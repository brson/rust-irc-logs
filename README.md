Archive of Rust IRC logs.

There is currently one directory here:

- [logbot] - from November 2017 until March 2020, [logbot.info] logged many Rust channels.

[logbot]: ./logbot
[logbot.info]: https://logbot.info

From April 2013 until 2018 #rust and #rust-internals were logged by [botbot.me].
I am still trying to obtain an archive of these logs.

[botbot.me]: https://botbot.me

If you have Rust IRC logs I am missing,
particularly prior to April 2013,
please contact me.
