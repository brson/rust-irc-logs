Archive of Rust IRC logs.

There are two directories here:

- [logbot] - from November 2017 until March 2020, [logbot.info] logged many Rust channels.
  Obtained from the logbot.info [archive page].
- [emberian] - personal logs from emberian of public Rust channels from 2013-2015,
  in ZNC format.

[logbot]: ./logbot
[emberian]: ./emberian
[logbot.info]: https://logbot.info
[archive page]: https://archive.logbot.info/

From April 2013 until 2018 #rust and #rust-internals were logged by [botbot.me].
I am still trying to obtain an archive of these logs.

[botbot.me]: https://botbot.me

If you have Rust IRC logs I am missing,
particularly prior to April 2013,
please contact me.
