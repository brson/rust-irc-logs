2018-03-09T17:11:58 #rust-release <pambihira> thank you for posting Logs
2018-03-14T14:12:59 #rust-release <steveklabnik> soooooooooooooooooooooo
2018-03-14T14:13:05 #rust-release <steveklabnik> there's something weird going on with cargo's docs
2018-03-14T14:13:15 #rust-release <steveklabnik> https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/4496/files#diff-0d7e52796da168d3e2f6b7a8100eb8db
2018-03-14T14:13:25 #rust-release <steveklabnik> matklad noticed that ^ isn't in stable rust
2018-03-14T14:13:28 #rust-release <steveklabnik> but if i rustup doc
2018-03-14T14:13:33 #rust-release <steveklabnik> or look at /1.24.1
2018-03-14T14:13:36 #rust-release <steveklabnik> they *are* there
2018-03-14T14:13:42 #rust-release <steveklabnik> it's the bare, / that doesn't show
2018-03-14T14:14:23 #rust-release <steveklabnik> so
2018-03-14T14:14:29 #rust-release <steveklabnik> i'm guessing we didn't remove the old redirect?
2018-03-14T14:14:33 #rust-release <steveklabnik> and so nobody noticed
2018-03-14T14:14:34 #rust-release <steveklabnik> heh
2018-03-14T14:15:00 #rust-release <steveklabnik> or something
2018-03-14T14:15:01 #rust-release <steveklabnik> any ideas?
2018-03-14T14:16:36 #rust-release <matklad> steveklabnik: are you sure that they are there for 1.24.1?
2018-03-14T14:16:43 #rust-release <matklad> Does not seem to be the case for me///
2018-03-14T14:16:46 #rust-release <misdreavus> ^
2018-03-14T14:16:49 #rust-release <misdreavus> yeah, i don't see it either
2018-03-14T14:16:50 #rust-release <steveklabnik> i thought they were
2018-03-14T14:17:07 #rust-release <steveklabnik> oh oh
2018-03-14T14:17:10 #rust-release <steveklabnik> no, you're correct
2018-03-14T14:17:17 #rust-release <steveklabnik> i mis-read :/
2018-03-14T14:17:24 #rust-release <misdreavus> /beta/ and /nightly/ have it but not /stable/ or any numbered version
2018-03-14T14:17:41 #rust-release <misdreavus> despite the commit being in stable
2018-03-14T17:47:14 #rust-release <simulacrum> steveklabnik: Probably a infra-related discussion at this point, with acrichto I guess being the point of contact? Not sure if anyone else would have access
2018-03-14T17:48:12 #rust-release <steveklabnik> yeah, i guess it isn't actually a release issue
2018-03-14T17:48:16 #rust-release <steveklabnik> probably?
2018-03-14T17:49:06 #rust-release <simulacrum> well, I imagine we need to figure out what went wrong and then fix that maybe during the release
2018-03-14T18:56:26 #rust-release <matklad> Is the cargo documention problem tracked anywhere, except for the IRC?
2018-03-14T18:56:47 #rust-release <matklad> If not, I'll create an issue on the Cargo repository to not lose track of it
2018-03-14T19:05:29 #rust-release <matklad> wait-wait-wait
2018-03-14T19:05:48 #rust-release <matklad> I've just seen https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/commit/999cba158826e488dc6b9e56588a74fc94560dbc
2018-03-14T19:07:20 #rust-release <matklad> Soooo, looks like the content was genuinely lost until Jan 8,  and that hasn't reached the stable yet
2018-03-14T19:20:05 #rust-release <misdreavus> oh wow
2018-03-19T19:46:57 #rust-release <aturon> simulacrum: hm, looks like the PR tracking spreadsheet isn't getting updated
2018-03-19T19:47:00 #rust-release <aturon> last update was march 2
2018-03-19T20:45:34 #rust-release <simulacrum> aturon: we have the html version now so we don't update the spreadsheet
2018-03-19T20:45:41 #rust-release <simulacrum> https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rustc-pr-tracking/
2018-03-19T20:45:45 #rust-release <aturon> simulacrum: whoa
2018-03-19T20:45:50 #rust-release <aturon> zomg
2018-03-19T20:45:54 #rust-release <aturon> when did this happen!?
2018-03-19T20:46:07 #rust-release <simulacrum> pietroalbini put it together a week or so back?
2018-03-19T20:46:09 #rust-release <simulacrum> Maybe 2?
2018-03-19T20:46:16 #rust-release <simulacrum> it auto-updates daily via travis cron job
2018-03-19T20:46:17 #rust-release <aturon> that is amazing
2018-03-19T20:46:26 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, I think it was a month ago
2018-03-19T20:46:46 #rust-release <simulacrum> might've been
2018-03-19T20:46:50 #rust-release <simulacrum> my time sense is bad
2018-03-19T20:47:37 #rust-release <pietroalbini> aturon, thanks :)
2018-03-21T01:27:26 #rust-release <jkordish> just added PR#49219 to the crater spreadsheet
2018-03-22T15:44:30 #rust-release <nmatsakis> simulacrum: ping
2018-03-23T22:31:37 #rust-release <steveklabnik> i know we've got a full plate for bors for this one
2018-03-23T22:31:38 #rust-release <steveklabnik> but https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/49318
2018-03-23T22:31:43 #rust-release <steveklabnik> sent this in at the usual time :)
2018-03-25T16:20:35 #rust-release <centril> steveklabnik: hmm; https://travis-ci.org/rust-lang/rust-www/builds/356152471 seems like rust-www had a deployment error 5 days ago
2018-03-25T16:49:36 #rust-release <steveklabnik> centril: huh
2018-03-25T16:49:48 #rust-release <steveklabnik> /home/travis/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.2.7/gems/dpl-s3-1.9.4/lib/dpl/provider/s3.rb:108:in `rescue in deploy': uninitialized constant Aws::S3::Errors (NameError)
2018-03-25T16:49:53 #rust-release <steveklabnik> looks like maybe we need to bundle update?
2018-03-25T16:50:38 #rust-release <centril> You know better since I'm not familiar with Ruby :) 
2018-03-25T16:50:54 #rust-release <steveklabnik> i will takea  look tomorrow
2018-03-25T16:51:52 #rust-release <centril> Thanks 
2018-03-26T10:08:55 #rust-release <simulacrum> steveklabnik: We've seen that error before on Rust CI mostly just need to restart IIRC
2018-03-26T10:10:38 #rust-release <aidanhs> hello all - if you ever edit the infra google docs, please put an email that will let you access google drive on https://docs.google.com/document/d/170KKci_ouB1gGlUKmHfHTCoccSf-m24ZElCQnfbebS0/edit?usp=sharing
2018-03-26T10:10:51 #rust-release <aidanhs> (I've begun restricting the permissions)
2018-03-26T11:29:14 #rust-release <pietroalbini> aidanhs, I can't add a PR in the crater spreadsheet, is it read only now?
2018-03-26T11:29:29 #rust-release <pietroalbini> (the PR is https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/47291 by the way)
2018-03-26T12:20:29 #rust-release <steveklabnik> simulacrum: gotcha
2018-03-26T14:25:23 #rust-release <Aaronepower> simulacrum: If a issue has a WG tag attached does it still need a T tag?
2018-03-26T14:31:49 #rust-release <pietroalbini> ok, both https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/49326 and https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/47291 needs to be added to the crater spreadsheet
2018-03-26T14:32:08 #rust-release <pietroalbini> and without logging into google I don't have permissions to do that (cc aidanhs simulacrum)
2018-03-26T15:25:28 #rust-release <simulacrum> Aaronepower: ideally, but it's not critical (we're slowly moving to a more-WG centric model anyway)
2018-03-26T15:26:02 #rust-release <simulacrum> pietroalbini: I'll add them as a line but not populate yet, I think aidanhs might have wanted to limit to authenticated only editing....
2018-03-28T23:42:25 #rust-release <batmanaod> I'm removing my nickname from the sign-up sheet. The last few weeks I've unfortunately been too busy to attend my duties, so I think for now it's better I just drop in to do PR triage, etc when I have time rather than making promises I'm not keeping.
2018-03-29T00:49:10 #rust-release <jkordish> yea, past few weeks have been killer for me. difficult at times.  been working 12hr days :(
2018-04-04T19:09:54 #rust-release <batmanaod> It looks like I don't have permission to edit the Crater GDoc. I know I've previously edited it; was this permission revoked?
2018-04-04T19:11:44 #rust-release <batmanaod> (I know I've fallen behind on PR and other triage, but I figured I could handle the occasional @rust-release request to set up a Crater run, or at least get a "pending" entry set up in the document)
2018-04-04T19:28:42 #rust-release <kennytm> batmanaod: yeah we messed up the gdocs permissions last week, sorry. just request for edit permission. you may ask tomprince over #rust-infra
2018-04-04T20:13:01 #rust-release <batmanaod> @kennytm Thanks! No problem.
2018-04-05T19:46:48 #rust-release <steveklabnik> whats the process for nominating a beta backport these days?
2018-04-05T19:48:56 #rust-release <steveklabnik> i've got a tiny but important rustdoc pr
2018-04-05T19:49:04 #rust-release <steveklabnik> https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/48831
2018-04-05T19:51:48 #rust-release <misdreavus> https://forge.rust-lang.org/beta-backporting.html
2018-04-05T19:52:16 #rust-release <steveklabnik> ah ha!
2018-04-05T19:52:20 #rust-release <misdreavus> the last time i did it, it was like, apply beta-nominated and a team, get the team to agree to backport it, open the backport pr
2018-04-05T19:52:21 #rust-release <steveklabnik> of course There's Docs For That
2018-04-05T19:52:32 #rust-release <misdreavus> lol
2018-04-10T14:44:16 #rust-release <Aaronepower> simulacrum: What category do performance regressions fall under? I've been marking them as enhancement and I wanted clarification.
2018-04-10T15:08:49 #rust-release <pietroalbini> Aaronepower, I-slow?
2018-04-10T15:09:09 #rust-release <centril> pietroalbini: sounds right
2018-04-10T15:09:30 #rust-release <centril> (I added descriptions to all labels a while back..)
2018-04-10T15:10:13 #rust-release <Aaronepower> pietroalbini: Sure, but I is a nomination not a category right?
2018-04-10T15:10:35 #rust-release <centril> Aaronepower: I-nominated are for nominations
2018-04-10T15:10:46 #rust-release <pietroalbini> Aaronepower, "Note that as of now, I-slow, and I-compile{time,mem} are not considered bugs, rather, they are enhancements, since they do not break user code." https://forge.rust-lang.org/pr-triage-procedure.html
2018-04-10T15:11:29 #rust-release <Aaronepower> Okay, so I've being doing it correctly.
2018-04-10T15:11:35 #rust-release <Aaronepower> Thanks
2018-04-10T15:11:45 #rust-release <centril> yup
2018-04-10T18:08:15 #rust-release <aidanhs> just a reminder for release team members - if you need access to the infra google drive (crater run queue etc) please either add yourself to https://docs.google.com/document/d/170KKci_ouB1gGlUKmHfHTCoccSf-m24ZElCQnfbebS0/edit or message me directly
2018-04-10T18:10:40 #rust-release <pietroalbini> aidanhs, added
2018-04-10T18:17:03 #rust-release <jkordish> @aidanhs, added
2018-04-13T02:55:26 #rust-release <simulacrum> pietroalbini: (and others): latest beta run is done http://cargobomb-reports.s3.amazonaws.com/beta-1.26.0-beta.2/index.html 
2018-04-13T05:12:12 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum: i'll triage some of it in a few hours
2018-04-13T11:09:01 #rust-release <pietroalbini> grouped all the regressed crates by regression, will post the issues by tomorrow
2018-04-13T13:26:43 #rust-release <simulacrum> pietroalbini: Thanks!
2018-04-13T14:24:42 #rust-release <pietroalbini> lol there are so many mentions in this issue that github stopped rendering them
2018-04-13T14:24:42 #rust-release <pietroalbini> https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/49935
2018-04-13T14:25:17 #rust-release <est31> github has a limit of 50 iirc
2018-04-13T14:25:47 #rust-release <est31> but the algorithm changed
2018-04-13T14:26:08 #rust-release <est31> older occurences had the last few mentions non rendered
2018-04-13T14:27:18 #rust-release <misdreavus> ick, i just saw that one
2018-04-13T15:54:50 #rust-release <pietroalbini> ...and I finished \o/
2018-04-13T15:55:20 #rust-release <pietroalbini> fyi, the horrible script I used to generate those 54 mentions: https://gist.github.com/pietroalbini/b52561fc9a5f8469b907d8e95e8d34de
2018-04-13T16:11:24 #rust-release <est31> pietroalbini: you are still smarter than me who did it all manually :)
2018-04-13T16:11:50 #rust-release <pietroalbini> est31, well, I also started doing that manually
2018-04-13T16:12:04 #rust-release <pietroalbini> but then I saw those 54 regressions :P
2018-04-13T16:12:31 #rust-release <est31> https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+author%3Aest31+is%3Aclosed+regression
2018-04-17T09:16:32 #rust-release <pietroalbini> can the others from the release team help triaging issues a bit? :)
2018-04-17T09:17:06 #rust-release <pietroalbini> already found an untriaged issue reporting a beta regression, and I can't do 50+ issue triages myself ;)
2018-04-17T09:28:25 #rust-release <araz> Will do triage tomorrow, but I am a little bit busy today :(
2018-04-17T13:45:19 #rust-release <jkordish> did a few. will attempt to do more after work
2018-04-17T13:58:48 #rust-release <pietroalbini> thanks!
2018-04-17T14:16:22 #rust-release <steveklabnik> win 18
2018-04-23T18:11:25 #rust-release <Aaronepower> simulacrum: Hey, what should be done about issues that may have been bugs but the original poster has gone silent? I'm looking at an issue here from January and it last left off with questions for the person. https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/47405
2018-04-23T19:55:09 #rust-release <simulacrum> Aaronepower: If there's not sufficient information to reproduce in your opinion then we can probably close, stating that
2018-04-23T19:55:33 #rust-release <simulacrum> Otherwise leave it
2018-04-23T19:57:05 #rust-release <Aaronepower> simulacrum: Thank you.
2018-04-23T19:58:22 #rust-release <Aaronepower> simulacrum: On closing should I say for the person to re-open the issue or file a new one?
2018-04-23T19:58:30 #rust-release <simulacrum> re-open
2018-04-23T19:58:36 #rust-release <Aaronepower> Okay, thanks.
2018-04-24T17:41:30 #rust-release <pietroalbini> by the way, I created a project on rust-lang/rust to keep track of the 1.26 regressions
2018-04-24T17:41:31 #rust-release <pietroalbini> https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/projects/4
2018-04-24T18:01:08 #rust-release <jkordish> thats pretty cool. didn't know you can do that.
2018-04-24T18:29:21 #rust-release <aturon> pietroalbini: omg that is awesome
2018-04-24T18:29:23 #rust-release <aturon> nmatsakis: ^
2018-04-24T18:54:09 #rust-release <pietroalbini> aturon, thanks!
2018-04-25T14:39:47 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, aidanhs can we get another crater beta run before 1.26?
2018-04-25T14:40:13 #rust-release <simulacrum> Is it critical? Usually beta backports aren't that significant
2018-04-25T14:40:34 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, we backported a lot of stuff though this release
2018-04-25T14:40:35 #rust-release <simulacrum> But I think it's possible to get it in, yeah, but it'll finish ~10 days before end
2018-04-25T14:43:16 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, looking at the spreadsheet the queue is empty, so we are not slowing down other things
2018-04-25T14:43:30 #rust-release <simulacrum> Yeah, I can start one later today
2018-04-25T14:44:00 #rust-release <pietroalbini> thanks!
2018-04-26T18:28:35 #rust-release <pietroalbini> aww, that's a good trend for S-waiting-on-review
2018-04-26T18:28:36 #rust-release <pietroalbini> https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rustc-pr-tracking/
2018-04-26T18:36:17 #rust-release <nmatsakis> I have a question about crater
2018-04-26T18:36:18 #rust-release <nmatsakis> http://cargobomb-reports.s3.amazonaws.com/pr-49799/index.html
2018-04-26T18:36:24 #rust-release <nmatsakis> how does one identify the "primary" failures here?
2018-04-26T18:36:44 #rust-release <nmatsakis> also, am I reading this right that 131 craters are affected in total? (I guess so)
2018-04-26T18:42:25 #rust-release <nmatsakis> better yet, answer me here: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/49799#issuecomment-384748791
2018-04-26T21:12:35 #rust-release <est31> wow thats sad that so many crates depend on that
2018-04-27T12:20:52 #rust-release <pietroalbini> small tool I wrote yesterday :) https://github.com/pietroalbini/crater-tree
2018-04-27T15:32:37 #rust-release <aturon> pietroalbini: you rock!
2018-04-27T15:51:05 #rust-release <nmatsakis> pietroalbini: neat
2018-04-27T15:51:20 #rust-release <pietroalbini> thanks!
2018-05-01T12:12:20 #rust-release <simulacrum> pietroalbini: Beta crater run done: http://cargobomb-reports.s3.amazonaws.com/1.26.0-beta-11/index.html
2018-05-01T12:12:40 #rust-release <simulacrum> I'll probably try and take a look at triaging it later today, but feel free to start :)
2018-05-01T15:26:28 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, thanks! I'll take a look
2018-05-01T15:53:44 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, did a quick scan of the full report, I'm looking at 6 crates in more details now
2018-05-01T15:56:31 #rust-release <pietroalbini> ...and some more crates in the blacklist: https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/crater/pull/219 (aidanhs a merge would be great!)
2018-05-01T16:09:20 #rust-release <pietroalbini> reopened https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/49932: not all of the regressions were fixed :(
2018-05-01T16:12:00 #rust-release <pietroalbini> bisecting it
2018-05-01T16:12:24 #rust-release <aidanhs> pietroalbini: btw, please do ping me if you push commits that address comments in the bot controlled crater
2018-05-01T16:13:10 #rust-release <pietroalbini> aidanhs, the comments were addressed, sorry for not pinging you!
2018-05-01T16:14:58 #rust-release <pietroalbini> (this week I didn't work too much on crater, I mostly spent time working through my backlog for another floss project ;) )
2018-05-01T16:21:23 #rust-release <aidanhs> pietroalbini: not a problem - I just don't want to leave you hanging too much just because I don't know about it! (I do it too much just from being crazy busy)
2018-05-01T16:24:39 #rust-release <nmatsakis> can I get some feedback on the question of `@bors rollup` --
2018-05-01T16:24:45 #rust-release <nmatsakis> also, is this the right channel
2018-05-01T16:24:50 #rust-release <nmatsakis> in particular, when should I use it?
2018-05-01T16:24:57 #rust-release <nmatsakis> my metric: low risk PR
2018-05-01T16:25:05 #rust-release <nmatsakis> I'm not sure if I should also consider the "importance"?
2018-05-01T16:26:08 #rust-release <pietroalbini> I remember seeing a discussion/policy somewhere, just can't remember where :P
2018-05-01T16:26:18 #rust-release <pietroalbini> kennytm, ?
2018-05-01T16:29:13 #rust-release <nmatsakis> also, when requesting a check-only crater run,
2018-05-01T16:29:14 #rust-release <nmatsakis> who should I cc?
2018-05-01T16:29:18 #rust-release <nmatsakis> I don't know why I can't seem to remember this
2018-05-01T16:30:07 #rust-release <pietroalbini> nmatsakis, for crater runs it's best to ping the infra team, none of the release team members (except simulacrum, which is also on infra) has access to the crater machines
2018-05-01T16:30:26 #rust-release <pietroalbini> let's hope bot-controlled is merged soon :D
2018-05-01T16:30:39 #rust-release <pietroalbini> aidanhs, by the way, what about that run-graph run?
2018-05-01T16:31:11 #rust-release <kennytm> pietroalbini: this one? https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/putting-bors-on-a-pip/7081
2018-05-01T16:31:34 #rust-release <pietroalbini> kennytm, yeah, that one, thanks
2018-05-01T16:34:51 #rust-release <pietroalbini> nmatsakis, can you take a look at this? https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/49932 :)
2018-05-01T16:36:42 #rust-release <nmatsakis> pietroalbini: yep
2018-05-01T16:39:16 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, ok, triaged everything, there is only that issue we thought was fixed
2018-05-01T16:46:57 #rust-release <nmatsakis> pietroalbini: so there is now only *one* error in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/49932 that still reproduces ?
2018-05-01T16:47:35 #rust-release <nmatsakis> however, I agree with Leo that this was intended, for better or worse
2018-05-01T16:54:42 #rust-release <pietroalbini> nmatsakis: yeah, technically there are two, but bismuth is failing because plexus is failing
2018-05-01T20:34:01 #rust-release <kennytm> huh o_O https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/labels/S-waiting-on-bikeshed
2018-05-01T20:40:58 #rust-release <pietroalbini> woops :D
2018-05-01T20:49:41 #rust-release <pietroalbini> kennytm, how did you find that repro in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/50371 :/
2018-05-01T20:49:47 #rust-release <pietroalbini> (bisecting it)
2018-05-01T20:50:29 #rust-release <kennytm> pietroalbini: the last log entry before the ICE is "INFO 2018-05-01T16:07:59Z: rustc_trans::base: trans_instance(std::ptr::write_volatile::<std::option::Option<usize>>)"
2018-05-01T20:50:55 #rust-release <pietroalbini> kennytm, nice catch!
2018-05-01T20:51:07 #rust-release <kennytm> :)
2018-05-04T08:13:43 #rust-release <pietroalbini> hmm, who should be assigned on https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/50420 ?
2018-05-05T00:38:07 #rust-release <simulacrum> steveklabnik: Going to do book updates
2018-05-05T00:54:03 #rust-release <simulacrum> and I just realized there's already a PR which does this in queue
2018-05-05T00:54:11 #rust-release <simulacrum> that somehow.. did not come up when I searched for book
2018-05-05T07:26:39 #rust-release <pietroalbini> hm, can we get https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/50419 into beta?
2018-05-05T07:26:46 #rust-release <pietroalbini> that's a bad ICE on a new feature
2018-05-05T13:15:22 #rust-release <simulacrum> pietroalbini: If it backports cleanly probably, otherwise unlikely -- beta is going to be promoted monday
2018-05-06T09:48:53 #rust-release <pietroalbini> ugh, we also have another beta regression :/
2018-05-06T09:48:53 #rust-release <pietroalbini> https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/50471
2018-05-06T09:49:20 #rust-release <pietroalbini> a pr is in progress https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/50474
2018-05-06T09:49:22 #rust-release <pietroalbini> cc simulacrum 
2018-05-06T09:49:48 #rust-release <pietroalbini> (did my pr to backport the impl trait rustdoc ice https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/50478)
2018-05-07T10:40:11 #rust-release <Aaronepower> simulacrum: When I make changes to a PR based on review should I remove S-waiting-on-author and add S-waiting-on-review myself or let someone else do it?
2018-05-07T11:01:34 #rust-release <pietroalbini> Aaronepower, please do, that's less work when doing PR triage :)
2018-05-07T17:17:08 #rust-release <steveklabnik> simulacrum: heh, weird
2018-05-07T17:17:20 #rust-release <steveklabnik> simulacrum: i saw the RBE stuff, did that get settled? or should i be sending in another PR?
2018-05-07T17:23:11 #rust-release <steveklabnik> looks like it was updated
2018-05-07T17:23:13 #rust-release <steveklabnik> great :)
2018-05-07T20:47:57 #rust-release <steveklabnik> https://github.com/rust-lang/blog.rust-lang.org/pull/245
2018-05-10T16:30:33 #rust-release <steveklabnik> acrichto: so. on the train. internet is... okay
2018-05-10T16:31:05 #rust-release <steveklabnik> i'm actually arriving at 1:30, not 1. so, if everything is ready.... might as well get going sooner rather than lateR?
2018-05-10T16:33:31 #rust-release <acrichto> steveklabnik: sure thing!
2018-05-10T16:33:40 #rust-release <acrichto> steveklabnik: I just pushed a few updates to the cargo section of the blog post
2018-05-10T16:33:43 #rust-release <acrichto> I'll kick things off now 
2018-05-10T16:33:49 #rust-release <steveklabnik> ah
2018-05-10T16:33:51 #rust-release <steveklabnik> cool :)

2018-05-10T17:06:36 #rust-release <acrichto> this next step really needs to be optimized
2018-05-10T17:06:46 #rust-release <acrichto> this "generate index.html for the entire s3 bucket" is crazy
2018-05-10T17:08:10 #rust-release <steveklabnik> heh

2018-05-10T17:26:12 #rust-release <misdreavus> (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧
2018-05-10T19:41:20 #rust-release <pietroalbini> nmatsakis, about https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/49799, do you mean something like https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/49935?
2018-05-10T19:41:54 #rust-release <nmatsakis> pietroalbini: I do
2018-05-10T19:42:09 #rust-release <pietroalbini> nmatsakis, well, I have the script in my homedir :P
2018-05-10T19:42:14 #rust-release <nmatsakis> I thought you might :)
2018-05-10T19:45:00 #rust-release <pietroalbini> nmatsakis, https://gist.github.com/pietroalbini/57155492c8fcb07972ca485a7b22a6e2
2018-05-10T19:45:18 #rust-release <pietroalbini> you can easily adapt it to change the message
2018-05-10T19:45:49 #rust-release <nmatsakis> pietroalbini: <3
2018-05-10T19:45:51 #rust-release <nmatsakis> you rock
2018-05-10T19:45:56 #rust-release <nmatsakis> I'll give it a try shortly
2018-05-10T19:46:02 #rust-release <pietroalbini> nmatsakis, I *had* to do that :P
2018-05-10T19:46:12 #rust-release <pietroalbini> no way I would write that message for 54 identical regressions
2018-05-10T19:48:01 #rust-release <pietroalbini> nmatsakis, for the script, you need to pipe the crates names in the stdin and provide the experiment name as first argument
2018-05-10T20:31:51 #rust-release <simulacrum> Crater run for just-released beta started
2018-05-10T20:31:59 #rust-release <pietroalbini> \o/
2018-05-10T23:49:21 #rust-release <nmatsakis> simulacrum: are you able to do a perf run for https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/50593 ?
2018-05-11T01:45:48 #rust-release <simulacrum> nmatsakis: Should be, I've queued one for that try build, if you want a later commit just re-try
2018-05-17T01:48:45 #rust-release <simulacrum> Beta crater run done https://cargobomb-reports.s3.amazonaws.com/beta-1.27-1/index.html, pietroalbini -- are you able to triage? If not I can do it soon-ish, just let me know
2018-05-17T10:43:57 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, I'll triage it today
2018-05-17T10:50:16 #rust-release <pietroalbini> wow, only 21 regressed crates
2018-05-17T12:34:17 #rust-release <pietroalbini> wtf, there is a crate implementing quicksort that spuriously fails to sort
2018-05-17T12:34:28 #rust-release <pietroalbini> :facepalm:
2018-05-17T13:04:49 #rust-release <kennytm> lolwut
2018-05-17T13:12:39 #rust-release <pietroalbini> kennytm, https://cargobomb-reports.s3.amazonaws.com/beta-1.27-1/beta-2018-05-10/reg/median_three_quicksort-0.0.1/log.txt
2018-05-17T13:14:08 #rust-release <kennytm> aha. looks like a homework exercise
2018-05-17T13:14:26 #rust-release <pietroalbini> yeah, it doesn't have any dependent crate
2018-05-17T13:15:16 #rust-release <kennytm> it can only be `skip_test`'ed, there is no repository associated to the package
2018-05-17T13:16:01 #rust-release <kennytm> no wait, looks like https://github.com/AlexHagerman/MedianThreeQuicksort is the source
2018-05-17T13:16:34 #rust-release <pietroalbini> kennytm, yep, added it as skip-test in the blacklist update pr
2018-05-17T13:17:20 #rust-release <kennytm> speaking of which, is the file https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/crater/blob/master/blacklist.md now useless?
2018-05-17T13:18:07 #rust-release <pietroalbini> kennytm, yep
2018-05-17T13:19:01 #rust-release <kennytm> perhaps it could be deleted after importing the content :)
2018-05-17T13:19:39 #rust-release <pietroalbini> yeah, there is a list of maintenance things I'd like to do on the crater repo
2018-05-17T13:19:58 #rust-release <pietroalbini> but I'm already overloading aidanhs with PRs :P
2018-05-17T13:20:46 #rust-release <aidanhs> I think I'll get a chance to do another pass of everything this weekend
2018-05-17T13:21:01 #rust-release <kennytm> pietroalbini:  ah ok :p
2018-05-17T13:45:13 #rust-release <pietroalbini> is there a trophy if a crate regressed for two releases in a row? :P
2018-05-17T13:45:17 #rust-release <pietroalbini> https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/50834
2018-05-17T13:59:57 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, finished the beta run triage \o/
2018-05-17T14:58:07 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, about 1.26.1, what's the process to decide what to do?
2018-05-17T14:59:03 #rust-release <simulacrum> Core team will meet today and hopefully come to a decision, probably yes, and then we'll want to make a PR that bumps stable with the relevant patche
2018-05-17T14:59:07 #rust-release <simulacrum> patches*
2018-05-17T15:03:16 #rust-release <pietroalbini> ok
2018-05-21T17:07:21 #rust-release <Aaronepower> Does A-lint apply to error messages?
2018-05-21T17:08:42 #rust-release <kennytm> A-diagnostic ?
2018-05-21T17:09:15 #rust-release <Aaronepower> kennytm: Yes that covers it but the forge says "Try to pick just one tag to give, unless you’re giving the A-diagnostics tag, in which case one more tag is a good idea."
2018-05-21T17:12:14 #rust-release <kennytm> if no other tags can be correctly associated with the issue i'd add A-diagnostic alone
2018-05-26T21:18:05 #rust-release <pietroalbini> posting pre-release testing on reddit is not a bad idea after all...
2018-05-26T21:19:46 #rust-release <est31> pietroalbini: how so?
2018-05-26T21:20:10 #rust-release <pietroalbini> est31, well, turns out the fix for tier 2 platforms might not work all the times
2018-05-26T21:20:14 #rust-release <pietroalbini> https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/51097
2018-05-26T21:20:59 #rust-release <est31> okay
2018-05-27T20:09:15 #rust-release <kennytm> have we prepared the 1.27.0 release notes?
2018-05-27T21:14:24 #rust-release <simulacrum> kennytm: Not to my knowledge
2018-05-27T22:27:41 #rust-release <pietroalbini> uh, wasn't aaronepower the one writing them usually?
2018-05-27T22:41:43 #rust-release <simulacrum> yeah, not sure -- they appear to not be currently on IRC
2018-05-27T23:05:57 #rust-release <pietroalbini> I can try writing them up tomorrow if I'm not too busy
2018-05-27T23:15:14 #rust-release <simulacrum> sounds good
2018-05-28T15:01:28 #rust-release <pietroalbini> Aaronepower, are you working on the release notes?
2018-05-28T15:02:30 #rust-release <Aaronepower> pietroalbini: I am, but I'm also at Rustfest and have been doing a lot of CLI-WG work, there should be a PR by Friday.
2018-05-28T15:02:52 #rust-release <pietroalbini> Aaronepower, ok! thank you!
2018-05-30T22:19:00 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, hmm, which timezone is the doodle in?
2018-05-30T22:23:56 #rust-release <simulacrum> I think it intended to be in the "host" timezone? Like, all of us see the local timezone and then it syncs up properly
2018-05-30T22:24:08 #rust-release <pietroalbini> uh, nice
2018-05-30T22:24:17 #rust-release <simulacrum> but maybe I've misconfigured it
2018-05-30T22:24:31 #rust-release <simulacrum> What time does it start for you?
2018-05-30T22:24:44 #rust-release <simulacrum> that is, what is the first slot?
2018-05-30T22:57:20 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, the first slot is 6am
2018-05-30T22:57:39 #rust-release <simulacrum> hm, so maybe I messed up
2018-05-30T23:00:58 #rust-release <simulacrum> pietroalbini: Yeah, I think I did the wrong thing
2018-05-30T23:01:03 #rust-release <simulacrum> Let me send out another one
2018-05-30T23:01:15 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, thanks!
2018-05-30T23:02:04 #rust-release <simulacrum> pietroalbini: Can you look at https://doodle.com/poll/5nap6smraxyvdhnt and see if that looks better?
2018-05-30T23:02:10 #rust-release <simulacrum> That is, doesn't start at 6am?
2018-05-30T23:03:04 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, yeah, the last option is at 4am
2018-05-30T23:03:20 #rust-release <simulacrum> okay, great, thanks!
2018-05-30T23:03:31 #rust-release <pietroalbini> but you probably did something wrong with 8:00
2018-05-30T23:03:58 #rust-release <pietroalbini> or whatever it is in your time zone :P
2018-05-30T23:04:09 #rust-release <pietroalbini> it appears as am instead of pm to me
2018-05-30T23:05:17 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, ^
2018-05-30T23:05:54 #rust-release <simulacrum> er, yeah, there's a slot that's middle of the night in my timezone with nothing around it
2018-05-30T23:06:12 #rust-release <simulacrum> I'm not actually sure why it's there; I don't recall selecting it
2018-05-30T23:06:20 #rust-release <simulacrum> But ... I don't think it's worth changing
2018-05-30T23:06:58 #rust-release <pietroalbini> *shrugs*
2018-05-31T02:39:58 #rust-release <jkordish> i just picked whatever most people were able to do. i can usually make anything work and can move things around if need be on my end :)
2018-06-05T16:02:06 #rust-release <simulacrum> aturon: ping for release kickoff
2018-06-05T16:24:27 #rust-release <aturon> simulacrum: kicked off
2018-06-05T16:24:50 #rust-release <simulacrum> steveklabnik: around?
2018-06-05T16:25:25 #rust-release <simulacrum> aturon: Can you tag 1.26.2 in rust-lang/rust? (for thanks)
2018-06-05T16:25:39 #rust-release <aturon> will do
2018-06-05T16:31:04 #rust-release <aturon> simulacrum: tagged
2018-06-05T16:31:29 #rust-release <simulacrum> okay -- I think only steveklabnik can run thanks so we'll wait on that (not really important anyway)
2018-06-05T17:11:04 #rust-release <aturon> simulacrum: i believe we're fully up
2018-06-05T17:11:10 #rust-release <simulacrum> yep, merging blog
2018-06-05T17:11:45 #rust-release <aturon> > stable-x86_64-apple-darwin updated - rustc 1.26.2 (594fb253c 2018-06-01)
2018-06-05T17:13:59 #rust-release <simulacrum> https://blog.rust-lang.org/2018/06/05/Rust-1.26.2.html
2018-06-05T17:14:17 #rust-release <aturon> simulacrum: high five!
2018-06-05T17:14:47 #rust-release <simulacrum> Technically this is where we should "tweet and post everything"
2018-06-05T17:19:45 #rust-release <steveklabnik> simulacrum: hi
2018-06-05T17:19:49 #rust-release <steveklabnik> i can do thanks :)
2018-06-05T17:20:20 #rust-release <simulacrum> thanks! :)
2018-06-05T17:22:16 #rust-release <steveklabnik> i started some work to hopefully make it so that it won't be tied to just me
2018-06-05T17:22:21 #rust-release <steveklabnik> not done yet though, too many releases too fast :p
2018-06-05T17:27:25 #rust-release <steveklabnik> https://thanks.rust-lang.org/rust/1.26.2
2018-06-05T17:33:57 #rust-release <pambihira> that's a quick fix. Gratz

2018-06-06T19:04:01 #rust-release <simulacrum> Welcome everyone to our first meeting :)
2018-06-06T19:04:05 #rust-release <batmanaod-M> I'm here. What is "o/"?
2018-06-06T19:04:21 #rust-release <simulacrum> Just stating presence, equivalent to "hello"
2018-06-06T19:04:30 #rust-release <simulacrum> Let's start with PR triage
2018-06-06T19:04:33 #rust-release <stokhos> hi
2018-06-06T19:04:35 #rust-release <jistone> (a head and a raised hand)
2018-06-06T19:04:37 #rust-release <stokhos> guys
2018-06-06T19:05:03 #rust-release <simulacrum> Any feedback we should take note of? Process changes?
2018-06-06T19:05:14 #rust-release <simulacrum> pietroalbini: I think you might have some thoughts here
2018-06-06T19:05:17 #rust-release <pietroalbini> yeah
2018-06-06T19:05:26 #rust-release <jistone> do you have that meeting agenda link?
2018-06-06T19:05:33 #rust-release <pietroalbini> https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Release-Team-Meeting-Agenda-gb8LJ6VkQxH9HKl1r9KFE
2018-06-06T19:05:34 #rust-release <simulacrum> https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Release-Team-Meeting-Agenda-gb8LJ6VkQxH9HKl1r9KFE
2018-06-06T19:05:57 #rust-release <pietroalbini> one of the things that would be really nice for triage is a spreadsheet for vacations
2018-06-06T19:06:25 #rust-release <pietroalbini> because it happens that I ping a person something like ten times and then someone points out on irc they're away
2018-06-06T19:06:45 #rust-release <simulacrum> makes sense -- I'll take that on
2018-06-06T19:07:46 #rust-release <simulacrum> Do we feel that PR triage has a sufficient number of people involved? That is, does anyone involved feel overloaded?
2018-06-06T19:08:10 #rust-release <batmanaod-M> Who would be included in the spreadsheet? Rust team members? Anyone with an open PR?
2018-06-06T19:08:25 #rust-release <simulacrum> batmanaod-M: I think reviewers -- so rust team members
2018-06-06T19:08:31 #rust-release <simulacrum> effectively all@rust-lang
2018-06-06T19:08:31 #rust-release <pietroalbini> yep
2018-06-06T19:09:06 #rust-release <batmanaod-M> Oh, that makes sense. So we'd continue to manually ping non-member PR authors when necessary.
2018-06-06T19:09:14 #rust-release <simulacrum> Yes
2018-06-06T19:09:16 #rust-release <batmanaod-M> ...and then eventually learn that they have been on vacation. :D
2018-06-06T19:09:46 #rust-release <pietroalbini> there are some days when nobody is doing triage, and then the person doing it the next day has more work to do
2018-06-06T19:10:22 #rust-release <simulacrum> That's theoretically true only of weekends
2018-06-06T19:10:46 #rust-release <jkordish> i haven't done any pr triaging as it seems a bit intimidating to me but i would love to help and figure it out.
2018-06-06T19:11:23 #rust-release <simulacrum> hm, so it looks like it might be good to maybe have more people per day on the PR triage rotation
2018-06-06T19:11:36 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, hmm, it would just be a mess in my opinion
2018-06-06T19:11:52 #rust-release <pietroalbini> at the moment, nobody is doing trigae on wed and thu
2018-06-06T19:12:00 #rust-release <araz> I haven't done much of it lately either, mostly because I have to dedicate more time to my studies at this point :/ I still want to help out from time to time though. 
2018-06-06T19:12:09 #rust-release <stokhos> I can help with issue triage on weekends
2018-06-06T19:12:13 #rust-release <simulacrum> araz: No problem :)
2018-06-06T19:12:48 #rust-release <stokhos> but the thing is i dont have much time when there are exams
2018-06-06T19:12:55 #rust-release <simulacrum> Do you have any ideas on how to balance the workload better?
2018-06-06T19:13:13 #rust-release <simulacrum> We can add people to weekends etc if you think that'll help...
2018-06-06T19:13:25 #rust-release <stokhos> sure
2018-06-06T19:13:29 #rust-release <pietroalbini> do the other people want to be pinged on weekends though? :P
2018-06-06T19:13:50 #rust-release <batmanaod-M> I un-assigned myself pretty early on as life got busier. It might be nice to have a way to communicate that some ad-hoc help is particularly needed on a given week(end).
2018-06-06T19:14:20 #rust-release <simulacrum> pietroalbini: Well, if not, they'll just see the pings on ~monday
2018-06-06T19:14:46 #rust-release <simulacrum> Presumably those people aren't watching IRC/GitHub notifications if they don't want pings or aren't working
2018-06-06T19:15:15 #rust-release <pietroalbini> yeah, but for reviewers after 3 days we ping them, and after 6 days we ping the whole team
2018-06-06T19:16:12 #rust-release <pietroalbini> now there are no pings on the weekend, but if we start also counting them we might ping the team before the reviewer had a chance to check the pr
2018-06-06T19:16:26 #rust-release <batmanaod-M> Agreed -- I don't think it's ever useful to "manage" notifications for other people by trying to put oneself in their shoes. Pings might be annoying, but there are plenty of ways to rate-limit such notifications on the receiving end.
2018-06-06T19:16:50 #rust-release <simulacrum> pietroalbini: I'm not sure that weekends are all that different though
2018-06-06T19:17:02 #rust-release <batmanaod-M> (I agree with simulacrum, that is, about "people aren't watching...notifications if they...aren't working"
2018-06-06T19:17:05 #rust-release <batmanaod-M> )
2018-06-06T19:17:22 #rust-release <pietroalbini> well, if we want to do that wonderful, less pings to do for me on monday :P
2018-06-06T19:17:51 #rust-release <simulacrum> pietroalbini: To clarify, do you think there's some potential solution here?
2018-06-06T19:18:40 #rust-release <pietroalbini> doing triage on wed and thu will reduce the load for shep and probably me
2018-06-06T19:19:39 #rust-release <pietroalbini> automating more things would be awesome though
2018-06-06T19:20:49 #rust-release <pietroalbini> some automation ideas that came out in the past weeks were automatically assigning -review when the author pushes a commit and -author when someone reviewsx
2018-06-06T19:21:22 #rust-release <simulacrum> I'll see if I can get kennytm to work on that :)
2018-06-06T19:21:50 #rust-release <pietroalbini> and possibly a bot that automatically removes S-blocked (like `@rust-highfive blocked #12345` that removes the label when the linked issue/pr is closed)
2018-06-06T19:22:36 #rust-release <simulacrum> Both sound relatively feasible
2018-06-06T19:23:01 #rust-release <simulacrum> Okay, let's move on to issue triage
2018-06-06T19:23:21 #rust-release <simulacrum> I think this has generally gone worse than PR triage -- probably due to a lack of organization
2018-06-06T19:24:25 #rust-release <stokhos> oh sorry, I thought we were talking about issue triage. what I meant was I can help with issue triage on weekends
2018-06-06T19:24:53 #rust-release <jkordish> think more people on that would be beneficial. there is always just so many.
2018-06-06T19:25:35 #rust-release <simulacrum> Does the process itself feel good? Do we need to expand/update documentation?
2018-06-06T19:26:43 #rust-release <stokhos> im ok with that 
2018-06-06T19:27:31 #rust-release <pietroalbini> (note: I mostly stopped doing issue triage because I prefer to use my time on other rust-lang activities)
2018-06-06T19:27:49 #rust-release <pietroalbini> in my opinion there should be two kinds of issue triage
2018-06-06T19:28:15 #rust-release <pietroalbini> applying labels is useful yes, but it's not vital to the rust project
2018-06-06T19:29:07 #rust-release <pietroalbini> but someone needs to read every issue and escalate if it's an important one like a beta regression
2018-06-06T19:29:31 #rust-release <jistone> I try to do a little of both (label and respond), but I've been irregular about it
2018-06-06T19:29:34 #rust-release <simulacrum> So splitting out a "regression hunting" group?
2018-06-06T19:29:35 #rust-release <pietroalbini> it happened multiple times that nobody noticed a regression for a few days/weeks
2018-06-06T19:30:38 #rust-release <batmanaod-M> Hm. Is there a label for non-regressions? Otherwise it might be hard for the regression-hunting team to avoid duplication of effort.
2018-06-06T19:31:09 #rust-release <pietroalbini> yeah, that's the problem with that
2018-06-06T19:31:10 #rust-release <simulacrum> pietroalbini: Do you know if we could make the GH project thing auto-add all new issues to a "to be triaged" pile?
2018-06-06T19:32:18 #rust-release <simulacrum> It looks like that's supported
2018-06-06T19:32:34 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, let me check
2018-06-06T19:33:36 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, I don't see an option to automatically add new issues to the project (the automation thing is only for issues already in the project)
2018-06-06T19:34:09 #rust-release <simulacrum> hm, I wonder if there's an API of some sort we could use
2018-06-06T19:34:12 #rust-release <pietroalbini> but if we want we can just instruct highfive to add every issue to that project
2018-06-06T19:34:49 #rust-release <pietroalbini> (my worry with this is that projects are noisy, every action you take is reported in the issue itself)
2018-06-06T19:35:05 #rust-release <simulacrum> I don't think there's email notifications sent for that though so it's not bad
2018-06-06T19:36:01 #rust-release <pietroalbini> maybe we could create a project "issue triage" with "not triaged" - "partial triage" - "full triage"?
2018-06-06T19:36:20 #rust-release <simulacrum> Representing the two types of triage?
2018-06-06T19:36:25 #rust-release <simulacrum> That could work, yeah
2018-06-06T19:37:14 #rust-release <pietroalbini> thinking about it, I'm a bit worried it will just be a maintenance burden though
2018-06-06T19:38:08 #rust-release <simulacrum> How so?
2018-06-06T19:38:28 #rust-release <pietroalbini> for example when another team member who doesn't know (or care) about the spreadsheet and applies labels
2018-06-06T19:39:22 #rust-release <pietroalbini> (even if we could also instruct highfive to move the issue to the "full triage" column as soon as a label/assignee is applied
2018-06-06T19:40:09 #rust-release <simulacrum> Once an issue is in full triage though it'll stay there ~forever
2018-06-06T19:40:17 #rust-release <pietroalbini> yep
2018-06-06T19:40:23 #rust-release <simulacrum> I think the new issue volume is low enough that this would be manageable
2018-06-06T19:40:39 #rust-release <pietroalbini> oh, we should not keep the issue in the full triage column, we should remove it from the project
2018-06-06T19:40:57 #rust-release <pietroalbini> because an issue can be assigned only to one project
2018-06-06T19:41:45 #rust-release <simulacrum> ah, okay
2018-06-06T19:41:58 #rust-release <simulacrum> Doesn't that conflict with the dedicated per-release regression projects then?
2018-06-06T19:42:06 #rust-release <pietroalbini> yep, that was my point
2018-06-06T19:42:30 #rust-release <simulacrum> Okay, so regression issues are tagged and removed from 'triage' project
2018-06-06T19:42:36 #rust-release <simulacrum> otherwise they can stay
2018-06-06T19:43:07 #rust-release <simulacrum> I think we have a reasonable picture of a good ~first step here so let's move on :)
2018-06-06T19:43:34 #rust-release <pietroalbini> maybe I'll think about this a bit more and we can decide in the next meeting?
2018-06-06T19:43:42 #rust-release <simulacrum> pietroalbini: Sounds good, yeah
2018-06-06T19:43:55 #rust-release <simulacrum> cuviper suggested making official release announcements on users.r-l.o, similar to how we make posts on reddit/HN/twitter/etc today
2018-06-06T19:44:00 #rust-release <simulacrum> I think this is trivial
2018-06-06T19:44:20 #rust-release <pietroalbini> yeah
2018-06-06T19:44:27 #rust-release <jistone> yep, just needs someone to do it :)
2018-06-06T19:45:17 #rust-release <simulacrum> Is anyone willing to take on adding this to https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rust-forge/blob/master/release-process.md#release-day-thursday?
2018-06-06T19:46:10 #rust-release <jistone> where do current social media announcements fall?  "Tweet and post everything!" ?
2018-06-06T19:46:46 #rust-release <simulacrum> yep, expanding that into a more complete section would be good
2018-06-06T19:47:23 #rust-release <jistone> ok, I can send a PR to expand that
2018-06-06T19:47:27 #rust-release <simulacrum> jistone: Great!
2018-06-06T19:47:48 #rust-release <pietroalbini> (btw, about issue triage, I wanted to talk a bit about the labels we apply)
2018-06-06T19:47:56 #rust-release <simulacrum> ah, yes
2018-06-06T19:48:05 #rust-release <simulacrum> Let's go ahead and do that
2018-06-06T19:48:07 #rust-release <jistone> (jistone == cuviper, btw.  I'm never sure who's aware of that)
2018-06-06T19:48:38 #rust-release <simulacrum> for reference current labels are documented here: https://forge.rust-lang.org/pr-triage-procedure.html#issue-triage
2018-06-06T19:48:39 #rust-release <pietroalbini> first thing, we should ask the teams about what labels are useful for them
2018-06-06T19:49:33 #rust-release <pietroalbini> mostly for the A- tags, it's not a bad idea to investigate which ones are needed and which ones are noise
2018-06-06T19:49:57 #rust-release <simulacrum> Sure.
2018-06-06T19:50:23 #rust-release <batmanaod-M> That section doesn't seem to document what the I-types are...
2018-06-06T19:50:25 #rust-release <pietroalbini> and also, I'd like to have an F-feature-name label for each feature we have, instead of A- labels just for a few of them
2018-06-06T19:50:43 #rust-release <jistone> I feel like we're missing labels for some libs, like a `std` catch-all
2018-06-06T19:50:51 #rust-release <batmanaod-M> Or, really, provide much in-depth explanation for any category except C-
2018-06-06T19:50:54 #rust-release <jistone> assuming we do want at least one A- label on everything
2018-06-06T19:51:11 #rust-release <simulacrum> I think this falls into the question of whether it's actually useful
2018-06-06T19:51:18 #rust-release <simulacrum> I think the F- labels would be more useful
2018-06-06T19:51:35 #rust-release <pietroalbini> the reasoning for F- labels is that when you stabilize a feature you can check if there are still issues with that at a glance
2018-06-06T19:51:51 #rust-release <simulacrum> maybe F- labels would be better as milestones though?
2018-06-06T19:52:20 #rust-release <batmanaod-M> :+1:
2018-06-06T19:52:26 #rust-release <pietroalbini> it doesn't work well if an issue is caused by two features together
2018-06-06T19:52:54 #rust-release <simulacrum> okay, F- labels sounds good then
2018-06-06T19:53:23 #rust-release <pietroalbini> (migrating to them is going to be *so much* fun...)
2018-06-06T19:53:27 #rust-release <batmanaod-M> Can issues not have multiple milestones?
2018-06-06T19:53:46 #rust-release <pietroalbini> nope
2018-06-06T19:54:22 #rust-release <simulacrum> so generally speaking I'll try to get teams to provide us with a "here's what we'd like" list and we can revisit
2018-06-06T19:54:45 #rust-release <pietroalbini> wonderful!
2018-06-06T19:54:48 #rust-release <simulacrum> but the F- labels seems good for us as a team for release tracking so we'll keep that
2018-06-06T19:55:21 #rust-release <simulacrum> Are people available for further weeks in this time slot?
2018-06-06T19:55:34 #rust-release <jkordish> this works really well for me, so yes.
2018-06-06T19:55:37 #rust-release <simulacrum> (or, perhaps better question, let me know if *not*)
2018-06-06T19:55:49 #rust-release <pietroalbini> yeah
2018-06-06T19:56:11 #rust-release <jistone> wfm
2018-06-06T19:56:32 #rust-release <simulacrum> I'll send out mail then letting people know that this will be the weekly release meeting for the time being...
2018-06-06T19:57:34 #rust-release <simulacrum> Otherwise though we'll call it here. Thanks everyone!
2018-06-06T19:57:39 #rust-release <pietroalbini> \o
2018-06-06T19:57:54 #rust-release <batmanaod-M> Thank you!
2018-06-06T19:58:01 #rust-release <stokhos> thank you!
2018-06-06T19:58:15 #rust-release <batmanaod-M> Oh, I have one additional question:
2018-06-06T19:59:14 #rust-release <batmanaod-M> The whole release team was tagged for review on one of the release's release notes (1.24.1, I think). I enjoyed helping with that; could we add "ping the release team for release-notes review" to the release-process instructions as well?
2018-06-06T20:08:24 #rust-release <batmanaod-M> (of course, just because I enjoyed it doesn't necessarily mean that I was helpful, so perhaps that's not a good idea...)
2018-06-06T20:12:34 #rust-release <simulacrum> generally more eyes on release notes are good, so that seems good to me
2018-06-11T11:18:31 #rust-release <pietroalbini> http://cargobomb-reports.s3.amazonaws.com/beta-1.27-9/index.html
2018-06-11T11:18:39 #rust-release <pietroalbini> I'll triage this after lunch :)
2018-06-11T12:50:59 #rust-release <pietroalbini> uh, there's something weird with that run simulacrum 
2018-06-11T12:51:08 #rust-release <pietroalbini> a bunch of failures are docker that's unreachable
2018-06-11T12:51:12 #rust-release <pietroalbini> should we restart it?
2018-06-11T13:43:40 #rust-release <simulacrum> pietroalbini: I'm not seeing those...
2018-06-11T13:45:15 #rust-release <simulacrum> but yeah we should probably restart (giving it a different name) and then triage the existing list of failures; that way we get the best of both options I think
2018-06-11T15:29:25 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, the failures are a lot of the build-fail in the fixed category
2018-06-11T15:30:43 #rust-release <simulacrum> pietroalbini: I don't think the fixed category matters too much -- if there's any in regressed we should double-check but I'm not too worried; I think what I said before stands
2018-06-11T15:39:51 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, I did some grep over the results, and there seems to be only 55 failures like that, so it's not a problem
2018-06-11T15:40:20 #rust-release <pietroalbini> all of them happened around june 8 14:09, so my guess is the docker daemon crashed
2018-06-11T15:41:51 #rust-release <simulacrum> hm, okay
2018-06-11T15:44:34 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, aidanhs yep, it restarted at 14:09 after a bunch of "stream copy error: reading from a closed fifo" https://gist.github.com/pietroalbini/2f84988631384cc2258b7c05a7037c2a
2018-06-11T16:38:34 #rust-release <pietroalbini> triaged the beta run
2018-06-11T16:38:50 #rust-release <pietroalbini> other than the spurious failures, there were two groups of failure
2018-06-11T16:39:17 #rust-release <pietroalbini> one was some fallout from the lints rename and deny(warnings), which was expected, and I opened a won't fix issue to notify the authors of those crates
2018-06-11T16:40:54 #rust-release <pietroalbini> but I can't figure out why there are three deny(warnings) and unused_must_use failures in the second beta run but not in the first one
2018-06-11T16:41:16 #rust-release <pietroalbini> a quick glance at the backports points to nothing interesting
2018-06-11T16:41:18 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, ^
2018-06-11T16:41:33 #rust-release <pietroalbini> https://cargobomb-reports.s3.amazonaws.com/beta-1.27-9/beta-2018-06-04/reg/mime-0.3.7/log.txt - https://cargobomb-reports.s3.amazonaws.com/beta-1.27-9/beta-2018-06-04/reg/ethereum-bigint-0.2.9/log.txt
2018-06-11T16:42:04 #rust-release <simulacrum> Could it be crates/dependenices updating?
2018-06-11T16:46:58 #rust-release <pietroalbini> oooh
2018-06-11T16:47:18 #rust-release <pietroalbini> ok, the first beta run was done with --cap-lints=warn and the second one with --cap-lints=forbid
2018-06-11T16:47:26 #rust-release <pietroalbini> that explains it
2018-06-11T16:48:00 #rust-release <simulacrum> ah, yeah, we shouldn't be capping lints for beta runs, since there's no real reason to warn about that kind of breakage
2018-06-11T16:48:19 #rust-release <simulacrum> (Cargo passes cap-lints for deps, and root crates can be fixed trivially without ecosystem pain)
2018-06-12T18:15:26 #rust-release <kennytm> should S-blocked be used for FCPs? https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/50912#issuecomment-395789806
2018-06-12T18:23:44 #rust-release <pietroalbini> well, that's technically correct
2018-06-12T18:36:59 #rust-release <kennytm> there's also 51408 blocked on 49219 which has been S-inactive-closed ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2018-06-13T19:13:33 #rust-release <pietroalbini> hmm, isn't this meeting time simulacrum?
2018-06-13T19:34:03 #rust-release <simulacrum> er, it was
2018-06-13T19:34:06 #rust-release <simulacrum> pietroalbini: Hm, I thought it was an hour later but I appear to have been wrong
2018-06-13T19:34:33 #rust-release <pietroalbini> *shrugs
2018-06-13T19:34:43 #rust-release <simulacrum> pietroalbini: I guess... we can start now
2018-06-13T19:35:21 #rust-release <simulacrum> I think the main thing to examine is the label requests
2018-06-13T19:35:22 #rust-release <simulacrum> https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Rust-langrust-label-requests-i0Sk1fjLRH3Fr1bOvn3qu
2018-06-13T19:35:51 #rust-release <pietroalbini> maybe you can ping the other ones in the channel?
2018-06-13T19:35:59 #rust-release <simulacrum> hm, yeah, let me get a list up
2018-06-13T19:37:31 #rust-release <simulacrum> jkordish, centril, batmanaod-M, pramodpsb, araz: <late meeting ping>
2018-06-13T19:37:45 #rust-release <simulacrum> ah, also stokhos
2018-06-13T19:38:39 #rust-release <simulacrum> So it looks like we're using the majority of the tags... I think the main set that doesn't appear useful is the OS (O-*) tag
2018-06-13T19:39:07 #rust-release <centril> yo
2018-06-13T19:40:29 #rust-release <pietroalbini> yeah, most of the uses for A- can be split into the F- labels and maybe we can do something like we do with NLL- for the diagnostics ones
2018-06-13T19:40:45 #rust-release <pietroalbini> (I'll switch to my phone so I'll be able to write less)
2018-06-13T19:41:09 #rust-release <stokhos> hi
2018-06-13T19:41:12 #rust-release <simulacrum> I agree that it seems like F- is going to be the most useful of the features
2018-06-13T19:41:16 #rust-release <simulacrum> er, labels
2018-06-13T19:42:32 #rust-release <centril> a new label for each tracking issue seems excessive
2018-06-13T19:43:24 #rust-release <pietroalbini> I think it will be useful when stabilizing things, so we can see all the issues for the feature
2018-06-13T19:43:25 #rust-release <simulacrum> Do you have a better suggestion? Otherwise it's hard/impossible to find issues relating to any given tracking issue
2018-06-13T19:43:51 #rust-release <simulacrum> labels don't really hurt in terms of usability I think either (that is, their quantity doesn't matter)
2018-06-13T19:45:19 #rust-release <simulacrum> centril: Do you seem some middleground that you'd prefer?
2018-06-13T19:45:44 #rust-release <centril> simulacrum: mostly I don't know that there's a problem atm; there are plenty of features that just have a tracking issue and that's it; then you just have a stabilization PR and done
2018-06-13T19:45:48 #rust-release <centril> simulacrum: particularly for T-libs stuff
2018-06-13T19:46:01 #rust-release <simulacrum> sure -- I think this is mostly lang tracking issues
2018-06-13T19:46:04 #rust-release <centril> simulacrum: but I see how it can be useful for larger T-lang stuff
2018-06-13T19:46:14 #rust-release <simulacrum> I don't imagine we'd have say F-drain_filter
2018-06-13T19:46:27 #rust-release <simulacrum> but something like F-use-extern-macros, sure
2018-06-13T19:46:55 #rust-release <centril> simulacrum: but I would perhaps say that we should have more tracking issues and not say lumb everything related to 'impl Trait' (several different RFCs) into a single unmanagable tracking issue
2018-06-13T19:47:35 #rust-release <simulacrum> And then have labels for those tracking issues? The end-goal here is to be able to find "todo lists" for each given feature
2018-06-13T19:48:40 #rust-release <centril> simulacrum: no just have those smaller tracking issues; for the end goal of "todo lists" milestones for larger things such as NLL seems better to me
2018-06-13T19:49:55 #rust-release <simulacrum> So how would one find the "blockers" for say extern crate prelude? With the labels it'd be a matter of search...
2018-06-13T19:51:36 #rust-release <centril> simulacrum: like we did with  https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/milestone/52
2018-06-13T19:51:45 #rust-release <centril> (Rust 2018 Alpha)
2018-06-13T19:51:59 #rust-release <simulacrum> milestones are painful because there can only be one per issue
2018-06-13T19:52:28 #rust-release <simulacrum> I think we'd prefer to use them but because of that we decided that wouldn't really work
2018-06-13T19:53:17 #rust-release <centril> simulacrum: fair enough; F-nll  works better that way; but it will make the RFC merge procedure more complicated
2018-06-13T19:53:21 #rust-release <centril> but not by much
2018-06-13T19:53:27 #rust-release <centril> and eventually rfcbot can do that
2018-06-13T19:53:43 #rust-release <simulacrum> hm, not sure what you mean there
2018-06-13T19:53:53 #rust-release <simulacrum> how will it affect RFC merges?
2018-06-13T19:54:08 #rust-release <centril> simulacrum: every time an RFC is merged a tracking issue has to be made
2018-06-13T19:54:14 #rust-release <centril> now you also have to add a label
2018-06-13T19:54:21 #rust-release <centril> but that's not too complicated / time consuming
2018-06-13T19:54:44 #rust-release <simulacrum> Yeah, seems like a low priority concern. We could create it with first triaged issue for that feature, for example
2018-06-13T19:55:30 #rust-release <centril> simulacrum: right; each RFC would most likely get mapped to one F-  label
2018-06-13T19:55:45 #rust-release <centril> but it can be totally automated
2018-06-13T19:56:08 #rust-release <simulacrum> Same as with tracking issue creation -- can be, but not hugely necessary. RFC traffic isn't that high :)
2018-06-13T19:56:54 #rust-release <centril> simulacrum: typically when I execute the RFC merge procedure I always make one tracking issue :)
2018-06-13T19:57:03 #rust-release <centril> but yeah, agreed on RFC traffic
2018-06-13T19:57:37 #rust-release <simulacrum> Sure -- what I mean is that it's not too much higher overhead than status quo both from automation or human time perspectives
2018-06-13T19:57:46 #rust-release <pietroalbini> then we can/should add "audit all the F- issues" to the stabilization procedure
2018-06-13T19:58:22 #rust-release <simulacrum> Probably, yeah -- I'd sort of imagine that teams would do that even if we don't ask them to
2018-06-13T19:58:25 #rust-release <centril> simulacrum: I agree
2018-06-13T20:00:41 #rust-release <simulacrum> Okay, that's both the official meeting time over and I think a successful conclusion of the meeting -- we resolved the questions I wanted to, anyway
2018-06-13T20:00:47 #rust-release <simulacrum> Thanks!
2018-06-13T20:00:51 #rust-release <simulacrum> \o
2018-06-13T20:01:00 #rust-release <centril> simulacrum: ill start applying F-  labels then when I merge RFCs :)
2018-06-13T20:01:03 #rust-release <centril> starting now
2018-06-13T20:01:11 #rust-release <simulacrum> Yeah, we'll update the forge directions eventually...
2018-06-13T20:01:48 #rust-release <centril> simulacrum: btw... I missed the first meeting; is it 21:00 CET?
2018-06-13T20:02:20 #rust-release <simulacrum> er... CET is Central European time?
2018-06-13T20:02:35 #rust-release <centril> simulacrum: yes
2018-06-13T20:02:47 #rust-release <jkordish> centril: quick google search and yes it would be 2100CET
2018-06-13T20:02:59 #rust-release <centril> ok great
2018-06-13T20:03:01 #rust-release * simulacrum is terrible at timezones
2018-06-13T20:03:06 #rust-release <simulacrum> It is the previous hour from now
2018-06-13T20:03:09 #rust-release <centril> simulacrum: 21:00 CET == 1 hour ago
2018-06-13T20:03:16 #rust-release <simulacrum> Yeah, then that's correct
2018-06-13T20:07:38 #rust-release <pietroalbini> \o
2018-06-13T20:07:59 #rust-release <pietroalbini> I'll guess we'll talk about the regression hunting squad next week
2018-06-13T20:09:43 #rust-release <jkordish> \o
2018-06-13T20:10:27 #rust-release <jkordish> pietroalbini: i'd be interested in that definitely. been trying to be more proactive on that while I do issue triage. 
2018-06-13T20:13:19 #rust-release <simulacrum> pietroalbini: Yeah, sounds good
2018-06-13T20:18:44 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, also, is there any chance to get r+ perms? it would be really nice not have to bother someone when I do beta backports, or when I see a "r=me after squash" during pr triage
2018-06-13T20:25:29 #rust-release <simulacrum> sure, yeah, if you want to make a PR to central station I can merge it. I'm not sure if we can deploy before acrichto gets back, but aidanhs might be able to
2018-06-13T22:00:43 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, thanks! :D also, https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-central-station/pull/47 should be merged before redeploying
2018-06-13T23:03:55 #rust-release <simulacrum> I don't have access anyway, but yes :)
2018-06-16T12:12:21 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, if I understood the beta process correctly it's the team responsible for the changes that should approve a pr for backport
2018-06-16T12:12:32 #rust-release <pietroalbini> so, shouldn't the release team approve that?
2018-06-16T12:13:00 #rust-release <pietroalbini> (context: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/51591)
2018-06-16T12:23:26 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, also, created a "backports rollup" pr with the release notes
2018-06-16T13:28:42 #rust-release <simulacrum> pietroalbini: I missed that it's release notes
2018-06-18T15:19:08 #rust-release <kennytm> pietroalbini: i think {!gh 50884} should be S-waiting-on-team, since we're still waiting for the checkboxes to enter FCP 
2018-06-18T15:19:13 #rust-release <kennytm> https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/50884
2018-06-18T15:23:00 #rust-release <kennytm> (the same for https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/51285)
2018-06-18T15:45:34 #rust-release <pietroalbini> kennytm, oh, right, if you have time to change them it would be awesome
2018-06-18T15:46:24 #rust-release <kennytm> okay, both changed
2018-06-20T15:52:58 #rust-release <pietroalbini> posted the prerelease testing announcement on r/rust
2018-06-20T15:59:44 #rust-release <jkordish> nice
2018-06-20T16:59:18 #rust-release <Aaronepower> Is there a meeting today?
2018-06-20T16:59:51 #rust-release <pietroalbini> Aaronepower, 2 hours from now if I'm not mistaken
2018-06-20T17:00:24 #rust-release <Aaronepower> Ohh okay, got timezones mixed up. 😅
2018-06-20T19:02:38 #rust-release <simulacrum> jkordish: jistone: centril: pietroalbini: batmanaod-M: araz: Aaronepower: stokhos: meeting
2018-06-20T19:02:42 #rust-release <pietroalbini> o/
2018-06-20T19:02:47 #rust-release <jkordish> o/
2018-06-20T19:03:24 #rust-release <jistone> o/
2018-06-20T19:03:25 #rust-release <araz> o/
2018-06-20T19:03:28 #rust-release <stokhos> o/
2018-06-20T19:04:18 #rust-release <simulacrum> close enough to quorum -- let's get started
2018-06-20T19:04:49 #rust-release <simulacrum> PR triage -- looks like there's been a slight uptick but that might be mozilla all-hands related
2018-06-20T19:05:44 #rust-release <pietroalbini> that and probably the amount of prs stuck in limbo for the "merge conflict" thing
2018-06-20T19:06:23 #rust-release <simulacrum> mhm
2018-06-20T19:06:52 #rust-release <pietroalbini> but thinking a bit more about it, that's for waiting-on-author, not -review
2018-06-20T19:07:30 #rust-release <simulacrum> Yeah, I think it's probably mostly review post all-hands
2018-06-20T19:07:43 #rust-release <simulacrum> but either way looks fine to me; any concerns?
2018-06-20T19:08:39 #rust-release <pietroalbini> the only thing is that merge conflict thing, but that requires infra people
2018-06-20T19:08:43 #rust-release <simulacrum> moving on to nominated issues -- https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/51650
2018-06-20T19:08:56 #rust-release <simulacrum> pietroalbini: yeah, it's "shrug" for now I think
2018-06-20T19:11:30 #rust-release <simulacrum> I think this issue is somewhat resolved -- for the future though we should make sure that we're updating bootstrap compilers more often I think
2018-06-20T19:11:39 #rust-release <simulacrum> i.e., keeping track of beta more closely
2018-06-20T19:12:10 #rust-release <simulacrum> any problems anyone sees with that?
2018-06-20T19:12:13 #rust-release <pietroalbini> I was thinking about a bot that opens a new PR automatically every time a new beta is published
2018-06-20T19:12:43 #rust-release <simulacrum> hm, that might be too aggressive - there's probably ~9-11 beta compilers per cycle with is more than one a week
2018-06-20T19:13:14 #rust-release <simulacrum> Though these PRs should land in rollups trivially so I guess not too bad
2018-06-20T19:13:55 #rust-release <pietroalbini> the problem is updating the bootstrap compiler has to be done after a new beta is released, so someone has to remember to do that the day after
2018-06-20T19:14:21 #rust-release <jkordish> is that documented somewhere?
2018-06-20T19:14:32 #rust-release <simulacrum> jkordish: What part of this?
2018-06-20T19:14:50 #rust-release <jkordish> well in regards to what pietroalbini  just mentioned
2018-06-20T19:15:15 #rust-release <simulacrum> updating it is ~trivial (just a date change in src/stage0.txt)
2018-06-20T19:15:31 #rust-release <jkordish> ok
2018-06-20T19:16:12 #rust-release <simulacrum> Let's see if we can do it manually for the next cycle and if that works well we'll see about writing a bot
2018-06-20T19:17:02 #rust-release <pietroalbini> sure, I have an idea about how to implement that, I'll write it down somewhere
2018-06-20T19:18:10 #rust-release <simulacrum> okay -- that's it for the nominated issues, let's talk about the regression hunting squad 
2018-06-20T19:19:12 #rust-release <simulacrum> I think we're mostly blocked on getting highfive moved over to infra's control and someone implementing a bot there ...
2018-06-20T19:19:29 #rust-release <pietroalbini> I thought a bit more about this in the past two weeks, and I think using a label might be better than a project
2018-06-20T19:20:01 #rust-release <simulacrum> "untriaged-release" -> "untriaged" -> nothing?
2018-06-20T19:20:48 #rust-release <pietroalbini> just a "new" label automatically applied to every new issue, and automatically removed when other labels are applied
2018-06-20T19:21:11 #rust-release <simulacrum> hm, okay -- I think removing it automatically might not be quite ideal
2018-06-20T19:21:38 #rust-release <simulacrum> i.e., I can see other team members finding an old issue with some labels and wanting it re-triaged
2018-06-20T19:22:31 #rust-release <pietroalbini> but then every time someone triages an issue they have to remove the new label
2018-06-20T19:22:44 #rust-release <jistone> that's not hard
2018-06-20T19:23:10 #rust-release <jistone> also, you might apply one label, but not be sure about others and still want more eyes on it
2018-06-20T19:23:33 #rust-release <simulacrum> GH's labeling dialog pretty much makes removing labels the easiest thing to do
2018-06-20T19:23:37 #rust-release <pietroalbini> yeah
2018-06-20T19:24:14 #rust-release <pietroalbini> maybe we can try just adding the "new" label, and then if it becomes hard to manage think about auto-removing them
2018-06-20T19:24:19 #rust-release <simulacrum> Sure, yeah
2018-06-20T19:24:31 #rust-release <simulacrum> I think it should be fairly easy to set up a bot that does this
2018-06-20T19:24:59 #rust-release <simulacrum> Would anyone be up for writing some code? I'd imagine we could for the time being just run it on heroku or something -- for free
2018-06-20T19:25:17 #rust-release <simulacrum> (then once we get highfive settled it would probably move there)
2018-06-20T19:25:31 #rust-release <pietroalbini> I can try doing that in a few days (busy with exams right now)
2018-06-20T19:26:08 #rust-release <simulacrum> okay, great!
2018-06-20T19:26:13 #rust-release <pietroalbini> (we might want to avoid adding the label if the issue is already created with some labels, like if some member creates a tracking issue)
2018-06-20T19:26:35 #rust-release <simulacrum> seems good -- we can iterate further
2018-06-20T19:27:51 #rust-release <simulacrum> okay, I think that's it for the agenda -- anyone have other things?
2018-06-20T19:32:07 #rust-release <simulacrum> presuming no -- let's call it here then
2018-06-20T19:32:10 #rust-release <pietroalbini> \o
2018-06-20T19:32:11 #rust-release <simulacrum> Thanks everyone! \o
2018-06-20T19:32:27 #rust-release <stokhos> \o
2018-06-20T19:32:42 #rust-release <jkordish> \o
2018-06-20T19:37:15 #rust-release <jistone> \o
2018-06-21T14:40:21 #rust-release <steveklabnik> we gonna do stuff at the usual time today? :D
2018-06-21T16:01:22 #rust-release <simulacrum> Okay, let's kick this off
2018-06-21T16:05:50 #rust-release <simulacrum> aturon: Okay, we might have a problem -- the command failed with release-stable-realz: fatal error: An error occurred (InvalidAccessKeyId) when calling the ListObjects operation: The AWS Access Key Id you provided does not exist in our records.
2018-06-21T16:07:12 #rust-release <steveklabnik> oh no
2018-06-21T16:09:15 #rust-release <simulacrum> but the file hasn't changed since july last year, so...
2018-06-21T16:09:36 #rust-release <simulacrum> either the key expired somehow or something else is wrong
2018-06-21T16:09:46 #rust-release <simulacrum> cc aidanhs
2018-06-21T16:10:22 #rust-release <aidanhs> omg no
2018-06-21T16:10:41 #rust-release <aidanhs> I was crossing my fingers for it not to be three infra-evenings in a row
2018-06-21T16:10:46 #rust-release <steveklabnik> :( <3
2018-06-21T16:11:06 #rust-release <misdreavus> ;_;
2018-06-21T16:11:55 #rust-release <aidanhs> simulacrum: I assume you're running on RCS?
2018-06-21T16:11:58 #rust-release <simulacrum> yeah
2018-06-21T16:12:27 #rust-release <simulacrum> let me try looking in bash history
2018-06-21T16:13:21 #rust-release <simulacrum> yeah, seems to be the right command
2018-06-21T16:13:23 #rust-release <aidanhs> I see some promising looking commands, but I don't know how you were running it
2018-06-21T16:13:27 #rust-release <aidanhs> oh :(
2018-06-21T16:14:03 #rust-release <simulacrum> re-logged, should be in .bash_history now
2018-06-21T16:15:05 #rust-release <simulacrum> aidanhs: Maybe it shouldn't be run in the existing docker? I did get the message that there's no such container as rcs, but I don't know if that's a symptom of yesterday
2018-06-21T16:15:16 #rust-release <aidanhs> hmm
2018-06-21T16:17:51 #rust-release <aidanhs> oooook I guess we better try bisecting the problem. I'll go onto the container, put the secrets in the environment explicitly and see if the `aws` command still functions
2018-06-21T16:20:36 #rust-release <aturon> simulacrum: aidanhs: i'm here now
2018-06-21T16:21:02 #rust-release <aturon> do you want me to try it?
2018-06-21T16:21:39 #rust-release <simulacrum> Can't hurt, but I doubt it'll make a difference -- you'd just be running the same command presumably
2018-06-21T16:21:57 #rust-release <simulacrum> docker exec -d -it friendly_cori bash -c 'promote-release /tmp/stable stable /data/secrets.toml 2>&1 | logger --tag release-stable-realz'
2018-06-21T16:22:15 #rust-release <aturon> simulacrum: hm so it occurs to me i have an additional key
2018-06-21T16:22:20 #rust-release <aturon> which i thought was just used for signing the tag
2018-06-21T16:22:24 #rust-release <aturon> but perhaps is relevant to this step too
2018-06-21T16:22:28 #rust-release <aturon> so yeah lemme try
2018-06-21T16:22:38 #rust-release <aidanhs> aturon: do you put it in the environment?
2018-06-21T16:22:57 #rust-release <aturon> aidanhs: no, i have it locally but carry it through the ssh tunneling
2018-06-21T16:24:06 #rust-release <simulacrum> ..I would be surprised if AWS keys could do that (and into a docker container). But I suppose it's possible...
2018-06-21T16:25:36 #rust-release <aturon> hm there's nothing in the log for today?
2018-06-21T16:26:00 #rust-release <aturon> simulacrum: so that command worked for me (completed successfully)
2018-06-21T16:26:04 #rust-release <aturon> but i'm not seeing anything in the log...
2018-06-21T16:26:12 #rust-release <simulacrum> did you just run it?
2018-06-21T16:26:15 #rust-release <aturon> yes
2018-06-21T16:26:35 #rust-release <simulacrum> yeah, log didn't notice that run I think?
2018-06-21T16:26:53 #rust-release <simulacrum> last run was at Jun 21 16:23:58 so nearly 3 minutes ago
2018-06-21T16:26:57 #rust-release <aidanhs> simulacrum: desperation makes you willing to try many things. just yesterday I adjusted the brightness of my monitor in desperation to try and fix some inconsistent colouring between some screenshots. needless to say it didn't work
2018-06-21T16:27:17 #rust-release <simulacrum> well, last run I see in logs 
2018-06-21T16:27:22 #rust-release <aturon> simulacrum: where are you looking?
2018-06-21T16:27:33 #rust-release <simulacrum> tail -f /var/log/syslog from inside the docker
2018-06-21T16:27:51 #rust-release <aturon> ah interesting
2018-06-21T16:28:10 #rust-release <aturon> (i usually look at the logs externally, thought they were the same...)
2018-06-21T16:28:12 #rust-release <simulacrum> (I wasn't able to do so outside, /opt/rcs/logs I can't seem to access even with sudo
2018-06-21T16:28:21 #rust-release <aturon> huh
2018-06-21T16:28:24 #rust-release <aturon> i can with sudo
2018-06-21T16:28:31 #rust-release <aturon> but the last entry is on the 20th
2018-06-21T16:28:38 #rust-release <simulacrum> sudo tail /opt/rcs/logs/syslog is empty for me... which is odd
2018-06-21T16:29:30 #rust-release <simulacrum> aturon: Is that how you look at logs?
2018-06-21T16:30:04 #rust-release <aturon> yes
2018-06-21T16:30:08 #rust-release <aturon> syslog is also empty for me
2018-06-21T16:30:14 #rust-release <aturon> but generally syslog.1 is up to date
2018-06-21T16:30:21 #rust-release <aturon> e.g. when we were debugging stuff yesterday
2018-06-21T16:30:56 #rust-release <simulacrum> hm, so I do see messages from today inside the docker `syslog`
2018-06-21T16:31:08 #rust-release <simulacrum> so maybe the files aren't copied until they're closed or some such?
2018-06-21T16:31:09 #rust-release <aidanhs> aturon: can you try `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=... AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=... aws s3 ls s3://static-rust-lang-org` within the container with the keys you have?
2018-06-21T16:31:33 #rust-release <aidanhs> the ones from secrets-prod.toml don't work
2018-06-21T16:31:44 #rust-release <aturon> simulacrum: confirmed that i get the same failure
2018-06-21T16:32:26 #rust-release <aturon> aidanhs: well so i'm pretty sure something's just busted
2018-06-21T16:32:35 #rust-release <aturon> one sec
2018-06-21T16:34:06 #rust-release <simulacrum> so the dev-static keys are identical and they were used yesterday
2018-06-21T16:34:53 #rust-release <aidanhs> uh wait
2018-06-21T16:34:59 #rust-release <aidanhs> identical seems suspicious
2018-06-21T16:35:25 #rust-release <simulacrum> how so? presumably the key has access to both buckets
2018-06-21T16:36:25 #rust-release <aidanhs> simulacrum: that would surprise me but I guess I can accept
2018-06-21T16:36:33 #rust-release <aturon> aidanhs: ok so to clarify, at this point i've done the full set of steps i normally do to cut a release, with no luck
2018-06-21T16:36:48 #rust-release <aidanhs> however, you have a point the keys are borked even for access to dev static
2018-06-21T16:37:09 #rust-release <aidanhs> it's like they've been revoked?
2018-06-21T16:37:41 #rust-release <aturon> aidanhs: is there something within AWS i could/should try?
2018-06-21T16:37:57 #rust-release <aidanhs> aturon: finding the list of access keys I guess
2018-06-21T16:39:03 #rust-release <aidanhs> I'm digging through my aws account to see if I can find out where they live
2018-06-21T16:40:59 #rust-release <aturon> yeah i always find AWS to be overwhelming...
2018-06-21T16:41:04 #rust-release <aturon> (i'm nosing around...)
2018-06-21T16:42:15 #rust-release <aidanhs> https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-west-1#/users
2018-06-21T16:42:18 #rust-release <aturon> so i have a list of users with keys, including "rust-central-station-deploy"
2018-06-21T16:42:21 #rust-release <aturon> yeah that's what i'm looking at
2018-06-21T16:42:24 #rust-release <aidanhs> woo
2018-06-21T16:42:30 #rust-release <aidanhs> so if you click through
2018-06-21T16:42:51 #rust-release <aidanhs> and go to "Security Credentials"
2018-06-21T16:43:24 #rust-release <aturon> ok i see two, one active and one inactive
2018-06-21T16:43:32 #rust-release <aturon> lemme compare to the secrets file
2018-06-21T16:44:32 #rust-release <aturon> aidanhs: ok, confirmed that secrets-prod.toml is using the inactive key
2018-06-21T16:44:43 #rust-release <aturon> that key is from 2017-01-27
2018-06-21T16:44:51 #rust-release <aturon> the active one is from 208-04-16
2018-06-21T16:45:49 #rust-release <aidanhs> so bizarre
2018-06-21T16:45:58 #rust-release <aidanhs> the certs got old, the keys got old
2018-06-21T16:47:24 #rust-release <aturon> aidanhs: ok so, i indeed get the same error when doing the s3 ls with the secrets-prod.toml keys
2018-06-21T16:47:37 #rust-release <aturon> however, from the AWS console, i don't see a way to actually get the secret
2018-06-21T16:47:45 #rust-release <aturon> should i re-activate the old key?
2018-06-21T16:48:25 #rust-release <aidanhs> I feel like the only correct answer to that is "no"
2018-06-21T16:48:29 #rust-release <aturon> lol
2018-06-21T16:48:41 #rust-release <simulacrum> we probably want a new key
2018-06-21T16:48:56 #rust-release <aidanhs> waiit a minute
2018-06-21T16:49:08 #rust-release <aturon> i think i have to de-activate the current one to do that? (the button to create is grayed out)
2018-06-21T16:49:34 #rust-release <aidanhs> `diff -u /home/ubuntu/rust-central-station/data/secrets-prod.toml /opt/rcs/data/secrets-prod.toml `
2018-06-21T16:49:44 #rust-release <aidanhs> why do these both exist
2018-06-21T16:50:06 #rust-release <aturon> oh my
2018-06-21T16:50:09 #rust-release <aidanhs> oh no
2018-06-21T16:50:12 #rust-release <simulacrum> the on in /opt looks newer
2018-06-21T16:50:15 #rust-release <simulacrum> one*
2018-06-21T16:50:16 #rust-release <aturon> indeed
2018-06-21T16:50:20 #rust-release <aidanhs> aturon: which run-prod did you do yesterday?
2018-06-21T16:50:26 #rust-release <simulacrum> how it got there... is a mystery to me
2018-06-21T16:51:04 #rust-release <simulacrum> aidanhs: Isn't there just one?
2018-06-21T16:51:09 #rust-release <aturon> aidanhs: within rust-central-station IIRC
2018-06-21T16:51:20 #rust-release <aidanhs> oh er
2018-06-21T16:52:07 #rust-release <aturon> aidanhs: (excellent catch btw...)
2018-06-21T16:52:12 #rust-release <aturon> awaiting further instructions :)
2018-06-21T16:52:21 #rust-release <aturon> though actually, i guess you now have everything you need
2018-06-21T16:52:30 #rust-release <simulacrum> We can try running with the one in opt, I think
2018-06-21T16:52:45 #rust-release <aturon> yes, in particular, we now have the actual secret for the active key
2018-06-21T16:54:33 #rust-release <aidanhs> yeah I want to be careful here
2018-06-21T16:54:49 #rust-release <aidanhs> this explains the website certs
2018-06-21T16:54:58 #rust-release <aidanhs> but I don't understand how the old container was running from opt
2018-06-21T16:55:04 #rust-release <simulacrum> so one thing: should we copy the /opt toml somewhere like /tmp or something -- I'm worried that we'll accidentally lose it somehow
2018-06-21T16:55:27 #rust-release <aturon> seems prudent
2018-06-21T16:55:56 #rust-release <aidanhs> simulacrum: well it won't get lost until we do something, and we're not going to do anything just yet :)
2018-06-21T16:56:07 #rust-release <simulacrum> hm, true
2018-06-21T16:56:09 #rust-release <aturon> FYI, i'm going to be in a 1.5 hour HR training session starting in 5 min
2018-06-21T16:56:10 #rust-release <aidanhs> I'd tar it up and put it in home in case the machine dies
2018-06-21T16:56:22 #rust-release <aturon> but i will be keeping an eye on this channel
2018-06-21T16:56:28 #rust-release <aidanhs> aturon: I think we should be ok for now
2018-06-21T16:56:31 #rust-release <aturon> ping me if you need stuff from me
2018-06-21T16:56:33 #rust-release <aturon> yeah seems like it
2018-06-21T16:58:39 #rust-release <aidanhs> (currently running a find of run-prod.sh on the box to find any possible rogue installations)
2018-06-21T17:01:38 #rust-release <simulacrum> aidanhs: So there's seemingly a discrepancy in /opt -- syslog.1 was touched yesterday whereas syslog.2.gz is ~2 months old
2018-06-21T17:01:39 #rust-release <aidanhs> `docker run --name rcs --volume `pwd`/data:/data --volume `pwd`/data/letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt --volume `pwd`/logs:/var/log --publish 80:80 --publish 443:443 --rm alexcrichton/rust-central-station`
2018-06-21T17:01:46 #rust-release <aidanhs> well ok then
2018-06-21T17:02:21 #rust-release <aidanhs> simulacrum: whoa syslog.1 is huge
2018-06-21T17:02:58 #rust-release <simulacrum> hm, maybe that's the last time we started/stopped RCS?
2018-06-21T17:03:12 #rust-release <aidanhs> seems possible
2018-06-21T17:03:40 #rust-release <aidanhs> so, I kinda want to move us back to the data dir in /opt since it's generally more recent
2018-06-21T17:03:48 #rust-release <aidanhs> but this will kill bors
2018-06-21T17:03:52 #rust-release <simulacrum> we should make a copy of it before then
2018-06-21T17:03:59 #rust-release <aidanhs> I'll make the tar
2018-06-21T17:04:19 #rust-release <simulacrum> Are we sure we can't swap the directories without stopping the docker container?
2018-06-21T17:04:47 #rust-release <aidanhs> 99%
2018-06-21T17:05:02 #rust-release <aidanhs> and even if we could, we'd need to restart things because it's already loaded the config
2018-06-21T17:06:32 #rust-release <simulacrum> hm, yeah
2018-06-21T17:06:47 #rust-release <simulacrum> killing bors isn't terrible though not ideal of course
2018-06-21T17:09:40 #rust-release <aidanhs> let me write down the commands I think should work
2018-06-21T17:14:08 #rust-release <aidanhs> docker kill friendly_cori
2018-06-21T17:14:10 #rust-release <aidanhs> docker run --name rcs --volume /opt/rcs/data:/data --volume /opt/rcs/data/letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt --volume /opt/rcs/logs:/var/log --publish 80:80 --publish 443:443 --rm --detach alexcrichton/rust-central-station
2018-06-21T17:14:12 #rust-release <aidanhs> docker exec -it rcs "letsencrypt renew"
2018-06-21T17:14:33 #rust-release <aidanhs> the last line is because we're reverting back to the old certs that were broken yesterday
2018-06-21T17:15:38 #rust-release <simulacrum> those commands look good to me, I believe
2018-06-21T17:16:27 #rust-release <aidanhs> ok - you can `tmux a` on the box if you want to observe
2018-06-21T17:19:24 #rust-release <aidanhs> ok, restarted
2018-06-21T17:20:04 #rust-release <aidanhs> no certs renewed, and yet it's fine - I don't know where the broken certs from yesterday were coming from...
2018-06-21T17:21:45 #rust-release <aidanhs> we're looking good I think
2018-06-21T17:22:40 #rust-release <aidanhs> bors has been killed and restarted, so the queue may need prodding
2018-06-21T17:22:42 #rust-release <simulacrum> bors seems to have more cleanly restarted than last time
2018-06-21T17:22:45 #rust-release <aidanhs> yeah
2018-06-21T17:23:15 #rust-release <simulacrum> wait, no, bors is very confused
2018-06-21T17:23:31 #rust-release <aidanhs> I wonder if it picked up the state from when we killed it yesterday
2018-06-21T17:23:32 #rust-release <simulacrum> aidanhs: that queue is old but wrong
2018-06-21T17:23:59 #rust-release <aidanhs> worth using the synchronise hammer?
2018-06-21T17:24:26 #rust-release <simulacrum> yes -- do you want to hit it?
2018-06-21T17:24:47 #rust-release <aidanhs> done
2018-06-21T17:24:52 #rust-release <aidanhs> oh - if you have the page open
2018-06-21T17:25:06 #rust-release <aidanhs> what was the top pr bors was about to start running?
2018-06-21T17:28:40 #rust-release <simulacrum> aidanhs: I only have the old page
2018-06-21T17:28:55 #rust-release <simulacrum> but what I see refreshing looks right
2018-06-21T17:55:47 #rust-release <simulacrum> release kicked off
2018-06-21T18:18:23 #rust-release <simulacrum> 15% done building LLVM
2018-06-21T18:20:17 #rust-release <steveklabnik> woo
2018-06-21T18:20:24 #rust-release <steveklabnik> how long are we thinking, vaguely?
2018-06-21T18:20:50 #rust-release <simulacrum> hm, 20-30 minutes?
2018-06-21T18:21:13 #rust-release <simulacrum> never run this so not sure exactly how fast this goes
2018-06-21T18:21:29 #rust-release <steveklabnik> cool cool, that's close enough
2018-06-21T18:30:31 #rust-release <simulacrum> steveklabnik: maybe towards 45-60, i.e., 30-45 more 
2018-06-21T18:30:43 #rust-release <simulacrum> we're only at 30%
2018-06-21T18:39:11 #rust-release <steveklabnik> roger that
2018-06-21T18:56:13 #rust-release <simulacrum> 50%
2018-06-21T19:00:29 #rust-release <steveklabnik> estimates, they are hard :)
2018-06-21T19:01:07 #rust-release <jistone> feels like a tense movie scene, where the USB transfer is dragging... bad guys at the door
2018-06-21T19:17:53 #rust-release <simulacrum> 76%...
2018-06-21T19:25:51 #rust-release <simulacrum> I feel like something changed since the last release, this didn't used to take this long
2018-06-21T19:26:26 #rust-release <steveklabnik> yeah
2018-06-21T19:26:28 #rust-release <steveklabnik> hm
2018-06-21T19:32:57 #rust-release <jistone> simulacrum, you mentioned building LLVM before -- aren't releases usually shipped directly from the build you announced for testing?
2018-06-21T19:33:33 #rust-release <jistone> (IOW, why is this building anything?)
2018-06-21T19:37:39 #rust-release <simulacrum> jistone: We run one x.py command to hash and sign it
2018-06-21T19:37:46 #rust-release <simulacrum> I have no idea why it's building LLVM, though
2018-06-21T19:38:39 #rust-release <simulacrum> I think there might be some false edges in the dep graph that we didn't notice before since this command isn't run except on central station
2018-06-21T19:38:48 #rust-release <simulacrum> but it's nearly done now I think
2018-06-21T19:39:15 #rust-release <simulacrum> well, still needs to upload everything
2018-06-21T19:39:36 #rust-release <simulacrum> I'll look into the LLVM issue later
2018-06-21T19:39:45 #rust-release <simulacrum> it's probably slowing down beta/nightly deploys too
2018-06-21T19:41:33 #rust-release <steveklabnik> <3
2018-06-21T19:44:38 #rust-release <simulacrum> yeah, we added the llvm bin path in this release which caused this - we can probably just disable llvm on central stations build
2018-06-21T19:44:46 #rust-release <simulacrum> anyway, hitting website
2018-06-21T19:44:56 #rust-release <simulacrum> er, merging
2018-06-21T19:45:34 #rust-release <simulacrum>  Build completed successfully in 1:45:13 
2018-06-21T19:45:44 #rust-release <simulacrum> (that's how long it takes to sign artifacts now)
2018-06-21T19:45:48 #rust-release <steveklabnik> wew
2018-06-21T19:46:09 #rust-release <simulacrum> though it should take somewhere around 5 minutes
2018-06-21T19:46:23 #rust-release <simulacrum> aturon: ping
2018-06-21T19:48:43 #rust-release <simulacrum> website is live
2018-06-21T19:48:49 #rust-release <steveklabnik> yay
2018-06-21T19:48:58 #rust-release <steveklabnik> i'm seeing it
2018-06-21T19:49:05 #rust-release <steveklabnik> can you push the tag?
2018-06-21T19:49:10 #rust-release <steveklabnik> or is that aturon and why you pinge dhim
2018-06-21T19:49:16 #rust-release <simulacrum> we need aturon to sign it
2018-06-21T19:49:29 #rust-release <steveklabnik> roger
2018-06-21T19:50:48 #rust-release <simulacrum> next all hands we should have the RCS log on screen, this is much more interesting than hitting a green button
2018-06-21T19:50:55 #rust-release <steveklabnik> hehe
2018-06-21T19:53:43 #rust-release <steveklabnik> aaron's coming
2018-06-21T20:06:18 #rust-release <aturon> simulacrum: what's the PR for 1.27.0?
2018-06-21T20:06:25 #rust-release <aturon> having trouble finding it for some reason
2018-06-21T20:06:38 #rust-release <simulacrum> gh51627
2018-06-21T20:06:46 #rust-release <simulacrum> 3eda71b00ad48d7bf4eef4c443e7f611fd061418 is the commit
2018-06-21T20:06:52 #rust-release <simulacrum> er, bors commit 
2018-06-21T20:07:46 #rust-release <simulacrum> aturon: You shouldn't need the PR, though? tagging is by-commit...
2018-06-21T20:07:55 #rust-release <aturon> simulacrum: yeah just wanted to check
2018-06-21T20:08:02 #rust-release <simulacrum> ah, okay
2018-06-21T20:08:47 #rust-release <bstrie> release today? do I have the week wrong?
2018-06-21T20:08:52 #rust-release <aturon> simulacrum: steveklabnik: tag pushed
2018-06-21T20:08:59 #rust-release <simulacrum> bstrie: Yes, will be live in ~5-10 minutes
2018-06-21T20:09:41 #rust-release <steveklabnik> woot
2018-06-21T20:09:44 #rust-release <steveklabnik> updating thnaks soon
2018-06-21T20:11:35 #rust-release <steveklabnik> https://thanks.rust-lang.org/rust/1.27.0
2018-06-21T20:11:36 #rust-release <steveklabnik> boom
2018-06-21T20:11:39 #rust-release <steveklabnik> time to merge the blog!
2018-06-21T20:12:08 #rust-release <simulacrum> ah, well, release isn't quite live yet
2018-06-21T20:12:24 #rust-release <simulacrum> Though we're supposed to merge at t-5 I guess
2018-06-21T20:12:40 #rust-release <steveklabnik> oh
2018-06-21T20:12:44 #rust-release <steveklabnik> since it was on the website i thought it was
2018-06-21T20:12:45 #rust-release <steveklabnik> oops
2018-06-21T20:13:00 #rust-release <simulacrum> nobody looks at the website and it's slow
2018-06-21T20:13:02 #rust-release <simulacrum> but it's about to be
2018-06-21T20:13:10 #rust-release <steveklabnik> hehe
2018-06-21T20:13:15 #rust-release <simulacrum> info: latest update on 2018-06-21, rust version 1.27.0 (3eda71b00 2018-06-19)  
2018-06-21T20:13:19 #rust-release <simulacrum> \o/
2018-06-21T20:13:36 #rust-release <steveklabnik> me too
2018-06-21T20:13:37 #rust-release <steveklabnik> woooo
2018-06-21T20:13:52 #rust-release <steveklabnik> blog is taking forever
2018-06-21T20:14:04 #rust-release <simulacrum> I see it
2018-06-21T20:14:08 #rust-release <simulacrum> https://blog.rust-lang.org/2018/06/21/Rust-1.27.html
2018-06-21T20:14:54 #rust-release <steveklabnik> :D
2018-06-21T20:14:56 #rust-release <steveklabnik> grats everyone
2018-06-21T20:15:01 #rust-release <steveklabnik> thank you all for your hard work on this one
2018-06-21T20:15:56 #rust-release <pietroalbini> \o/
2018-06-21T20:17:12 #rust-release <pietroalbini> now we just need to add "ensure alex is around" to the release process
2018-06-22T21:24:49 #rust-release <Aaronepower> Release notes for 1.28.0: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/51722
2018-06-22T21:37:48 #rust-release <pietroalbini> starting the beta crater run
2018-06-22T22:23:04 #rust-release <steveklabnik> Aaronepower: <3
2018-06-22T22:24:26 #rust-release <simulacrum> pietroalbini: Thanks!
2018-06-25T18:51:43 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, uh, wait, https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/51785 is regression-from-stable-to-stable
2018-06-25T18:52:10 #rust-release <pietroalbini> if we're going to do 1.27.1 (as I saw in the release blog post) we should also include that
2018-06-25T18:52:37 #rust-release <pietroalbini> it was introduced in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/51785
2018-06-25T18:52:48 #rust-release <pietroalbini> *https://github.com/cuviper/rust/commit/cb2a0d61adb47b530f8922c9ae3c816cbbf062c5
2018-06-25T18:54:03 #rust-release <jistone> pietroalbini, I think it's only in beta
2018-06-25T18:54:22 #rust-release <pietroalbini> ...
2018-06-25T18:54:34 #rust-release <pietroalbini> oh right :/
2018-06-25T19:05:52 #rust-release <jistone> chalk up another success for rustc dogfooding though
2018-06-25T19:06:07 #rust-release <jistone> that nightly building from beta caught an issue before it was released
2018-06-25T20:41:09 #rust-release <simulacrum> This is something that should probably have tests, though
2018-06-25T20:41:21 #rust-release <simulacrum> I'm surprised it went uncaught on nightly for quite a while
2018-06-25T21:13:41 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, I can do the backport if needed
2018-06-25T21:14:01 #rust-release <simulacrum> Sure, was just trying to check if jistone already has something prepared
2018-06-25T21:14:17 #rust-release <jistone> I haven't yet, feel free
2018-06-25T21:17:37 #rust-release <jistone> simulacrum, I'm not sure there's a good test we could do for improper type-punning like that
2018-06-25T21:17:58 #rust-release <simulacrum> I meant a test that tests that we got the length of a file correctly
2018-06-25T21:18:05 #rust-release <simulacrum> (could be itself)
2018-06-25T21:18:37 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, done
2018-06-25T21:18:56 #rust-release <simulacrum> thanks
2018-06-25T21:19:02 #rust-release <jistone> pietroalbini++
2018-06-27T09:57:18 #rust-release <pietroalbini> beta crater run completed in http://cargobomb-reports.s3.amazonaws.com/pr-51570/index.html, I'll triage it later today
2018-06-27T09:57:53 #rust-release <pietroalbini> *http://cargobomb-reports.s3.amazonaws.com/beta-1.28-1/index.html, damn google
2018-06-27T13:22:33 #rust-release <pietroalbini> ok, opened issues for the spurious failures
2018-06-27T13:22:40 #rust-release <pietroalbini> *beta run failures
2018-06-27T13:23:08 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, aidanhs and there is the PR for the spurious ones: https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/crater/pull/244
2018-06-27T13:23:38 #rust-release <simulacrum> merged
2018-06-27T13:24:06 #rust-release <pietroalbini> thanks!
2018-06-27T13:25:09 #rust-release <pietroalbini> (I didn't have time neither to bisect the regressions nor look at them in too much detail, so the issues are a bit short)
2018-06-27T19:03:11 #rust-release <simulacrum> o/
2018-06-27T19:03:15 #rust-release <pietroalbini> o/
2018-06-27T19:03:25 #rust-release <jkordish> o/
2018-06-27T19:05:09 #rust-release <simulacrum> Aaronepower, araz, batmanaod-M centril, jistone, pramodpsb, stokhos: meeting
2018-06-27T19:05:17 #rust-release <stokhos> o/
2018-06-27T19:05:29 #rust-release <jistone> o/
2018-06-27T19:05:55 #rust-release <simulacrum> pietroalbini: Do you want to go through PR triage?
2018-06-27T19:06:16 #rust-release <batmanaod-M> o/
2018-06-27T19:06:26 #rust-release <pietroalbini> sure
2018-06-27T19:07:22 #rust-release <pietroalbini> there is nothing too different this week than the last one, but looking at the trend over time the numbers are increasing
2018-06-27T19:07:37 #rust-release <pietroalbini> (it's possible to change the number of days at the bottom of https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rustc-pr-tracking/)
2018-06-27T19:08:36 #rust-release <pietroalbini> the number of blocked PRs is increasing a lot over the last few months
2018-06-27T19:09:27 #rust-release <simulacrum> Do we have a sense if this is due to edition-related overload or if this is unrelated to anything general?
2018-06-27T19:09:57 #rust-release <pietroalbini> a lot of those is PRs waiting for an rfc, which means they won't get unblocked in a while
2018-06-27T19:11:06 #rust-release <pietroalbini> also, more people doing triage would be great, otherwise it takes a lot of time (1.5/2h last monday for me)
2018-06-27T19:11:25 #rust-release <simulacrum> oof -- we should work on that
2018-06-27T19:11:35 #rust-release <pietroalbini> (cc shep TimNN)
2018-06-27T19:11:40 #rust-release <TimNN> o/
2018-06-27T19:11:57 #rust-release <shep> ohai
2018-06-27T19:12:00 #rust-release <shep> o/
2018-06-27T19:12:16 #rust-release <batmanaod-M> I may have some time this weekend; I'll try...
2018-06-27T19:12:18 #rust-release <shep> pietroalbini: that's my bad, sorry
2018-06-27T19:12:18 #rust-release <simulacrum> pietroalbini: Is that mostly due to the high number of PRs, do you think?
2018-06-27T19:12:40 #rust-release <simulacrum> i.e. with 150 PRs we're seeing longer triage to go through many of them
2018-06-27T19:13:23 #rust-release <jkordish> ^ wow
2018-06-27T19:13:33 #rust-release <jkordish> i'll see about helping this sunday
2018-06-27T19:13:35 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, if there is a person each workday doing that it's not too much of a problem, because the same number of PRs are split ~evenly
2018-06-27T19:14:39 #rust-release <pietroalbini> but when ~40 waiting-on-review and ~25 waiting-on-author accumulate on monday it's going to take a while to go through all of them
2018-06-27T19:15:09 #rust-release <shep> and I'll try to get back in the swing for friday
2018-06-27T19:15:36 #rust-release <pietroalbini> shep, thanks :D
2018-06-27T19:15:56 #rust-release <simulacrum> Okay, so looks like we need to either find more people or increase automation
2018-06-27T19:16:25 #rust-release <pietroalbini> yeah
2018-06-27T19:16:39 #rust-release <simulacrum> Let's try to think about concrete ideas for improving the situation here for next week; finding more people in the past has sort of led to the current state so maybe we need to try an alternate approach for searching them out
2018-06-27T19:19:18 #rust-release <simulacrum> pietroalbini: Do you have a report on the triage results for beta crater run? Did it look relatively decent?
2018-06-27T19:19:49 #rust-release <pietroalbini> 24 regressions, so not too bad
2018-06-27T19:20:00 #rust-release <pietroalbini> https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+author%3Apietroalbini+label%3Aregression-from-stable-to-beta
2018-06-27T19:20:02 #rust-release <simulacrum> sounds good
2018-06-27T19:20:27 #rust-release <pietroalbini> I don't have access today to the machine I bisect on, so if someone else can jump on that it would be awesome
2018-06-27T19:20:43 #rust-release <simulacrum> pietroalbini: I'll look into it or maybe kennytm will beat me
2018-06-27T19:21:06 #rust-release <jkordish> ^ do we have documentation on doing bisects?
2018-06-27T19:21:29 #rust-release <simulacrum> jkordish: Not really, this is the tool to use though: https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/cargo-bisect-rustc
2018-06-27T19:21:59 #rust-release <pietroalbini> (instead of that I use simulacrum's old tool with a few custom scripts -- https://github.com/pietroalbini/bisect-rust)
2018-06-27T19:22:07 #rust-release <kennytm> o/
2018-06-27T19:22:10 #rust-release <jkordish> ok. i could help out if i knew how
2018-06-27T19:22:12 #rust-release <jkordish> oh ok
2018-06-27T19:22:52 #rust-release <simulacrum> With the edition preview starting, issues on rust-lang/rust that are related should be tagged with the edition preview label and please cc me and centril when you see them (@Mark-Simulacrum and @Centril)
2018-06-27T19:23:47 #rust-release <simulacrum> Otherwise I think that's it for today -- anyone have anything else?
2018-06-27T19:24:28 #rust-release <pietroalbini> I didn't have time to work on bots this week, I have an exam next mon/wed so my time is more limited
2018-06-27T19:24:39 #rust-release <stokhos> I can try help with pr triage on friday
2018-06-27T19:25:01 #rust-release <stokhos> though I think I need some guidance on that
2018-06-27T19:25:13 #rust-release <simulacrum> stokhos: Can you talk to shep, maybe split the work between the two of you somehow? :)
2018-06-27T19:25:23 #rust-release <stokhos> sure
2018-06-27T19:25:23 #rust-release <simulacrum> pietroalbini: Okay, thanks for the heads up
2018-06-27T19:25:45 #rust-release <simulacrum> stokhos: Also, if you need help, feel free to ping me or ask here in the channel
2018-06-27T19:25:54 #rust-release <simulacrum> Alright, let's call it here then
2018-06-27T19:25:56 #rust-release <simulacrum> \o
2018-06-27T19:25:56 #rust-release <stokhos> ok cool
2018-06-27T19:25:58 #rust-release <pietroalbini> \o
2018-06-27T19:26:01 #rust-release <jkordish> \o
2018-06-27T19:26:02 #rust-release <TimNN> \o
2018-06-27T19:26:02 #rust-release <stokhos> \o
2018-06-27T19:26:05 #rust-release <shep> \o
2018-06-27T19:26:12 #rust-release <pietroalbini> stokhos, you can also ping me if I'm online
2018-06-27T19:26:26 #rust-release <stokhos> thanks man
2018-06-27T19:26:31 #rust-release <shep> stokhos: oh, I guess if the meeting is done, we can chat here instead of in DM
2018-06-27T19:29:35 #rust-release <pietroalbini> for the ones wanting to do triage, if you want to use github saved replies I made an userscript to add variables support to them
2018-06-27T19:29:43 #rust-release <pietroalbini> https://userscripts.pietroalbini.org/scripts/github-pr-variables-in-comments.user.js
2018-06-27T19:30:14 #rust-release <shep> And there's https://forge.rust-lang.org/triage-procedure.html
2018-06-27T19:30:29 #rust-release <pietroalbini> yeah
2018-06-27T20:46:33 #rust-release <batmanaod-M> Maybe we could ask for PR-triage help to be requested in the next This Week in Rust "Call for Participation"?
2018-06-27T21:17:48 #rust-release <simulacrum> pietroalbini: kennytm: Finished bisecting regressions
2018-06-27T21:19:50 #rust-release <pietroalbini> batmanaod-M, hmm, that's not something a random people can do easily, because permissions are needed to do most of the things (relabeling, closing prs...)
2018-06-27T21:20:03 #rust-release <pietroalbini> but if we need more manpower that's a good place to ask!
2018-06-27T21:21:36 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, thanks!
2018-06-27T21:32:31 #rust-release <batmanaod-M> Oh right.
2018-06-28T15:56:38 #rust-release <batmanaod-M> I'm going to write an email to support@github asking that they implement this feature:  https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/148
2018-06-28T15:57:05 #rust-release <batmanaod-M> Hah, didn't notice the repo owner's profile pic before posting
2018-06-28T16:03:38 #rust-release <batmanaod-M> Anyway, I'm going to mention that I'm part of the rust-release team, but I will not make any claim that I speak for the group. However, the request may carry more weight if we make an "official" request from the whole release team. simulacrum, what do you think?
2018-06-28T16:04:28 #rust-release <simulacrum> hm, I don't know that we'd get anything useful back
2018-06-28T16:17:26 #rust-release <pietroalbini> batmanaod-M, it's probably way easier to implement a bot that does that for us rather than asking github support about it
2018-06-28T16:44:47 #rust-release <batmanaod-M> I had that thought, but I saw it was already requested so I figured I'd at least throw my +1 in there
2018-06-29T16:28:49 #rust-release <pietroalbini> stokhos, one tip: prefix all the messages with "ping from triage"
2018-06-29T16:30:04 #rust-release <pietroalbini> in the past there were random people pinging the authors when not needed, so we decided to say in all of our messages that we are triage
2018-06-29T16:30:43 #rust-release <steveklabnik> there's a pretty long history of that in rust too :)
2018-06-29T16:31:10 #rust-release <steveklabnik> https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/search?q=%22triage%3A+no+change%22&unscoped_q=%22triage%3A+no+change%22&type=Issues
2018-06-29T16:31:13 #rust-release <steveklabnik> hehe
2018-06-29T16:31:45 #rust-release <TimNN> “so we decided to say [...]" Is that written somewhere? (Because I don't think I have been doing that consistently)
2018-06-29T16:32:03 #rust-release <pietroalbini> TimNN, I think that was in the minutes of some meeting
2018-06-29T16:33:18 #rust-release <TimNN> Maybe we should add this to https://forge.rust-lang.org/triage-procedure.html ?
2018-06-29T16:34:02 #rust-release <pietroalbini> TimNN, 2018-02-20 infra meeting -- https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ras_Lrb-CE9VirHqO3V2in-k9kRi-QDj76MgPcDtVnQ/edit
2018-06-29T16:34:38 #rust-release <pietroalbini> TimNN, yeah, can you send a pr?
2018-06-29T16:34:47 #rust-release <TimNN> Btw, why does https://forge.rust-lang.org/pr-triage-procedure.html still exist? I've been working with an outdated script for who knows how long.
2018-06-29T16:35:01 #rust-release <TimNN> Yeah, later today / this weekend (on mobile right now).
2018-06-29T16:36:34 #rust-release <pietroalbini> https://mozilla.logbot.info/rust-infra/20180220#c14333213-c14333253
2018-06-29T16:37:27 #rust-release <pietroalbini> looking back, that change was approved with overwhelming support :D
2018-06-30T17:11:57 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, there was a talk about a 1.27.1 in the release blog post, is that still planned?
2018-06-30T17:12:29 #rust-release <simulacrum> pietroalbini: sort of? I think it may happen but there are no *concrete* plans right now
2018-06-30T17:13:39 #rust-release <pietroalbini> because in that case we probably should also backport https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/51828
2018-06-30T17:15:10 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, hmm, should I create stable-{nominated,accepted} labels to keep track of that?
2018-06-30T17:15:33 #rust-release <simulacrum> hm, seems like a good idea for that tracking to be codified
2018-06-30T17:19:51 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, ok, created the labels and applied them to the two prs
2018-06-30T17:19:59 #rust-release <simulacrum> thanks!
2018-06-30T17:20:22 #rust-release <pietroalbini> for the policy I'd say "the same as the beta ones, but approval is from the core team"
2018-06-30T17:46:18 #rust-release <kennytm> could we make `stable-nominated` a dark color like `beta-nominated`? the current color is very similar to the `T-*` labels :p
2018-06-30T19:33:26 #rust-release <pietroalbini> kennytm, better?
2018-06-30T19:33:53 #rust-release <kennytm> pietroalbini: +1
2018-07-02T20:07:36 #rust-release <Aaronepower> pietroalbini: Hey, why am I getting this error for approving the commit? https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/51997
2018-07-02T20:35:04 #rust-release <kennytm> Aaronepower: you need to be listed in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-central-station/blob/master/homu.toml.template to be able to r+, you may submit a PR to add yourself in
2018-07-02T20:35:31 #rust-release <kennytm> homu, rfcbot and highfive all have their own lists of team members, so 🤷‍♂️
2018-07-02T20:36:56 #rust-release <Aaronepower> kennytm: Thanks! I've done that now.
2018-07-02T20:37:36 #rust-release <kennytm> Aaronepower: np. (you should also remove yourself from the `try` list)
2018-07-03T17:10:21 #rust-release <pietroalbini> TimNN, you should also add S-inactive-closed to the PRs you close for inactivity ;)
2018-07-03T17:10:46 #rust-release <TimNN> Ah, sorry, thanks for reminding me, that slipped my mind
2018-07-03T17:13:48 #rust-release <pietroalbini> yeah, I forget too sometimes
2018-07-03T17:14:09 #rust-release <pietroalbini> but that label is going to be useful if we want to implement auto-reopen for those PRs
2018-07-04T19:01:23 #rust-release <pietroalbini> meeting time! simulacrum probably won't be able to be here on time today, so he asked me to run it
2018-07-04T19:01:55 #rust-release <stokhos> hi
2018-07-04T19:01:57 #rust-release <pietroalbini> Aaronepower, araz batmanaod-M centril jistone jkordish stokhos meeting o'clock!
2018-07-04T19:02:06 #rust-release <Aaronepower> o/
2018-07-04T19:02:13 #rust-release <jkordish> o/
2018-07-04T19:02:45 #rust-release <stokhos> o/
2018-07-04T19:04:42 #rust-release <pietroalbini> ok, let's get started -- agenda: https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Release-Team-Meeting-Agenda-gb8LJ6VkQxH9HKl1r9KFE
2018-07-04T19:05:20 #rust-release <pietroalbini> first item is pr triage - https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rustc-pr-tracking/
2018-07-04T19:06:12 #rust-release <pietroalbini> the number of PRs in review is going down, which is really nice, and for the blocked PRs there is a dedicated item later in the agenda
2018-07-04T19:06:42 #rust-release <pietroalbini> I wasn't able this week to do triage myself, any feedback from those who did it? (cc TimNN shep)
2018-07-04T19:08:06 #rust-release <pietroalbini> especially from stokhos, which I saw did some of it last week ;)
2018-07-04T19:09:02 #rust-release <stokhos> yes. I did some triage last friday
2018-07-04T19:09:18 #rust-release <stokhos> I didn't see any problem
2018-07-04T19:10:21 #rust-release <stokhos> there were 2 PRs that hadn't been commented for at least 15 days.
2018-07-04T19:10:47 #rust-release <pietroalbini> stokhos, do you remember which ones?
2018-07-04T19:10:50 #rust-release <stokhos> I labeled them with i-nominated
2018-07-04T19:11:07 #rust-release <pietroalbini> oh, ok, team review
2018-07-04T19:11:56 #rust-release <stokhos> I labeled 1 or 2 to team review
2018-07-04T19:12:04 #rust-release <pietroalbini> if there is still no review next week I'd say we ping the team leader
2018-07-04T19:12:14 #rust-release <stokhos> ok 
2018-07-04T19:13:46 #rust-release <pietroalbini> ok, great! moving on, there are no nominated issues this week, so the next item is the language of the release notes
2018-07-04T19:14:28 #rust-release <pietroalbini> there were a few comments in the last PR about stabilized vs stabilised, and both variants are present in the current notes
2018-07-04T19:14:40 #rust-release <Aaronepower> Not anymore.
2018-07-04T19:15:31 #rust-release <Aaronepower> I've removed all the most recent ones. It's now neutral language that says neither.
2018-07-04T19:16:11 #rust-release <pietroalbini> oh, I missed that
2018-07-04T19:16:33 #rust-release <pietroalbini> there are still a few instances of stabilised in the past notes though
2018-07-04T19:16:47 #rust-release <pietroalbini> should we stick with en-US or en-UK in the future?
2018-07-04T19:17:13 #rust-release <pietroalbini> (for context, iirc the rust docs uses en-US)
2018-07-04T19:17:26 #rust-release <jkordish> ^ then that is probably what we should use for conformity 
2018-07-04T19:17:32 #rust-release <jkordish> imho
2018-07-04T19:18:20 #rust-release <stokhos> I prefer en-US
2018-07-04T19:19:39 #rust-release <pietroalbini> yeah, I'd also prefer consistency across the rust documents, Aaronepower?
2018-07-04T19:19:49 #rust-release <Aaronepower> Yes sorry I have thoughts one sec.
2018-07-04T19:21:47 #rust-release <Aaronepower> I've been thinking about this since it was raised, and the difference I feel between this and rust docs is that rust docs is not written by an individual. The release notes is mainly written by me except when there is point releases. It's very hard for me to write in en-US as I've never written in this way. So what I think is best is just avoid the use of the words that differ, for example not using "Stabilised" and just saying "is
2018-07-04T19:21:47 #rust-release <Aaronepower>  now stable".
2018-07-04T19:23:29 #rust-release <pietroalbini> so, would you be ok with "let's avoid differences between US and UK whenever possible, and prefer US for consistency otherwise"?
2018-07-04T19:23:54 #rust-release <Aaronepower> Yeah.
2018-07-04T19:24:32 #rust-release <pietroalbini> ok, great. Aaronepower, could you send a PR to the forge writing this?
2018-07-04T19:25:10 #rust-release <Aaronepower> On it.
2018-07-04T19:27:37 #rust-release <pietroalbini> moving on, the last item is whether we should close PRs with S-blocked after a week (I think that was added by simulacrum)
2018-07-04T19:27:55 #rust-release <Aaronepower> blocked in this case by author?
2018-07-04T19:28:19 #rust-release <pietroalbini> blocked on other PRs, FCPs or RFCs
2018-07-04T19:28:42 #rust-release <Aaronepower> What's an example?
2018-07-04T19:29:27 #rust-release <pietroalbini> mostly everything in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+label%3AS-blocked+is%3Apr
2018-07-04T19:30:27 #rust-release <pietroalbini> the argument for closing those PRs is that there is no point in keeping them open if they're blocked
2018-07-04T19:30:27 #rust-release <Aaronepower> So why a week and as soon they become blocked?
2018-07-04T19:30:38 #rust-release <Aaronepower> and not as*
2018-07-04T19:31:36 #rust-release <pietroalbini> personally I'd split the discussion in PRs blocked by other PRs and PRs blocked by RFCs/external discussions
2018-07-04T19:32:11 #rust-release <pietroalbini> because if a PR is blocked by another PR it will be unblocked hopefully soon, but if a PR is blocked by an RFC... well... it will take some time :)
2018-07-04T19:33:05 #rust-release <pietroalbini> (pinging in shep and TimNN, if you can comment on this!)
2018-07-04T19:33:58 #rust-release <kennytm> {!gh 47291} is blocked by {!gh 50262} for 65 days ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2018-07-04T19:34:17 #rust-release <kennytm> https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/47291, https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/50262
2018-07-04T19:34:29 #rust-release <pietroalbini> kennytm, no bots here :P
2018-07-04T19:34:34 #rust-release <TimNN> I also noticed that some PRs stay blocked for a long time
2018-07-04T19:35:04 #rust-release <TimNN> I think that closing them while applying a label like S-closed-blocked would work
2018-07-04T19:35:32 #rust-release <Aaronepower> Yeah I think that's reasonable. For blocked on other PRs would maybe two weeks be enough to give people an appropriate amount of time? So there isn't a suddenly tight deadline on a author. 
2018-07-04T19:35:35 #rust-release <pietroalbini> so, closing PRs as soon as they're blocked, and then reopen them when they unlock?
2018-07-04T19:36:07 #rust-release <pietroalbini> (I agree with Aaronepower's two weeks idea)
2018-07-04T19:36:07 #rust-release <TimNN> Would we review S-closed-blocked PRs as part of triage? Or maybe once a week?
2018-07-04T19:36:22 #rust-release <TimNN> Or should we rely on authors to re-open once the PR is unblocked?
2018-07-04T19:36:52 #rust-release <pietroalbini> TimNN, ideally we would have a bot to automatically reopen those when the blocking PR is merged, but we don't have it now
2018-07-04T19:37:08 #rust-release <Aaronepower> Well elsewhere we usually ask the author to reopen when we close something don't we?
2018-07-04T19:37:14 #rust-release <TimNN> That would also only handle a subset of PRs
2018-07-04T19:37:28 #rust-release <pietroalbini> the problem with checking closed PRs during triage is that there are all the older ones that create noise
2018-07-04T19:37:31 #rust-release <TimNN> There are PRs blocked on WG-* discussions, for example
2018-07-04T19:37:42 #rust-release <kennytm> https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/51966 is blocked by https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=38047, i doubt a bot can handle it
2018-07-04T19:38:03 #rust-release <pietroalbini> in PRs blocked by discussion I'd say it's the author that has to move it forward
2018-07-04T19:38:26 #rust-release <pietroalbini> Aaronepower, at the moment only if the author is inactive for more that 2 weeks
2018-07-04T19:38:49 #rust-release <pietroalbini> and those usually aren't reopened (unless the author is a rust-lang member, from what I've seen)
2018-07-04T19:40:22 #rust-release <Aaronepower> I think that's due to the fact that GitHub only has a binary state for a PR. Closed in most projects means rejected.
2018-07-04T19:40:47 #rust-release <TimNN> Another point to consider: triaging S-blocked PRs takes much less time than other parts of triage
2018-07-04T19:41:00 #rust-release <TimNN> So keeping the current system doesn't add too much overhead
2018-07-04T19:41:45 #rust-release <pietroalbini> yeah, it's mostly a graph that looks bad from my point of view
2018-07-04T19:42:03 #rust-release <TimNN> Just remove S-blocked PRs from the graph :P
2018-07-04T19:42:18 #rust-release <Aaronepower> Which graph?
2018-07-04T19:42:23 #rust-release <pietroalbini> https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rustc-pr-tracking/
2018-07-04T19:42:44 #rust-release <Aaronepower> Ah ty
2018-07-04T19:43:24 #rust-release <pietroalbini> I'd say we close PRs blocked by WG discussions/RFCs, as those usually take months to unblock and the code rots anyway, but we keep the other ones open with the current triage policy
2018-07-04T19:43:29 #rust-release <pietroalbini> what do you think about that?
2018-07-04T19:44:43 #rust-release <TimNN> Sounds good, although I would add a bit of leeway to the instructions: If there are indications that a PR may be blocked long-term it should be closed (e.g. the llvm bug thing will probably also take a while)
2018-07-04T19:45:54 #rust-release <Aaronepower> Well does the LLVM upgrade need to close how badly does that code rot between upgrades?
2018-07-04T19:48:27 #rust-release <pietroalbini> no idea about that llvm upgrade, but if that's going to be blocked anyway for months let's just close it, there is no point in keeping it open
2018-07-04T19:50:13 #rust-release <Aaronepower> So to the back to the categorisation of the two types of PRs. Should externals also be on a deadline or just as soon as we realise it'll be a while?
2018-07-04T19:50:50 #rust-release <Aaronepower> externals being PRs dependent on external factors like LLVM, RFCs, or WG discussions.
2018-07-04T19:51:10 #rust-release <pietroalbini> I'd say as soon as possible
2018-07-04T19:51:31 #rust-release <Aaronepower> Yeah, I agree.
2018-07-04T19:51:54 #rust-release <pietroalbini> great
2018-07-04T19:52:28 #rust-release <pietroalbini> I don't know if I'll have too much time to update the forge, TimNN can you do that?
2018-07-04T19:53:37 #rust-release <TimNN> Yeah, I can open a PR tomorrow or on friday
2018-07-04T19:55:23 #rust-release <pietroalbini> ok, the agenda is done, anyone has something they want to talk about?
2018-07-04T19:57:11 #rust-release <Aaronepower> Hmm, I actually haven't looked at the forge for the release notes in a long time, a lot of the stuff has changed. Both in how I get the data and how rust does PRs. I don't think we really do "libs stabilisation" PRs anymore do we? Where a sweeping amount of std is stabilised.
2018-07-04T19:57:44 #rust-release <pietroalbini> I haven't see those in a while
2018-07-04T19:58:08 #rust-release <pietroalbini> if you have time to update the stale parts it would be awesome
2018-07-04T19:58:13 #rust-release <Aaronepower> Should I rewrite the whole thing?
2018-07-04T19:58:32 #rust-release <pietroalbini> if everything changed... :P
2018-07-04T19:58:58 #rust-release <pietroalbini> generally, I don't think anyone has a problem with more up to date docs ;)
2018-07-04T19:58:58 #rust-release <Aaronepower> Well I don't do the git log or github approach anymore.
2018-07-04T19:59:32 #rust-release <Aaronepower> I have a program that uses GitHub's GraphQL library to fetch all the PRs in a release cycle.
2018-07-04T20:01:41 #rust-release <pietroalbini> can you publish it somewhere and link it in the forge?
2018-07-04T20:02:17 #rust-release <Aaronepower> Yeah I'll publish on my GitHub.
2018-07-04T20:02:59 #rust-release <Aaronepower> Luckily I rewrote it at RustFest Paris to be in Rust otherwise the instructions would be "How to install Perl6." :p
2018-07-04T20:03:27 #rust-release <pietroalbini> lol
2018-07-04T20:04:17 #rust-release <pietroalbini> the time is over, and I there was nothing else to say, so
2018-07-04T20:04:18 #rust-release <pietroalbini> \o
2018-07-04T20:04:26 #rust-release <jkordish> \o
2018-07-04T20:04:36 #rust-release <Aaronepower> \o
2018-07-04T20:05:09 #rust-release <stokhos> \o
2018-07-04T20:05:20 #rust-release <TimNN> \o
2018-07-07T13:04:08 #rust-release <Aaronepower> Put up the updated release notes process. https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rust-forge/pull/146
2018-07-07T13:12:59 #rust-release <pietroalbini> great, thanks!
2018-07-07T13:14:07 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, should we move tools like Aaronepower's relnotes (if they're OK with that, obviously) or your tool to analyze crater reports to the rust-ops GitHub org?
2018-07-07T14:05:48 #rust-release <simulacrum> I think that's a great idea!
2018-07-07T14:13:23 #rust-release <Aaronepower> Yeah, I'm fine with it being there.
2018-07-08T19:23:45 #rust-release <TimNN> PR with the S-blocked updates: https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rust-forge/pull/147
2018-07-08T19:42:54 #rust-release <pietroalbini> TimNN, thanks!
2018-07-08T19:48:24 #rust-release <TimNN> No problem :) I've created the label and merged the PR.
2018-07-10T14:03:48 #rust-release <simulacrum> Will kick off release in a few minutes, but it's expected to take ~3 hours today as last time
2018-07-10T14:09:17 #rust-release <steveklabnik> woot
2018-07-10T14:24:38 #rust-release <simulacrum> steveklabnik: Anyway, LLVM is 10% done building so I think in about 1.5 hours I'll push tag for thanks -- does that work for you?
2018-07-10T14:42:47 #rust-release <steveklabnik> sounds great
2018-07-10T15:05:30 #rust-release <simulacrum> 53% done with LLVM
2018-07-10T15:05:35 #rust-release <steveklabnik> nice
2018-07-10T15:28:24 #rust-release <simulacrum> 80%...
2018-07-10T15:45:42 #rust-release <simulacrum> LLVM finished, pushing website
2018-07-10T15:45:55 #rust-release <steveklabnik> nice
2018-07-10T15:46:07 #rust-release <steveklabnik> let me know when the tag is up :D <3
2018-07-10T15:47:24 #rust-release <simulacrum> steveklabnik: Tag is up
2018-07-10T15:47:36 #rust-release <steveklabnik> thanks

2018-07-10T15:47:46 #rust-release <steveklabnik> ?
2018-07-10T15:47:51 #rust-release <simulacrum> not on master
2018-07-10T15:48:06 #rust-release <simulacrum> I was waiting for a the 28 release notes to land so we didn't have to rebase, soon though
2018-07-10T15:48:09 #rust-release <steveklabnik> ah cool
2018-07-10T15:48:13 #rust-release <steveklabnik> i will link to the branch then
2018-07-10T15:48:42 #rust-release <simulacrum> steveklabnik: also, r? https://github.com/rust-lang/blog.rust-lang.org/pull/260 (CVE # inclusion)
2018-07-10T15:49:35 #rust-release <steveklabnik> merged
2018-07-10T15:49:47 #rust-release <steveklabnik> thanks is recompiling, heh
2018-07-10T15:56:27 #rust-release <steveklabnik> https://thanks.rust-lang.org/rust/1.27.1
2018-07-10T15:58:03 #rust-release <simulacrum> syncing docs...
2018-07-10T16:11:43 #rust-release <steveklabnik> heh, website is now showing and people are asking about it
2018-07-10T16:12:42 #rust-release <simulacrum> we might want to switch website to a later step
2018-07-10T16:12:53 #rust-release <steveklabnik> yeah, sometimes it takes longer
2018-07-10T16:14:08 #rust-release <simulacrum> I think about another ~10 minutes
2018-07-10T16:14:16 #rust-release <steveklabnik> roger
2018-07-10T16:20:06 #rust-release <simulacrum> steveklabnik: release is made
2018-07-10T16:20:09 #rust-release <simulacrum> blog merged
2018-07-10T16:23:32 #rust-release <steveklabnik> yay
2018-07-10T16:23:38 #rust-release <steveklabnik> seeing the code
2018-07-10T18:15:24 #rust-release <steveklabnik> 18:14 < nilset> i found this bug on beta and nightly, and it now seems to also be in 1.27.1 https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/52213
2018-07-10T18:15:27 #rust-release <steveklabnik> 18:14 < nilset> the code correctly fails to compile on 1.27.0
2018-07-10T18:15:30 #rust-release <steveklabnik> 18:15 < nilset> but in 1.27.1 it happily compiles a safe rust segfault
2018-07-10T20:47:59 #rust-release <pietroalbini> oh, great :/
2018-07-11T19:01:24 #rust-release <simulacrum> o/

2018-07-11T19:06:04 #rust-release <simulacrum> okay, starting off with PR triage
2018-07-11T19:07:00 #rust-release <simulacrum> It looks like overall PR count has started to go down over the past week mostly due to review state shrinking I think
2018-07-11T19:07:24 #rust-release <pietroalbini> yeah, and we started to close some blocked PRs
2018-07-11T19:09:10 #rust-release <simulacrum> I think there was some discussion about the blocked PR policy at some point? Mind giving a quick rundown?
2018-07-11T19:09:22 #rust-release <simulacrum> (This might've been last meeting?)
2018-07-11T19:09:29 #rust-release <pietroalbini> yeah, we discussed it last meeting
2018-07-11T19:09:37 #rust-release <simulacrum> okay, I'll read logs then
2018-07-11T19:09:58 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, TimNN sent a PR to the forge with the changes, that might be faster to read
2018-07-11T19:10:27 #rust-release <simulacrum> Okay, great! Looks reasonable to me.
2018-07-11T19:11:00 #rust-release <simulacrum> for those interested: https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rust-forge/pull/147
2018-07-11T19:11:43 #rust-release <simulacrum> Okay, I think that's all I have for PR triage -- pietroalbini, anything else to bring up?
2018-07-11T19:11:49 #rust-release <simulacrum> cc shep as well
2018-07-11T19:12:23 #rust-release <pietroalbini> now that more people are doing it it takes less time :D
2018-07-11T19:13:24 #rust-release <pietroalbini> nothing else I think
2018-07-11T19:13:44 #rust-release <simulacrum> Okay, there are no nominated issues for this week
2018-07-11T19:14:27 #rust-release <simulacrum> 1.27.2 release is the next topic
2018-07-11T19:16:38 #rust-release <simulacrum> We'll be discussing this more in the core team meeting tomorrow, but the gist is that someone found (yet another) hole introduced in the match bindings
2018-07-11T19:17:00 #rust-release <simulacrum> er, math ergonomics
2018-07-11T19:17:11 #rust-release <simulacrum> How do we feel about making another release to patch that hole? I'm personally leaning towards just doing it but I also somewhat want to stem the tide here
2018-07-11T19:19:39 #rust-release <simulacrum> <assumes no one has any feelings>
2018-07-11T19:19:40 #rust-release <pietroalbini> well, this bug seems to be pretty bad, there were two different reports about it
2018-07-11T19:20:09 #rust-release <simulacrum> Right, that's part of why I lean towards making the additional patch release
2018-07-11T19:20:20 #rust-release <pietroalbini> the worry is that we're having a bunch of those
2018-07-11T19:21:20 #rust-release <simulacrum> Yes -- I get the impression from compiler team that we don't have a good way to stem the slow bleeding here without NLL, and that's at least a month out or so
2018-07-11T19:21:39 #rust-release <pietroalbini> I'm thinking about some ways to catch those before they ship
2018-07-11T19:22:15 #rust-release <pietroalbini> unfortunately I don't think those bugs could have been catched by crater, unless some crate was erroring out and got fixed by the bug
2018-07-11T19:23:00 #rust-release <simulacrum> I think the problem here is that many of these are holes exposed by match ergonomics, and to catch them we'd need to fuzz the compiler or something ... maybe against NLL
2018-07-11T19:23:01 #rust-release <simulacrum> But generally that seems hard
2018-07-11T19:23:25 #rust-release <pietroalbini> and surely too slow for a point release
2018-07-11T19:23:29 #rust-release <simulacrum> Right, yeah
2018-07-11T19:24:17 #rust-release <pietroalbini> hmm
2018-07-11T19:24:23 #rust-release <stokhos> what are cons against a patch release?
2018-07-11T19:24:38 #rust-release <simulacrum> stokhos: Mostly community/world pushback of "oh no so many patch releases"
2018-07-11T19:25:13 #rust-release <stokhos> ok
2018-07-11T19:25:46 #rust-release <stokhos> that
2018-07-11T19:25:55 #rust-release <pietroalbini> if most of the patch releases since 1.26 have been caused by the borrowck, could we consider freezing the current implementation until NLL lands?
2018-07-11T19:25:55 #rust-release <stokhos> is so trivial in my opinion
2018-07-11T19:26:20 #rust-release <simulacrum> pietroalbini: The current implementation has been frozen -- it's effectively unmaintainable, which is part of the problem I believe
2018-07-11T19:27:35 #rust-release <simulacrum> okay, so I think the consensus we have is that we don't have a good answer here, but generally think that a patch release is a good idea
2018-07-11T19:28:26 #rust-release <jkordish> I'd agree with that
2018-07-11T19:28:31 #rust-release <pietroalbini> +1
2018-07-11T19:28:34 #rust-release <stokhos> +1
2018-07-11T19:29:20 #rust-release <simulacrum> okay, so the last item here is the stable-nominated/stable-accepted tags
2018-07-11T19:30:17 #rust-release <pietroalbini> the one in the meeting doc? that was just a link for the PR we were talking about
2018-07-11T19:30:22 #rust-release <simulacrum> basically: just be aware of these, feel free to nominate if you feel strongly
2018-07-11T19:30:40 #rust-release <simulacrum> (couldn't remember if we had mentioned this before)
2018-07-11T19:31:44 #rust-release <simulacrum> anyway, that's all I have -- we can close the meeting here unless anyone has anything else?
2018-07-11T19:34:35 #rust-release <simulacrum> \o -- thanks everyone!
2018-07-11T19:34:40 #rust-release <jkordish> \o
2018-07-11T19:34:46 #rust-release <pietroalbini> \o
2018-07-11T19:35:17 #rust-release <stokhos> \0
2018-07-12T16:48:16 #rust-release <ishitatsuyuki> What's the policy on releasing a point release or not, for a soundness hole?
2018-07-12T16:49:33 #rust-release <pietroalbini> ishitatsuyuki, the final decision on a point release is from the core team, not the release team
2018-07-12T16:49:58 #rust-release <ishitatsuyuki> hmm ok
2018-07-12T16:50:10 #rust-release <steveklabnik> ishitatsuyuki: we consider how close we are to the next release, how big of an impact we think it has, how complex the backport would be
2018-07-12T16:50:32 #rust-release <ishitatsuyuki> That sounds a good guideline
2018-07-13T17:36:28 #rust-release <pietroalbini> that was fast
2018-07-15T18:39:08 #rust-release <pietroalbini> (sorry for the spam! -- and technically I'm the one who should know how to use craterbot...)
2018-07-16T17:04:31 #rust-release <pietroalbini> sorry, missed triage today, I'm really busy with exams these days :(
2018-07-18T19:04:40 #rust-release <simulacrum> o/

2018-07-18T19:08:30 #rust-release <shep> o/
2018-07-18T19:08:31 #rust-release <simulacrum> pietroalbini: Want to run us through PR triage?
2018-07-18T19:09:46 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, hmm, this week I had to skip triage, maybe someone else knows better about the state of the pr queue :)
2018-07-18T19:10:38 #rust-release <simulacrum> shep perhaps?
2018-07-18T19:10:46 #rust-release <pietroalbini> (had an uni exam on mon, tue, today and one tomorrow :/)
2018-07-18T19:10:59 #rust-release <TimNN> I did some yesterday, but didn't get through all the PRs / categories
2018-07-18T19:11:23 #rust-release <shep> I didn't do it on Friday because someone else claimed that day ;-)
2018-07-18T19:11:41 #rust-release <shep> I see that there are still PRs though
2018-07-18T19:11:46 #rust-release <shep> so that's good
2018-07-18T19:11:55 #rust-release <stokhos> emm, I didn''t do it on friday too.
2018-07-18T19:12:33 #rust-release <stokhos> attended a meeting 
2018-07-18T19:13:50 #rust-release <simulacrum> hm, okay, we can just skip it for this week
2018-07-18T19:14:07 #rust-release <simulacrum> no nominated issues (well, not really)
2018-07-18T19:15:53 #rust-release <simulacrum> 1.27.2 update will happen on Friday
2018-07-18T19:16:09 #rust-release <simulacrum> and Aaronepower also made the "State of Rust" announcement
2018-07-18T19:18:25 #rust-release <pietroalbini> is the forge the best place for the state of rust? there is a bit of friction to update it
2018-07-18T19:18:46 #rust-release <simulacrum> Do we have better ideas?
2018-07-18T19:19:05 #rust-release <pietroalbini> a github project with text-only cards?
2018-07-18T19:19:31 #rust-release <pietroalbini> that way everyone with labels access to the repo can update it
2018-07-18T19:19:52 #rust-release <simulacrum> That does seem relatively reasonable, but the one project per issue limitation is then unfortunate
2018-07-18T19:20:03 #rust-release <simulacrum> Although if they're text-only I guess they aren't directly associated?
2018-07-18T19:20:08 #rust-release <pietroalbini> yep
2018-07-18T19:20:38 #rust-release <simulacrum> Though generally speaking presumably tracking issues won't be associated with anything but this project, right?
2018-07-18T19:20:46 #rust-release <simulacrum> So presumably we could do that too...
2018-07-18T19:21:20 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, something like https://github.com/pietroalbini/rust/projects/1
2018-07-18T19:22:00 #rust-release <simulacrum> that does look quite nice
2018-07-18T19:22:14 #rust-release <simulacrum> Especially if we can get a bot or something to auto-move cards through it, but that's not necessary
2018-07-18T19:23:49 #rust-release <simulacrum> Okay, I'll look into making that change or getting Aaronepower to do so
2018-07-18T19:23:50 #rust-release <simulacrum> That's all I believe for today's agenda unless anyone has anything else?
2018-07-18T19:25:20 #rust-release <simulacrum> Alright, let's call it here, thanks everyone!
2018-07-18T19:25:23 #rust-release <pietroalbini> (changed the layout of the card in the project)
2018-07-18T19:25:24 #rust-release <pietroalbini> o/
2018-07-18T19:25:28 #rust-release <pietroalbini> *\o
2018-07-18T19:25:51 #rust-release <stokhos> o/
2018-07-18T19:26:38 #rust-release <TimNN> \o
2018-07-18T19:56:11 #rust-release <Aaronepower> simulacrum: Where should that project be? On the rust repo itself?
2018-07-18T19:56:33 #rust-release <simulacrum> Yes, I think so
2018-07-18T19:57:42 #rust-release <Aaronepower> Alright, I'll start working on that over the next week.
2018-07-18T20:00:54 #rust-release <simulacrum> thanks!
2018-07-19T15:26:42 #rust-release <pietroalbini> no new regressions in the beta crater run
2018-07-19T15:27:11 #rust-release <kennytm> \o/
2018-07-20T13:06:24 #rust-release <simulacrum> Will kickoff release in ~30 minutes, expectation is that it'll take ~2 hours due to requiring an LLVM build
2018-07-20T13:26:34 #rust-release <simulacrum> Actually, 30 minutes from now I think
2018-07-20T13:52:48 #rust-release <simulacrum> Okay, promotion kicked off
2018-07-21T13:49:49 #rust-release <Aaronepower> Hey, I've created a GitHub project version of the State of Rust. https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/projects/8
2018-07-21T23:30:55 #rust-release <simulacrum> Aaronepower: Looks great! Now all we need is something that'll export this to markdown/html/some other format so we can put it up on the forge
2018-07-21T23:31:10 #rust-release <simulacrum> Otherwise it looks like the search is terrible (as can be expected for github)
2018-07-25T19:00:13 #rust-release <simulacrum> o/
2018-07-25T19:00:18 #rust-release <pietroalbini> o/
2018-07-25T19:00:38 #rust-release <jkordish> o/
2018-07-25T19:02:26 #rust-release <simulacrum> centril, batmanaod-M, pramodpsb, Aaronepower, araz, stokhos: meeting
2018-07-25T19:02:34 #rust-release <Aaronepower> o/
2018-07-25T19:02:49 #rust-release <centril> o/
2018-07-25T19:03:08 #rust-release <stokhos> o/
2018-07-25T19:03:46 #rust-release <simulacrum> Okay, starting off with PR triage: https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rustc-pr-tracking/
2018-07-25T19:04:10 #rust-release <simulacrum> Two notes here: bors is currently closed because we discovered that Travis lost/forgot our macOS images/testers
2018-07-25T19:04:19 #rust-release <simulacrum> er, treeclosed
2018-07-25T19:04:56 #rust-release <araz> o/
2018-07-25T19:04:59 #rust-release <simulacrum> Also, earlier today we were unable to queue any Travis builds so that also may have slowed the queue down somewhat (missed around 6 hours at least)
2018-07-25T19:05:32 #rust-release <simulacrum> I believe the PR triage has been going decently, TimNN, shep, pietroalbini, anyone want to give an update?
2018-07-25T19:05:50 #rust-release <pietroalbini> as far as reviews goes everything seems ok, the number of watiting-on-review is down (to ~40)
2018-07-25T19:07:06 #rust-release <simulacrum> Okay, that's good
2018-07-25T19:07:53 #rust-release <simulacrum> Okay, let's move on -- I think PR triage state is good
2018-07-25T19:08:00 #rust-release <jistone> o/
2018-07-25T19:08:09 #rust-release <simulacrum> No nominated issues
2018-07-25T19:08:27 #rust-release <simulacrum> https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/projects/6 is the beta regressions board
2018-07-25T19:08:32 #rust-release <stokhos> I nominated 2 issues
2018-07-25T19:08:39 #rust-release <stokhos> last friday
2018-07-25T19:08:54 #rust-release <pietroalbini> stokhos, for the release team?
2018-07-25T19:08:59 #rust-release <simulacrum> hm, for T-release?
2018-07-25T19:09:17 #rust-release <stokhos> what's the difference?
2018-07-25T19:09:32 #rust-release <simulacrum> Well, did you tag with T-release?
2018-07-25T19:09:39 #rust-release <stokhos> no
2018-07-25T19:09:41 #rust-release <stokhos> i didn't
2018-07-25T19:09:52 #rust-release <pietroalbini> stokhos, I-nominated is for a specific team
2018-07-25T19:09:55 #rust-release <simulacrum> Without that it's hard to find things
2018-07-25T19:10:05 #rust-release <simulacrum> Do you happen to recall what the issues were?
2018-07-25T19:10:08 #rust-release <pietroalbini> so for example, if there is T-compiler and I-nominated, the issue is nominated for the compiler team
2018-07-25T19:10:17 #rust-release <jistone> I didn't file an issue for it, but pr 52709 addresses a small regression
2018-07-25T19:10:25 #rust-release <centril> stokhos: if you can link the issues here :)
2018-07-25T19:10:32 #rust-release <stokhos> let me try to find it
2018-07-25T19:10:52 #rust-release <stokhos> *them
2018-07-25T19:11:00 #rust-release <simulacrum> jistone: We should be able to land it before beta promotion, I think acrichto's flying in today
2018-07-25T19:11:09 #rust-release <jistone> simulacrum, ok thanks
2018-07-25T19:13:00 #rust-release <simulacrum> okay, let's circle back to stokhos's issues if we find them
2018-07-25T19:13:23 #rust-release <simulacrum> note that 1.28 release is next week, as is the target date for second preview of the edition
2018-07-25T19:13:57 #rust-release <simulacrum> There's also now a repository to submit feature requests for the infra team (e.g., bots, hosting, etc) https://github.com/rust-ops/requests/issues
2018-07-25T19:14:25 #rust-release <stokhos> https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/51384
2018-07-25T19:14:26 #rust-release <simulacrum> Basically the idea here is that the bots we've discussed in the past to auto-move issues and such should be detailed on an issue here so we can track it 
2018-07-25T19:14:29 #rust-release <stokhos> this one
2018-07-25T19:15:02 #rust-release <pietroalbini> stokhos, that's nominated for the rustdoc team, not release :)
2018-07-25T19:15:10 #rust-release <stokhos> ok
2018-07-25T19:15:22 #rust-release <pietroalbini> usually I-nominated goes along with the relevant team, so they can look at it
2018-07-25T19:15:24 #rust-release <stokhos> I think the other one is for doc team 
2018-07-25T19:15:30 #rust-release <stokhos> ok
2018-07-25T19:15:32 #rust-release <stokhos> got it
2018-07-25T19:15:40 #rust-release <centril> re. bots & infra team; rfcbot is currently hosted at: https://github.com/anp/rfcbot-rs and I'm basically the only one working on it... maybe we should move it over and so on..
2018-07-25T19:15:53 #rust-release <simulacrum> centril: Can you open an issue on rust-ops?
2018-07-25T19:16:04 #rust-release <centril> sure
2018-07-25T19:16:06 #rust-release <simulacrum> (ideally with details as to hosting requirements)
2018-07-25T19:16:16 #rust-release <simulacrum> e.g. if it needs nodejs or ruby or just Rust + Internet
2018-07-25T19:16:18 #rust-release <centril> simulacrum: I'll cc anp since they own the bot
2018-07-25T19:16:38 #rust-release <simulacrum> Okay, so stokhos do you think we need to discuss those PR(s) here?
2018-07-25T19:16:39 #rust-release <centril> simulacrum: mostly rocket.rs + postgres
2018-07-25T19:17:02 #rust-release <stokhos> no i dont think so
2018-07-25T19:17:45 #rust-release <stokhos> just no one has worked on those two a long time
2018-07-25T19:18:16 #rust-release <simulacrum> We can probably mark them as S-blocked or waiting-on-team if they're in need of outside feedback
2018-07-25T19:18:46 #rust-release <stokhos> ok
2018-07-25T19:18:57 #rust-release <pietroalbini> I think those PRs are just waiting to be reviewed, so I-nominated should hopefully make the team notice them
2018-07-25T19:19:37 #rust-release <centril> simulacrum: https://github.com/rust-ops/requests/issues/1
2018-07-25T19:19:39 #rust-release <simulacrum> Yeah, that's my impression too
2018-07-25T19:19:58 #rust-release <simulacrum> Okay, I think that's all I have for today -- any other items that I missed/forgot about?
2018-07-25T19:20:38 #rust-release <centril> I scanned through the State of Rust project and there were a bunch of tracking issues for RFCs missing
2018-07-25T19:21:33 #rust-release <simulacrum> Do we know if they're actually missing or just not on the page?
2018-07-25T19:21:51 #rust-release <simulacrum> or is this the GH project (which we should actually link to from the page I guess)
2018-07-25T19:21:55 #rust-release <centril> simulacrum: not on the project page; I know they have tracking issues cause I made them
2018-07-25T19:22:10 #rust-release <centril> not on forge either I think
2018-07-25T19:22:39 #rust-release <simulacrum> Okay, maybe you can talk to Aaronepower -- state of rust has been their project :)
2018-07-25T19:22:55 #rust-release <centril> aight
2018-07-25T19:23:33 #rust-release <centril> Aaronepower: is the state of rust page automated somehow or have you filled in this manually?
2018-07-25T19:23:34 #rust-release <pietroalbini> also, while I was investigating the macos disaster today I noticed we stopped shipping binaries for a few tier 2 platforms
2018-07-25T19:23:46 #rust-release <Aaronepower> centril: Did you check it since when it was first published? As the scraper I used to get the issues missed the first two pages and I have since added them.
2018-07-25T19:24:12 #rust-release <simulacrum> pietroalbini: Probably best to file issue(s) - I'm not sure that we guarantee anything but it'd be good to at least be aware of it
2018-07-25T19:24:21 #rust-release <centril> Aaronepower: I checked the project page during the meeting
2018-07-25T19:24:33 #rust-release <simulacrum> Generally speaking it feels like we should have some sort of bot / checker that would make sure we're running what we expect
2018-07-25T19:24:50 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, in the forge it says we guarantee to have builds, so I though they should also be on rustup
2018-07-25T19:24:59 #rust-release <pietroalbini> https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/52686#issuecomment-407672796 <-- the missing platforms
2018-07-25T19:25:09 #rust-release <Aaronepower> centril: Are the missing issues marked B-unstable? That's the only issues in there at the moment.
2018-07-25T19:25:11 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, T-infra or T-release?
2018-07-25T19:25:29 #rust-release <centril> Aaronepower: B-RFC-Approved iirc
2018-07-25T19:26:02 #rust-release <simulacrum> pietroalbini: T-infra
2018-07-25T19:26:24 #rust-release <centril> https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/50512  also has the wrong team; it says lang on state-of-rust.html but it is libs
2018-07-25T19:26:24 #rust-release <Aaronepower> centril: Ah, yeah that'd be why. I'll have a look at those issues and added them to the project.
2018-07-25T19:26:44 #rust-release <pietroalbini> Aaronepower, maybe we can setup a redirect from the forge to the project?
2018-07-25T19:27:14 #rust-release <centril> Aaronepower: ideally everything labeled C-tracking-issue should be there
2018-07-25T19:27:27 #rust-release <Aaronepower> Yeah, I actually wanted to bring that up as what to do now with GitHub Project and the forge page?
2018-07-25T19:27:49 #rust-release <simulacrum> I believe the best solution might be to short-term link to the GH project from forge
2018-07-25T19:27:58 #rust-release <pietroalbini> Aaronepower, probably a js location.href with an html link for those without js enabled?
2018-07-25T19:27:59 #rust-release <simulacrum> Eventually we can probably generate HTML onto the forge
2018-07-25T19:28:28 #rust-release <centril> do you automate the contents of the project board as well or is that done by hand?
2018-07-25T19:28:59 #rust-release <simulacrum> I believe it's all done by hand for now
2018-07-25T19:29:00 #rust-release <simulacrum> I hope to have a triage bot that can at least enqueue things for human eyes
2018-07-25T19:29:30 #rust-release <centril> simulacrum: maybe this can be integrated into rfcbot, since rfcbot already handles FCPs and such
2018-07-25T19:29:39 #rust-release <simulacrum> hm, seems interesting, yes
2018-07-25T19:29:46 #rust-release <Aaronepower> centril: What do you mean by automate? The project board was generated by taking the forge table, using a vim macro to convert it all into the new format and manually copy and pasting into the appropriate column.
2018-07-25T19:29:47 #rust-release <centril> and it already scrapes and has a bunch of info
2018-07-25T19:30:20 #rust-release <centril> Aaronepower: having a bot move around the issues on the project board and add them as needed when the status of the issues change
2018-07-25T19:30:30 #rust-release <simulacrum> Anyway, we can discuss (here/elsewhere), but I think we don't need everyone here -- so we can close the meeting here
2018-07-25T19:30:38 #rust-release <Aaronepower> Ah, all by hand.
2018-07-25T19:31:00 #rust-release <centril> Aaronepower: ah; that is bound to get out of date as new RFCs get added ;)
2018-07-25T19:31:06 #rust-release <centril> unless I remember to add it to the project board
2018-07-25T19:31:20 #rust-release <centril> but I'm forgetful ^,-
2018-07-25T19:31:52 #rust-release <centril> simulacrum: sure :)
2018-07-25T19:33:46 #rust-release <Aaronepower> I quite like the idea of integrating it with the rfcbot. We could have like `@rfcbot triage; Blocked on decision to stabilise`.
2018-07-25T19:34:53 #rust-release <centril> Aaronepower: yeah that sounds great and not too difficult to integrate; would just need another column in the SQL and the command parser is easily fixed
2018-07-25T19:35:42 #rust-release <centril> Aaronepower: can you file an issue on rfcbot's tracker?
2018-07-25T19:36:07 #rust-release <Aaronepower> centril: What do you mean by tracker? Just the GitHub page?
2018-07-25T19:36:16 #rust-release <centril> Aaronepower: yeah, the repo
2018-07-25T19:40:52 #rust-release <Aaronepower> centril: Done. 
2018-07-25T19:41:05 #rust-release <centril> Aaronepower: cool thanks
2018-07-31T07:32:45 #rust-release <SimonSapin> Hi release team. When is 1.29 beta being cut? I hope https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/52850 can land in time
2018-07-31T08:29:13 #rust-release <TimNN> FYI: I won't be able to do PR triage today, since I will be traveling most of the day
2018-07-31T08:43:04 #rust-release <pietroalbini> SimonSapin, well, it's not a big deal, it can be backported
2018-07-31T08:43:10 #rust-release <SimonSapin> ok
2018-07-31T15:54:36 #rust-release <pietroalbini> moved regressions around
2018-07-31T21:10:22 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, uh, we didn't backport the 1.27.2 release notes to 1.28/1.29-beta/master :/
2018-07-31T21:10:33 #rust-release <simulacrum> shrug
2018-07-31T21:10:43 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, I'll send a pr for master
2018-07-31T21:10:58 #rust-release <simulacrum> should probably do master and beta 
2018-07-31T21:11:32 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, master+beta-accepted, so it can be included in a beta rollup
2018-07-31T21:11:39 #rust-release <simulacrum> sure, yeah
2018-08-01T01:24:59 #rust-release <Havvy> The compatibility note on https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/RELEASES.md#version-1280-2018-08-02 is strictly false. You can still put implementions there. It's just that it's the same as not having the duplicated constraint.
2018-08-01T01:26:57 #rust-release <simulacrum> Havvy: Could you send a PR to update master?
2018-08-01T01:33:26 #rust-release <Havvy> !gh 52529

2018-08-01T19:04:16 #rust-release <Aaronepower> o/
2018-08-01T19:04:28 #rust-release <simulacrum> Alright, starting off with PR queue triage
2018-08-01T19:04:56 #rust-release <simulacrum> our bors queue was/is quite long due to Travis spurious failures
2018-08-01T19:05:09 #rust-release <simulacrum> but otherwise it looks like we have quite a few less PRs now (dropping overall)
2018-08-01T19:05:34 #rust-release <simulacrum> which is both good and bad -- but mostly good for us :)
2018-08-01T19:06:34 #rust-release <simulacrum> Anyone have anything they'd like to add?
2018-08-01T19:06:48 #rust-release <pietroalbini> yeah
2018-08-01T19:07:21 #rust-release <pietroalbini> I'll be on holiday from the 5th to the 24th, so it'd be nice if someone else can replace me for those weeks on monday :)
2018-08-01T19:07:38 #rust-release <simulacrum> anyone want to volunteer?
2018-08-01T19:08:55 #rust-release <simulacrum> hm, okay, I'll see if I can either find someone or might do it myself
2018-08-01T19:09:07 #rust-release <Aaronepower> I can.
2018-08-01T19:09:07 #rust-release <simulacrum> No nominated issues this week
2018-08-01T19:09:27 #rust-release <simulacrum> Aaronepower: oh, great! Feel free to ping me or pietroalbini after the meeting if you have any questions!
2018-08-01T19:09:48 #rust-release <simulacrum> The 1.28 release is tomorrow -- blog post PR is up: https://github.com/rust-lang/blog.rust-lang.org/pull/264
2018-08-01T19:10:55 #rust-release <simulacrum> Please review and leave feedback on the PR
2018-08-01T19:11:06 #rust-release <simulacrum> pietroalbini has also been doing great work with crater to get us ready for the edition release in early December
2018-08-01T19:12:05 #rust-release <simulacrum> Would someone be willing to write up a document summarizing the main efforts we're going for to test the edition? I can put together a rough sketch...
2018-08-01T19:13:30 #rust-release <Aaronepower> If no one wants to by next weeks meeting I can do after I finish with the 1.29 release notes.
2018-08-01T19:14:05 #rust-release <simulacrum> yeah, it's not super urgent
2018-08-01T19:14:36 #rust-release <simulacrum> Okay, we'll see what we can do -- this will be for internals, I'll put up a paper doc with some rough notes later this week (hopefully today)
2018-08-01T19:17:33 #rust-release <simulacrum> That's all I have for today -- any other thoughts?
2018-08-01T19:17:50 #rust-release <pietroalbini> about https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/sudden-realization-who-is-testing-2018-deps-in-2015-crates/8109, testing 2018 deps with 2015 crates with crater is going to be a pain
2018-08-01T19:19:03 #rust-release <pietroalbini> probably the best bet for that is to manually test a few popular crates
2018-08-01T19:19:13 #rust-release <simulacrum> I think we might go for a more limited approach, for example switching out just serde/failure/libc manually and testing the graph with that
2018-08-01T19:19:52 #rust-release <pietroalbini> a crater run with a few manually fixed crates should be doable though
2018-08-01T19:20:34 #rust-release <jistone> I could volunteer num-traits, useful since that tends to shows up in public APIs
2018-08-01T19:20:44 #rust-release <jistone> (though I wouldn't move the proper crate for a while)
2018-08-01T19:20:55 #rust-release <simulacrum> we could potentially do a long-ish crater run that randomly picked a crate with >20 reverse-deps and fixed it then ran crater
2018-08-01T19:22:14 #rust-release <jistone> num-traits also has a 0.1.43 that reexports from 0.2 -- so if we only try 2018 for 0.2, that could be an interesting testing mix
2018-08-01T19:22:32 #rust-release <simulacrum> yep, num-traits sounds like a good candidate and fairly fundamental to the ecosystem I imagine
2018-08-01T19:22:55 #rust-release <simulacrum> Anyway, let's close the meeting here (though we can keep discussing) -- don't want to keep people unnecessarily
2018-08-01T19:23:52 #rust-release <pietroalbini> if we manually migrate say like 10 core crates in a separate branch doing a crater run with them is really easy, all of the code to do that is already written for the lazy_static crater run (started earlier today)
2018-08-01T19:25:55 #rust-release <simulacrum> sounds like a good approach
2018-08-01T19:26:09 #rust-release <pietroalbini> I'll comment on the internals thread
2018-08-01T19:27:25 #rust-release <simulacrum> \o - thanks all1

2018-08-01T19:38:45 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, lol, bors applied the rollup status to {!gh 52841} thanks to https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/52841#issuecomment-409597952
2018-08-01T19:38:45 #rust-release <rustbot> [PR 52841] <open> resolve: Implement prelude search for macro paths, implement tool attributes <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/52841>
2018-08-01T19:39:14 #rust-release <pietroalbini> command parsing is a bit strange? :D
2018-08-01T19:39:16 #rust-release <simulacrum> bors is problematic like that
2018-08-01T19:39:24 #rust-release <simulacrum> very, uh, eager
2018-08-01T19:39:45 #rust-release <pietroalbini> (making a rollup atm)
2018-08-01T20:04:31 #rust-release <araz> Have you considered using discord instead of  irc for the rust release team meetings?
2018-08-01T20:05:51 #rust-release <araz> Since other teams are using it now, I was curious if we should as well
2018-08-01T21:52:55 #rust-release <simulacrum> We can discuss next week -- I didn't see much of a reason to move and not all teams have
2018-08-01T21:53:18 #rust-release <pietroalbini> personally I prefer irc to discord
2018-08-01T21:54:26 #rust-release <Havvy> Some have gone to discord and then back to irc
2018-08-01T21:54:55 #rust-release <pietroalbini> mostly because we can link logs around without requiring logging into discord
2018-08-02T14:55:29 #rust-release <simulacrum> Release started
2018-08-02T15:07:45 #rust-release <simulacrum> steveklabnik: If you could do a final check over for the blog that'd be great: https://github.com/rust-lang/blog.rust-lang.org/pull/264

2018-08-04T21:53:42 #rust-release <pietroalbini> I'll be off until the 25th (I might be able to get online on the 18th and 19th), o/

2018-08-08T19:02:53 #rust-release <simulacrum> centril, batmanaod-M, pramodpsb, Aaronepower: meeting
2018-08-08T19:03:03 #rust-release <simulacrum> stokhos and pietroalbini aren't here today I believe
2018-08-08T19:03:26 #rust-release <simulacrum> I believe PR triage has been going okay
2018-08-08T19:04:11 #rust-release <simulacrum> any concerns there?
2018-08-08T19:05:46 #rust-release <simulacrum> looks like no
2018-08-08T19:05:54 #rust-release <simulacrum> There are no nominated issues or beta nominations for us to look at
2018-08-08T19:06:12 #rust-release <simulacrum> the first crater run for beta finished yesterday, https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/53072#issuecomment-410954209
2018-08-08T19:06:26 #rust-release <simulacrum> Anyone want to volunteer to triage that? 
2018-08-08T19:06:50 #rust-release <simulacrum> there's docs here https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/crater/blob/master/docs/report-triage.md for the process
2018-08-08T19:07:21 #rust-release <jistone> I'm slammed this week, but might be able to do it early next week
2018-08-08T19:08:14 #rust-release <simulacrum> I'll try and take a look if no one else does at some point this week (might not get through all of them though)
2018-08-08T19:09:22 #rust-release <simulacrum> Okay, well, feel free to ping me if anyone decides to take a look
2018-08-08T19:09:31 #rust-release <simulacrum> There's a doodle poll up for rescheduling the meeting; https://doodle.com/poll/nbysr3beqrq84nvh
2018-08-08T19:09:52 #rust-release <simulacrum> You should have also gotten email about this, if not, please talk to me so we can figure that out after the meeting :)
2018-08-08T19:10:19 #rust-release <simulacrum> Please fill that out by August ~15th, so next week's meeting
2018-08-08T19:11:00 #rust-release <simulacrum> I think that's all I have for today; any other concerns or things people wanted to bring up?
2018-08-08T19:13:45 #rust-release <simulacrum> Okay, thanks everyone!

2018-08-15T19:07:49 #rust-release <simulacrum> okay, let's get started even though not many people are around
2018-08-15T19:07:50 #rust-release <simulacrum> I blame rustconf :)
2018-08-15T19:08:29 #rust-release <simulacrum> I think PR triage has been going well
2018-08-15T19:09:50 #rust-release <simulacrum> We have no nominated issues and no beta nominations
2018-08-15T19:11:10 #rust-release <simulacrum> Anyone have any concerns?
2018-08-15T19:12:43 #rust-release <stokhos> i have been quite buzy
2018-08-15T19:13:08 #rust-release <stokhos> didn't contribute much
2018-08-15T19:13:25 #rust-release <jkordish> ^ same. :(
2018-08-15T19:13:29 #rust-release <stokhos> but glad to hear that we are going well
2018-08-15T19:14:31 #rust-release <simulacrum> That's okay; no worries. 
2018-08-15T19:14:43 #rust-release <stokhos> :)
2018-08-15T19:14:46 #rust-release <simulacrum> Don't forget that the meeting time for next week is changing to I believe 3 hours later
2018-08-15T19:14:52 #rust-release <stokhos> ok
2018-08-15T19:15:01 #rust-release <simulacrum> I'll send out mail to that regard today
2018-08-15T19:16:12 #rust-release <simulacrum> I think that's all for today, so see you all next week, thanks!
2018-08-15T19:16:14 #rust-release <simulacrum> \o
2018-08-15T19:16:25 #rust-release <stokhos> o\

2018-08-15T19:17:14 #rust-release <jistone> I'll be at rustconf friday only, if we want to find each other
2018-08-15T19:17:30 #rust-release <jkordish> o/
2018-08-15T19:18:12 #rust-release <jkordish> i really wanted to go as i haven't been to Oregon in a year. didn't realize until to late :/
2018-08-15T19:18:57 #rust-release <jistone> lucky for me I live here :)
2018-08-15T19:20:02 #rust-release <jkordish> i'm so jealous
2018-08-15T19:20:44 #rust-release <jkordish> been looking at homes there to hopefully move. been in TX since 2006. but i work remote so it isn't **terrible**
2018-08-15T19:21:48 #rust-release <jistone> I was working remote in san jose before moving here
2018-08-15T19:21:57 #rust-release <jistone> that's a pretty easy cost-of-living change to justify
2018-08-15T19:22:26 #rust-release <stokhos> im still a student ..
2018-08-15T19:22:35 #rust-release <stokhos> my life sucks
2018-08-15T19:22:40 #rust-release <stokhos> :/
2018-08-15T19:24:21 #rust-release <jkordish> stokhos: nah. wait till you get a mortgage.
2018-08-15T19:24:23 #rust-release <jkordish> ;)
2018-08-15T19:24:45 #rust-release <stokhos> phd in economics
2018-08-15T19:25:02 #rust-release <stokhos> but more interest in math T.T
2018-08-15T19:25:41 #rust-release <jkordish>  very cool!
2018-08-15T19:25:59 #rust-release * misdreavus perks up at mention of texas
2018-08-15T19:26:36 #rust-release <stokhos> math is beautiful
2018-08-15T19:27:13 #rust-release <jkordish> misdreavus: you in texas?
2018-08-15T19:27:26 #rust-release <stokhos> me?
2018-08-15T19:27:27 #rust-release <misdreavus> jkordish: yeah, DFW. you?
2018-08-15T19:27:49 #rust-release <jkordish> misdreavus: outside of san antonio. boerne.
2018-08-15T19:27:53 #rust-release <misdreavus> nice!
2018-08-15T19:28:45 #rust-release <jkordish> i'm glad you think so. ;)
2018-08-15T19:28:50 #rust-release <misdreavus> lol
2018-08-15T19:29:19 #rust-release <misdreavus> i grew up in amarillo, my family moved there when i was 4-5, i think?
2018-08-15T19:29:41 #rust-release <misdreavus> i think a small part of me wants to figure out how to move back, but that's probably nostalgia speaking
2018-08-15T19:30:14 #rust-release <jkordish> misdreavus next time i'm in dallas i'll ping you.
2018-08-15T19:30:25 #rust-release <misdreavus> yeah!
2018-08-15T19:31:07 #rust-release <misdreavus> i'm over in irving so i could probably make it wherever in the metroplex
2018-08-15T19:31:30 #rust-release <misdreavus> it's close enough to the center
2018-08-15T19:31:40 #rust-release <misdreavus> (if you count fort worth)
2018-08-15T19:32:30 #rust-release <jkordish> you guys have some good tattoo places up there so i might have to.
2018-08-15T19:33:34 #rust-release <misdreavus> lol i didn't even know
2018-08-17T20:06:37 #rust-release <pietroalbini> hey! I'll be sort of home for until the 20th (then I'll be back the 25th)
2018-08-17T20:06:57 #rust-release <pietroalbini> is there anything urgent that needs to be done aidanhs simulacrum?
2018-08-19T02:06:25 #rust-release <simulacrum> not to my knowledge
2018-08-20T14:37:46 #rust-release <aidanhs> pietroalbini: not that I know of
2018-08-21T13:41:30 #rust-release <TimNN> FYI: I won't be able to do any PR triage today
2018-08-21T16:13:05 #rust-release <simulacrum> Aaronepower: Not sure if a PR has already been put up but might be good to add clippy-preview to 1.30 release notes
2018-08-21T16:13:22 #rust-release <simulacrum> er, 1.29 I think
2018-08-21T17:18:22 #rust-release <Aaronepower> simulacrum: Oh yeah I wanted to add it but I saw it was waiting on bors is it okay to add to the PR?
2018-08-21T17:27:43 #rust-release <kennytm> Aaronepower: if you wanna add to the PR, please wait until {!gh 53530}'s test has finished (either merged or failed) :)
2018-08-21T17:27:44 #rust-release <rustbot> [PR 53530] <open> Rollup of 17 pull requests <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/53530>
2018-08-21T17:28:19 #rust-release <Aaronepower> kennytm: Yeah, that's what I thought. Thanks!

2018-08-22T22:04:50 #rust-release <jkordish> o/
2018-08-22T22:06:35 #rust-release <simulacrum> I believe PR triage has been going relatively well -- anyone have any concerns?
2018-08-22T22:07:02 #rust-release <simulacrum> Bors queue is a little long but there's a rollup in progress that should half the length
2018-08-22T22:13:48 #rust-release <simulacrum> looks like nothing else for today, so unless there are other things from anyone we'll call it here
2018-08-22T22:20:07 #rust-release <simulacrum> Thanks all!
2018-08-22T22:20:08 #rust-release <simulacrum> \o

2018-08-25T08:59:07 #rust-release <pietroalbini> and I'm back \o/
2018-08-25T08:59:27 #rust-release <kennytm> o/
2018-08-26T19:36:56 #rust-release <pietroalbini> Aaronepower, hey! how was triage while I was away? :)
2018-08-26T19:37:59 #rust-release <Aaronepower> pietroalbini: PR triage was fine, I hope I did enough to cover both of us. 
2018-08-26T19:38:57 #rust-release <Aaronepower> There are some things I want to talk about about some of the triage though, but that's for the meeting.
2018-08-26T19:39:06 #rust-release <pietroalbini> Aaronepower, would you like to continue doing it? I'd prefer to focus more on crater, but if you can't I'll do it myself
2018-08-26T19:40:41 #rust-release <Aaronepower> pietroalbini: Well I currently have myself scheduled for an hour of issue, PR, and crater triage during a week. Maybe schedule is maybe about to go up in the air so I can't give any guarantees at the moment.
2018-08-26T19:41:15 #rust-release <pietroalbini> Aaronepower, ok, don't worry, I'll do it myself then
2018-08-26T19:41:42 #rust-release <pietroalbini> (btw, there is not really a point for crater triage nowadays ;) )
2018-08-26T19:42:09 #rust-release <Aaronepower> Yes that is most weeks, check crater see there's nothing.
2018-08-26T19:42:59 #rust-release <pietroalbini> Aaronepower, well, now crater is fully automated :P
2018-08-26T19:46:49 #rust-release <Aaronepower> Huh, I guess we should keep the triage document more up to date.
2018-08-26T19:47:03 #rust-release <pietroalbini> Aaronepower, added a point to the meeting agenda
2018-08-29T22:03:12 #rust-release <Aaronepower> simulacrum: Meeting?
2018-08-29T22:03:20 #rust-release <simulacrum> yes,
2018-08-29T22:03:22 #rust-release <simulacrum> o/
2018-08-29T22:03:41 #rust-release <jkordish> o/
2018-08-29T22:04:08 #rust-release <simulacrum> araz, batmanaod-M, jistone, pietroalbini, pramodpsb, stokhos: meeting
2018-08-29T22:04:23 #rust-release <stokhos> o/
2018-08-29T22:05:58 #rust-release <simulacrum> okay, let's start with PR triage update
2018-08-29T22:06:48 #rust-release <simulacrum> I believe things have been going well
2018-08-29T22:07:00 #rust-release <jistone> o/
2018-08-29T22:07:36 #rust-release <simulacrum> does anyone have any concerns?
2018-08-29T22:08:59 #rust-release <Aaronepower> Yes
2018-08-29T22:11:43 #rust-release <batmanaod-M> o/
2018-08-29T22:11:44 #rust-release <batmanaod-M> sorry
2018-08-29T22:12:13 #rust-release <Aaronepower> While doing PR triage on S-waiting-on-author I noticed there's quite a few people who's response is along the lines of "Soon TM" for multiple weeks. I feel like this is really just to keep the PR open for weeks to months when really it should be closed and reopened when they actually have the time to address it. I think triaging these PRs is waste of both our and the author's time. I don't know how to solve this without seeming
2018-08-29T22:12:14 #rust-release <Aaronepower>  passive aggressive though.
2018-08-29T22:12:47 #rust-release <simulacrum> hm, that does seem relatively common
2018-08-29T22:13:10 #rust-release <batmanaod-M> Do we have a policy (other than the guidelines for how to do PR triage) explaining to PR authors when/why PRs are closed?
2018-08-29T22:13:38 #rust-release <batmanaod-M> Even if it weren't commonly known that we had it, if it were posted somewhere we could link to it
2018-08-29T22:13:52 #rust-release <batmanaod-M> in fact, the high-five bot could even have a link in its text
2018-08-29T22:14:34 #rust-release <simulacrum> I don't think so, but the directions itself are good enough I think
2018-08-29T22:14:43 #rust-release <batmanaod-M> In particular, showing that (1) closure isn't necessarily permanent, or a sign that the PR is bad, and (2) this is a consistent policy, would be beneficial, I think.
2018-08-29T22:14:53 #rust-release <Aaronepower> batmanaod-M: That should probably be in CONTRIBUTING.md so that contributors see it.
2018-08-29T22:14:58 #rust-release <batmanaod-M> I don't agree. The directions are clearly oriented at team-members.
2018-08-29T22:15:00 #rust-release <batmanaod-M> ^ Yes
2018-08-29T22:15:13 #rust-release <batmanaod-M> to the idea that it should be in CONTRIBUTING
2018-08-29T22:15:32 #rust-release <simulacrum> Er, yeah, good enough to start -- we'd want to modify/copy it for contributing; that would be great if someone's willing to take that on?
2018-08-29T22:16:22 #rust-release <Aaronepower> simulacrum: I could do it in a hour or two.
2018-08-29T22:16:33 #rust-release <simulacrum> sure, nothing urgent 
2018-08-29T22:17:24 #rust-release <Aaronepower> simulacrum: What about those people who reply with no meaningful update, as I think the current policy is fine if you just reply.
2018-08-29T22:17:45 #rust-release <batmanaod-M> So we're on the same page, the idea is just to make sure that all the pertinent information from the triage guide is added to the `#pull-requests` section of CONTRIBUTING.md, and then add it to the `@rust-highfive` auto-comment text?
2018-08-29T22:17:53 #rust-release <simulacrum> batmanaod-M: Yes.
2018-08-29T22:18:24 #rust-release <batmanaod-M> So, once we have a policy, I would propose a slight modification: PRs with no new commits within (N) days are closed for inactivity.
2018-08-29T22:18:36 #rust-release <simulacrum> Hm, so I think it might be good to revise it a little that we give ~2 times of "soon" and then close
2018-08-29T22:18:38 #rust-release <batmanaod-M> (Assuming that there are outstanding review issues, obviously)
2018-08-29T22:18:45 #rust-release <batmanaod-M> ^ agree
2018-08-29T22:20:07 #rust-release <simulacrum> Aaronepower: Does that satisfy your concern?
2018-08-29T22:21:03 #rust-release <Aaronepower> So that'd be 28 days or about a month. When after that last "soon" should it be closed? Because I would worry that people feel like if we close immediately that they would feel like they said the wrong password and suddenly the gate has closed. Of course that's not the actual case, but i think that's easy to be the perception.
2018-08-29T22:24:08 #rust-release <simulacrum> So I'd presume we essentially close only after we've seen it be 'soon' for a week or so (whatever the normal period is)
2018-08-29T22:24:34 #rust-release <simulacrum> Anyway, we can iterate maybe in a PR -- let's move on to the other items
2018-08-29T22:24:54 #rust-release <simulacrum> no nominated issues or beta nominations for us to look at
2018-08-29T22:25:13 #rust-release <simulacrum> Aaronepower: Could you open a PR for Forge to finish the discussion on your concern?
2018-08-29T22:25:20 #rust-release <simulacrum> (doesn't need to be today of course)
2018-08-29T22:25:32 #rust-release <Aaronepower> simulacrum: A PR or an issue?
2018-08-29T22:25:55 #rust-release <simulacrum> Either works -- PR might be better if you have a concrete proposal that satisfies all of your concerns
2018-08-29T22:26:14 #rust-release <Aaronepower> An issue then 😅
2018-08-29T22:26:49 #rust-release <simulacrum> okay, pietroalbini brought up craterbot being ready for wider usage
2018-08-29T22:27:35 #rust-release <simulacrum> I think it's reasonable for it to essentially have the release, infra, compiler, and libs teams as having access -- maybe in a add-yourself manner -- does that sound reasonable to everyone?
2018-08-29T22:27:58 #rust-release <Aaronepower> +1
2018-08-29T22:28:22 #rust-release <jistone> that means anyone in those teams can trigger a crater run?
2018-08-29T22:28:40 #rust-release <simulacrum> yes
2018-08-29T22:28:43 #rust-release <jistone> +1
2018-08-29T22:30:09 #rust-release <simulacrum> okay, I think that's all for today, if you want access to craterbot please file a PR with rust-lang-nursery/crater 
2018-08-29T22:31:02 #rust-release <simulacrum> Thanks all! \o
2018-08-29T22:31:24 #rust-release <jistone> \o
2018-08-29T22:31:28 #rust-release <Aaronepower> \o
2018-08-29T22:31:35 #rust-release <stokhos> \o
2018-08-29T22:31:37 #rust-release <jkordish> \o
2018-08-30T08:46:31 #rust-release <pietroalbini> uh
2018-08-30T08:46:48 #rust-release <pietroalbini> somehow I misread the doodle and thought the meeting was on thu, sorry :(
2018-08-30T08:47:57 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, I'll add the whole teams to the ACL, it's simpler and doesn't require a redeploy when someone else wants access
2018-08-30T13:35:26 #rust-release <simulacrum> sounds good
2018-08-30T13:35:52 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, if you have access to the craterbot account, can you add the org:read scope to the token?
2018-08-30T13:36:02 #rust-release <simulacrum> hm, I don't think I do
2018-08-30T13:36:32 #rust-release <simulacrum> I need to run now but I'll check if I have access in ~2 hours
2018-08-30T13:36:40 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, sure, thanks!
2018-08-30T21:49:28 #rust-release <Aaronepower> Here's the PR for updating the policy on prolonged inactive PRs. https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rust-forge/pull/162
2018-08-30T21:50:12 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, maybe we should sync the release team in the nursery org to allow team mentions?
2018-08-30T21:58:10 #rust-release <batmanaod-M> Thank you @aaronepower!
2018-08-31T00:08:56 #rust-release <simulacrum> pietroalbini: Sounds like a good idea; it might be good to move the forge to rust-lang org as well
2018-08-31T00:09:13 #rust-release <simulacrum> I've been meaning to sync release team in general soon-ish
2018-09-05T19:00:59 #rust-release <TimNN> o/
2018-09-05T21:59:10 #rust-release <simulacrum> o/
2018-09-05T21:59:14 #rust-release <pietroalbini> o/
2018-09-05T21:59:15 #rust-release <jkordish> o/
2018-09-05T22:01:46 #rust-release <simulacrum> Aaronepower, araz, batmanaod-M, jistone, pramodpsb, stokhos, TimNN: meeting time!
2018-09-05T22:02:08 #rust-release <pietroalbini> (TimNN won't be able to attend)
2018-09-05T22:03:01 #rust-release <simulacrum> okay -- lets get started
2018-09-05T22:03:04 #rust-release <simulacrum> PR triage is first
2018-09-05T22:03:20 #rust-release <pietroalbini> sorry, missed this monday slot
2018-09-05T22:03:28 #rust-release <simulacrum> There's an item that we'll get back to from TimNN on reviewers not responding to pings....
2018-09-05T22:03:46 #rust-release <simulacrum> I think the general state looks okay based on graphs and bors queue etc; any concerns we should note?
2018-09-05T22:04:00 #rust-release <pietroalbini> also, it would be awesome if someone can replace me on mon
2018-09-05T22:04:10 #rust-release <batmanaod-M> o/
2018-09-05T22:04:29 #rust-release <pietroalbini> I'm going to have less time available and I'd like to dedicate it to beta stuff and crater
2018-09-05T22:05:19 #rust-release <simulacrum> anyone willing to replace pietroalbini on monday triage?
2018-09-05T22:06:30 #rust-release <simulacrum> okay, looks like that might just slip, which is fineish. If it becomes a problem we can revisit
2018-09-05T22:06:50 #rust-release <pietroalbini> hmm, if there is no one, maybe it's time to ask if external people are willing to help?
2018-09-05T22:06:54 #rust-release <batmanaod-M> I will do my best to do triage on Mondays. I'll make a note
2018-09-05T22:08:29 #rust-release <simulacrum> okay, thanks batmanaod-M!
2018-09-05T22:08:56 #rust-release <simulacrum> I think that's all for PR triage (we'll get back to TimNN's item later)
2018-09-05T22:08:57 #rust-release <simulacrum> no nominated issues
2018-09-05T22:08:58 #rust-release <simulacrum> no beta nominations
2018-09-05T22:09:02 #rust-release <stokhos> o/
2018-09-05T22:10:02 #rust-release <simulacrum> looks like the PR closure policy change has stagnated somewhat based on the push = broken PR problem https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rust-forge/pull/162
2018-09-05T22:10:59 #rust-release <simulacrum> I personally feel like that's not too big a problem in practice (just create a new PR if necessary)
2018-09-05T22:11:54 #rust-release <simulacrum> but we can continue discussion async I think on the PR
2018-09-05T22:12:25 #rust-release <batmanaod-M> I agree. Are we responsible for making an executive decision on this?
2018-09-05T22:12:54 #rust-release <batmanaod-M> Or rather, if consensus isn't reached, who "wins"?
2018-09-05T22:12:56 #rust-release <simulacrum> Yes, we're in charge of PR triage.
2018-09-05T22:13:19 #rust-release <simulacrum> Loosely, we'll "reach consensus" by majority
2018-09-05T22:13:46 #rust-release <pietroalbini> yeah, if mine is the only concern we can merge it
2018-09-05T22:14:12 #rust-release <simulacrum> I'll take a look later today hopefully and try to put up a comment or just merge it
2018-09-05T22:14:27 #rust-release <batmanaod-M> 👍
2018-09-05T22:16:04 #rust-release <simulacrum> Okay, so to summarize a little from the notes -- I believe the concern TimNN raised is that review can be slow and in some cases the pings don't seem to help immediately or at all
2018-09-05T22:17:07 #rust-release <simulacrum> Furthermore, in the cases where the PR author is 'well known' and perhaps working directly with the team on a given PR it's possible for PR iteration to happen outside of GH to an extent
2018-09-05T22:17:31 #rust-release <simulacrum> The policy change suggested here is to nominate PRs for team discussion if review hasn't happened
2018-09-05T22:17:44 #rust-release <simulacrum> This seems reasonable to me, I think
2018-09-05T22:17:49 #rust-release <pietroalbini> which is partially what we're doing right now
2018-09-05T22:18:08 #rust-release <simulacrum> well, today, we ping the team and that's it, nominating is more 'you should look at this in meetings'
2018-09-05T22:18:25 #rust-release <simulacrum> that is -- ping is async, nomination is more of an async agenda item for a sync meeting
2018-09-05T22:19:23 #rust-release <pietroalbini> uh, ok, after 9 days of review inactivity we add S-waiting-on-team
2018-09-05T22:20:23 #rust-release <simulacrum> Hm, okay -- it might be that we want to change "If the PR has been inactive for greater than 2 weeks, ping the team lead on IRC and on GitHub, noting that you’ve pinged on IRC." from S-waiting-on-team to 'nominate the PR'
2018-09-05T22:20:35 #rust-release <simulacrum> that is, assign I-nominated to it
2018-09-05T22:20:56 #rust-release <pietroalbini> yeah, that's a good idea
2018-09-05T22:21:07 #rust-release <batmanaod-M> Hm. Does that mean that we'd expect the team to perform PR review during team meetings?
2018-09-05T22:21:51 #rust-release <pietroalbini> I don't think they have time (I have yet to see a compiler meeting that's *not* overtime :P)
2018-09-05T22:22:08 #rust-release <pietroalbini> but they can reassign the PR directly to someone who has time to review that
2018-09-05T22:22:10 #rust-release <simulacrum> We would expect the team to assign someone else, probably
2018-09-05T22:22:28 #rust-release <batmanaod-M> Okay, that makes more sense.
2018-09-05T22:22:55 #rust-release <simulacrum> It's worth noting that this means the PR has been sitting there for 9 days + 2 weeks so... 23 days? Or maybe 14, not sure. 
2018-09-05T22:22:56 #rust-release <simulacrum> But anyway, it's been open without feedback for a while
2018-09-05T22:23:11 #rust-release <simulacrum> Anyone want to make a PR making that change?
2018-09-05T22:25:11 #rust-release <simulacrum> okay, I guess I can do it
2018-09-05T22:26:56 #rust-release <simulacrum> I think that's all for today unless I missed something -- any other concerns/thoughts?
2018-09-05T22:27:07 #rust-release <pietroalbini> I removed the crater rotation from the signup doc, since there is no reason to do that anymore
2018-09-05T22:28:19 #rust-release <pietroalbini> and I granted the teams direct access to it as you discussed last meeting
2018-09-05T22:29:33 #rust-release <simulacrum> Sounds good. Thanks all!
2018-09-05T22:29:40 #rust-release <simulacrum> \o
2018-09-05T22:29:42 #rust-release <pietroalbini> \o
2018-09-05T22:29:44 #rust-release <jkordish> \o
2018-09-05T22:29:59 #rust-release <stokhos> \o
2018-09-05T22:55:39 #rust-release <batmanaod-M> \o
2018-09-07T03:19:49 #rust-release <simulacrum> Aaronepower: If you get a chance, can you file a PR to add a language stabilization for function-like proc macros? That is, foo! is now going to be stable in 1.29 I believe
2018-09-07T03:19:58 #rust-release <simulacrum> (where foo is a proc macro)
2018-09-07T07:27:52 #rust-release <Aaronepower> simulacrum: Sure is there a relevant PR to link to?
2018-09-07T07:44:40 #rust-release <Aaronepower> Also could I get Editor rights on the meeting agenda doc?
2018-09-07T16:14:43 #rust-release <simulacrum> Aaronepower: Let me look, there should be. As to meeting agenda, if you give me your email then definitely, not entirely sure what all's required
2018-09-07T16:35:36 #rust-release <simulacrum> Aaronepower: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/52081
2018-09-07T17:32:04 #rust-release <simulacrum> Aaronepower: but let's not actually do that since it sounds like we're not really stabilizing the ability to use them in 1.29
2018-09-07T17:32:08 #rust-release <simulacrum> we'll push in 1.30 on that
2018-09-07T18:18:20 #rust-release <Aaronepower> simulacrum: theaaronepower[at]gmail.com
2018-09-07T19:01:59 #rust-release <Havvy> Function-like and attribute proc macros are stable in 1.30, not 1.29.
2018-09-07T19:38:53 #rust-release <steveklabnik> https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/54040
2018-09-07T19:38:57 #rust-release <steveklabnik> :confetti-ball:
2018-09-07T19:39:07 #rust-release <steveklabnik> ill be back next week for the release itself o/
2018-09-09T13:32:18 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, fyi, all the beta-nominated PRs are backported to the beta branch, except https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/53687
2018-09-09T13:32:41 #rust-release <pietroalbini> and that PR still needs to be finished/reviewed/merged
2018-09-09T13:33:28 #rust-release <pietroalbini> unfortunately that PR is supposed to fix a beta regression (ICE with rustdoc)
2018-09-10T01:31:32 #rust-release <simulacrum> pietroalbini: Okay, sounds good. If it slips, that's unfortunate but not really much we can do at this point
2018-09-10T14:09:02 #rust-release <misdreavus> pietroalbini: simulacrum: i'm trying to get a quick fix in to beta so we can still make it
2018-09-10T14:09:07 #rust-release <misdreavus> it'll be tight timing tho
2018-09-10T14:28:29 #rust-release <misdreavus> ack, is it possible to change a PR's target branch after it's opened?
2018-09-10T14:37:18 #rust-release <misdreavus> pietroalbini: simulacrum: {!gh 54104}
2018-09-10T14:37:26 #rust-release <misdreavus> er, https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/54104
2018-09-10T16:10:35 #rust-release <misdreavus> can i get a review on https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/54104, preferably before beta is branched off? >_>
2018-09-10T16:10:46 #rust-release <misdreavus> travis just passed
2018-09-10T17:02:17 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, also, https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/54045 (yet another regression) was found a few days ago :/
2018-09-11T15:33:51 #rust-release <batmanaod-M> Does someone know if eddyb is on vacation or something? Looks like there are a couple of pings he hasn't responded to in a few weeks
2018-09-11T15:57:20 #rust-release <eddyb> batmanaod-M: no
2018-09-11T15:57:45 #rust-release <eddyb> batmanaod-M: the edition has high enough priority for me to avoid opening the notifications (I don't want to lose track of them)
2018-09-11T15:59:31 #rust-release <eddyb> so I went from 200 -> 30 notifications, most of those 30 will probably remain like that for another two weeks or so
2018-09-11T16:00:13 #rust-release <pietroalbini> eddyb, hmm, are the other members of the compiler team busy with the edition too?
2018-09-11T16:00:37 #rust-release <eddyb> pietroalbini: uhhh I think so?
2018-09-11T16:00:51 #rust-release <eddyb> pietroalbini: it varies, though, I don't know about everyone
2018-09-11T16:01:01 #rust-release <pietroalbini> because otherwise batmanaod-M could reassign the PRs that don't explicitly require you, to move them forward
2018-09-11T16:01:17 #rust-release <pietroalbini> (and remove some of the load from you ;) )
2018-09-11T16:03:59 #rust-release <eddyb> pietroalbini: okay, let me rephrase
2018-09-11T16:04:05 #rust-release <eddyb> pietroalbini: we don't want most of these things to move forward
2018-09-11T16:04:24 #rust-release <eddyb> while we're focusing on the edition
2018-09-11T16:06:35 #rust-release <pietroalbini> eddyb, maybe it would be best to say that in the PRs then?
2018-09-11T16:06:45 #rust-release <eddyb> but if I do that then I lose the notifications
2018-09-11T16:06:48 #rust-release <eddyb> Q_Q
2018-09-11T16:07:07 #rust-release <pietroalbini> eddyb, we can ping you again :P
2018-09-11T16:07:09 #rust-release <eddyb> I just didn't want to deal with them until the more stressful things are over
2018-09-11T16:07:15 #rust-release <eddyb> uhhhh
2018-09-11T16:30:50 #rust-release <batmanaod-M> That makes sense.
2018-09-11T16:31:42 #rust-release <batmanaod-M> Hmmm....maybe at the next meeting we can discuss some kind of "temporarily frozen" tag, as an alternative to the "closed for inactivity" tag
2018-09-11T16:32:45 #rust-release <batmanaod-M> Such that when applying the tag, we'd be required to add a comment explaining what the tag is waiting on, so that maybe once/month we can go through the "frozen" PRs and check if they're ready to re-open
2018-09-11T16:33:11 #rust-release <pietroalbini> batmanaod-M, like S-blocked? :P
2018-09-11T16:33:16 #rust-release <batmanaod-M> So, like the "blocked" tag, but a bit "fuzzier"
2018-09-11T16:33:30 #rust-release <batmanaod-M> Yeah -- but does "blocked" only refer to being blocked on another issue or PR?
2018-09-11T16:33:58 #rust-release <pietroalbini> batmanaod-M, hmm, at the moment it's a bit more generic
2018-09-11T16:34:10 #rust-release <batmanaod-M> I suppose we could "block" PRs on the 2018 milestone itself
2018-09-11T16:34:35 #rust-release <pietroalbini> and I don't see a point in having multiple labels with the same triage process but a little different meaning
2018-09-11T16:34:45 #rust-release <pietroalbini> (except S-waiting-on-bikeshed, of course)
2018-09-11T16:34:51 #rust-release <batmanaod-M> Agreed, actually.
2018-09-11T16:36:24 #rust-release <batmanaod-M> So @eddyb, can I label some of these issues S-blocked and comment that they're blocked on the 2018 release?
2018-09-11T16:55:17 #rust-release <eddyb> batmanaod-M: that seems... too formal
2018-09-11T16:55:28 #rust-release <eddyb> batmanaod-M: you can comment that they're waiting on people to come back from edition crunch
2018-09-11T17:13:56 #rust-release <batmanaod-M> I'm a formalist :D
2018-09-11T17:17:07 #rust-release <batmanaod-M> So can I also close them for now?
2018-09-11T17:22:45 #rust-release <pietroalbini> hmm, personally I'd say no (it's no the author's fault, it's mostly "ours")
2018-09-11T17:32:32 #rust-release <batmanaod-M> Do we consider closing to require someone to be "at fault"?
2018-09-11T17:33:04 #rust-release <batmanaod-M> (I am used to StackOverflow's culture, where closure is supposed to be "friendly". They even renamed it to "on hold".)
2018-09-11T17:33:11 #rust-release <TimNN> batmanaod-M: Are you currently doing PR triage?
2018-09-11T17:34:36 #rust-release <pietroalbini> batmanaod-M, I don't think so, but the PR author might think that
2018-09-11T17:39:25 #rust-release <batmanaod-M> Ah. Well in one case the author is eddyb :D
2018-09-11T18:23:41 #rust-release <eddyb> batmanaod-M: it's more like 2, heh
2018-09-11T18:47:09 #rust-release <eddyb> oh, I'm getting my PRs closed... at least one of them is easy to revive
2018-09-12T10:12:49 #rust-release <pietroalbini> Aaronepower, simulacrum seems like we missed https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/1520 from the release notes
2018-09-12T10:13:37 #rust-release <pietroalbini> and also from the blog post
2018-09-12T10:21:46 #rust-release <Aaronepower> pietroalbini: Thanks I've made a PR with that addition. https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/54150
2018-09-12T22:00:19 #rust-release <simulacrum> o/
2018-09-12T22:00:24 #rust-release <pietroalbini> o/
2018-09-12T22:00:25 #rust-release <jkordish> o/
2018-09-12T22:00:28 #rust-release <jistone> o/
2018-09-12T22:00:47 #rust-release <jistone> happy release-eve!
2018-09-12T22:01:08 #rust-release <pietroalbini> jistone, it's release day here :P
2018-09-12T22:01:15 #rust-release <jistone> heh
2018-09-12T22:01:40 #rust-release <jistone> you still have to wait a while yet though
2018-09-12T22:01:48 #rust-release <simulacrum> araz, batmanaod-M, pramodpsb: meeting
2018-09-12T22:02:14 #rust-release <simulacrum> Okay, so first off PR triage 
2018-09-12T22:02:31 #rust-release <simulacrum> I think we've been doing fairly well on this -- any concerns?
2018-09-12T22:03:09 #rust-release <pietroalbini> well, yeah, the number of in-review PRs is relatively small
2018-09-12T22:06:14 #rust-release <simulacrum> okay looks like no concerns
2018-09-12T22:06:15 #rust-release <simulacrum> no nominated issues or beta nominations
2018-09-12T22:06:21 #rust-release <simulacrum> 1.29 regressions -- looks like 2 issues are not going to get fixed
2018-09-12T22:06:44 #rust-release <simulacrum> the first is a lint bug where we can't allow them on impl trait it looks like? I think this is relatively minor
2018-09-12T22:08:14 #rust-release <simulacrum> the other is a perf regression but also looks relatively unimportant
2018-09-12T22:08:28 #rust-release <pietroalbini> hmm, the allow thing is impacting a rustc PR -- https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/52896#issuecomment-409149134
2018-09-12T22:09:27 #rust-release <simulacrum> hm, yes, but this is limited to rustc since stability attributes are only required there I think? I'm not actually 100% sure on the details here
2018-09-12T22:09:38 #rust-release <simulacrum> but it seems likely that the impact will be relatively low
2018-09-12T22:10:03 #rust-release <pietroalbini> yeah, I don't think it's worth blocking the release on this
2018-09-12T22:10:10 #rust-release <pietroalbini> should we communicate this in any way?
2018-09-12T22:10:50 #rust-release <jistone> does it affect things like #[must_use] fn ?
2018-09-12T22:10:52 #rust-release <simulacrum> the issue is nominated for compiler team so they should see it tomorrow
2018-09-12T22:11:47 #rust-release <jistone> if it's just stability attrs, those are unstable to the public, so shouldn't need release notes
2018-09-12T22:11:49 #rust-release <simulacrum> jistone: Not sure -- probably? It looks like oli is saying this is due to us using existential type to emulate impl trait and perhaps placing it in the wrong scope or some such
2018-09-12T22:12:13 #rust-release <simulacrum> but must_use might be attached to the function instead of the return value 
2018-09-12T22:12:46 #rust-release <jistone> yeah, I can't really thing of other attrs you'd want on return values
2018-09-12T22:12:50 #rust-release <jistone> *think
2018-09-12T22:12:57 #rust-release <simulacrum> yeah I think this should be mostly internal to rustc
2018-09-12T22:13:33 #rust-release <pietroalbini> checked, it should not affect must_use
2018-09-12T22:14:14 #rust-release <simulacrum> okay, good -- looks like quite limited in problem scope and compiler team can decide priority
2018-09-12T22:15:09 #rust-release <simulacrum> We'll try and check in next week to make sure compiler team discussed this
2018-09-12T22:16:22 #rust-release <simulacrum> okay, so we have another item from Aaronepower here on State of Rust
2018-09-12T22:18:28 #rust-release <pietroalbini> I don't think they're online right now?
2018-09-12T22:18:59 #rust-release <simulacrum> hm okay 
2018-09-12T22:19:29 #rust-release <simulacrum> I think the main point here is if we can triage this as part of the normal triage or if we want some form of additional process here
2018-09-12T22:20:14 #rust-release <pietroalbini> (sorry, it's too late for me, bye!)
2018-09-12T22:22:20 #rust-release <simulacrum> I think there's nothing in particular we need to discuss with regards to State of Rust -- I think we'll probably want to get volunteers but I don't think we can do that from this group since all of us are fairly busy, so we'll probably want to ask on internals
2018-09-12T22:22:30 #rust-release <simulacrum> I'll see if Aaronepower is interested in making that request
2018-09-12T22:23:07 #rust-release <batmanaod-M> What exactly is State of Rust?
2018-09-12T22:23:44 #rust-release <simulacrum> it's a project to provide visibility into what state features are in -- RFC, implemented, etc, and hopefully provide a way to guide people who want to help make features happen etc
2018-09-12T22:24:14 #rust-release <simulacrum> Possibly will also contain some form of ETA on features at some point but not sure
2018-09-12T22:25:14 #rust-release <batmanaod-M> That sounds great.
2018-09-12T22:25:25 #rust-release <simulacrum> yep, it's something we've wanted for a while
2018-09-12T22:25:44 #rust-release <simulacrum> anyway -- I think we'll table that until next week, hopefully I'll get a chance to check in with Aaronepower 
2018-09-12T22:26:14 #rust-release <simulacrum> I think that's all for today, thanks all!
2018-09-12T22:26:46 #rust-release <simulacrum> \o

2018-09-13T15:39:41 #rust-release <simulacrum> steveklabnik: Okay, let's kick this off
2018-09-13T15:39:44 #rust-release <simulacrum> steveklabnik: Is blog post ready?
2018-09-13T15:54:01 #rust-release <simulacrum> steveklabnik: Thanks should be ready to go, tag is pushed
2018-09-13T15:55:03 #rust-release <steveklabnik> woot
2018-09-13T15:55:05 #rust-release <steveklabnik> sorry i stepped out
2018-09-13T15:55:07 #rust-release <steveklabnik> i will run thanks now
2018-09-13T15:55:09 #rust-release <steveklabnik> blog post is ready
2018-09-13T15:56:48 #rust-release <steveklabnik> thanks is gonna take a few minutes because i have to recompile it
2018-09-13T16:01:15 #rust-release <steveklabnik> .... thanks failed to build
2018-09-13T16:01:16 #rust-release <steveklabnik> fffuu
2018-09-13T16:01:18 #rust-release <steveklabnik> one seocnd
2018-09-13T16:01:35 #rust-release <simulacrum> I think we're still T-20 minutes or so -- no big rush
2018-09-13T16:02:15 #rust-release <steveklabnik> i had recently installed clang
2018-09-13T16:02:18 #rust-release <steveklabnik> i think that's confusing it
2018-09-13T16:05:02 #rust-release <steveklabnik> fffuuu
2018-09-13T16:14:21 #rust-release <steveklabnik> no jinxes but i think i've got it
2018-09-13T16:15:15 #rust-release <simulacrum> okay I think I was wrong about my estimate -- T-23 minutes or so *now*
2018-09-13T16:15:19 #rust-release <steveklabnik> nope, not quite
2018-09-13T16:15:23 #rust-release <steveklabnik> heh, good in my case, then
2018-09-13T16:22:05 #rust-release <simulacrum> T-15 minutes
2018-09-13T16:22:36 #rust-release <steveklabnik> no dice :/ almost, but not quite
2018-09-13T16:24:05 #rust-release <steveklabnik> https://github.com/alexcrichton/ssh2-rs/issues/82
2018-09-13T16:24:08 #rust-release <steveklabnik> time to ping alex
2018-09-13T16:24:17 #rust-release <simulacrum> steveklabnik: Want to pull it from the blog post then or do you think we'll get it in?
2018-09-13T16:28:42 #rust-release <simulacrum> hm I feel like cargo branches got off-track somehow, so no tag there for now
2018-09-13T16:30:54 #rust-release <steveklabnik> whew
2018-09-13T16:30:54 #rust-release <steveklabnik> https://thanks.rust-lang.org/rust/1.29.0
2018-09-13T16:31:02 #rust-release <steveklabnik> done
2018-09-13T16:31:26 #rust-release <steveklabnik> how far out are we?
2018-09-13T16:31:50 #rust-release <simulacrum> around 5 minutes
2018-09-13T16:32:05 #rust-release <steveklabnik> cool
2018-09-13T16:32:09 #rust-release <steveklabnik> im gonna go have a smoke
2018-09-13T16:32:09 #rust-release <steveklabnik> and brb
2018-09-13T16:32:14 #rust-release <steveklabnik> and then we can pull the trigger :)
2018-09-13T16:35:43 #rust-release <simulacrum> www merged
2018-09-13T16:40:15 #rust-release <simulacrum> as per usual my estimates seem to be wrong
2018-09-13T16:40:16 #rust-release <steveklabnik> back
2018-09-13T16:40:18 #rust-release <steveklabnik> hehe <3
2018-09-13T16:40:28 #rust-release <simulacrum> oh god

2018-09-13T16:41:06 #rust-release <simulacrum> hm I think that's fine though
2018-09-13T16:41:14 #rust-release <steveklabnik> oh no
2018-09-13T16:41:26 #rust-release <simulacrum> that was the non-real release checking if it should run
2018-09-13T16:44:48 #rust-release <simulacrum> Hm yeah I am not seeing the release yet but I'd sort of expect it by now
2018-09-13T16:45:07 #rust-release <simulacrum> time to debug
2018-09-13T16:46:08 #rust-release <simulacrum> okay release is I think live
2018-09-13T16:46:09 #rust-release <simulacrum> merging blog
2018-09-13T16:46:21 #rust-release <steveklabnik> woot

2018-09-13T16:47:50 #rust-release <steveklabnik> blog post up!
2018-09-13T16:47:58 #rust-release <simulacrum> hm the blog looks different now
2018-09-13T16:48:05 #rust-release <simulacrum> Is that something we did?
2018-09-13T16:48:05 #rust-release <steveklabnik> yes
2018-09-13T16:48:09 #rust-release <steveklabnik> i merged a PR to tweak some CSS
2018-09-13T16:48:44 #rust-release <simulacrum> ah okay good
2018-09-13T16:49:42 #rust-release <simulacrum> steveklabnik: Okay, I'll need to run soon, thanks!

2018-09-13T18:49:05 #rust-release <aidanhs> hello release team! cargo is apparently setting up a bot to auto-close stale issues, in case you're interested - https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6020
2018-09-16T05:20:03 #rust-release <eddyb> uuuuh
2018-09-16T05:20:11 #rust-release <eddyb> did we... not release a nightly?
2018-09-16T05:20:33 #rust-release <eddyb> I tried to get https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/54116 in so we get a nightly from it, what did I miss?
2018-09-16T05:36:10 #rust-release <eddyb> looking at the past few days, both times the last PR was one of mine, landed at 1:17 and 1:14, respectively (local time, GMT+3)
2018-09-16T05:36:30 #rust-release <eddyb> and toolstate actually improved (both rls and clippy were fixed yesterday)
2018-09-16T05:36:54 #rust-release <eddyb> so if a nightly was made from the former, I'd expect it to be made from the latter too
2018-09-16T05:37:18 #rust-release <eddyb> huh, https://static.rust-lang.org/dist/2018-09-15/index.html exists
2018-09-16T05:37:32 #rust-release <eddyb> so why does rustup not see it?
2018-09-16T05:38:21 #rust-release <eddyb> ah no, that's the previous day, not what should be the latest
2018-09-16T05:58:31 #rust-release <eddyb> what on earth, https://static.rust-lang.org/dist/2018-09-16/channel-rust-nightly.toml exists but not https://static.rust-lang.org/dist/2018-09-16/index.html
2018-09-16T05:59:41 #rust-release <eddyb> so it got uploaded? but not promoted to nightly
2018-09-16T05:59:50 #rust-release <eddyb> oh woow rustup toolchain add nightly-2018-09-16 appears to be working
2018-09-16T06:00:53 #rust-release <eddyb> but somehow https://static.rust-lang.org/dist/channel-rust-nightly.toml points to 2018-09-15
2018-09-16T06:03:43 #rust-release <eddyb> (sorry if this is all amateurish investigation, but since nobody else is around...)
2018-09-16T06:04:04 #rust-release <eddyb> pietroalbini: ping
2018-09-16T06:06:33 #rust-release <eddyb> hmm so it did the first but not third step of this https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-central-station/blob/master/promote-release/src/main.rs#L153-L155
2018-09-16T06:07:43 #rust-release <eddyb> docs are "Version 1.30.0-nightly (2ab3eba30 2018-09-14)" so they weren't updated either
2018-09-16T06:07:52 #rust-release <eddyb> hmm, I wonder if it's just cloudfront
2018-09-16T06:11:20 #rust-release <eddyb> https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/static-rust-lang-org/dist/channel-rust-nightly.toml is also old :(
2018-09-16T06:16:08 #rust-release <eddyb> oh wow https://static.rust-lang.org/doc/nightly/index.html and https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/ have different versions
2018-09-16T06:21:50 #rust-release <eddyb> does this fail? https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-central-station/blob/9334355e08d3dc8ae180d81a4ccb7c84ce96d137/promote-release/src/main.rs#L432
2018-09-16T06:34:18 #rust-release <eddyb> ah no I was looking at the wrong file, the websites appear to be sync
2018-09-16T06:34:38 #rust-release <eddyb> old: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/ new: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/index.html
2018-09-16T07:11:37 #rust-release <eddyb> mkay my best guess (from last-modified headers) is that the docs upload died halfway through
2018-09-16T07:11:50 #rust-release <eddyb> for some reason I don't have access to
2018-09-16T07:18:00 #rust-release <eddyb> nvm on Discord I'm pretty sure it was simulacrum's deployment around 00:27 GMT that killed the release process mid-upload
2018-09-16T14:25:25 #rust-release <pietroalbini> eddyb, sorry, left the irc client up even if I wasn't around :)
2018-09-16T14:47:26 #rust-release <eddyb> pietroalbini: simulacrum already solved it :D
2018-09-17T16:46:18 #rust-release <Aaronepower> The 1.30.0 release notes: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/54300
2018-09-17T16:46:31 #rust-release <pietroalbini> Aaronepower, thanks!
2018-09-17T16:46:45 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, hmm, no beta branch yet?
2018-09-17T18:04:00 #rust-release <simulacrum> pietroalbini: No, soon. Probably today or tomorrow, need to check in with a few people
2018-09-17T18:04:53 #rust-release <pietroalbini> ok, I'll start the crater run when you promotr
2018-09-17T18:04:55 #rust-release <pietroalbini> *promote
2018-09-18T16:33:36 #rust-release <TimNN> I'm sorry, but I won't be able to do triage today
2018-09-18T17:01:04 #rust-release <batmanaod-M> I missed mine yesterday; I should be able to do some today
2018-09-19T22:00:15 #rust-release <simulacrum> o/

2018-09-19T22:02:39 #rust-release <simulacrum> okay, starting off with PR triage today
2018-09-19T22:02:39 #rust-release <simulacrum> https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Release-Team-Meeting-Agenda--ANKITLMYgdF1IfZ1XpPTqnx9Ag-gb8LJ6VkQxH9HKl1r9KFE
2018-09-19T22:02:45 #rust-release <simulacrum> https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rustc-pr-tracking/
2018-09-19T22:03:11 #rust-release <simulacrum> Looks like everything is mostly on track -- we're seeing an uptick across the board but I suspect that's primarily the rush to get things into RC
2018-09-19T22:04:06 #rust-release <jistone> o/
2018-09-19T22:04:26 #rust-release <simulacrum> Any concerns?
2018-09-19T22:05:43 #rust-release <batmanaod-M> o/
2018-09-19T22:05:47 #rust-release <simulacrum> checking in on https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/54045
2018-09-19T22:05:59 #rust-release <simulacrum> compiler team assigned to eddyb/oli-obk but looks like there's not been any progress
2018-09-19T22:06:25 #rust-release <jistone> marked high, at lest
2018-09-19T22:06:29 #rust-release <jistone> least
2018-09-19T22:06:41 #rust-release <pietroalbini> maybe it's worth pushing it for stable backport if we decide to also get https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/54206 fixed on stable?
2018-09-19T22:06:58 #rust-release <pietroalbini> (that's rls missing on win-gnu)
2018-09-19T22:07:16 #rust-release <simulacrum> I've nominated it for stable backport
2018-09-19T22:07:46 #rust-release <simulacrum> I don't think we have a fix for RLS on windows-gnu yet though
2018-09-19T22:08:08 #rust-release <pietroalbini> (that's a nominated issue btw)
2018-09-19T22:08:52 #rust-release <simulacrum> pietroalbini: Is the nomination intended for us? I think infra/dev-tools is mostly the concern here
2018-09-19T22:09:27 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, hmm, T-release maybe it's for "that's another thing we might want to backport"
2018-09-19T22:09:46 #rust-release <simulacrum> sure, sounds good
2018-09-19T22:09:47 #rust-release <simulacrum> Tagging as such
2018-09-19T22:10:24 #rust-release <simulacrum> okay, let's move on to the next item
2018-09-19T22:11:15 #rust-release <simulacrum> We might want to move to Discord -- is there anyone against such a move? I think if no then we should go ahead and make the move
2018-09-19T22:11:22 #rust-release <simulacrum> (happy to hear general feedback here)
2018-09-19T22:12:37 #rust-release <pietroalbini> I think we should have all the rust chats in the same place, and discord is that place at the moment
2018-09-19T22:12:47 #rust-release <jkordish> +1
2018-09-19T22:13:33 #rust-release <pietroalbini> btw, the android app doesn't work without play services, and that's not so nice
2018-09-19T22:13:42 #rust-release <Aaronepower> I think I've already voiced my concerns over moving to Discord on the internals post. I'm still against the Discord move as a whole but I don't think filibustering this will actually help.
2018-09-19T22:13:46 #rust-release <simulacrum> Okay, since there seems to be no one against such a move I think I'll create the role/team on there -- does everyone have an account on Discord already?
2018-09-19T22:15:06 #rust-release <jistone> I do
2018-09-19T22:15:40 #rust-release <jkordish> yes
2018-09-19T22:15:55 #rust-release <batmanaod-M> I don't really see the benefit of Discord over IRC or Matrix (yet), but I agree that having one consolidated location is preferable.
2018-09-19T22:16:00 #rust-release <batmanaod-M> (And yes, I have an account)
2018-09-19T22:17:27 #rust-release <Aaronepower> simulacrum: I also meant to reply to you on that internals post, but I don't think Discord will allow logbots or publicly viewable channels.
2018-09-19T22:18:22 #rust-release <simulacrum> Generally I think those are concerns facing ~all teams though and I don't think we have any particular need for either, right?
2018-09-19T22:20:23 #rust-release <jistone> I'd prefer default-open (public)
2018-09-19T22:20:42 #rust-release <simulacrum> I'll start an email thread gathering specific feedback but generally it sounds like we do have some concerns (which may or may not be blocking)
2018-09-19T22:21:08 #rust-release <Aaronepower> simulacrum: It reduces transparency and accessibility, both pretty high priority things for me.
2018-09-19T22:22:02 #rust-release <simulacrum> Okay -- thanks for the feedback!
2018-09-19T22:22:22 #rust-release <Aaronepower> I also wish that we tested other open alternatives as all platforms that the teams have tested have been closed source apps (except gitter which was closed and is now not)
2018-09-19T22:22:52 #rust-release <simulacrum> as a "news" item the release candidate announcement should be going out tomorrow; we've already produced the relevant beta and I believe it went out earlier today
2018-09-19T22:23:14 #rust-release <pietroalbini> and the crater run for that is queued, it should start in less than a day
2018-09-19T22:23:45 #rust-release <simulacrum> pietroalbini: Thanks for being on top of crater!
2018-09-19T22:25:02 #rust-release <simulacrum> okay, I think that's all for today, thanks everyone!
2018-09-19T22:25:08 #rust-release <Aaronepower> simulacrum: wait
2018-09-19T22:25:24 #rust-release <simulacrum> Did I miss something?
2018-09-19T22:25:43 #rust-release <Aaronepower> simulacrum: I wanted to bring up the State Of Rust thing that I was meant to bring up last week but was unable to attend last minute.
2018-09-19T22:25:51 #rust-release <simulacrum> Ah okay sure we can talk about that
2018-09-19T22:27:08 #rust-release <Aaronepower> So yeah, we need to do something with or it will languish. I initially looked into rfcbot automation, but it seemed like rfcbot doesn't hook into the actual useful events for it like merging etc.
2018-09-19T22:27:47 #rust-release <anp> Aaronepower: it gets those events, would just need to include their ingestion and wire it all up
2018-09-19T22:29:18 #rust-release <simulacrum> Agreed that if we do nothing it will languish -- do you have any specific proposal? I don't think I personally have the time until the edition fully ships at least to help write up a bot/update rfcbot
2018-09-19T22:29:47 #rust-release <Aaronepower> anp: I know, but also the code was pretty opaque to me so I couldn't really figure out where any of it would work. Also that is the smallest part of the document that could automated, what really needs to be kept up is updating.
2018-09-19T22:30:28 #rust-release <Aaronepower> So that's why I was thinking triage. It doesn't have to be weekly like PR or issue, I was thinking more monthly as RFCs seem to move pretty slow when I look through and see if anything needs to be updated.
2018-09-19T22:32:15 #rust-release <simulacrum> Do you want to add a section to the signup doc with relevant steps on what needs to happen during those triage sections?
2018-09-19T22:33:10 #rust-release <Aaronepower> simulacrum: Yeah sure, I can have that done before the next meeting.
2018-09-19T22:33:46 #rust-release <simulacrum> great, we can talk through it then and maybe get some assignees
2018-09-19T22:33:49 #rust-release <simulacrum> Any other items?
2018-09-19T22:36:11 #rust-release <simulacrum> Okay, thanks everyone!

2018-09-21T21:38:31 #rust-release <pietroalbini> will triage it tomorrow
2018-09-22T14:42:54 #rust-release <pietroalbini> finished triaging beta regressions

2018-09-26T22:01:37 #rust-release <iAaronepower> o/
2018-09-26T22:01:50 #rust-release <simulacrum> Any concerns about PR tracking? I don't think there's anything I'm aware of that we need to discuss
2018-09-26T22:03:48 #rust-release <simulacrum> okay, moving on -- no nominated issues and no beta nominations
2018-09-26T22:04:35 #rust-release <simulacrum> Checking in on the stable nominations
2018-09-26T22:07:07 #rust-release <pietroalbini> I think there is nothing worth of a point release at the moment?
2018-09-26T22:07:13 #rust-release <simulacrum> Yes, that's my feeling as well
2018-09-26T22:07:25 #rust-release <simulacrum> RLS is sort of up there but we don't really have a good backport candidate
2018-09-26T22:07:31 #rust-release <pietroalbini> for #[allow(deprecated)] the compiler team decided not to backport
2018-09-26T22:08:18 #rust-release <pietroalbini> https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/54045#issuecomment-423232005
2018-09-26T22:08:21 #rust-release <simulacrum> okay, let's remove the nomination then
2018-09-26T22:08:59 #rust-release <pietroalbini> and cycle error ice was nominated a few hours ago, but with a negative comment from pnkfelix
2018-09-26T22:09:05 #rust-release <pietroalbini> https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/53316#issuecomment-424728956
2018-09-26T22:09:09 #rust-release <pietroalbini> "My personal inclination is to not backport this to stable, and probably not to backport beta either"
2018-09-26T22:09:23 #rust-release <simulacrum> okay, so looks like nothing that we can backport right now
2018-09-26T22:09:34 #rust-release <pietroalbini> I'd say it's not worth doing a point release for the release notes fix :P
2018-09-26T22:09:59 #rust-release <simulacrum> yep, for sure
2018-09-26T22:10:13 #rust-release <iAaronepower> pietroalbini: Which pr is that?
2018-09-26T22:10:38 #rust-release <pietroalbini> iAaronepower, https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/54150 aka --document-private-items
2018-09-26T22:10:51 #rust-release <pietroalbini> which we forgot in the shipped notes
2018-09-26T22:10:58 #rust-release <iAaronepower> Ah okay
2018-09-26T22:11:26 #rust-release <simulacrum> okay, pietroalbini, want to talk about beta crater run?
2018-09-26T22:11:46 #rust-release <pietroalbini> yep, I did a first crater run and... we found a lot of regressions
2018-09-26T22:12:23 #rust-release <pietroalbini> https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+author%3Apietroalbini+milestone%3A1.30
2018-09-26T22:12:35 #rust-release <pietroalbini> the teams should now triage them
2018-09-26T22:12:49 #rust-release <pietroalbini> I'll start another beta run really soon, probably tomorrow
2018-09-26T22:12:51 #rust-release <simulacrum> I think we've seen at least some triage
2018-09-26T22:13:23 #rust-release <iAaronepower> (Sidenote: Is there use case for reading the RELEASES.md in a release tag? I always assumed people just looked at master)
2018-09-26T22:13:36 #rust-release <pietroalbini> since I'm going to import another 23k GitHub repositories into Crater, and I want to also test them
2018-09-26T22:13:39 #rust-release <simulacrum> iAaronepower: Mostly distros I think
2018-09-26T22:13:48 #rust-release <simulacrum> pietroalbini: Yes, seems like a good candidate
2018-09-26T22:13:55 #rust-release <simulacrum> er, good thing to do
2018-09-26T22:14:03 #rust-release <pietroalbini> that's all for me
2018-09-26T22:15:50 #rust-release <simulacrum> okay, anything else?
2018-09-26T22:16:12 #rust-release <pietroalbini> is it possible to move the meeting start a little bit earlier?
2018-09-26T22:16:39 #rust-release <pietroalbini> something like half an hour/one hour, it's pretty late here in europe
2018-09-26T22:16:56 #rust-release <jkordish> ^ fine with that
2018-09-26T22:17:10 #rust-release <simulacrum> We can maybe do half an hour; I can't do more than that for sure
2018-09-26T22:17:28 #rust-release <iAaronepower> simulacrum: I was meant to have the State of Rust triage procedure done, but my MacBook is in for repairs so I won’t get to that or anything else dev wise till it’s back.
2018-09-26T22:17:36 #rust-release <simulacrum> iAaronepower: Okay, no worries
2018-09-26T22:17:43 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, that would be great
2018-09-26T22:18:20 #rust-release <simulacrum> IIRC the doodle poll indicated that half an hour would be feasible -- I'll send out some mail indicating the time change
2018-09-26T22:18:57 #rust-release <pietroalbini> also, what's the consensus on chat platforms?
2018-09-26T22:19:25 #rust-release <simulacrum> We've not really reached any -- I'm tentatively hoping that concerns over zulip will be settled (there's been some discussion on internals) and we can possibly move there with compiler team
2018-09-26T22:20:20 #rust-release <simulacrum> But otherwise we'll stay on IRC for the time being
2018-09-26T22:20:25 #rust-release <pietroalbini> ok
2018-09-26T22:21:44 #rust-release <simulacrum> okay, I think that's all
2018-09-26T22:21:50 #rust-release <simulacrum> thanks all!
2018-09-26T22:21:56 #rust-release <pietroalbini> \o
2018-09-26T22:21:58 #rust-release <iAaronepower> \o
2018-09-26T22:22:00 #rust-release <jkordish> \o

2018-09-26T22:24:33 #rust-release <batmanaod-M> \o
2018-10-02T15:40:07 #rust-release <pietroalbini> yay, we went from 69 regressions to 131 with the new repos in crater :(
2018-10-02T15:40:36 #rust-release <pietroalbini> (report is still generating, had some trouble with uploading to s3)
2018-10-02T16:49:36 #rust-release <Aaronepower> Should all ICE's be nominated if they haven't before?
2018-10-02T16:51:08 #rust-release <Aaronepower> simulacrum: ^
2018-10-02T17:28:29 #rust-release <batmanaod-M> Other than nomination, how can our team help deal with regressions? (Or is generating the report and doing nominations basically it?)
2018-10-03T01:11:13 #rust-release <simulacrum> nominate and keep an eye on it to make sure we're making progress
2018-10-03T01:11:16 #rust-release <simulacrum> if needed escalate 
2018-10-03T01:12:14 #rust-release <simulacrum> Aaronepower: No, not generally -- unless they're regressions. ICEs aren't generally "bad" -- we want to fix them, but they aren't really requiring compiler team attention. If they're in a feature that's being stabilized leaving a comment on the tracking issue might be good but generally isn't too important

2018-10-03T22:03:21 #rust-release <simulacrum> okay, let's start with PR triage
2018-10-03T22:03:28 #rust-release <Aaronepower> o/
2018-10-03T22:04:14 #rust-release <simulacrum> I'm not aware of any new issues; are there any concerns?
2018-10-03T22:04:25 #rust-release <jistone> o/
2018-10-03T22:06:40 #rust-release <simulacrum> okay, looks like no concerns -- moving on to nominations
2018-10-03T22:07:08 #rust-release <simulacrum> looks like nothing there
2018-10-03T22:07:31 #rust-release <simulacrum> As a heads up, we will be moving the meeting from now on 30 minutes earlier
2018-10-03T22:07:52 #rust-release <simulacrum> I'll also send out email but I believe most everyone is here already
2018-10-03T22:09:16 #rust-release <simulacrum> We discussed the possibility of a 1.29.2 release in the core team meeting today -- the feelings were mostly neutral -- does anyone here strongly feel about this?
2018-10-03T22:09:34 #rust-release <simulacrum> (we have backports for all stable nominations: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=label%3Astable-nominated)
2018-10-03T22:09:56 #rust-release <Aaronepower> simulacrum: The main one being rls?
2018-10-03T22:10:26 #rust-release <simulacrum> RLS fix for windows-gnu, and removal of some noalias annotations due to miscompilations
2018-10-03T22:10:39 #rust-release <pietroalbini> miscompilation seems really bad
2018-10-03T22:11:27 #rust-release <simulacrum> yeah -- the main hesitation we had is that there's ~3 weeks until the next release anyway
2018-10-03T22:11:46 #rust-release <pietroalbini> well, that's half of our release cycle, doesn't seem so bad
2018-10-03T22:12:04 #rust-release <simulacrum> Sure, yeah -- so looks like we're relatively interested?
2018-10-03T22:13:00 #rust-release <Aaronepower> Well it should be now if it's going to happen the sooner the better.
2018-10-03T22:13:14 #rust-release <pietroalbini> I would be in favor of this (and more point releases in general)
2018-10-03T22:13:33 #rust-release <simulacrum> okay, let's go with "yes" then -- probably aiming at 1.29.2 next week -- let's go with a target date of Thursday
2018-10-03T22:14:00 #rust-release <pietroalbini> great
2018-10-03T22:14:10 #rust-release <simulacrum> pietroalbini: Would you have time to prepare the stable backport rollup PR?
2018-10-03T22:14:25 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, sure
2018-10-03T22:14:30 #rust-release <simulacrum> okay, great
2018-10-03T22:15:13 #rust-release <simulacrum> I think that's all we needed to discuss with regards to stable
2018-10-03T22:15:29 #rust-release <simulacrum> The next item is another crater run being finished, needs triage
2018-10-03T22:15:38 #rust-release <simulacrum> Anyone want to take that on?
2018-10-03T22:15:55 #rust-release <pietroalbini> this is a bit lighter to triage than the others
2018-10-03T22:16:24 #rust-release <pietroalbini> we only need to triage the github regressions in it, and randomly clicking at it most of them are petgraph-related
2018-10-03T22:16:48 #rust-release <pietroalbini> (it's the same as the previous run, only with 26k new gh repos in it)
2018-10-03T22:17:07 #rust-release <simulacrum> ah, okay, sounds good
2018-10-03T22:17:10 #rust-release <simulacrum> I can probably take it on then
2018-10-03T22:17:33 #rust-release <simulacrum> Anyone have any more items?
2018-10-03T22:17:37 #rust-release <Aaronepower> Yes
2018-10-03T22:17:46 #rust-release <pietroalbini> (also yes)
2018-10-03T22:18:33 #rust-release <Aaronepower> Firstly I have the State Of Rust triage steps here. Here is a link I wasn't sure if I should paste into the signup document without prior review first. https://paste.rs/pjc
2018-10-03T22:19:22 #rust-release <simulacrum> Let's put it on the forge as an addition to the PR triage and issue triage file
2018-10-03T22:19:28 #rust-release <simulacrum> (can you make a PR?)
2018-10-03T22:19:36 #rust-release <simulacrum> It looks good just glancing at it 
2018-10-03T22:19:45 #rust-release <Aaronepower> Yeah no problem.
2018-10-03T22:20:20 #rust-release <simulacrum> thanks for typing those up!
2018-10-03T22:21:04 #rust-release <Aaronepower> So I have some more things and these are more open questions.
2018-10-03T22:21:25 #rust-release <Aaronepower> Mainly from when I was doing a lot of issue triage.
2018-10-03T22:22:10 #rust-release <simulacrum> Do you think we need to discuss in-meeting or would async work (can file issues on rust-ops/release once I create it)
2018-10-03T22:23:01 #rust-release <Aaronepower> Well I would like the gathered feedback but I'm fine either way.
2018-10-03T22:23:34 #rust-release <simulacrum> pietroalbini: Was your item key to get to today?
2018-10-03T22:23:48 #rust-release <pietroalbini> nope, but it's pretty fast
2018-10-03T22:24:17 #rust-release <simulacrum> Aaronepower: Okay, go ahead and let's see how many we can get through
2018-10-03T22:24:48 #rust-release <Aaronepower> So why do we keep `NLL-fixed-by-NLL` issues open? It seems like at this stage there aren't going to be non NLL fixes for them.
2018-10-03T22:25:18 #rust-release <pietroalbini> mainly because they're still happening on stable?
2018-10-03T22:25:31 #rust-release <pietroalbini> I think the plan was to bulk-close them once nll is stable
2018-10-03T22:25:37 #rust-release <simulacrum> Yes, that's the plan I believe
2018-10-03T22:25:44 #rust-release <Aaronepower> Okay.
2018-10-03T22:26:04 #rust-release <simulacrum> NLL is somewhat unique in this regard, I think -- many of these issues would be closed for other features
2018-10-03T22:27:31 #rust-release <simulacrum> Aaronepower: does that answer your question?
2018-10-03T22:27:58 #rust-release <Aaronepower> Yes, sorry I wish IRC had "blah is typing". 
2018-10-03T22:28:21 #rust-release <Aaronepower> The second thing is I would like to propose that teams have a "help" triage, for going through and picking out issues that can be done by others. And that we codify when it is okay for someone to take over from an absentee helper.
2018-10-03T22:28:36 #rust-release <batmanaod-M> For state-of-Rust: how are the
2018-10-03T22:28:39 #rust-release <batmanaod-M> Derp
2018-10-03T22:29:38 #rust-release <simulacrum> Aaronepower: Sounds like it might already be resolved through just "this issue has no assignee" in theory?
2018-10-03T22:29:44 #rust-release <batmanaod-M> State of Rust:
2018-10-03T22:29:45 #rust-release <batmanaod-M>  * Sometimes the active RFC changes; this is not always obvious without clicking through to the RFC, then to the tracking issue, then to links in the tracking issue... So it's probably worth calling out in the procedure.
2018-10-03T22:29:46 #rust-release <batmanaod-M>  * Should we have guidelines on what conditions warrant pinging the participants in the tracking-issue thread?
2018-10-03T22:30:04 #rust-release <simulacrum> batmanaod-M: Could you leave that feedback on the (future) PR?
2018-10-03T22:30:06 #rust-release <Aaronepower> simulacrum: I mean like when someone says "I'll take this up." and there's no activity.
2018-10-03T22:31:07 #rust-release <simulacrum> Aaronepower: Yeah, for that, I'd say probably similar to PRs we'd go for the ~2 week window IIRC? And then basically re-add the help tag or de-assign them
2018-10-03T22:32:17 #rust-release <Aaronepower> simulacrum: Where should that information go? Right now I'm think both in forge, and in CONTRIBUTING.md so that new people will know it is okay if they find an issue on their own to take it up.
2018-10-03T22:32:35 #rust-release <simulacrum> Those two sound like the right places, yes
2018-10-03T22:33:17 #rust-release <simulacrum> we're pretty much out of time at this point -- though we can continue trying to resolve Aaronepower's questions -- let's close the official meeting here, thanks all!
2018-10-03T22:33:31 #rust-release <pietroalbini> \o
2018-10-03T22:33:56 #rust-release <batmanaod-M> Yes, I'll copy my message over as a comment
2018-10-03T22:34:03 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, btw, my question was, should we send a ping to the members of the team that didn't contribute (almost) at all?
2018-10-03T22:34:34 #rust-release <simulacrum> pietroalbini: I've been meaning to do that, just haven't quite gotten around to it yet -- thanks for reminding me :)
2018-10-03T22:34:45 #rust-release <pietroalbini> np
2018-10-03T22:34:58 #rust-release <batmanaod-M> \o
2018-10-03T22:35:06 #rust-release <pietroalbini> I'll try to get a stable rollup PR up tomorrow, 'night!
2018-10-03T22:35:59 #rust-release <Aaronepower> simulacrum: Okay, and how do you feel about the idea of asking the other teams to set some sort triage for them to pick out issues to be marked as `E-help-wanted`?
2018-10-03T22:36:23 #rust-release <stokhos> \o
2018-10-03T22:37:08 #rust-release <simulacrum> I don't know if they have bandwidth to do so proactively, unfortunately -- most of the time these are identified through E-mentor or such 
2018-10-03T22:39:27 #rust-release <Aaronepower> simulacrum: Okay, that was it in terms of my questions.
2018-10-03T22:39:52 #rust-release <simulacrum> okay, if you have any more, feel free to throw them to the agenda
2018-10-03T22:54:09 #rust-release <Aaronepower> Here is the PR for the procedure. cc batmanaod-M https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rust-forge/pull/168

2018-10-10T21:32:55 #rust-release <jistone> o/
2018-10-10T21:33:21 #rust-release <simulacrum> okay, let's start off with PR tracking
2018-10-10T21:33:48 #rust-release <simulacrum> there's been a recent uptick in bors queue length
2018-10-10T21:34:21 #rust-release <simulacrum> I think some of that might just be that there's not been a successful rollup landing for the past few days so I'm thinking it's probably okay
2018-10-10T21:34:46 #rust-release <pietroalbini> also there are a lot of PRs with no update for more than a month
2018-10-10T21:36:24 #rust-release <simulacrum> well, created more than a month ago, right? I see only 2 PRs that have no updates for more than a month?
2018-10-10T21:37:07 #rust-release <pietroalbini> oh, right
2018-10-10T21:37:28 #rust-release <pietroalbini> (sorry, it's still a bit late here :P)
2018-10-10T21:37:29 #rust-release <simulacrum> which is maybe not great but seems okay 
2018-10-10T21:38:03 #rust-release <simulacrum> Does anyone have any concerns with regards to PR tracking they'd like to raise?
2018-10-10T21:40:25 #rust-release <simulacrum> Looks like no -- moving on to main agenda
2018-10-10T21:40:33 #rust-release <simulacrum> 1.29.2 will be released tomorrow
2018-10-10T21:41:00 #rust-release <simulacrum> Probably around 10-11 US Eastern time
2018-10-10T21:41:17 #rust-release <jistone> scratch builds on fedora look fine
2018-10-10T21:41:29 #rust-release <simulacrum> I believe all the pieces are ready so we should be good
2018-10-10T21:41:54 #rust-release <simulacrum> We'll also want to bump beta bootstrap to run off of .2 once it ships
2018-10-10T21:42:11 #rust-release <pietroalbini> yep, looked at the pre-release threads a few days ago and nothing came up
2018-10-10T21:42:12 #rust-release <simulacrum> Would anyone want to do that?
2018-10-10T21:42:17 #rust-release <pietroalbini> I can do that
2018-10-10T21:42:22 #rust-release <simulacrum> pietroalbini: great!
2018-10-10T21:42:25 #rust-release <pietroalbini> along with a bump for the master branch
2018-10-10T21:42:34 #rust-release <simulacrum> sure, to latest beta
2018-10-10T21:42:38 #rust-release <pietroalbini> yep
2018-10-10T21:43:00 #rust-release <simulacrum> pietroalbini has done amazing work and written up a blog post, please take a look and leave any feedback you might have: https://github.com/rust-lang/blog.rust-lang.org/pull/273
2018-10-10T21:43:44 #rust-release <simulacrum> I think that's all for the release
2018-10-10T21:43:55 #rust-release <simulacrum> Aaronepower has landed the state of rust triage onto the forge
2018-10-10T21:44:15 #rust-release <simulacrum> https://forge.rust-lang.org/triage-procedure.html#state-of-rust-triage
2018-10-10T21:45:25 #rust-release <simulacrum> There's not really a distinct group of people doing this right now; I'm hopeful though that it can be somewhat passively maintained especially since we should be somewhat slowing down in feature shipping as the edition settles
2018-10-10T21:46:06 #rust-release <Aaronepower> yeah at most how I saw this was like one person a week triage.
2018-10-10T21:46:58 #rust-release <simulacrum> yep -- which I think we may be able to take on as a team as well
2018-10-10T21:47:30 #rust-release <simulacrum> Aaronepower: Would you like to make a signup doc for maybe a monthly (week 1/2/3/4) triage?
2018-10-10T21:47:36 #rust-release <simulacrum> well, add it to the existing one
2018-10-10T21:47:43 #rust-release <Aaronepower> Yeah no problem.
2018-10-10T21:47:59 #rust-release <simulacrum> okay -- if you could send out email to the team letting them know that'd be good as well
2018-10-10T21:48:10 #rust-release <Aaronepower> Will do.
2018-10-10T21:49:09 #rust-release <simulacrum> As a heads up the 1.30 release will happen in  just over 2 weeks, which also means RC 2 is rolling out and the first major world-push announcement for edition
2018-10-10T21:49:26 #rust-release <pietroalbini> should we do another crater run?
2018-10-10T21:49:50 #rust-release <simulacrum> A nightly crater run might be a good idea -- that way we can hopefully pre-triage beta breakage
2018-10-10T21:50:03 #rust-release <simulacrum> (future beta breakage)
2018-10-10T21:50:56 #rust-release <pietroalbini> hmm, we might miss stuff added the last minute
2018-10-10T21:51:20 #rust-release <simulacrum> sure, we'll do more beta runs, but at least it'll be good to get an initial idea
2018-10-10T21:51:28 #rust-release <jistone> it's easier to fix things while they're still on nightly
2018-10-10T21:51:31 #rust-release <jistone> (no backport)
2018-10-10T21:51:35 #rust-release <pietroalbini> oh, yeah, surely
2018-10-10T21:51:49 #rust-release <pietroalbini> should I start it tomorrow?
2018-10-10T21:52:05 #rust-release <simulacrum> that would work, sure, I don't think it's super urgent
2018-10-10T21:52:22 #rust-release <simulacrum> We'll not announce the moment beta is cut anyway
2018-10-10T21:53:15 #rust-release <simulacrum> I think that's all I had -- does anyone have anything else they'd like to discuss?
2018-10-10T21:58:22 #rust-release <simulacrum> okay, thanks all
2018-10-10T21:58:23 #rust-release <simulacrum> \o

2018-10-11T19:09:38 #rust-release <jistone> simulacrum, did something block 1.29.2?
2018-10-11T21:35:28 #rust-release <pietroalbini> jistone, hmm, simulacrum is still offline, talked with acrichto a bit and we might release tomorrow if they don't get online
2018-10-11T23:03:02 #rust-release <simulacrum> yes, we'll bump release to tomorrow -- it slipped my mind this morning 
2018-10-11T23:28:40 #rust-release <jistone> pietroalbini, simulacrum, thanks - no worries
2018-10-12T10:04:15 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, updated the blog post with today's date
2018-10-12T10:04:30 #rust-release <pietroalbini> I noticed that the date on the release notes is wrong though :/
2018-10-12T13:55:48 #rust-release <simulacrum> It doesn't matter too much IMO
2018-10-12T13:56:03 #rust-release <simulacrum> I'll kick release off in ~2 hours (set an alarm today)
2018-10-12T16:06:03 #rust-release <simulacrum> release kicked off
2018-10-12T16:30:11 #rust-release <simulacrum> www pushed
2018-10-12T16:32:05 #rust-release <simulacrum> tag pushed 
2018-10-12T17:02:04 #rust-release <simulacrum> release is out
2018-10-12T17:08:26 #rust-release <jistone> 🎉🎉🎉
2018-10-12T17:08:31 #rust-release <pietroalbini> \o/
2018-10-16T20:11:35 #rust-release <simulacrum> Anyone have some time to review crater beta regressions? https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/54364#issuecomment-430337523
2018-10-17T21:30:08 #rust-release <simulacrum> o/
2018-10-17T21:30:33 #rust-release <Aaronepower> o/
2018-10-17T21:31:51 #rust-release <simulacrum> jistone, jkordish, pietroalbini, pramodpsb, stokhos: meeting
2018-10-17T21:32:23 #rust-release <pietroalbini> o/
2018-10-17T21:32:26 #rust-release <stokhos> o/
2018-10-17T21:33:05 #rust-release <jkordish> o/
2018-10-17T21:33:17 #rust-release <simulacrum> okay, let's get started with PR triage -- I am unaware of any major issues on our side
2018-10-17T21:34:03 #rust-release <simulacrum> It does look like bors is not decreasing much but there are a lot of rollup status PRs it looks like
2018-10-17T21:35:11 #rust-release <simulacrum> so probably not worth getting too concerned with
2018-10-17T21:36:50 #rust-release <simulacrum> does anyone have any concerns? 
2018-10-17T21:37:39 #rust-release <pietroalbini> nope
2018-10-17T21:38:34 #rust-release <simulacrum> okay, looks like nothing nominated and no beta/stable nominations for us to look at
2018-10-17T21:38:35 #rust-release <simulacrum> Let's talk about the release
2018-10-17T21:38:48 #rust-release <simulacrum> There's a couple regressions that are still not resolved
2018-10-17T21:39:24 #rust-release <simulacrum> I'm going to try to get the docs team to land the PR that fixes the jemalloc-ctl crate
2018-10-17T21:39:28 #rust-release <pietroalbini> the ios one is not a blocker, that's a tier 2 platform
2018-10-17T21:39:38 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, I think that already landed?
2018-10-17T21:39:42 #rust-release <simulacrum> oh, yep, it landed
2018-10-17T21:40:09 #rust-release <pietroalbini> I'll probably backport it tomorrow
2018-10-17T21:40:34 #rust-release <simulacrum> We'll want to land release notes in the same backport probably
2018-10-17T21:40:42 #rust-release <pietroalbini> ack
2018-10-17T21:41:15 #rust-release <simulacrum> As a heads up I'll be cutting the "dev-static" stable a little earlier than usual because we want to make sure the edition is properly destabilized
2018-10-17T21:41:38 #rust-release <simulacrum> (Basically as soon as all the relevant details have landed I'll cut it, hopefully Friday or Saturday)
2018-10-17T21:42:37 #rust-release <pietroalbini> so that needs to wait for the backport, which needs to wait for the notes
2018-10-17T21:42:45 #rust-release <simulacrum> yes
2018-10-17T21:42:55 #rust-release <pietroalbini> (and the compiler team decision about the other backports)
2018-10-17T21:43:09 #rust-release <simulacrum> Aaronepower: Do you think you'll get a chance to figure out the URL issue? I'm thinking we might just land it without that link if not
2018-10-17T21:43:26 #rust-release <simulacrum> I don't think its critical - the release notes aren't really intended as a documentation resource 
2018-10-17T21:44:34 #rust-release <Aaronepower> simulacrum: I can give it a look tomorrow, but I agree it's not really critical.
2018-10-17T21:44:53 #rust-release <simulacrum> okay -- if you could ping pietroalbini once you've taken a look so we can get the backport PR rolling that would be great
2018-10-17T21:45:04 #rust-release <Aaronepower> Will do
2018-10-17T21:45:15 #rust-release <simulacrum> I'm otherwise happy with the release notes; I'll delegate the PR so you can approve it when ready
2018-10-17T21:46:12 #rust-release <pietroalbini> Aaronepower, has r+ access iirc
2018-10-17T21:46:34 #rust-release <simulacrum> ah, wasn't sure... well, won't hurt
2018-10-17T21:47:19 #rust-release <simulacrum> Okay, I have nothing else -- anyone have any other concerns?
2018-10-17T21:50:00 #rust-release <simulacrum> okay, let's call it there; thanks everyone! 
2018-10-17T21:50:10 #rust-release <pietroalbini> \o
2018-10-17T21:50:12 #rust-release <simulacrum> \o
2018-10-17T21:50:15 #rust-release <stokhos> \o
2018-10-17T21:50:23 #rust-release <jkordish> \o
2018-10-17T21:50:23 #rust-release <Aaronepower> \o
2018-10-18T18:19:35 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, backport done
2018-10-22T18:11:49 #rust-release <nmatsakis> is this where the release team lives?
2018-10-22T19:15:26 #rust-release <pietroalbini> nmatsakis, yep
2018-10-22T19:15:38 #rust-release <nmatsakis> I wanted to ask about the RC2 release plans
2018-10-22T19:15:47 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, ^
2018-10-22T19:15:58 #rust-release <nmatsakis> there remain two blockers: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22Edition+2018+RC+2%22
2018-10-22T19:16:00 #rust-release <nmatsakis> one has a pending PR to fix
2018-10-22T19:16:10 #rust-release <nmatsakis> I think we probably ought to defer the other
2018-10-22T19:16:30 #rust-release <pietroalbini> maybe I can add that to the meeting agenda
2018-10-22T19:16:33 #rust-release <nmatsakis> that is, gh54692 has a pending fix, but I think we should defer gh55222
2018-10-22T19:16:42 #rust-release * nmatsakis it'd be helpful to have release team feedback on timing
2018-10-22T19:16:44 #rust-release <nmatsakis> argh
2018-10-22T19:16:47 #rust-release <pietroalbini> (no bots here...)
2018-10-22T19:16:50 #rust-release <nmatsakis> no worries
2018-10-22T19:17:01 #rust-release <nmatsakis> (my fingers have learned command-enter from zulip :) that interacts poorly with irc-cloud)
2018-10-22T19:21:11 #rust-release <pietroalbini> added to the agenda
2018-10-23T01:08:58 #rust-release <simulacrum> FWIW meeting is kinda late, beta/stable promotion needs to happen Wednesday at the absolute latest
2018-10-23T01:09:11 #rust-release <simulacrum> I was hoping for over the weekend but these pending PRs prevented that
2018-10-23T14:48:25 #rust-release <nmatsakis> are the RLS tests sometimes unpredictable?
2018-10-23T14:48:28 #rust-release <nmatsakis> I'm looking at https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/55229#issuecomment-432144345
2018-10-23T14:48:32 #rust-release <nmatsakis> locally it seems to pass
2018-10-23T14:49:40 #rust-release <nmatsakis> I did `./x.py test src/tools/rls`, anyway
2018-10-23T14:49:44 #rust-release <pietroalbini> nmatsakis, you should probably ask nrc
2018-10-23T14:50:01 #rust-release <nmatsakis> wil do
2018-10-23T14:50:11 #rust-release <pietroalbini> but if they work on the same platform locally you can just retry
2018-10-23T14:50:22 #rust-release <nmatsakis> I don't have access to windows
2018-10-23T14:50:22 #rust-release <pietroalbini> (we're in beta week, so merges with broken tools are forbidden)
2018-10-23T14:52:41 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, pr with the last beta backports sent and queued
2018-10-23T14:53:12 #rust-release <nmatsakis> ok -- this PR is a beta blocker
2018-10-23T14:54:03 #rust-release <pietroalbini> nmatsakis, ugh, we can't actually merge that if it the failure is not spurious though
2018-10-23T14:54:16 #rust-release <nmatsakis> yes so that's the question
2018-10-23T14:54:20 #rust-release <nmatsakis> I guess I can just retry and find out
2018-10-23T14:54:23 #rust-release <pietroalbini> yep
2018-10-23T14:55:14 #rust-release <nmatsakis> ok I'm always unclear on when it makes sense to retry :)
2018-10-23T14:56:03 #rust-release <pietroalbini> well, if the queue is not huge and the failure looks unrelated a retry is a good idea ;)
2018-10-23T16:09:30 #rust-release <simulacrum> pietroalbini: Hm, I think we'll want another beta PR for the mod.rs feature; either backport if the existing beta-nominated PR or destabilization
2018-10-23T16:18:59 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, the rollup just started testing
2018-10-23T16:19:23 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, it's late though, maybe we can rollup that PR directly in the stable promotion?
2018-10-23T16:19:53 #rust-release <pietroalbini> (I'd go with destabilizing though, the crater run failed and we have no assurance that fix work, nor time to test it a bit more)
2018-10-24T13:03:48 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, I'm making the stable release PR (check infra on discord for context)
2018-10-24T21:31:24 #rust-release <simulacrum> o/
2018-10-24T21:32:11 #rust-release <pietroalbini> o/
2018-10-24T21:32:38 #rust-release <simulacrum> batmanaod-M, jistone, jkordish, pramodpsb: meeting!
2018-10-24T21:32:46 #rust-release <jkordish> o/
2018-10-24T21:33:38 #rust-release <jistone> o/
2018-10-24T21:33:54 #rust-release <simulacrum> okay, let's get started
2018-10-24T21:34:19 #rust-release <simulacrum> Looking at the PR tracking page it looks like we're doing okay though bors queue is not getting shorter (i.e., is getting longer)
2018-10-24T21:34:54 #rust-release <pietroalbini> well, the bors queue is a bit special this week
2018-10-24T21:34:58 #rust-release <simulacrum> I think we'll probably just want to do a couple rollups though so it shouldn't be too bad
2018-10-24T21:35:28 #rust-release <pietroalbini> github exploded a few days ago, my rollup yesterday failed and today we're just retrying the 1.30 release
2018-10-24T21:35:35 #rust-release <simulacrum> yeah
2018-10-24T21:36:13 #rust-release <simulacrum> so I think no major concerns here, and we have a pretty full agenda, so let's move on; we can retouch next week if necessary
2018-10-24T21:36:33 #rust-release <simulacrum> There are no RC2 blockers left 
2018-10-24T21:37:00 #rust-release <simulacrum> (well, aside from the beta promotion of nightly)
2018-10-24T21:38:38 #rust-release <simulacrum> There's an item about the meeting timezone -- I think essentially the main point here is that ideally we'd move the meeting to a different time because it's really late in Europe right now (and will be even later)
2018-10-24T21:39:12 #rust-release <batmanaod-M> o/
2018-10-24T21:39:32 #rust-release <pietroalbini> uh, we skipped the 1.30 release?
2018-10-24T21:39:39 #rust-release <simulacrum> er, oh, yeah
2018-10-24T21:39:44 #rust-release <simulacrum> we'll hit it after timezone
2018-10-24T21:40:03 #rust-release <simulacrum> I think the main thing here is just sending out another Doodle to see if we can find a better time
2018-10-24T21:40:11 #rust-release <simulacrum> I will put that on my agenda
2018-10-24T21:40:25 #rust-release <pietroalbini> well, with the timezone change it will be one hour earlier
2018-10-24T21:40:52 #rust-release <jistone> is the current meeting time tied to a DST-affected timezone?
2018-10-24T21:40:53 #rust-release <pietroalbini> so 22:30 local time (instead of 23:30)
2018-10-24T21:41:00 #rust-release <simulacrum> Hm, is that better? 
2018-10-24T21:41:24 #rust-release <pietroalbini> yep, but it will probably correct itself once the meeting timezone switches to DST
2018-10-24T21:41:37 #rust-release <simulacrum> yeah, Europe seems to be out of sync with the US by one week on that
2018-10-24T21:41:53 #rust-release <jistone> i.e. is it on some US time now, or UTC?
2018-10-24T21:42:11 #rust-release <simulacrum> It is currently some US time, I think
2018-10-24T21:42:45 #rust-release <pietroalbini> ok, if it's some US time it won't be a problem for europe, it will just be one hour earlier for a week
2018-10-24T21:43:00 #rust-release <simulacrum> okay, sounds good, then I think we should have no problems actually?
2018-10-24T21:43:22 #rust-release <pietroalbini> I think TimNN added it just as a FYI
2018-10-24T21:43:38 #rust-release <simulacrum> okay, let's circle back to the release
2018-10-24T21:44:08 #rust-release <simulacrum> The PR for the release artifacts is up
2018-10-24T21:44:11 #rust-release <simulacrum> https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/55315
2018-10-24T21:44:24 #rust-release <simulacrum> and is currently being tested, should be done in ~45 minutes or so I think
2018-10-24T21:44:59 #rust-release <simulacrum> The blog post is here: https://github.com/rust-lang/blog.rust-lang.org/pull/281
2018-10-24T21:45:09 #rust-release <pietroalbini> I don't really feel confident doing a release tomorrow without pre-release testing from the community
2018-10-24T21:45:14 #rust-release <pietroalbini> especially with all the last minute changes
2018-10-24T21:45:31 #rust-release <simulacrum> Historically we've not actually seen too much prerelease testing or caught anything
2018-10-24T21:45:46 #rust-release <simulacrum> I plan on running through the changes myself as soon as we have artifacts
2018-10-24T21:45:54 #rust-release <jistone> would be a (slight) shame to slip the release - first time ever?
2018-10-24T21:46:33 #rust-release <simulacrum> Definitely I think moving forward the process for release artifacts should be a little different; we need a hard cutoff for beta backports earlier than 'today'
2018-10-24T21:46:34 #rust-release <jistone> what delayed this stable build?  rustbelt?  the github issues?
2018-10-24T21:47:00 #rust-release <simulacrum> There was a couple beta backports that I thought would get in but they didn't
2018-10-24T21:47:15 #rust-release <simulacrum> We delayed mostly because I underestimated how long they'd take I think
2018-10-24T21:47:21 #rust-release <jistone> ok
2018-10-24T21:47:57 #rust-release <simulacrum> For the future we'll hard cut any non-blockers (e.g., destabilize) in the week prior to stable release I hope/think
2018-10-24T21:48:22 #rust-release <pietroalbini> ok
2018-10-24T21:49:00 #rust-release <simulacrum> Any other concerns for the release?
2018-10-24T21:50:26 #rust-release <simulacrum> okay, so there's an item from TimNN about the PR triage process
2018-10-24T21:50:59 #rust-release <simulacrum> skimming through it I think the two survey suggestions look reasonable -- does anyone have any major objections?
2018-10-24T21:53:21 #rust-release <simulacrum> okay, I'll try to contact TimNN and see if they'd be interested in fleshing these out and we can then review them and send them out
2018-10-24T21:54:02 #rust-release <simulacrum> I think that's all for the agenda, any other concerns?
2018-10-24T21:56:08 #rust-release <simulacrum> I think we'll actually cancel the meeting for next week to just avoid any timezone issue
2018-10-24T21:56:22 #rust-release <simulacrum> Since it's the first week in the cycle I think that'll be fine
2018-10-24T21:57:31 #rust-release <simulacrum> I'll send out mail as well
2018-10-24T21:57:34 #rust-release <simulacrum> Thanks everyone!
2018-10-24T21:57:39 #rust-release <simulacrum> \o
2018-10-24T21:57:42 #rust-release <batmanaod-M> \o
2018-10-24T21:57:44 #rust-release <jistone> \o
2018-10-24T21:57:51 #rust-release <pietroalbini> \o
2018-10-24T22:00:59 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, when do you plan to release tomorrow?
2018-10-24T22:05:24 #rust-release <simulacrum> pietroalbini: http://www.timebie.com/std/mdt.php?q=9.5 I think
2018-10-24T22:05:38 #rust-release <simulacrum> maybe a 5-10 minutes afterwards
2018-10-24T22:06:42 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, ok!
2018-10-24T22:06:50 #rust-release <pietroalbini> 'night!
2018-10-24T22:06:59 #rust-release <simulacrum> \o
2018-10-24T23:27:09 #rust-release <simulacrum> https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-release-for-1-30/8669
2018-10-25T08:13:33 #rust-release <pietroalbini> posted the pre-release on r/rust
2018-10-25T08:16:31 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, uuuh, the macros chapter of the book is going to be missing in 1.30, but it's mentioned in the release notes
2018-10-25T08:19:55 #rust-release <pietroalbini> Aaronepower, ^
2018-10-25T13:08:40 #rust-release <Aaronepower> pietroalbini: Well what should we do? There isn't any other resources that explain how to use proc macros.
2018-10-25T13:16:17 #rust-release <pietroalbini> Aaronepower, that link doesn't exist though
2018-10-25T13:17:32 #rust-release <Aaronepower> pietroalbini: Well it does exist on nightly.
2018-10-25T13:18:02 #rust-release <pietroalbini> Aaronepower, but the notes don't point to nightly
2018-10-25T13:19:24 #rust-release <Aaronepower> pietroalbini: Yes, so I'm asking should we just remove it, or use the nightly link?
2018-10-25T13:19:59 #rust-release <pietroalbini> Aaronepower, hmm
2018-10-25T13:20:20 #rust-release <pietroalbini> we can't fix it on stable without rebuilding everything (and let's not), and on the next stable it will be ok
2018-10-25T13:20:48 #rust-release <pietroalbini> so the only window we have to fix it is a future point release, if we do them
2018-10-25T13:23:30 #rust-release <Aaronepower> Another use case for Hera. :D
2018-10-25T13:42:56 #rust-release <pietroalbini> Aaronepower, well, we want a full rebuild though, otherwise the updated notes don't show up in the release tarballs
2018-10-25T13:43:07 #rust-release <pietroalbini> (in the stable branch)
2018-10-25T13:44:29 #rust-release <simulacrum> Yes, I think we probably just leave it for now -- the relevant fix is on master (or soon will be), it just didn't make it into stable
2018-10-25T13:48:43 #rust-release <Aaronepower> pietroalbini: I know, I was just being facetious. Though since we have to pull out `mod.rs being optional` from the release notes couldn't we also do this change?
2018-10-25T13:49:05 #rust-release <pietroalbini> Aaronepower, already pulled that
2018-10-25T13:49:10 #rust-release <Aaronepower> Ah
2018-10-25T13:49:12 #rust-release <pietroalbini> while doing the stable PR
2018-10-25T13:49:25 #rust-release <Aaronepower> It's still in master though?
2018-10-25T13:49:29 #rust-release <pietroalbini> (now that I think about it, that commit needs to be backported to stable)
2018-10-25T13:51:40 #rust-release <pietroalbini> *to master
2018-10-25T14:10:00 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, is beta scheduled to be released on monday?
2018-10-25T15:08:34 #rust-release <simulacrum> yes
2018-10-25T15:38:18 #rust-release <simulacrum> okay let's do this
2018-10-25T15:39:22 #rust-release <simulacrum> release is started
2018-10-25T15:45:53 #rust-release <simulacrum> tag pushed
2018-10-25T16:05:52 #rust-release <simulacrum> www pushed
2018-10-25T16:16:36 #rust-release <simulacrum> T-15 minutes
2018-10-25T16:48:00 #rust-release <simulacrum> release is live
2018-10-25T16:53:10 #rust-release <pietroalbini> \o/
2018-10-25T19:07:19 #rust-release <misdreavus> aaaaaand i've already got an ICE report for rustdoc >_>
2018-10-25T19:08:01 #rust-release <misdreavus> i never properly nominated https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/54199 for beta backport, so now that linked issue is on stable
2018-10-25T19:29:47 #rust-release <misdreavus> someone was able to rebase the PR onto the stable branch cleanly https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/compare/stable...joelgallant:predicate_may_hold-failure
2018-10-25T19:33:49 #rust-release <pietroalbini> misdreavus, you should add stable-nominated to that PR
2018-10-25T19:34:03 #rust-release <pietroalbini> linking that branch in the comments
2018-10-25T19:34:13 #rust-release <misdreavus> yeah, i was about to add tags right when you pinged me, lol
2018-10-25T19:35:31 #rust-release <pietroalbini> :D
2018-10-25T20:11:24 #rust-release <misdreavus> oh nice, github pretty-prints comparison links like how it does for commit hashes
2018-10-26T12:52:20 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, cargo 0.31.0 needs to be published on crates.io
2018-10-26T13:39:19 #rust-release <simulacrum> ah, yes, forgot to do that yesterday
2018-10-26T13:39:23 #rust-release <simulacrum> I'll try to do so today
2018-10-28T22:30:41 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, hmm, why is a pr beta-accepted if beta wasn't promoted yet?
2018-10-28T22:30:46 #rust-release <pietroalbini> *isn't
2018-10-28T22:30:53 #rust-release <simulacrum> pietroalbini: Beta was promoted friday night by acrichto
2018-10-28T22:31:04 #rust-release <simulacrum> maybe saturday morning, not sure
2018-10-28T22:31:09 #rust-release <pietroalbini> ...oh, missed that, woops!
2018-10-28T22:31:57 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, it's not on rustup though?
2018-10-28T22:32:11 #rust-release <simulacrum> hm, that's a bit odd
2018-10-28T22:32:22 #rust-release <pietroalbini> info: latest update on 2018-10-24, rust version 1.30.0-beta.17 (f33946f81 2018-10-23)
2018-10-28T22:32:34 #rust-release <simulacrum> I'm not sure if the PR landed...?
2018-10-28T22:32:45 #rust-release <simulacrum> oh I forgot to r+ the PR that switches it to beta
2018-10-28T22:33:14 #rust-release <simulacrum> okay, should have a new beta in ~3-4 hours I guess
2018-10-28T22:33:20 #rust-release <simulacrum> https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/55405
2018-10-28T22:33:30 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, maybe you should merge the beta-approved PR in that
2018-10-28T22:33:30 #rust-release <simulacrum> hm, we might want to roll in the backports though
2018-10-28T22:33:35 #rust-release <pietroalbini> yep
2018-10-28T22:33:42 #rust-release <pietroalbini> I can do that
2018-10-28T22:33:52 #rust-release <simulacrum> pietroalbini: Okay, thanks!
2018-10-28T22:34:10 #rust-release <simulacrum> I think there should be ~4 -- let me check that it's the correct list
2018-10-28T22:35:09 #rust-release <pietroalbini> there are 2 approved, 1 unapproved but merged and 1 unapproved and not yet merged
2018-10-28T22:35:13 #rust-release <pietroalbini> https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+label%3Abeta-nominated
2018-10-28T22:36:55 #rust-release <simulacrum> pietroalbini: Okay, I think I updated the list -- should all be approved
2018-10-28T22:36:59 #rust-release <simulacrum> the Ok wrapping is not critical
2018-10-28T22:37:09 #rust-release <simulacrum> I would like the other 3 though for sure
2018-10-28T22:37:14 #rust-release <pietroalbini> ack
2018-10-28T22:43:46 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, rolled up the backports
2018-10-28T22:44:12 #rust-release <simulacrum> thanks!
2018-10-29T13:35:51 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, if you're ok with https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/55405#issuecomment-433911390, I can work on the PR
2018-10-29T13:36:18 #rust-release <pietroalbini> (you need to force-push beta yourself or unlock the branch though)
2018-10-29T13:41:06 #rust-release <simulacrum> pietroalbini: unlocking the branch
2018-10-29T13:41:51 #rust-release <simulacrum> pietroalbini: branch unlocked
2018-10-29T13:43:00 #rust-release <simulacrum> I am hesitant to start RCS manually because historically that's caused breakage due to overlapping dates and all
2018-10-29T13:45:11 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, ok, so we can announce rc2 tomorrow
2018-10-29T13:48:29 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, you can lock the branch again
2018-10-29T14:03:28 #rust-release <simulacrum> yes I think that should work
2018-10-29T14:15:00 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, I'm also including two smaller PRs to avoid conflicts while cherry-picking
2018-11-04T17:53:22 #rust-release <Aaronepower> Draft for the release notes of Rust 1.31.0. https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/55678
2018-11-05T21:02:25 #rust-release <simulacrum> TimNN: hey, wanted to talk to you about the PR triage updates you put on the agenda 2(?) weeks ago
2018-11-05T21:03:19 #rust-release <TimNN> simulacrum: Sure
2018-11-05T21:04:07 #rust-release <simulacrum> TimNN: So we discussed this briefly and everyone seemed fairly onboard with sending out the survey(s) -- would you be willing to do the legwork and put together a few google forms for that? (I think google is the easiest, but happy with something else too)
2018-11-05T21:04:20 #rust-release <simulacrum> Then we can do some final review and send those out to the teams
2018-11-05T21:04:44 #rust-release <TimNN> Yeah, I also had Google Forms in mind
2018-11-05T21:05:31 #rust-release <TimNN> I'll try to put something together before Wednesday, then you can look over them and suggest improvements during the meeting?
2018-11-05T21:05:41 #rust-release <TimNN> I likely won't be able to attend again
2018-11-05T21:06:22 #rust-release <simulacrum> I'll definitely be happy to mention it -- I think we might do the improvements async over the course of the week?
2018-11-05T21:06:33 #rust-release <TimNN> Yeah, sounds fine as well
2018-11-05T21:06:39 #rust-release <simulacrum> (not sure that going through all the questions during the meeting is super great use of time)
2018-11-05T21:06:48 #rust-release <TimNN> I'll put the links in the doc / on the agenda when I have something
2018-11-05T21:06:53 #rust-release <TimNN> That's probably true
2018-11-05T21:07:18 #rust-release <simulacrum> sounds good, thanks! Feel free to ping me if you have any questions though I might not be *too* responsive :)
2018-11-05T21:08:17 #rust-release <TimNN> Alright, will do :)
2018-11-07T17:48:34 #rust-release <simulacrum> https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/prerelease-for-1-30-1/8784
2018-11-07T22:30:18 #rust-release <simulacrum> o/
2018-11-07T22:30:53 #rust-release <pietroalbini> o/
2018-11-07T22:32:22 #rust-release <simulacrum> Aaronepowerr, batmanaod-M, jistone, jkordish, pramodpsb: meeting
2018-11-07T22:32:36 #rust-release <jkordish> o/
2018-11-07T22:32:58 #rust-release <batmanaod-M> am in another meeting, sorry
2018-11-07T22:33:10 #rust-release <jistone> o/
2018-11-07T22:33:29 #rust-release <simulacrum> okay, let's get started
2018-11-07T22:34:13 #rust-release <simulacrum> we'll be discussing PR triage a bit more in a bit, but tentatively I think there's no major *current* issues (there's some longer term ones, but we'll discuss those as we hit them on the agenda)
2018-11-07T22:35:08 #rust-release <simulacrum> There are no nominated issues (regular, beta, or stable)
2018-11-07T22:36:15 #rust-release <simulacrum> First item is that the rust all hands is firmly scheduled for early February next year -- I believe all of you should have received an email from Aaron about this, if you haven't, please let me know after the meeting and I can make sure that happens
2018-11-07T22:37:32 #rust-release <simulacrum> The other important item to mention is that the upcoming release (December 6th) is the final edition release, which probably doesn't mean too much other than hopefully a few more beta crater runs than usual
2018-11-07T22:39:04 #rust-release <simulacrum> Okay, so pietroalbini has an item about more people needing to do triage -- I personally think that this is probably true but we need more data to get insight on what that means
2018-11-07T22:39:32 #rust-release <pietroalbini> that was also discussed in the last infra team meeting
2018-11-07T22:40:12 #rust-release <pietroalbini> seems like there is a lot of untriaged stuff, and looking at my notifications I see only triage pings from TimNN 
2018-11-07T22:40:14 #rust-release <simulacrum> pietroalbini: Anything important to note from that? 
2018-11-07T22:41:09 #rust-release <pietroalbini> 9:04 PM] alexcrichton: as a passing though, I feel like our triage procedure for the bors queue has fallen behind in recent months
2018-11-07T22:41:09 #rust-release <pietroalbini> [9:04 PM] alexcrichton: passing thought*
2018-11-07T22:41:09 #rust-release <pietroalbini> [9:04 PM] alexcrichton: I feel like I keep running into PRs like https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/55052 which sit for a month before they get poked
2018-11-07T22:41:16 #rust-release <simulacrum> Untriaged PRs or issues?
2018-11-07T22:41:33 #rust-release <pietroalbini> prs waiting on review
2018-11-07T22:42:15 #rust-release <simulacrum> I think part of the problem is that so far we've not had amazing success with pulling folks in willing to do this legwork
2018-11-07T22:42:41 #rust-release <simulacrum> and I'm not sure we have great ideas on how to change that?
2018-11-07T22:43:13 #rust-release <pietroalbini> shep is going to do the friday slot again, and TimNN is doing tuesday
2018-11-07T22:43:33 #rust-release <pietroalbini> maybe we should ask outside the team for more people from the community to do triage?
2018-11-07T22:44:15 #rust-release <simulacrum> Right -- historically I felt that that was mostly met with silence and we've not had any ideas on how to make it more appealing
2018-11-07T22:45:31 #rust-release <pietroalbini> "the best way to keep up with the rust development while helping it"? :D
2018-11-07T22:46:29 #rust-release <pietroalbini> I mean, if no one on the team has time for that we should just try to ask for other people to join
2018-11-07T22:47:01 #rust-release <simulacrum> We definitely could -- I think maybe a post on users.r-l.o might make sense for this kind of effort, too
2018-11-07T22:47:12 #rust-release <simulacrum> we don't really need folks familiar with internals
2018-11-07T22:47:19 #rust-release <shep> I hadn't actually *agreed* to do it, was just offering. But my "maybe" is better than nothing, I suppose ;-)
2018-11-07T22:47:41 #rust-release <shep> You just have to look for obsessive people that like to put things into boxes.
2018-11-07T22:47:51 #rust-release <pietroalbini> shep, woops, misunderstood your comment :)
2018-11-07T22:47:56 #rust-release <shep> Not that I would know anything about that...
2018-11-07T22:48:14 #rust-release <simulacrum> Okay, so let's do this -- for now, I'd like to get the survey for people doing triage implemented so we get at least some visibility
2018-11-07T22:48:19 #rust-release <shep> I was mostly waiting for someone to say something back that it might be useful ;-)
2018-11-07T22:48:22 #rust-release <simulacrum> (this might also be beneficial to have some public 'thanks' system)
2018-11-07T22:49:03 #rust-release <shep> I rather like having the ability to tag things in rust-lang/rust, so I'm happy to chip in some "payment" :-)
2018-11-07T22:49:07 #rust-release <simulacrum> I'm going to try and dedicate some time myself as a stop-gap kind of measure -- I think I can spare 30-45 minutes a week to it *somewhere*
2018-11-07T22:49:54 #rust-release <simulacrum> So, concretely, please take a look at the survey TimNN made (link in agenda) and leave comments on the paper doc
2018-11-07T22:50:32 #rust-release <simulacrum> Then we can hopefully start collecting tentative data on how long the process takes precisely at least
2018-11-07T22:51:44 #rust-release <simulacrum> pietroalbini: Do you have a link to the crater run itself for the categorized failures doc?
2018-11-07T22:51:50 #rust-release <pietroalbini> sure
2018-11-07T22:52:01 #rust-release <pietroalbini> https://crater-reports.s3.amazonaws.com/beta-1.31-1/index.html
2018-11-07T22:52:15 #rust-release <simulacrum> (easier to pull logs and such)
2018-11-07T22:52:24 #rust-release <simulacrum> If no one gets to it I'll triage that tomorrow
2018-11-07T22:52:38 #rust-release <pietroalbini> thanks!
2018-11-07T22:52:57 #rust-release <simulacrum> Oh, one more thing -- 1.30.1 is going to be released tomorrow 
2018-11-07T22:53:06 #rust-release <pietroalbini> (unfortunately I have less time than usual this week)
2018-11-07T22:53:08 #rust-release <simulacrum> should be fairly low-key, there's nothing major in it
2018-11-07T22:54:40 #rust-release <simulacrum> I think that's all for the agenda -- anyone have something else?
2018-11-07T22:57:48 #rust-release <simulacrum> okay, thanks everyone!
2018-11-07T22:57:51 #rust-release <simulacrum> \o
2018-11-07T22:58:06 #rust-release <jkordish> \o

2018-11-07T22:58:40 #rust-release <pietroalbini> \o
2018-11-08T16:04:38 #rust-release <simulacrum> release in ~1 hour or so
2018-11-08T17:02:22 #rust-release <simulacrum> release time!
2018-11-08T17:11:01 #rust-release <simulacrum> pietroalbini: Will you be able to fix the not Steve added on the blog post?
2018-11-08T17:30:38 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, sure
2018-11-08T17:36:53 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, done
2018-11-08T17:55:27 #rust-release <simulacrum> release is out
2018-11-08T18:04:18 #rust-release <pietroalbini> \o/
2018-11-09T04:15:09 #rust-release <simulacrum> pietroalbini: Finished crater triage and opened relevant issues, did not do the blacklist additions -- ran out of time and not sure what the process is exactly
2018-11-09T09:13:41 #rust-release <pietroalbini> simulacrum, thanks!
2018-11-14T22:30:37 #rust-release <simulacrum> o/
2018-11-14T22:30:44 #rust-release <pietroalbini> o/
2018-11-14T22:30:55 #rust-release <dpc2> o/
2018-11-14T22:31:55 #rust-release <simulacrum> Aaronepower, batmanaod-M, jistone, jkordish, pramodpsb, TimNN: meeting
2018-11-14T22:32:13 #rust-release <Aaronepower> o/
2018-11-14T22:32:25 #rust-release <jkordish> O/
2018-11-14T22:32:31 #rust-release <jistone> o/
2018-11-14T22:32:37 #rust-release <simulacrum> okay, let's get started
2018-11-14T22:32:46 #rust-release <simulacrum> First off -- PR tracking
2018-11-14T22:32:57 #rust-release <simulacrum> Looks like overall bors queue is finally trending down
2018-11-14T22:33:20 #rust-release <simulacrum> this might be a symptom of just overall fewer PRs though, not sure
2018-11-14T22:33:46 #rust-release <simulacrum> overall I think the PR state is okay, no major concerns to be surfaced at this time
2018-11-14T22:35:37 #rust-release <pietroalbini> (ugh my laptop's battery just died)
2018-11-14T22:35:47 #rust-release <jkordish> :(
2018-11-14T22:35:47 #rust-release <simulacrum> moving on to beta nominations I'm accepting the release notes PR
2018-11-14T22:36:37 #rust-release <simulacrum> It's likely it'll go in after the beta code freeze just because there's no way it can regress but I think that's fine
2018-11-14T22:36:43 #rust-release <simulacrum> I will try to get a review done by this weekend of it
2018-11-14T22:37:32 #rust-release <simulacrum> Okay, moving on to the crater run 
2018-11-14T22:37:47 #rust-release <simulacrum> I finished triage and opened issues on the first one and just queued a 2nd one
2018-11-14T22:38:37 #rust-release <simulacrum> we'll probably want someone to triage that when it lands; does anyone feel particularly inclined to do so?
2018-11-14T22:39:24 #rust-release <dpc2> simulacrum: what does it involve?
2018-11-14T22:39:27 #rust-release <pietroalbini> (this should be a bit easier to triage now that crater automatically detects most spurious failures)
2018-11-14T22:39:48 #rust-release <simulacrum> essentially clicking through ~30-40 crates, categorizing failures, and opening new issues for new problems
2018-11-14T22:40:46 #rust-release <dpc2> i'm free to help with that
2018-11-14T22:41:11 #rust-release <simulacrum> dpc2: Okay, I'll put you down -- you can watch https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/55540 for status updates on the latest crater run
2018-11-14T22:41:33 #rust-release <simulacrum> okay, TimNN's PR triage tracking form was merged this week
2018-11-14T22:41:52 #rust-release <simulacrum> so please make sure to fill that out when doing triage
2018-11-14T22:42:07 #rust-release <simulacrum> I don't think I have access to the results currently but will speak to TimNN about getting those in our hands
2018-11-14T22:42:54 #rust-release <simulacrum> dpc2: I'll speak to you after the meeting about specifically what to do to start helping with PR triage
2018-11-14T22:43:00 #rust-release <dpc2> simulacrum: sure
2018-11-14T22:43:09 #rust-release <simulacrum> pietroalbini brought up switching away from IRC
2018-11-14T22:43:14 #rust-release <pietroalbini> yeah
2018-11-14T22:43:31 #rust-release <pietroalbini> now most of the rust work is on discord/zulip, and I basically open irc just for this meeting
2018-11-14T22:43:40 #rust-release <simulacrum> Yeah, I essentially do the same
2018-11-14T22:44:05 #rust-release <pietroalbini> at least we could create a release channel on discord to avoid abusing the infra one
2018-11-14T22:44:07 #rust-release <simulacrum> I think moving to either Discord or Zulip would probably make sense -- I got the sense that we'd tentatively prefer Zulip last time we discussed this; has that changed?
2018-11-14T22:45:46 #rust-release <simulacrum> sounds like probably no -- I'll send mail out to release@ about this
2018-11-14T22:45:51 #rust-release <pietroalbini> atm I'd prefer discord: as the release team we don't really need threads, and most of the other ops stuff is there
2018-11-14T22:46:11 #rust-release <simulacrum> Hm, yeah, that's a good point
2018-11-14T22:46:27 #rust-release <jistone> anonymous lurking was a point of contention last time, iirc
2018-11-14T22:46:36 #rust-release <simulacrum> I also have access to Discord directly
2018-11-14T22:47:02 #rust-release <pietroalbini> jistone, hmm, does that really happen though? and is it needed for release stuff?
2018-11-14T22:47:31 #rust-release <jistone> I don't think we members need that, but it's a matter of openness
2018-11-14T22:47:34 #rust-release <simulacrum> Let's do this -- I'll create a channel in Discord and we'll move there. If people want to anonymously lurk, Rust's discord technically doesn't require email verification to even talk so ... plus that seems like a non-use case, mostly
2018-11-14T22:48:17 #rust-release <simulacrum> at least to me that's not high enough on the priority list to consider it currently, and if we were to I think we should do so across the spectrum of Rust teams, not just as the release team
2018-11-14T22:48:32 #rust-release <jistone> I don't feel strongly, but I recall someone was pretty vocal last time it came up
2018-11-14T22:48:44 #rust-release <pietroalbini> Aaronepower maybe?
2018-11-14T22:49:01 #rust-release <dpc2> if anonymity is a concern, we could have a private group with only members of the badge (and some higherups) allowed
2018-11-14T22:49:08 #rust-release <dpc2> *anonymous lurking
2018-11-14T22:49:21 #rust-release <simulacrum> dpc2: I think it's that people want to allow it (and Discord kinda doesn't)
2018-11-14T22:49:31 #rust-release <jistone> yeah, the concern is relevant to all rust communication, not this team in particular
2018-11-14T22:49:37 #rust-release <dpc2> okay
2018-11-14T22:50:00 #rust-release <simulacrum> so I think I'm going to send out mail and if no one objects too strongly with reasoning that is applicable strictly to the release team we'll move
2018-11-14T22:50:26 #rust-release <Aaronepower> My concerns would mainly be that now to be on discord you have to opt into not being able sue them, which is not something a chat program company does if they're not going to do something shady.
2018-11-14T22:51:11 #rust-release <simulacrum> I think that's perhaps not great but not something we as the release team should necessarily try to combat, if that makes sense
2018-11-14T22:51:21 #rust-release <simulacrum> anyway -- I will send email
2018-11-14T22:51:39 #rust-release <simulacrum> Next week's meeting will be canceled due to Thanksgiving in the US
2018-11-14T22:52:02 #rust-release <Aaronepower> Yeah I agree with that
2018-11-14T22:52:37 #rust-release <simulacrum> that's all I had for today, anyone want to bring something up?
2018-11-14T22:53:28 #rust-release <simulacrum> okay, that's it for the meeting. Thanks all!
2018-11-14T22:53:32 #rust-release <pietroalbini> \o
2018-11-14T22:53:43 #rust-release <jkordish> \o
2018-11-14T22:53:45 #rust-release <dpc2> \o
2018-11-14T22:54:02 #rust-release <simulacrum> dpc2: Did you have a weekday when you want to do triage regularly?
2018-11-14T22:54:21 #rust-release <dpc2> simulacrum: i'm available on all the days so pick any
2018-11-14T22:54:21 #rust-release <jistone> \o
2018-11-14T22:55:01 #rust-release <simulacrum> dpc2: Okay, I've put you down for Monday each week
2018-11-14T22:55:31 #rust-release <dpc2> cool :)
2018-11-14T22:55:41 #rust-release <simulacrum> dpc2: the procedure is documented here: https://forge.rust-lang.org/triage-procedure.html
2018-11-14T22:56:01 #rust-release <simulacrum> essentially all of the details should be in there I think, feel free to ping me with questions
2018-11-14T22:56:22 #rust-release <pietroalbini> dpc2, do you have labelling access on rust-lang/rust?
2018-11-14T22:56:41 #rust-release <dpc2> nope i don't
2018-11-14T22:56:48 #rust-release <dpc2> my GH username is Dylan-DPC
2018-11-14T22:58:59 #rust-release <simulacrum> let me add you to the release team
2018-11-14T22:59:27 #rust-release <dpc2> cool
2018-11-14T23:01:16 #rust-release <simulacrum> dpc2: Should've received an invite
2018-11-14T23:01:26 #rust-release <simulacrum> thanks!
2018-11-14T23:01:56 #rust-release <dpc2> yah got it :) np :)
2018-11-15T18:18:37 #rust-release <simulacrum> TimNN: When you get a chance, can you share the link for the form results with the release team? If you'd like to just make it world-viewable that would work fine I think
2018-11-15T18:19:51 #rust-release <TimNN> simulacrum: I commented in the doc: "the responses can contain potentially sensitive data (GitHub username, free form comments, how much effort someone put into triage)"
2018-11-15T18:20:04 #rust-release <TimNN> I think it would be preferable to invite the members individually
2018-11-15T18:20:08 #rust-release <TimNN> (no public link sharing)
2018-11-15T18:20:16 #rust-release <TimNN> (at least not of the raw results)
2018-11-15T18:20:39 #rust-release <TimNN> What do you think?
2018-11-15T18:21:41 #rust-release <simulacrum> Sure, yeah, that makes sense -- can you share it with just me for now, and we can figure out exactly how to disseminate that information later?
2018-11-15T18:22:21 #rust-release <TimNN> Sure
