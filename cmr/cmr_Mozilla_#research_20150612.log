[20:18:32] <Manishearth> okay, mingw rust is pretty nice actually
[20:18:50] <Manishearth> but we'd have to make it clear that msvc is very  rough right now
[20:19:14] <larsberg> Manishearth: we're just walking them through some exercises, not trying to port Servo to Windows :-)
[20:20:08] <Manishearth> larsberg: It's still all horrible and crazy :o
[20:20:19] <Manishearth> On a serious note, msvc *is* lacking things
[20:20:21] <larsberg> but... but... I saw an installer!
[20:20:35] <Manishearth> though they might work by whistler
[20:20:51] <Manishearth> I'm hoping to smoke out msvc bugs with this exercise

[21:40:58] <nmatsakis> pcwalton: I think you once mentioned a variant on LR that made adjustments to automatically resolve SR or RR conflicts -- or did I imagine that?
[21:41:03] <nmatsakis> it seems very doable to me,
[21:41:09] <nmatsakis> so I'm figuring someone must have done it
[21:41:19] <pcwalton> nmatsakis: do you mean the variant on LALR?
[21:41:23] <nmatsakis> perhaps
[21:41:27] <pcwalton> if so, that's called "lane tracing"
[21:41:28] <nmatsakis> oh wit
[21:41:30] <nmatsakis> wait
[21:41:31] <pcwalton> google for that :)
[21:41:32] <pcwalton> it's full LR
[21:41:38] <pcwalton> with a LALR-like algorithm
[21:41:40] <nmatsakis> does it just expand states to get back to LR
[21:41:41] <nmatsakis> ah ok
[21:41:42] <nmatsakis> that's not quite what I meant
[21:41:45] <nmatsakis> but I will google it
[21:41:50] <nmatsakis> what I meant was more
[21:41:56] <nmatsakis> changing the grammar itself
[21:41:59] <nmatsakis> inlining nonterminals etc
[21:42:01] <pcwalton> oh
[21:42:04] <nmatsakis> basically that's always my trick for resolving problems
[21:42:08] <pcwalton> I don't think I'm aware of something that does that
[21:42:10] <nmatsakis> and I'm not sure why the parser generator couldn't do it for me 
[21:42:20] <nmatsakis> in the past I did it
[21:42:27] <nmatsakis> by writing a macro expander
[21:42:30] <nmatsakis> and running my grammar through that
[21:42:30] <nmatsakis> :)
[21:42:53] <pcwalton> ah, yeah
[21:43:09] <nmatsakis> e.g. if you have
[21:43:15] <nmatsakis> Foo = X Y* Z
[21:43:19] <nmatsakis> that will get many more conflicts than
[21:43:25] <nmatsakis> Foo = X Z | X Y+ Z
[21:43:43] <nmatsakis> but of course it's a pain to do that transform by hand, grammar gets big fast
[21:44:54] *** Dexter|bbl is now known as Dexter
[21:48:22] <pcwalton> nmatsakis: btw, what is the status of your trait caching improvement?
[21:48:34] <pcwalton> people on Reddit really want it, and I do top
[21:48:35] <pcwalton> too
[21:49:15] <nmatsakis> pcwalton: yeah I discovered a slight problem where it can yield bad results; shouldn't be too hard to fix though
[21:49:21] <pcwalton> oh, ok
[21:49:23] <nmatsakis> I was just resurrecting an old branch
[21:49:32] <nmatsakis> where I did some of the steps
[21:49:36] <nmatsakis> I would want to do to fix it ;)
[21:49:54] <nmatsakis> basically the optimization works by comparing trait resolutions across fns
[21:50:00] <nmatsakis> but you can create fns with where clauses that are trivially unsatisfiable
[21:50:02] <nmatsakis> if you work a bit at it
[21:50:04] <nmatsakis> and this can fool the caching

[21:50:44] <pnkfelix> edunham: hey there.  I'm drafting up exercises for the Rust tutorial we'll be doing at Whistler
[21:51:17] <edunham> would you like to leverage my rust-novice-ness to test whether they make sense? :)
[21:51:36] <pnkfelix> edunham: and I was wondering if you thought you might have time before say Tuesday night to go through them, including an *honest* report of how long each took 
[21:52:05] <pnkfelix> edunham: right, you get it
[21:52:48] <pnkfelix> edunham: I don't have the whole set ready to go yet, but I am thinking I want to send out the initial ones now for my "most inner circle" to look at.  :)
[21:53:32] <edunham> sure, no problem... send them along now, and I'll get the times back to you as I complete each one. would a narration of what parts are confusing and what links I find when googling for help also be useful?
[21:58:56] <samth> pnkfelix: in 211 we multiplied instructor time by 4 to get student time :)
[21:59:17] <pnkfelix> samth: yeah i remember
[21:59:54] <samth> the problem is that there are lower-bounds on time, but not upper bounds :)
[21:59:55] <pnkfelix> samth: hard to know if that formula carries over to this context.  Do you know offhand if it worked in the classes that used ACL2 ?  ;)
[22:00:14] <samth> pnkfelix: sadly cce isn't on irc
[22:00:25] <pnkfelix> edunham: I'll send them along in a bit, I'm putting some finishing touches on

[22:05:50] <edunham> it'll be really interesting if some people from the not-writing-code parts of the organization come in and try Rust as a first language :)
[22:07:12] <mbrubeck> Related to that, I hope we can get some non-platform people interested (e.g. webdev, mobile, fx-team)...
[22:07:28] <Manishearth> edunham: poor souls
[22:08:10] <Manishearth> first youhave to interoduce variables to 'em as boxes, and then you suddenly say that the boxes are alive
[22:08:19] <edunham> Manishearth: less worse than starting with PHP. more confusing than starting with C...
[22:08:27] <Manishearth> true
[22:09:18] <Manishearth> My first two languages (minus stuff I didn't do much in) were JS and then PHP. Past me was a total idiot.
[22:09:33] <edunham> nah, I think first language is mostly a matter of luck
[22:09:49] <edunham> because before you start coding, you don't have nearly as strong a sense for what coding-related advice is good or bad
[22:10:02] <edunham> so it's super difficult to assess which language to start with
[22:10:10] *** Quits: tadh (quassel@moz-iq6hhs.biz.rr.com) (Connection closed)
[22:10:13] * edunham got lucky and happened to start with C
[22:10:17] <Manishearth> oooo
[22:10:33] <edunham> I was actually doing robotics at the time, so I was strongly motivated to push through all the annoyance of it... and I had a very patient mentor
[22:11:21] <Manishearth> I didn't really approach it as "I want to learn a language", I approached it as "oo I can make my marquee havens more interactive" (again. past me. idiot.)
[22:11:38] <Manishearth> robotics is a pretty awesome way to start
[22:12:00] <Manishearth> I think a lot of folks stagnate whilst coding because there's not much of a way to make anything useful when you start
[22:12:07] <edunham> fwiw, I was then like "I should learn object-oriented programming! let's read a C++ book" and I got nowhere useful with it because I didn't have a set goal in mind
[22:12:08] <Manishearth> or make anything which you can actually have fun with
[22:12:43] <edunham> and then I got forcibly sat down and taught OOP in the form of Java when I started university, and after that it was easy to pick up Python (again with excellent mentorship, though)
[22:12:44] <Manishearth> which is why stuff like scratch and robotics work out so well. You get to see your code doing something
[22:13:07] <edunham> yeah and there's a real deadline, like "i have to make this stupid toaster follow a wall by tomorrow, no excuses"
[22:13:17] <Manishearth> lol
[22:14:09] <edunham> I actually found a bunch of that old code recently... it was from before I learned about revision control, so the filenames are pretty painful
[22:16:17] <Manishearth> I treated version control as a dumb way to backup code (so basically a slightly better google drive) for way too long
