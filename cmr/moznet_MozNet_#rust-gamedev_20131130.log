[06:20:51] <bjz> csherratt: beep
[06:21:12] <csherratt> hi bjz
[06:21:54] <bjz> csherratt: have you thought any more about the gfx stuff?
[06:22:13] <bjz> I'm just wondering how to move forward
[06:24:32] <csherratt> how much shader work have you done so far?
[06:26:10] <csherratt> not inside of gfx, just in general.
[06:26:49] <bjz> csherratt: some, not a great deal though. I was thinking my stuff would evolve during my time working on my project
[06:30:44] <bjz> I know the basics, but I haven't gone crazy
[06:30:49] <bjz> csherratt: you?
[06:35:56] <csherratt> well, it's just with a purely data driven design some shaders are going to require dozens of uniforms to actually render.
[06:36:24] <csherratt> while some simpler things might only require the project matrix.
[06:36:38] <bjz> mmk
[06:39:02] <csherratt> I'm not sure where I am going with this.
[06:39:59] <csherratt> well, maybe I should ask you.
[06:40:40] <csherratt> where were you planning on going with gfx. I can see that starting of building a draw list.
[06:41:47] <csherratt> how did you plan on keeping track of draw order, object culling, grouping to reducing binding overhead ect.
[06:42:02] *** Quits: jeaye (Jeaye@moz-34FEF2BB.hsd1.ca.comcast.net) (Quit: zzz)
[06:42:15] <bjz> I'm planning to use it for my procedural exploration game thingy - hadn't really thought about all that stuff yet
[06:42:33] <bjz> I've basically been building components from the ground up
[06:43:11] <bjz> glfw wrapper, maths, open gl generator, procedural noise thingy, now gfx
[06:44:11] <csherratt> so is this the image I had seen of a bunch of trees on a green hill or am I thinking of something else.
[06:44:24] <bjz> csherratt: sounds like it
[06:44:56] <bjz> I've been doing lots of yak shaving over the past year, but I've learned tons
[06:44:59] <bjz> :P
[06:45:41] * bjz is a bit of a turtle when it comes to races. one that likes venturing down rabbit holes.
[06:48:05] <csherratt> so when you drew each of the trees did you load each one in a separate set of vertexes?
[06:49:16] <bjz> yeah I think so - wasn't the most effient. I'm guessing you could reuse the same vertex buffers though
[06:49:44] <csherratt> yeah you can.
[06:50:06] <csherratt> you then just move the data around by changing the uniform in the vertex shader
[06:50:18] <bjz> https://github.com/bjz/gfx-rs/tree/master/src/examples/terrain
[06:50:28] <bjz> yeah
[06:52:06] <csherratt> how did you do the lake reflection? stencil buffer?
[06:53:05] <bjz> photoshop x)
[06:53:22] <bjz> (sorry to disappoint)
[06:53:47] <bjz> one of my goals for the future, but at the moment I'm too stupid
[06:53:48] <csherratt> wait were all these done in photoshop?
[06:54:13] <bjz> no, the night one was done over a more basic real time rendering
[06:55:17] <bjz> I just altered it because I wanted to get an idea of how I wanted it to look without going down a technical rabbit hole
[06:55:33] <csherratt> ah
[06:55:50] *** Quits: erickt1 (Adium@49C4075F.3AC15C18.2321E71E.IP) (Quit: Leaving.)
[06:55:54] <bjz> :P
[06:56:10] * bjz has lots to learn
[06:57:34] <csherratt> there is an old trick to do reflections like that. you render the lake and set a bit in the stencil buffer. You then configure the pipeline to only render based on the stencil buffers mask. You then flip the entire world upside down and render it.
[06:57:48] <csherratt> you can create a mirror like surface like you have shown there.
[06:59:08] <bjz> yeah, that would be awesome
[06:59:43] <bjz> probably what I would have done if I had spent the time learning x)
[07:02:10] <bjz> csherratt: so I'm guessing a nice rendering engine would help abstract that stuff
[07:02:46] <csherratt> yeah it would have to.
[07:03:08] <bjz> csherratt: then this kind of example might be useful
[07:03:41] <bjz> there are of course lots of other things
[07:03:50] <csherratt> have you read the spec on the quake 3 map format?
[07:03:56] <bjz> no
[07:04:32] <csherratt> http://www.mralligator.com/q3/
[07:05:08] <bjz> yeah, got it already
[07:05:11] <bjz> ^_^
[07:10:02] <bjz> csherratt: do you think it's a good format, and if so, why?
[07:10:38] <bjz> (I mean, carmack was behind it, so it comes with some credibility
[07:10:40] <bjz> )
[07:11:01] <csherratt> It's a bit dated. But if you look through the fields you can learn quite a bit about how they structured data internally in the engine.
[07:12:26] <bjz> ahh, I see what direction your looking at it now
[07:13:05] <csherratt> probably best to look at the model, and work you way outwards.
[07:14:33] <bjz> just so I know, what things about it are a little dated?
[07:15:56] <csherratt> well if you compare it to the updated BSP format used by valve it can give you a better idea of the added assets http://www.bagthorpe.org/bob/cofrdrbob/bspformat.html
[07:17:23] <bjz> oh interesting
[07:17:31] <bjz> thanks, this is useful stuff
[07:18:15] <csherratt> but my comment was more to the effect that quake 3 came out in 1999 so it is far from an example of a modem game engine.
[07:18:21] <bjz> https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Source_BSP_File_Format
[07:18:25] <bjz> yeah
[07:20:06] <csherratt> much of the map data can be just dumped into a single vertex array object.
[07:20:17] <ofeldt-> isn't the bsping declining? ppl using more oct-tree or other ways to partition render space.
[07:22:07] <ofeldt-> afaik even the source-engine format, though still impressive is quite dated and more like lugguage due to the fact that inventing new conecept is (time consuming) expensive
[07:22:43] <bjz> ofeldt-: do you know of any good examples to look at?
[07:24:00] <bjz> ofeldt-: just trying to get an idea of how things are normally represented internally
[07:27:24] <bjz> interesting: http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/5493/whats-the-state-of-the-art-in-space-partitioning-for-games/5503#5503
[07:29:48] <ofeldt-> bjz, yeah as the post says, it depends. octree allow simple rearange, the bsp preprocessing part limits the geometry-change you can achieve at runtime.
[07:30:52] <bjz> ofeldt-: does this choice dramatically alter the architecture of the rendering engine?
[07:32:43] <ofeldt-> bjz, not only rendering but also assets/content
[07:32:53] <bjz> interesting
[07:33:09] <ofeldt-> as stated in the second post bsp seems to be used mainly for physics now (on which i can't tell)
[07:33:53] <ofeldt-> did you ever do mapping in a CSG/BSP-driven engine?
[07:34:02] <bjz> no
[07:34:26] <bjz> have you?
[07:34:36] <ofeldt-> yes
[07:35:16] <bjz> what do you think would be good for procedural content?
[07:35:58] <ofeldt-> heh, how long is a string ;)
[07:36:07] <bjz> haha
[07:36:37] * bjz is wondering whether he should reduce his scope
[07:36:59] <ofeldt-> can't tell, e.g. take octree, if you were to build.. let's say.. minecraft, fixed-sized block based volumes, they would play well with octrees.
[07:37:16] <bjz> ah, I'm talking polygonal geometry
[07:37:23] <bjz> not voxels
[07:38:26] * bjz is wondering whether making more of a 'flixel for 3d' might be better
[07:38:44] <ofeldt-> CSG/BSP needs (don't quote me on that) a convex geometry to be efficient. so it can eliminate everything "outside" of reality. if you'd change the geometry, you'd have to redo (potentially large) parts of the tree.
[07:39:02] <bjz> mm
[07:39:02] <cmr> What does CSG stand for?
[07:39:03] <ofeldt-> source engine minimizes rendering load by precalculating a PVS
[07:39:13] * cmr is drowning in acronym soup
[07:39:29] <bjz> constructive solid geometry?
[07:39:32] <ofeldt-> constructive solid geometry
[07:39:34] <ofeldt-> yap
[07:39:48] <bjz> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_solid_geometry
[07:39:55] <bjz> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_space_partitioning
[07:40:03] <cmr> Ah I've seen this article before
[07:40:04] <ofeldt-> it actually super clever and simple (imho) but has building overhead.
[07:40:07] <cmr> I recognize the pictures!
[07:40:17] <bjz> hah
[07:40:28] <cmr> I used it a lot when learning basic cad
[07:41:16] <bjz> yeah
[07:41:50] <bjz> ofeldt-: sounds like octrees might be better
[07:42:20] <ofeldt-> to tell from my mapping experience, the whole pipeline CSG->BSP-PVS-RAD is very daunting.
[07:42:41] <bjz> daunting as in...?
[07:42:54] <bjz> and by 'mapping experience' - is that as a dev?

[07:44:08] <bjz> oh ok
[07:44:18] <bjz> like making stock stuff?

[07:51:10] <ofeldt-> good luck with that. from my experience it's a pita building a game/rendering engine. :)

[18:53:10] <h3r3tic> ofeldt-, bjz: re BSPs vs OCTrees, etc. and their popularity. In practice, you will always want to use a structure which best fits your game world, and plugs into your content pipeline. BSP is surely neat in that you can calculate PVS from it using the antipenumbra method, but other than that it doesn't give you much. the times where you'd use the BSP/CSG to model actual level geometry are gone. now you'll have hundreds of thousands, or millions of 
[18:53:10] <h3r3tic> polygons in a frame. Something like a BSP is not suitable for these sort of workloads. Not to say that they are useless, though :) Last time around I fiddled with culling for an indoor game mock, I went with a super simple scheme, in which you'd just model the whole thing any way you wanted -- any poly soup in 3ds max. Then you'd place a bunch of simple objects (read:boxes) around that to designate rooms. I used CSG to generate portals between them, 
[18:53:13] <h3r3tic> and assigned all the geometry to the rooms which the portals connected. Used the portals for culling at runtime. Worked really well :)
[18:54:15] <h3r3tic> also, recently a few commercial games/game engines have been using a scheme whenre you have a software rasterizer for super low poly occlusion blockers. E.g. The Battlefield series uses that, with Quake-era polycounts for culling their stuff
[18:54:37] <h3r3tic> they rasterize this super simple geometry into a software z-buffer, and then test bounding boxes of objects before submitting them to the GPU
[18:55:02] <h3r3tic> this has the upside of working with dynamic levels
[18:57:35] <h3r3tic> as for octrees... not sure if I'd use them for culling. they certainly are neat for storing sparse data... but don't restrict yourself to just 8-ary subdivision. octrees are just nested grids, and you can generalize from there. e.g. I use sparse trees of arity 27 (3x3x3) to store volumetric light probes for dynamic objects, as these turned out to provide the best compression in my particular case.
[18:57:50] <h3r3tic> ( also, having a flatter data structure means you don't chase pointers that much )

[19:00:43] <h3r3tic> but yeah, in general use whatever the heck suits your game :D Even OCTrees and BSPs still come in several flavors, e.g. you can have loose OCTrees, and BSP can be leafy, solid-leafy, solid, shadow-volume BSPs, etc :P come up with your own :)
