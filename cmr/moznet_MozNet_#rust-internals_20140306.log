[05:14:21] <sfackler> acrichto: Any idea on what to name a Writer version of Buffer/what to rename Buffer to?
[05:14:45] <acrichto> I thought Buffer was the writer version?
[05:14:49] <acrichto> we want to rename it?
[05:15:23] <sfackler> Buffer extends Reader, not Writer
[05:15:52] <Yurume> uh, does Writer need a *trait* for buffered interface?
[05:15:52] <sfackler> is there already a Writer equivalent?
[05:15:53] <acrichto> oh indeed
[05:15:59] <acrichto> do we need a writer equivalent?
[05:16:05] <sfackler> Yurume: it gives direct access to the buffer
[05:16:10] <Yurume> unputc?
[05:16:14] <Yurume> (so to say)
[05:16:30] <acrichto> seems like kinda an odd thing to do
[05:16:34] <sfackler> acrichto: I'm working on stream-ifying Hex and Base64 and calling read over and over for every 2/4 bytes is painful perf-wise
[05:16:54] <acrichto> that's why you'd always use a buffered writer?
[05:17:06] <acrichto> looking directly at the buffer is the same as calling write(), no?
[05:17:10] <sfackler> I mean, the same can be said for doing stuff on buffer
[05:17:21] <sfackler> looking at the buffer means that you don't need your own buffer
[05:17:39] <sfackler> I'd like to avoid having to have these Writer adapters have to malloc 1k or whatever
[05:17:47] <acrichto> ?
[05:18:07] <sfackler> 1 sec
[05:18:11] <acrichto> you also don't want to restrict writers to *only* buffered writers?
[05:18:58] <Yurume> I don't see the point, one can simply document that streamified Hex and Base64 is more efficient with a buffered writer, and BufferedWriter simply can do that job.
[05:19:02] <sfackler> here's the current impl: https://gist.github.com/sfackler/3da205791521c80a843c
[05:19:46] <sfackler> Yurume: that's an argument for eliminating Buffer as well
[05:20:07] <acrichto> sfackler: I would want to measure a perf improvement before looking to add a buffered writer trait
[05:20:14] <sfackler> (I'm also seeing really bad perf from MemWriter compared to BufferedWriter)
[05:20:22] <Yurume> sfackler: Buffer is somewhat different, since it can also allows for inspecting the buffer.
[05:20:55] <acrichto> MemWriter suffers because it supports seek
[05:20:57] <acrichto> a little
[05:21:04] <acrichto> but they're likely not ideal
[05:21:29] <sfackler> I'm seeing 139MB/S with a MemWriter and 243MB/S from a BufferedWriter
[05:21:36] <Yurume> uh, wait, is MemWriter based on ~[u8] and not on Vec<u8>?
[05:21:44] <sfackler> probably
[05:21:54] <Yurume> that'd be quite problematic soon
[05:22:04] <sfackler> it's a trivial change
[05:22:30] <acrichto> what's the underlying writer on a buffered writer?
[05:22:33] <Yurume> would we convert all ~[u8] into Vec<u8> systematically? I didn't think so, but...
[05:22:36] <sfackler> but anyways, it seems like we should have a Buffer trait for both readers and writers, or neither
[05:22:44] <sfackler> acrichto: NullWriter
[05:22:54] <sfackler> but the buffer is big enough to fit everything
[05:23:07] <sfackler> so it should't ever flush
[05:24:45] <acrichto> I think the Seek impl is hurting MemWriter
[05:24:48] <sfackler> acrichto: here's the entire file with benchmark numbers: https://gist.github.com/sfackler/a8d3d44e467711ff1618
[05:25:11] <Yurume> thinking about it, Buffer can act both as Reader and Writer if you want: fn fill<'a>(&'a mut self) -> IoResult<&'a *mut* [u8]>; fn consume/* rather rename to advance */(&self, amt: uint);
[05:26:17] <Yurume> that actually has some interesting consequences; ungetc with an arbitrary character is possible, for example.
[05:27:25] <acrichto> sfackler: I suspect you can optimize MemWriter

[05:36:44] <acrichto> you could take a generic buffer instead of a specific buffer
[05:37:37] <sfackler> sure, but why would you want to take a buffer instead of any reader?
[05:38:02] <acrichto> read_line()
[05:38:10] <acrichto> buffers implement more methods than generic readers
[05:38:13] <acrichto> it was not a perf decision
[05:38:22] <acrichto> although buffers exist because of perf
[05:38:34] <acrichto> there is no efficient method of reading a line other than with a buffer

[05:40:06] <sfackler> right, but it *could* have been written by looping over read_byte, just like this hex writer is implemented by writing 2 bytes at a time
[05:40:38] <acrichto> it's different though
[05:40:51] <acrichto> well hm
[05:41:21] <Yurume> sfackler: how about potential read_uint() method, which reads a string representation of integers and nothing else?
[05:41:46] <Yurume> so that "314x" should consume "314" but not "x" while it has to know about "x" anyway.

[05:43:42] <Yurume> (not because of API but because of borrowck)
[05:43:49] <sfackler> I agree that Buffer is awesome, which is why I want more of it!

[06:18:25] <ecr> cmr: it's going alright. niko had already created a typed model of the language with evaluation semantics (but no typechecking) before I got involved. I've been experimenting with a typeless version recently. That's almost done and I'll probably start working on a typing judgment for the typed model.

[06:19:59] <ecr> the high level overview is pretty understandable
[06:20:38] <ecr> step 1: create a much simpler language that contains all the bits of the language you care about. if you can eliminate a language feature by expanding it into other features, do so
[06:21:07] <ecr> so for example, we can model traits with explicit dictionaries, so we don't need traits in the model langauge
[06:22:03] <Yurume> is there a model with evaluation semantics already? I wasn't aware of that (I knew it was in progress though).
[06:22:17] <ecr> step 2: define a bunch of inference rules to determine the type of an expression. usually these are recursive. you can type an expression by constructing a proof using those rules.
[06:23:28] <ecr> step 3: define a bunch more inference rules to define how evaluation works. something like "if x -> y, then x *c -> y * c". you can evaluate an expression by constructing another proof as before

[06:23:44] <ecr> step 4: prove two lemmas: progress and preservation
[06:24:25] <ecr> preservation means that if an expression type checks and can take an evaluation step, then the result also type checks and has the same type (so evaluation preserves types)
[06:24:46] <ecr> progress means that if an expression type checks then it either is a value or can take an evaluation step
[06:25:24] <ecr> preservation + progress can be used to show that anything that type checks will not get stuck during evaluation, which is called soundness
[06:25:34] <cmr> evaluation step being one step closer towards actually being a value, right?
[06:25:39] <ecr> right
[06:25:48] <cmr> mmm
[06:26:24] <ecr> we're doing this with a multi-tiered approach

[06:31:04] <ecr> anyway, the tier we're working on now is a PLT Redex model. it's easy to experiment with, but it only tests properties so it doesn't give us a proof
[06:31:21] <ecr> once we're satisfied there, we'll move on to actually proving things
[06:31:35] <ecr> probably start with a paper proof
[06:32:18] <ecr> I might eventually do it in a proof assistant, like Coq (or Agda / Idris).
[06:32:21] <Yurume> you mean that you want to eventually make a mechanized proof?
[06:32:53] <ecr> Yurume: I'd like to personally.
[06:32:59] <Yurume> I'm not good at Coq but that'd be quite huge undertaking...
[06:33:08] <ecr> indeed
[06:33:31] <ecr> although this would only be type soundness, not a verified compiler
[06:33:46] <ecr> anyway
[06:34:06] <ecr> cmr, once we have type soundness for the current model we can start doing a whole bunch of other things
[06:34:22] <Yurume> (while I only did the paper proof, I had a colleague that did a huge amount of Coq proofs for some core language with multiple dispatch)
[06:34:23] <ecr> like testing potential extensions (e.g. HKTs) to make sure they're safe
[06:34:37] <cmr> fancy indeed.
[06:34:45] <ecr> or making a verified compiler
[06:35:20] <ecr> Yurume: it's pretty intense. I've had some experience with Coq, but I'm definitely a beginner still
[06:35:57] <ecr> cmr: and once we have a type soundness proof, we can actually back up the "Rust is memory safe" claim.
[06:36:14] <cmr> ecr: does type soundness include the region system?
[06:36:16] <ecr> if we made a verified compiler/interpreter, then we'd have an oracle against which to test rustc
[06:36:19] <ecr> cmr: yes
[06:36:20] <cmr> or would it build on top of it
[06:36:22] <cmr> ok.

[06:36:53] <ecr> the interaction of regions and linear types is actually the interesting part for Rust
[06:37:00] <ecr> most of the rest is fairly standard
[06:38:16] <ecr> unless we accidentally extend generics or traits in a way that enables dependent types
[06:38:21] <ecr> then things will get messy

[06:57:00] <sfackler> The way I've always seen length headers done is to write the data into a buffer, write the length of the buffer and then write the buffer. I have no idea how that would stand up perf-wise though
[06:57:13] <sfackler> that's how e.g. postgres does things
[06:57:31] <sfackler> it may be a net win for perf if it significantly speeds up MemWriter
[06:57:35] <acrichto> we may be able to do that

[07:00:39] <sfackler> I think it'd end up just being that Encoder would keep track of a stack of MemWriters instead of a stack of size_positions
[07:00:55] <sfackler> it may save space on the encoded format since it won't force 4-byte sizes as well
[07:01:06] <sfackler> maybe i'll experiment a bit

[07:27:08] <ecr> you can use lvalues in rvalues (use a variable)
[07:27:14] <cmr> ok.
[07:27:53] <ecr> see the lv and rv sections in here: https://github.com/anasazi/rust-redex/blob/master/rust.rkt
[07:28:52] <ecr> note: in this setup you can't nest expressions. basically every intermediate expression is given a name (assigned to a variable)
[07:29:03] <ecr> niko had it that way before I started
[07:29:09] <ecr> not sure why
[07:29:10] <cmr> like an ssa form?
[07:29:36] <ecr> similar
[07:30:02] <cmr> heh, I like how Option is built into it.
[07:30:22] <ecr> yeah
[07:30:44] <ecr> it did that instead of general enums b/c it encodes enough of the behavior of enums that he was concerned with
[07:30:52] <ecr> i'm working on generalizing it
[07:31:08] <ecr> if you go down to sum-main you can see what a program would look like
[07:32:08] <cmr> almost somewhat a little bit like rust if you squint
[07:33:13] <cmr> so what is this actually doing? testing that certain programs reduce to a certain value?
[07:35:12] <ecr> yes, and testing that the heap is changed in the expected way
[07:35:40] <ecr> reduction rules are at the bottom
[07:35:40] <cmr> I tried to understand this before some months ago but it is starting to make more sense.
[07:36:11] <ecr> metafunctions are just functions on the object language (patina) instead of regular racket functions

[11:22:12] <huon> Yurume: how'd you find all the duplicate words?
[11:22:15] <Yurumechan> awww I horribly broke rebase. :S
[11:22:29] <eddyb> which rebase?
[11:22:32] <Yurumechan> huon: simple vim filter.
[11:22:40] <huon> even over multiple lines?
[11:22:48] <eddyb> huon/m
[11:22:51] <Yurumechan> my branch shortly broke due to wrong rebase
[11:22:57] <eddyb> 'dis the 2000
[11:23:05] <Yurumechan> huon: vim supports some crazy regex
[11:23:12] <eddyb> Yurumechan: I broke --onto yesterday by giving it HEAD~1 instead of HEAD~2
[11:23:16] <huon> eddyb: but they may have `///` at the start of them
[11:23:24] <huon> or *
[11:23:31] <Yurumechan> eddyb : XD
[11:23:43] <eddyb> Yurumechan: but I had a copy of it pushed on github, so I fetched, replaced by branch and rebased again
[11:24:07] <Yurumechan> huon: I simply ignored them as like spaces and filtered false positives myself
[11:24:08] <eddyb> s/by/my
[11:24:27] <huon> oh, neat
[11:24:58] <Yurumechan> afk atm, will talk about that later ;)
[11:28:22] <eddyb> ain't this a lovely day in London? (it's been really grim outside, for weeks now)
[11:28:56] <eddyb> who needs sun when your city can look like nuclear winter?
[11:29:28] <eddyb> huon: cloning &T is just a copy of the pointer, right?
[11:29:41] <huon> in general yes
[11:29:52] <huon> but autoderef can turn it into a T clone
[11:30:04] <eddyb> it's generic code so it should be fine
[11:30:06] <huon> are you in london?
[11:30:21] <eddyb> huon: london would probably look better >_>
[11:30:37] <eddyb> just poking at the weather
[11:31:02] <eddyb> huon: I'm trying to understand the way IrMaps are passed down
[11:31:38] <eddyb> I can't give &mut T as the context type for Visitor, as it can't be cloned
[11:32:25] <eddyb> but I think I can move it to the type that implements Visitor and get rid of more RefCell's

[11:34:59] <eddyb> yeah, environment, that's what I meant
[11:36:21] <huon> making it part of the struct seems like a good plan
[11:36:48] <eddyb> I'll just implement Visitor<()> for IrMaps<'a> and remove the struct

[12:22:39] <eddyb> kimundi: not auto, just a helper
[12:25:29] <kimundi> eddyb: Hm, Deref turns a &P<T> into a &T, and with Pod you can do &T -> T. Is therea way to tread both operations the same?
[12:25:56] <kimundi> Like, both are a deref in a sense
[12:26:37] <kimundi> Does &T implement Deref?

[12:47:16] <eddyb> kimundi: no... it could, if no code ever calls it
[12:47:25] <eddyb> (apart from generic code)
[12:47:53] <eddyb> kimundi: a deref doesn't produce a T, it produces a T lvalue, which is a C++ reference
[12:48:05] <eddyb> there is no way to describe that kind of lvalue in the language
[12:48:29] <eddyb> *x = y; should work even when y is Pod
[12:48:33] <kimundi> eddyb: Right, I meant the case where the lvalue turns into a rvalue
[12:48:53] <kimundi> like map(|x| *x)
[12:49:27] <eddyb> that's copying out of an lvalue

[13:10:38] <eddyb> kimundi: haha https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/12730#issuecomment-36850006
[13:11:12] <kimundi> eddyb: Well, its a valid point to consider! ;)
[13:11:25] <eddyb> http://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1zlq21/should_rust_be_more_careful_with_unicode/ I like the sound of grapheme clusters being just as well supported as bytes and codepoints
[13:11:48] <kimundi> yeah meht too
[13:12:11] <kimundi> what I didn't like was the epiphany that "codepoint" is the wrong term for what we have :P
[13:12:44] <kimundi> "unicode scalar value"... urgh
[13:13:00] <eddyb> USV
[13:13:00] <kimundi> suddenly "grapheme cluster" becomes the nicer terminology :P
[13:13:08] <eddyb> sounds like something from starcraft
[13:13:34] <kimundi> Well, that issue also mentioned the abbreviation "ucs" for it
[13:13:59] <kimundi> "unicode code, scalar"
[13:15:18] <kimundi> "foo".bytes(), "foo".ucss(), "foo".clusters()
[13:15:36] <eddyb> uc32?
[13:15:43] <eddyb> unicode codepoint (32 bits)
[13:16:01] <kimundi> hmmmm... that might work better
[13:16:10] <eddyb> uc21 or something like that if you want to be (even more) technical :P
[13:16:37] <eddyb> and leave the possibility of bit packing optimizations open
[13:17:08] <kimundi> well, again its not a codepoint, its a codepoint without the surrogate pairs, so a scalar value...
[13:17:23] <eddyb> ohh right
[13:17:33] <eddyb> us21? lol
[13:18:29] <Zr40> the name uc21 would become wrong if unicode ever gets a 33rd plane
[13:18:51] <kimundi> Unlikely to happen though
[13:19:13] <kimundi> Unicode fills hardly 10% of the current range
[13:19:18] <eddyb> Zr40: but so would our optimizations!
[13:19:33] <Zr40> eddyb: they don't depend on the name, do they? :)
[13:19:35] <eddyb> (if we had them)
[13:19:46] <eddyb> you'd have to use a different type to actually make the extra planes work

[15:56:43] <nmatsakis> eddyb: so I'm reading PR #12610, got about 1000 lines of diff to go ;) one non-nit comment:
[15:56:56] <nmatsakis> we need to check for an infinite loop in autoderef
[15:57:12] <nmatsakis> I think we just use a counter, because I don't care to impose the type system limitations needed to do otherwise.
[15:57:20] <nmatsakis> (though I plan to raise this general issue in the mtg today)
[15:57:39] <nmatsakis> we should also add a test for a Smaht<T> that derefs to Smaht<T> and check it doesn't infinite loop
[15:57:55] <nmatsakis> as a side-effect, we can remove  the existing occurs_check call that is in that loop
[15:58:07] <nmatsakis> I figure it should just report an error and stop
[15:58:24] <eddyb> it's a loop, so 1000 derefs won't hurt it, right?
[15:58:58] <eddyb> rusti: let mut x; loop {x = ~x; x.foo;}
[15:58:58] -rusti- <anon>:10:34: 10:39 error: type inference failed because I could not find a type
[15:58:59] -rusti-  that's both of the form <generic #3> and of the form @<generic #3> - such a type would have to be infinitely large.
[15:58:59] -rusti- <anon>:10         let mut x; loop {x = ~x; x.foo;}
[15:58:59] -rusti-                                            ^~~~~
[15:58:59] -rusti- application terminated with error code 101
[15:59:13] <eddyb> nmatsakis: ^^ that error has interesting information in it, but it also awkwardly phrased
[15:59:35] <nmatsakis> eddyb: are you asking if 1000 is a suitable threshold?
[16:00:14] <eddyb> yeah, I like round numbers
[16:00:19] <eddyb> though 1024 is round, not 1000
[16:00:34] <nmatsakis> if so, I think that's fine. I intend (in a separate issue) to suggest we introduce a general "recursion threshold" that is configurable per crate.
[16:00:43] <nmatsakis> for now it's enough to just use a static constant and check 
[16:00:52] <nmatsakis> it might be nice to consolidate the (similar) check we have to do during monomorpihzation
[16:00:59] <nmatsakis> let me check whether that occurs
[16:01:11] <eddyb> recursive generics?
[16:01:26] <eddyb> rusti: fn foo<T>(){foo<(T, T)>();}
[16:01:27] -rusti- pastebinned 8 lines of output: http://sprunge.us/aTBV
[16:01:31] <nmatsakis> ah, middle/trans/monomorphize.rs, it's just super hard coded to 30
[16:01:42] <eddyb> rusti: fn foo<T>(){foo::<(T, T)>();} foo::<int>()
[16:01:42] -rusti- <anon>:10:9: 10:38 error: overly deep expansion of inlined function
[16:01:42] -rusti- <anon>:10         fn foo<T>(){foo::<(T, T)>();} foo::<int>()
[16:01:42] -rusti-                   ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[16:01:42] -rusti- application terminated with error code 101
[16:01:43] <nmatsakis> eddyb: ^ i'd say make a static constant somewhere for now and have both of them reference it
[16:01:52] <eddyb> in the driver?
[16:01:56] <nmatsakis> sure
[16:02:03] <nmatsakis> I mean the ideal thing
[16:02:07] <eddyb> or session... I could make it Cell in session
[16:02:07] <nmatsakis> would be a field in the crate context
[16:02:19] <nmatsakis> i'd like to configurable using an annotation on the crate
[16:02:27] <nmatsakis> e.g., #[recursionlimit(3000)]
[16:02:36] <nmatsakis> because there might be SOME crates for which a deeper stack is needed
[16:02:38] <eddyb> since Session is available to both typeck and trans
[16:02:46] <nmatsakis> sure, that's fine
[16:03:28] <eddyb> right, I should get on with my @ removal. one error left
[16:03:40] <eddyb> and then I can come back, fix the lifetime nit and add this feature
[16:04:24] <nmatsakis> eddyb: that's fine. I have some other nits but I'll wait till i'm done to send them to you -- the lifetimes thing is fine as long as there's a reason btw
[16:04:44] <eddyb> there isn't here, just Option being opaque to regionck
[16:04:52] <nmatsakis> eddyb: for now, can you avoid rebasing when you apply the fix, so I can easily diff between what you had and what you changed?
[16:04:56] <nmatsakis> yes, that's a reason
[16:05:03] <nmatsakis> but it can be worked around
[16:05:05] <nmatsakis> might be better to do so
[16:05:20] <eddyb> I know how to do it, it's just that I didn't think of it then
[16:05:33] <eddyb> the worst lifetime contraption I've had to deal with is in the pretty printer context
[16:06:21] <eddyb> in one PR only one permutation worked, in another PR only a completely different permutation worked. bizarre stuff, I think I ended up removing one of the borrowed pointers

[16:12:45] <nmatsakis> maybe a bit
[16:13:43] <eddyb> nmatsakis: I wonder if I'll blow the stack putting all the contexts in it
[16:14:31] <eddyb> HashMaps will go up to ~100 bytes with the robin hood changes, and these contexts have several hashmaps each
[16:14:45] <eddyb> fn(){fn(){fn(){}}} can use a KBs of stack
[16:14:50] <eddyb> *a few
[16:15:15] <eddyb> but it's trivial to add indirection with ~ so I don't care
[16:15:55] <eddyb> maybe_load_env: <'b> |&'b Block<'b>| -> &'b Block<'b>) {
[16:16:07] <eddyb> nmatsakis: ^^ does that work o_O?
[16:16:15] <eddyb> it's... a type lambda
[16:16:19] *** Quits: jdm (jdm@CAB30FBD.8F96AEA7.2D179A7D.IP) (Quit: Lost terminal)
[16:16:30] <nmatsakis> it's not a type lambda, and yes it works.
[16:16:41] <eddyb> I thought that syntax was broken or something
[16:16:50] <nmatsakis> that's not the broken syntax
[16:16:59] <nmatsakis> the broken syntax is 'a |...| -> ...
[16:17:03] <eddyb> riight
[16:17:39] <eddyb> so a function taking a closure taking a reference and returning one with the same lifetime...
[16:17:40] <nmatsakis> anyway, yeah you can have bound lifetimes in closure types. horrible pain in the butt, but so nice (and super common)
[16:17:54] <eddyb> should I make the function generic, or the closure?
[16:18:13] <nmatsakis> that depends on what you want
[16:18:19] <eddyb> trans_closure itself (har har) is generic over 'a
[16:18:33] <nmatsakis> it's done the way it is for a reason,
[16:18:38] <eddyb> but it doesn't do anything with it and has a <'b> |&'b ...| thing there
[16:18:39] <nmatsakis> so are you planning on changing it for some reason?
[16:18:47] <nmatsakis> right
[16:18:53] <nmatsakis> point is:
[16:18:54] <eddyb> I hope I don't have to
[16:18:59] <nmatsakis> if you put it on the closure
[16:19:07] <eddyb> but why is the function generic?
[16:19:10] <nmatsakis> then it's the caller of the closure that specifies the lifetime
[16:19:19] <nmatsakis> probably because pcwalton was editing things with a perl script
[16:19:26] <eddyb> hehe
[16:19:37] <nmatsakis> in this case, you want that on the closure, iirc,
[16:19:41] <nmatsakis> because the data goes on the sack
[16:19:42] <nmatsakis> *stack
[16:19:47] <nmatsakis> er, sorry
[16:19:55] <nmatsakis> but rather the lifetime of the block is internal to the fn
[16:19:58] <nmatsakis> anyway
[16:20:06] * kimundi thinks its exciting that there are still parts of the languages that he has no clue about, like this
[16:20:13] <eddyb> @CrateContext -> &'a CrateContext<'a>
[16:20:20] <eddyb> but in function arguments I can omit the lifetimes
[16:20:32] <eddyb> I hope I can do that here and get away with it
[16:21:18] <eddyb> nmatsakis: so because lifetime erasure, we can have Java-like "generics" over them?
[16:21:30] <eddyb> in crazy places
[16:22:14] <eddyb> I'm trying to think of an use for a more general notation... maybe with lifetime bounds/constraints?
[16:25:07] <eddyb> nmatsakis: did I tell you about wanting to remove get_mut from local_data?
[16:29:23] <eddyb> I bet brson is going to question me about https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/12652#issuecomment-36906024

[17:51:56] <kimundi> eddyb: Hm, care to explain to me what exactly the CFG is/contains, in comparision to whatever it would replace?
[17:52:52] <eddyb> it's a graph containing type level (semantical I should say) information instead of the AST, which is a tree containing syntactical information
[17:53:04] <eddyb> overloaded ops become method calls

[17:54:11] <eddyb> as zwarich (I hope I'm not mistaking them for someone else) made me realize yesterday, we could be emitting phi's ourselves
[17:54:23] <eddyb> for something like let x = if a {b} else {c};
[17:54:57] <eddyb> but that's hard to do with just the AST, compared to a CFG
[17:55:00] <kimundi> ah, okay, so its the logical result you get after you ran a few compile phases over the AST
[17:55:04] <eddyb> kinda
[17:55:17] <eddyb> kimundi: all the analysis passes after type checking would work much better (and be smaller) with a CFG
[17:55:40] <kimundi> I bet
[17:55:46] <eddyb> borrowck for example shouldn't have to care that an arithmetic expression is an overloaded op, it should see a method call, which it is

[17:57:59] <eddyb> yeah
[17:58:30] <eddyb> you should be able to drop the AST as you're creating the CFG
[17:59:00] <eddyb> encode only the CFG in metadata (that would make trans faster for inlined functions)
[17:59:20] <kimundi> Iterator<Ast> -> Iterator<Cfg>. Lets turn the compiler into a single line of iterator chains!
[18:00:02] <eddyb> we may need HKT to be generic over folding
