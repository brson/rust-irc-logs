[00:57:49] <eternaleye> You know, reading more about SGX, I find myself really wanting to try and integrate it into a capability-based microkernel
[00:58:18] <bascule> eternaleye: I just want to try using SGX period (with Rust)
[00:58:19] <eternaleye> Have something provide the ability to spawn a "seal/unseal" cap pair, backed by a tiny SGX enclave that encapsulates the key
[00:58:32] <bascule> that'd be cool
[00:59:02] <eternaleye> bascule: It'd be a primitive that could be used for damn near anything, too
[00:59:36] <eternaleye> bascule: Especially if it takes a cap, and returns a cap that seals any data sent over it
[00:59:44] <eternaleye> (or unseals)
[01:00:02] <eternaleye> bascule: (where sealing is AEAD, or signcryption in the asymmetric case)
[01:00:11] <bascule> now you just need membranes

[01:01:43] <bascule> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-capability_model
[01:01:46] <bascule> ^^^ mentions them
[01:01:55] <bascule> "Deep attenuation refers to the case where the same attenuation is applied transitively to any objects obtained via the original attenuated object, typically by use of a "membrane"."
[01:02:06] <eternaleye> Mm
[01:02:11] <eternaleye> Yeah, makes sense
[01:02:16] <bascule> imagine applying sealers/unsealers to an object graph containing capabilities
[01:02:25] <eternaleye> Yup
[01:02:49] <eternaleye> it's pretty easy if your message format is ([caps], [bytes])
[01:02:59] <eternaleye> Then you just seal the bytes with AEAD, and interpose the caps
[01:03:06] <eternaleye> And the interposition is just the same routine
[01:03:29] <eternaleye> (which is why I chose that as my message format for the microkernel I'm designing)

[04:16:00] <c74d> …I still don't see how that relates to Khan, but okay.
[04:16:08] <bascule> lol
[04:16:14] <bascule> actually 2015 is NOT the year of the Tiger
[04:16:22] <c74d> it's a year of the goat or sheep
[04:16:23] <bascule> Ryan Carboni just thinks it is
[04:16:25] <bascule> for some crazy reason
[04:16:37] <bascule> even though 23 out of 24 rounds have been broken
[04:16:58] <bascule> you might remember Tiger from Tiger Tree Hashes popular in P2P apps in the early 2000s
[04:17:06] <bascule> and I hadn't heard then name for nearly a decade
[04:17:15] <bascule> and suddenly this Ryan guy thinks it's the best hash function of 2015
[04:17:24] <bascule> I disagree and say Blake2(b) :o
[04:17:34] <bascule> so did zooko, and thus the point of controversy
[04:17:49] <bascule> also apparently ECC isn't fully baked, and we need to wait another 10 years to trust it
[04:24:06] <Ilari> What's not fully baked about ECC?
[04:25:03] <Ilari> Well, apart of quadratic extensions and related stuff...
[04:25:18] <Ilari> *quadric
[04:27:05] <bascule> Ilari: ECC is new and shiny and scary and was invented last year by the NSA to trick you into not using RSA, the safe, mature option
[04:27:25] <bascule> clearly we need 10 more years of investigation into ECC before it can be trusted
[04:27:36] <bascule> </strawman but close enough>
[04:33:20] <c74d> …unless, like, Tiger → India → Khan?
[04:34:19] <eternaleye> c74d: No, more like "A scream of frustration directed skywards, because your enemy is too far away to strangle"

[04:35:01] *** Quits: erickt (erickt@moz-njt.vqi.14.76.IP) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[04:35:49] <bascule> there are people who seem to care a lot about crypto but have really bad opinions
[04:36:00] <c74d> ah, 'k. I was aware of what you were referencing (though I don't generally know much about Star Trek), but I wasn't aware of what you meant by it.
[04:36:14] <bascule> like RSA is great, let's keep using for key exchange and encryption because ECC is scary
[04:37:03] <bascule> I think it's because the mathematics of RSA are simple enough to write down on a whiteboard... nevermind if they actually understand how the trapdoor function works
[04:37:19] <bascule> but explaining ECC involves bringing things like groups into the problem
[04:37:26] <bascule> and that's scary
[04:37:33] <cmr> god forbid we use /algebra/
[04:37:41] <eternaleye> bascule: Wait, since when are groups scary?
[04:37:55] <bascule> eternaleye: if you've never heard of them, I guess
[04:38:41] <bascule> I feel like these people don't actually understand RSA, but are comfortable enough with the concepts to feel secure
[04:38:45] <bascule> factoring numbers is hard
[04:38:55] <bascule> why is the discrete logarithm problem hard? what's a discrete logarithm?
[04:39:12] <Ilari> Nevermind that RSA problem hasn't been shown to be equivalent to factoring.
[04:39:15] <eternaleye> bascule: "As long as it has these properties, we can call any operation 'addition', and the same holds for various other operations. So long as you have 'multiplication', 'exponentiation', and 'modular arithmetic', you have DLP. Thus, we can translate Diffie-Hellman into the elliptic-curve setting."
[04:39:35] <bascule> sure
[04:39:51] <bascule> I'm not sure these people even understand finite field Diffie-Hellman
[04:40:03] <eternaleye> bascule: Sure, but they argue RSA is safe because of time unbroken
[04:40:07] <bascule> yep
[04:40:12] <eternaleye> bascule: Which gives a nice way to kick them in the teeth :D
[04:40:16] <bascule> it's... not that much more time?
[04:40:18] <bascule> a decade?
[04:40:39] <eternaleye> bascule: Because, well, FF-DHE was _the_ first public-key cryptosystem published openly
[04:40:49] <bascule> yep, I was talking about ECC with the last comment
[04:40:53] <eternaleye> bascule: Sure
[04:41:11] <eternaleye> But describing things as trivial transformations of well-understood things is a good psychological lever
[04:41:41] <bascule> that's where djb and Tanje's talke was nice
[04:41:54] <bascule> lol talk
[04:42:05] <eternaleye> It was an ephemeral talk.
[04:42:15] <bascule> it could be done better
[04:42:21] <bascule> I hope Steve Weis does it better at DEFCON, heh
[04:42:31] <bascule> like, start with the clock metaphor
[04:42:39] <bascule> go through the various generators
[04:42:49] <eternaleye> And for ECC, bring up Salvador Dali? :P
[04:43:04] <bascule> "we could pick 1, but that would be bad, because any number to the first power is itself!"
[04:43:11] <bascule> hahaha eternaleye 
[04:43:14] <bascule> that'd be awesome
[04:43:27] <eternaleye> It might actually be a good one
[04:43:32] <bascule> it would!
[04:43:35] <eternaleye> Because it's (sort of) a transformed space
[04:44:10] <eternaleye> In that "moving along the clock" is more than just a circle, but is still defined

[13:46:19] <Ilari> On raw message level, the scheme I have been working on would be vulernable, except due to the way it does contexts, it never gives attacker enough control to pull off the attack I'm thinking of.
[13:49:30] <Ilari> And this applies even if context is always NULL.
[14:10:46] <eternaleye> Tiffany: I... don't really see it being much beloved?
[14:11:03] <Tiffany> it's been mentioned a lot
[14:11:07] <Tiffany> does it have nice properties or something?
[14:11:15] <eternaleye> Tiffany: Ah, that's a different thing from "beloved"
[14:11:38] <eternaleye> Tiffany: For the longest time, it's basically been _the_ consensus algorithm (and its variants)
[14:11:52] <Tiffany> I don't know how to compare it to other consensus mechanisms I know about like bitcoin's proof of work or the stellar consensus protoocl
[14:11:56] <eternaleye> Tiffany: So every new consensus algorithm either was a new variant of Paxos, or compared itself against Paxos
[14:11:57] <Tiffany> ah
[14:12:08] <Tiffany> when did that change?
[14:12:15] <eternaleye> Not sure it has.
[14:12:20] <Tiffany> oh
[14:12:28] <eternaleye> Even Stellar SCP's paper compares itself against Paxos
[14:12:35] <Tiffany> I don't think I've read that
[14:13:05] <eternaleye> Raft _defines_ itself as "Like Paxos, but not brain-melting"
[14:13:18] <eternaleye> (I disagree with their premise that Paxos is brain-melting, though)
[14:14:04] <Tiffany> I wonder if there's something that compares basic properties of various consensus protocols
[14:14:30] <Tiffany> it seems like paxos requires a single leader to exist somewhere, although it looks like it can change dynamically?
[14:14:48] <eternaleye> Tiffany: That's pretty standard as an efficiency thing, but not required
[14:15:08] <eternaleye> Tiffany: Basically, a constant leader saves you 1RTT/election in the common case
[14:16:24] <eternaleye> The concept of Paxos is actually really simple.
[14:17:08] <eternaleye> In the "Accept?" phase, the Proposer (think of them as a lobbyist) goes around asking people "Will you take the time to listen to my idea?" - but does not actually give the idea yet
[14:17:41] <eternaleye> The Acceptors only say "yes" if the Proposer shows they've taken into account the other proposals floating around (highest ID)
[14:17:59] <eternaleye> And if a new, higher ID comes along, they drop the old lobbyist like a rock.
[14:18:14] <eternaleye> (Imagine "higher ID" as "Bigger campaign contribution")
[14:18:55] <eternaleye> Now, in the "Accept!" phase, the lobbyist says "Okay, everyone whose listening to me: My idea is X"
[14:19:16] <eternaleye> If the number of people listening is STRICTLY more than half, X passes.
[14:19:22] <eternaleye> Done.
[14:20:04] <eternaleye> *who's
[14:20:42] <eternaleye> Now for the error cases:
[14:20:56] *** Quits: erickt (erickt@moz-njt.vqi.14.76.IP) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[14:21:05] <eternaleye> If the lobbyist asks someone to listen and they've already seen a higher ID, they tell the lobbyist about the competing proposal
[14:21:19] <eternaleye> That lets the lobbyist revise their position and start again
[14:21:50] <eternaleye> And if the lobbyist's idea fails in "Accept!", then they increment their ID by one and try again.
[14:22:19] <eternaleye> (Since the winning ID is at-least one higher, that guarantees someone will tell them what the newer proposal was)
[14:22:58] <eternaleye> Most of the problem with "complexity" in Paxos comes down to two things:
[14:23:06] <eternaleye> *Crappy* explanations
[14:23:13] <eternaleye> Many, many variations for performance

[16:56:36] <bascule> eternaleye: 
[17:03:15] <Ilari> Also, regarding ECC randomization, I don't think there is a curve such that it is efficient in software and efficient in RSA-multiplier-based hardware.
[17:04:54] <Ilari> One can construct curves that are efficient in software and have small maximum run of order, but I don't think those are very safe against hardware SCA (due to regular bit pattern in order).
[17:19:41] <eternaleye> bascule: You know how some people collect stamps? I collect explanatory analogies in much the same way.
[17:31:44] <bascule> heh
[17:32:06] <bascule> I've tried to read Paxos Made Simple and linked it to a lot of people
[17:32:10] <bascule> and the main reaction I get is
[17:32:18] <bascule> "that's not plain English"
[17:32:19] <bascule> heh
[17:32:51] <bascule>  For any v and n, if a proposal with value v and number n is issued,
[17:32:51] <bascule> then there is a set S consisting of a majority of acceptors such that
[17:32:51] <bascule> either (a) no acceptor in S has accepted any proposal numbered less
[17:32:51] <bascule> than n, or (b) v is the value of the highest-numbered proposal among
[17:32:51] <bascule> all proposals numbered less than n accepted by the acceptors in S.
[17:32:53] <bascule> We can therefore satisfy P2b by maintaining the invariance of P2c
[17:33:18] <bascule> I'm sure Leslie Lamport thinks this is plain English
[17:34:13] <Ilari> Wasn't there some catastrophic security bug in standard Java SSL code semi-recently (IIRC, allowing totally bypassing certificate validation)?
[17:34:31] <bascule> Ilari: yes, SKIP-TLS
[17:35:06] * bascule has to support JCE/JSSE stuff :(
[17:35:17] <bascule> fortunately none of it terminates TLS externally, but
[17:36:54] <Ilari> I was thinking, are there versions of Java that have 1024-bit DH limit but are not vulernable to SKIP-TLS?
[17:40:48] <Ilari> ... Apparently there are. :-/
[17:46:23] <bascule> yes
[17:46:33] <bascule> I've just been suggesting shutting off DHE in Java
[17:46:55] <bascule> especially because if you have it enabled and the server responds with incompatible (i.e. actually secure) groups, it aborts the handshake
[18:41:50] <Ilari> Any other clients with 1024-bit limit for DH besides Java 6 and 7?
[18:43:27] <bascule> Java 7 supports 2048-bit
[18:44:52] <Ilari> Ah, so know any other clients besides Java 6 that "support" DHE but can't deal with 2048-bit key?
[18:47:44] <Ilari> Also, apparently Apple TLS stacks before iOS 9 / Mac OS X 10.11 can't deal with AEAD ciphers...
[18:49:09] <eternaleye> Ilari: Well, Java 7 still asplodes on anything > 2048 though, IIRC
[18:49:57] <Ilari> Yeah, but 2048 isn't that bad currently (but might be in future).
[18:50:41] <eternaleye> Ilari: Sure, but it's also only one of the five FF-DHE groups.
[18:50:53] <eternaleye> Ilari: If the server goes for _any_ of the others, kaboom.
[18:55:56] <Ilari> Looked at SSL labs client characteristics database. Apparently Apple products are the only ones it knows that do support TLS 1.2, but don't support AEAD.
[18:56:23] <Ilari> And that everything it has that supports TLS 1.2, also supports ECDHE.
[18:58:30] <Ilari> Bit of programming fun: Write code that checks TLS 1.0-1.2 block padding in strict constant-time way. :-)
[19:04:04] <Ilari> So to cover everything that DB knows, one needs ECDHE_{RSA,ECDSA}_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 and ECDHE_{RSA,ECDSA}WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA
[19:04:21] <Ilari> (TLS 1.2-capable, that is)
[19:06:15] <Ilari> Funkily enough, in TLS1.2, TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 and TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 are the same, except in certain situations in ClientHello.
[19:07:38] <Ilari> Hmm... Let's Encrypt is to go online on week of September 14th... Let's see if I get IPv6 connectivity before that. :-)
