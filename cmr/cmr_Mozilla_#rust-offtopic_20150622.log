[02:03:38] <cmr> I was in a museum the other week and found a schoolbook from the late 1800s, and "cypher" (zero) was considered an advanced topic.
[02:04:28] <cmr> "The concept of zero (which was also called "cipher"), which is now common knowledge, was alien to medieval Europe, so confusing and ambiguous to common Europeans that in arguments people would say "talk clearly and not so far fetched as a cipher".

[02:57:26] <amstrad> Quxxy: tho, im specifically talking nodejs, (i am not a fan of JS scripting int he browser)
[02:57:49] <amstrad> i mean, who could be a fan of browser scripting, UI dev is painful overall
[02:58:43] <cmr> http://sploid.gizmodo.com/lockheed-martins-new-fusion-reactor-might-change-humani-1646578094
[02:58:45] <cmr> so that might be a thing
[02:58:46] <amstrad> Quxxy: anyway, i kind like the idea of writing low level native components, and exposing them to a fluffy JS scripting interface over the top (as is node with libuv)
[02:59:30] <Astrum|Lap> nodejs isn't too bad, but only because there aren't really that many great alternatives
[02:59:57] <cmr> Elixr is a pretty good alternative IMO.
[03:00:47] <amstrad> Astrum|Lap: yeah, thats true, i think i could live without the JS aspect of nodejs, really, JS's and its single threaded event loop make libuv rather charming to work with, but any language would do the job if it had that event loop characteristic. 
[03:00:53] <cmr> I'd much rather use OTP than pretty much any other platform
[03:01:04] <Astrum|Lap> I've been meaning to look into elixer
[03:01:05] <cmr> *especially* libuv
[03:01:28] <amstrad> cmr: well, its a means to a end, and libuv works well enough
[03:01:33] <aatch> amstrad, have you looked at Go? It's pretty much designed for the exact use-case you're talking about.
[03:01:45] <cmr> amstrad: I disagree that it works well.
[03:01:47] <amstrad> aatch: well, i opted for Rust over Go
[03:02:08] <cmr> Its single-threaded design makes it near impossible to effectively write parallel applications.
[03:02:10] <amstrad> aatch: i don't have a need for Go, i do have a niche to fill with Rust however
[03:02:24] <amstrad> cmr: you can, with fibers
[03:02:24] <aatch> amstrad, that's like opting for a steak over chocolate pudding, hardly comparable.
[03:02:24] <Astrum|Lap> I'd also like to point out that popularity is an important factor too
[03:02:37] <amstrad> aatch: what is?
[03:03:03] <XMPPwocky> more like opting for a live cow and a kitchen over ordering a steak off the menu
[03:03:12] <Astrum|Lap> steak please
[03:03:36] <aatch> amstrad, opting for Rust over Go, they're different enough that you don't really choose one over the other as a value judgement.
[03:03:53] <amstrad> aatch: that's what i mean tho, i have no use for Go
[03:04:28] <amstrad> i started with Rust as it promised checks and balances with regards to concurrency
[03:04:46] <Astrum|Lap> also ease of deployment can be a factor
[03:04:52] <aatch> amstrad, that's fine then, but I'm just saying that Go fills a similar space to node.js
[03:04:54] <amstrad> and, that my primary use case is to develop some VPN / kernel space driver stuff
[03:05:38] <amstrad> aatch: at the moment, node is just fine and does the job perfectly (with a little help from TypeScript)
[03:05:42] <cmr> amstrad: node-fibers still only uses one libuv event loop?
[03:05:56] <amstrad> cmr: can't say i use them much
[03:06:16] <cmr> I guess the applications I care about really just don't lend themselves to being on a single thread when the rest of the CPU is just sitting there twiddling its thumbs.
[03:06:22] <amstrad> cmr: nodes take on things is, if you want concurrency, spawn a new OS process and send and recv messages from it
[03:06:37] <cmr> *parallelism
[03:06:48] <Astrum|Lap> pfft, parallelism
[03:07:00] <amstrad> cmr: well, you can fake it with the approach above
[03:07:02] <cmr> I used to use node a lot and it's useful for simple stuff but I found it didn't scale well in either code complexity or performance, without dropping to C++ for compute.
[03:07:02] <Astrum|Lap> but in all honesty, nodejs is fine for a lot of things
[03:07:18] <cmr> Futures help but only to a point IMO...
[03:07:20] <amstrad> cmr: yeah, you would want to do that
[03:07:26] <amstrad> cmr: promises?
[03:07:30] <cmr> Same thing.
[03:07:44] <amstrad> no, they are different (if we want to be specific about things)

[03:09:34] <amstrad> cmr: i don't see any reason tho why work couldnt be pushed out to a thread pool and yielded back on the main thread in nodejs
[03:09:34] <XMPPwocky> lol
[03:09:37] <Quxxy> amstrad: This is what frustrates me about the "but node.js!" argument: node.js isn't nice because of JavaScript; it's nice because of the event loop
[03:09:47] <XMPPwocky> Astrum|Lap: (because CEF)
[03:09:48] <Quxxy> Rip out JS and substitute Lua and that'd be a big improvement
[03:09:51] <amstrad> Quxxy: that's what im saying
[03:10:03] <XMPPwocky> Quxxy: okay, lua being an improvement, you're gonna need to argue *that*
[03:10:08] <Quxxy> Which is why I regard node.js as *completely irrelevant* to the discussion of whether or not JS is shit :P
[03:10:14] <amstrad> Quxxy: well, JS runs on a event look, and IO works best on a event loop
[03:10:28] <cmr> amstrad: sure, that usually works.
[03:10:30] <amstrad> ^ match made in heaven 
[03:10:31] <Quxxy> XMPPwocky: Aside from weak support for Unicode and base 1 indexing... Lua is pretty nice
[03:10:53] <amstrad> cmr: it goes against the grain with JS tho
[03:10:53] <aatch> Eh, I'd argue that JS's event-handing abilities are middling at best.
[03:10:54] <Quxxy> amstrad: No, JS environments expose an event loop because it can't really *do* anything else
[03:10:58] <Astrum|Lap> Quxxy: Tiffany would disagree with that statement I believe
[03:11:05] <cmr> amstrad: but like, write a 10 million concurrent-client server in libuv, or HAProxy.
[03:11:09] <Quxxy> And even then, it only "supports" it through callbacks
[03:11:16] * WindowsBunny nuzzles Quxxy
[03:11:35] <Astrum|Lap> anyway
[03:11:42] <Quxxy> I mean, you can *make* PHP a semi-decent thing to use
[03:11:50] <amstrad> cmr: just cluster across a single machine, and deploy to several hundred servers, and drop in a few load balancers and you are set
[03:11:56] <cmr> *shudder*

[03:13:41] <amstrad> cmr: sure, but lets look at this another way, its rare you are going to need that amount of scale out off the bat...in this light, node is a ideal means to get you up and running "acceptably" with litter fuss, and it encourages a design where if node isn't "cutting the mustard", you can (and should) be able to swap it for something else
[03:13:41] <cmr> it was *cloud*

[03:15:01] <amstrad> cmr: besides, when node covers like 95% of use cases in the commercial arena, and is tested and works, i don't see a reason not to use it...ill add that, its FAR from being the silver bullet to ALL THE THINGS

[03:15:53] <amstrad> cmr: yeah, but it just comes down to practicality
[03:15:53] <cmr> Java, .NET, PHP all fall in that umbrella of "95% of use cases and is tested and works"
[03:15:57] <Quxxy> :P
[03:16:06] <XMPPwocky> php works?
[03:16:07] <amstrad> cmr: i am a .net head by trade
[03:16:08] <XMPPwocky> (sorry)
[03:16:24] <Astrum|Lap> aatch: so, want to cloud it up? I like money... =P
[03:16:24] <RC9> depends on your definition of works
[03:16:29] <cmr> yeah I shouldn't ahve lumped .NET in with that group, I actually like .NET
[03:16:35] <Tobba> heh
[03:16:39] <cmr> I just plucked 3 big tech stacks off the top of my head
[03:16:42] <Tobba> for fun times, try using obscure features within LLVM
[03:16:44] <RC9> that said, a major programmer pastime is bashing things which arent up to ones standards
[03:16:52] <amstrad> cmr: C# doesn't run single threaded
[03:16:53] <RC9> so at the end of the day... php does serve quite a lot of the web
[03:16:58] <Quxxy> .NET only has a few major problems: UTF-16, and being way too Microsoft for its own good
[03:17:03] <amstrad> well, doesn't "have to"
[03:17:05] <Astrum|Lap> and nothing is up to a programmers standards tbh
[03:17:12] <Astrum|Lap> it's like... the defining characteristic of a programmer
[03:17:13] <XMPPwocky> Tobba: try passing a f32 into inline asm in Rust
[03:17:18] <RC9> Astrum|Lap, exactly :D
[03:17:18] <Tobba> Quxxy: being too microsoft for its own good includes UTF-16
[03:17:23] <Tobba> XMPPwocky: try passing a pointer into a register
[03:17:24] <WindowsBunny> I was inspired to learn PHP when I was 12
[03:17:28] <WindowsBunny> because Neopets used PHP
[03:17:32] <amstrad> Quxxy: nothing wrong with Microsoft mate, besides, Microsoft have open sourced EVERYTHING nowadays
[03:17:34] <XMPPwocky> Tobba: i still haven't figured that out. everything that seems reasonable crashes at runtime or compile-time
[03:17:37] <aatch> Tobba, oh yeah, the paths that clang doesn't use are fragile as all hell.
[03:17:40] <Tobba> (it has to be cast to an usize otherwise it crashes)
[03:17:45] <Quxxy> Tobba: I regard that as an unfortunate, but understandable, technical decision
[03:17:46] <cmr> WindowsBunny: I was more inspired by neopet's use of flash
[03:17:50] * cmr loves neopets
[03:17:54] <Tobba> aatch: even those it does, try the addrspace attribute sometime
[03:17:56] <cmr> erm, loved
[03:17:59] <cmr> although it's totally still up
[03:18:02] <XMPPwocky> i was like 9
[03:18:05] <Quxxy> amstrad: Irrelevant.  In the context of .NET's original release, *no one* trusted MS
[03:18:06] <amstrad> Quxxy: .net isn't the little bubble it used to be
[03:18:14] <aatch> Tobba, clang uses the addrspace attribute?
[03:18:16] <Astrum|Lap> amstrad: they haven't open sourced a lot
[03:18:18] <Quxxy> I mean, for years, no one was really certain whether or not MS was going to squash Mono or not
[03:18:19] <WindowsBunny> cmr: I never was very good at neopets
[03:18:21] <XMPPwocky> and i was going to make a neopets clone with all my web knowledge coming from a "html for dummies" book
[03:18:23] <Tobba> aatch: it doesn't use it, just exposes it
[03:18:29] <amstrad> Quxxy: heaps of people trusted MS
[03:18:35] <Astrum|Lap> apple still probably has more open source code out there
[03:18:37] <Tobba> nearly ever optimization pass that deals with pointers can manage to nick the attribute off
[03:18:44] <Astrum|Lap> but they're the bad guy now
[03:18:46] <Quxxy> amstrad: Yes.  They ended up with large WinForms projects, followed by Silverlight projects :P
[03:18:47] <XMPPwocky> you had to enter a password... by clicking on various links in the correct order
[03:18:48] <Astrum|Lap> or something
[03:19:09] <amstrad> Quxxy: you just mentioned 2 UI stacks
[03:19:12] <WindowsBunny> XMPPwocky: wat
[03:19:13] <XMPPwocky> like, you click on "1" on "1.html", that takes you to "11.html", you click 2, that takes you to "112.html" and so on, and eventually you are logged in
[03:19:18] <Tobba> there's also the fun thing with "all null pointers are invalid", except when you're using addrspace 0 is often a perfectly valid address
[03:19:21] <cmr> XMPPwocky: lol
[03:19:22] <amstrad> Quxxy: no one pays any attention to MS UI stacks
[03:19:23] <XMPPwocky> i didn't know that javascript existed
[03:19:33] <WindowsBunny> XMPPwocky: don't use JS for authentication
[03:19:36] <Quxxy> I used to *really* hope they *would* open up .NET more, and we could replace Java with something technically better
[03:19:40] <amstrad> Quxxy: also, WinForms aint that bad
[03:19:44] <Quxxy> But I lost any enthusiasm for that years ago and moved on
[03:19:47] <Quxxy> I didn't say it was bad
[03:19:52] <XMPPwocky> WindowsBunny: i mean CGI at that point would have been absolutely ridiculous
[03:20:04] <Quxxy> I mean that MS has this nasty habit of releasing great new tech... and then abandoning it shortly thereafter
[03:20:09] <Quxxy> Because LOOK SHINY
[03:20:13] <XMPPwocky> i didn't know what CGI was and I thought google just had a bunch of .html files for all the possible searches you could make
[03:20:16] <amstrad> Silverlight was questionable Quxxy, they wanted a stake in RIA apps, and Flash was all the rage at the time of its release
[03:20:22] <Quxxy> I know
[03:20:25] <WindowsBunny> XMPPwocky: that's horrifying
[03:20:27] <Quxxy> I *wanted* Silverlight to displace Flash
[03:20:32] <Quxxy> But again, it wasn't open enough
[03:20:41] <amstrad> Quxxy: well, its all open now
[03:20:47] <Quxxy> And I didn't *really* trust MS not to abuse their position if it *did* win
[03:20:48] <WindowsBunny> XMPPwocky: At least it's not like a thought I had when I was very little, that every single frame/possibility of a game was premade
[03:21:05] <amstrad> Quxxy: well, it was probably that mindset that lead to them open sourcing everything now
[03:21:10] <Quxxy> Tossing some stuff up on GitHub does *not* rebuild the bridges MS have so thoroughly burned down over the years
[03:21:14] <amstrad> so, can't complain at your distrust
[03:21:19] <Quxxy> That's going to take far more construction effort on their part to show they've changed
[03:21:42] <Astrum|Lap> Quxxy: it's weird being a bit older than a lot of people in here
[03:21:42] <amstrad> Quxxy: what specifically did they do to wrong you so much?
[03:21:48] <Astrum|Lap> I remember when MS was the undisputed bad guy
[03:21:50] <Quxxy> Taking a few experimental steps in new shoes doesn't mean they're going to be a good fit longer-term :)
[03:21:51] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: I just want to see the source to their win32 subsystems so I can understand why the fuck some functions behave weirdly
[03:21:56] <XMPPwocky> Quxxy: and their PR and marketing is very weird and "hello fellow kids"
[03:22:03] <amstrad> Astrum|Lap: 35 here, i remember "how it was"
[03:22:06] <XMPPwocky> something does seem a little off about what they're doing
[03:22:14] <RC9> windows open source
[03:22:16] <Quxxy> amstrad: Recently?  They broke my muscle memory
[03:22:16] <RC9> that would be a sight
[03:22:37] <amstrad> Quxxy: intellisense too useful?
[03:22:37] <Astrum|Lap> RC9: well there was that leak years ago iirc
[03:22:40] <Quxxy> But more broadly, lots of things over the years that just led me to not believe a word they say, not trust that they aren't going to suddenly turn and stab me in the back
[03:22:43] <RC9> leak?
[03:22:43] <WindowsBunny> RC9: It doesn't have to be free software, just making the source code viewable, even if its all rights reserved still
[03:22:44] <RC9> really?
[03:22:47] <Quxxy> amstrad: They moved "New Folder" in windows 10
[03:22:58] <Quxxy> Now, instead of folders, I get new Explorer windows
[03:23:02] <amstrad> Quxxy: the bastards !! :D
[03:23:06] <RC9> ew
[03:23:06] <Astrum|Lap> RC9: give me a bit...
[03:23:09] <RC9> kk
[03:23:32] <Quxxy> At least when they changed Backspace from "up a level" to "back", it still sort-of worked
[03:23:39] <Quxxy> But this?  This is just pointless and capricious
[03:23:46] <Astrum|Lap> http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2004/2/15/71552/7795
[03:23:51] <Astrum|Lap> RC9: ^
[03:23:52] <amstrad> Quxxy: well, they are allowed their own operating system, i can't complain ever about .net (that platform has made me hundreds of thousands of dollars over the years)
[03:23:54] <Astrum|Lap> think that's it
[03:24:23] <Quxxy> amstrad: Sure you can complain; if you think something is perfect, you're wrong and have lost perspective :D
[03:24:42] *** Quits: panicbit (panicbit@moz-vqobnf.dip0.t-ipconnect.de) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[03:24:45] <Quxxy> I quite like .NET as a technology
[03:24:47] <amstrad> Quxxy: its far from perfect, but .net was the closest to perfection that i have seen
[03:24:48] <RC9> i think water is perfect
[03:24:50] <RC9> does that count
[03:24:58] <Quxxy> I don't really trust Microsoft, though
[03:25:21] <amstrad> Quxxy: well, like i say, distrust in MS probably helped lead to them open sourcing all their stuff
[03:25:47] <aatch> .NET is pretty cool. It's like JVM done right.
[03:26:09] <Quxxy> amstrad: And yet, we also have WinRT and the metro lockdown :)
[03:26:21] <amstrad> Quxxy: i distrust closed propitiatory applications from MS, things like SharePoint, CRM and Commerce, mostly because they vendor lock you, but for development tech, its fantastic
[03:26:37] <amstrad> and Excel, and most of Office
[03:26:41] <XMPPwocky> did somebody say developers
[03:26:44] <cmr> no
[03:26:45] <Quxxy> Developers?
[03:26:46] <cmr> go back to sleep
[03:26:51] <Astrum|Lap> chairs?
[03:26:58] <Quxxy> Damnit, Astrum|Lap !
[03:26:58] <cmr> bees?
[03:27:21] <amstrad> Quxxy: anyway, it would be nice to see a borrow checker laid in over the top of Roslyn (if that is even possible)
[03:27:48] <cmr> http://img.memecdn.com/chairs-chairs-everywhere_webm_2461513.webm is excellently looped.
[03:27:49] <Quxxy> amstrad: I don't believe that's really possible without lifetime annotations or very hard whole-program analysis
[03:27:53] <Quxxy> (From what I understand)
[03:27:55] <Astrum|Lap> bleh, all I want to do is work on my code editor
[03:27:58] <Astrum|Lap> I need more free time
[03:28:05] <Astrum|Lap> anyone want to donate me some hours from their day
[03:28:17] <cmr> how much you payin'
[03:28:24] <amstrad> Quxxy: well, everyone raves about things like resharper, which is nothing more than gloried compiler tooling
[03:28:34] <Astrum|Lap> free.99
[03:28:54] <Quxxy> amstrad: Children.  They've never had to debug a multi-process program in windbg
[03:28:58] <amstrad> Quxxy: but they are doing some pretty intense software analysis there, it would be interesting to see if it was indeed possible to do
[03:29:10] <amstrad> Quxxy: heh
[03:29:22] <Quxxy> Man, that was unpleasant
[03:29:44] <amstrad> Quxxy: ever write stuff in MFC / C++ back in the day?
[03:30:05] <Quxxy> No, never
[03:30:10] <Quxxy> I was a child of VB5 and 6
[03:30:22] <amstrad> MFC was around the same time as VB5-6
[03:30:26] <Quxxy> I took one look at MFC and thought "... but why would I use that over VB?  I don't hate myself."
[03:30:32] <amstrad> haha
[03:30:35] <Astrum|Lap> I was never a programmer as a kid
[03:30:43] <Astrum|Lap> I did stuff with electronics instead
[03:30:49] <amstrad> Quxxy: because, direct Win32 programming was too impractical :D
[03:31:00] <amstrad> (for the C++ developers of the day)
[03:31:15] <Quxxy> amstrad: Oh please; I wrote an article on using the Win32 API to fake pointers in VB :P
[03:31:28] <amstrad> Quxxy: i didn't mind win32
[03:31:39] <Quxxy> It was just all the crap you had to go through in C++ to get something that worked about as well as a VB GUI did
[03:31:56] <amstrad> it was impractical to use it for your day job tho, and in those days, you "GOTTA WRITE MDI!!"
[03:31:58] <Quxxy> And if you *really* needed speed, you could just use inline assembly
[03:32:04] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: lets write a win32 gui library in rust!
[03:32:05] <WindowsBunny> :D
[03:32:13] <Quxxy> WindowsBunny: I've considered it :P
[03:32:22] * amstrad has also
[03:32:28] <Quxxy> It probably wouldn't get any use because of all the metro bullshit people seem to want these days
[03:32:31] <Quxxy> Something like MinWin for D
[03:32:34] <Quxxy> *GOD* that was nice
[03:33:02] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: Well, I want to write a proper IRC client using native win32
[03:33:11] <Quxxy> A few basic controls, some basic layout, and a really simple class structure
[03:33:13] <amstrad> Quxxy: surely tho, Rust is best used as a background server process, i wouldn't even use C# for anything UI nowadays
[03:33:31] <Quxxy> You want a basic UI?  Sure!  Want to go crazy?  Here's the hWnd, go nuts
[03:34:20] <Quxxy> I'd like to try mimicking the setup I had in Py3
[03:34:46] <Quxxy> The GUI ran in its own process, using an IO event loop
[03:34:56] <Quxxy> Every async operation was done with generators
[03:35:13] <Quxxy> So the UI thread was almost never blocked, but I never had to deal with GIL or threading
[03:35:42] <Quxxy> I had an RPC layer on top of that
[03:35:47] <Astrum|Lap> FRP, the one true way forward
[03:36:10] <Quxxy> So you could do async (pretending to be sync) cross-process calls, complete with stack unwinding and even bi-directional generators
[03:36:18] <Quxxy> Used it to implement transparent transaction support
[03:36:44] <cmr> Sounds like overengineering at its finest.
[03:36:47] <Quxxy> If you had two coroutines running in the GUI process, they could have independent transactions, and the system would order them correctly
[03:36:51] <Quxxy> cmr: And how!
[03:37:00] <Quxxy> But it was *so clean* to use
[03:37:32] <Astrum|Lap> cmr: overengineering gets me excited
[03:37:38] <Astrum|Lap> adequate engineering is boring =P
[03:38:17] <amstrad> Quxxy: i don't know if this counts for anything, but given i have nothing else to currently write in Rust, im leaning towards writing a little Win32/OpenGL demo
[03:38:42] <Quxxy> amstrad: Are you aware of the various graphics bindings in existence?
[03:38:46] <amstrad> Quxxy: i have put the whole non blocking IO thing away for the time being, waiting on mio
[03:38:55] <amstrad> Quxxy: well, i know of rust-windows
[03:39:09] <amstrad> haven't had a look around for a rust gl.h binding
[03:39:09] <Quxxy> amstrad: I'm actually learning IOCP because I want async io now damnit
[03:39:14] <amstrad> im sure one exists
[03:39:16] <Quxxy> amstrad: look up glium and glutin
[03:39:26] <Quxxy> I forget which one you're meant to use; the names don't really help :P
[03:39:33] <Quxxy> There are probably others
[03:39:38] <amstrad> Quxxy: if you are doing IOCP, for the love of god, submit a PR to mio
[03:39:47] <amstrad> i have been waiting for this also
[03:40:03] <Quxxy> amstrad: My understanding is that mio is going with readiness, whereas IOCP is completion
[03:40:09] <Quxxy> *i.e.* the abstractions are backwards
[03:40:20] <amstrad> Quxxy: they had some roadmap
[03:40:29] <Quxxy> I remember a presentation by some Python guys who found that the Python async io stuff, which was readiness-based, was just *crap* on Windows
[03:40:38] <amstrad> Quxxy: ideally, i want to develop on windows, deploy to linux
[03:40:40] <Quxxy> They implemented a completion-based library, and it *obliterated* the standard support
[03:40:48] <cmr> I thought mio went with completion
[03:40:55] *** Quits: swgillespie (swgillespie@moz-rn1.vmq.232.104.IP) (Quit: My MacBook Pro has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[03:40:58] <Quxxy> The conclusion was: if you want high performance, you can't abstract over this difference
[03:41:00] <WindowsBunny> amstrad: Really it's waiting on me to finish my ws2_32 bindings to the point where it can be used for mio
[03:41:09] <cmr> because it's easier to do completion with epoll etc than readiness with iocp
[03:41:14] <amstrad> WindowsBunny: are you building mio?
[03:41:22] <amstrad> or, is mio waiting on you?
[03:41:36] <WindowsBunny> amstrad: I think mio is waiting on me :P
[03:41:44] <Quxxy> cmr: I... kinda stopped paying attention when I got a vague "well Windows users can suck it" response (not their words or their intent; I'm being glib here :) )
[03:41:56] <amstrad> WindowsBunny: if i knew how to drive rust, id write that stuff myself
[03:42:15] <WindowsBunny> amstrad: Well, feel free to contribute to winapi-rs
[03:42:16] <amstrad> i can't believe its taken me 8 months to get where i am with the language (the basics)
[03:42:26] <WindowsBunny> amstrad: It's one of the easiest libraries you can contribute to
[03:42:57] <amstrad> WindowsBunny: might take a look at it, im moving away from "how do i write stuff in rust" to "now to write something with it"
[03:43:10] <amstrad> WindowsBunny: i doubt id be of much use tbh
[03:43:30] <WindowsBunny> amstrad: It's literally looking at windows SDK headers, and porting the definitions to Rust, that's it
[03:43:58] <amstrad> WindowsBunny: can't that be automated?
[03:44:17] <WindowsBunny> the output from bindgen is kinda horrible
[03:44:23] <amstrad> hmm
[03:44:29] <Quxxy> amstrad: And it doesn't even *try* to handle the conditional stuff
[03:44:31] <WindowsBunny> And nobody has written a more custom tailored version for me yet
[03:44:35] <Quxxy> Windows versions, API partitioning
[03:44:39] <Quxxy> Platform partitioning
[03:44:42] <WindowsBunny> bindgen doesn't handle macro constants
[03:44:53] <WindowsBunny> and there are tens of thousands of macro constants in winapi
[03:45:03] <amstrad> alright, ill take your word for it :D
[03:45:31] <WindowsBunny> I dream to one day provide a complex set of feature flags to target specific versions of windows and partitions
[03:45:45] <WindowsBunny> maybe even add dynamic loading to my -sys crates
[03:47:19] <Quxxy> WindowsBunny: bindgen-win32, cargo-script, rust-ffi, apitmir-2, borrowing explained... I need to do less magpie-ing
[03:48:13] <cmr> WindowsBunny: https://github.com/tomaka/shared_library/blob/master/demo/src/main.rs is nice.
[03:48:28] <cmr> glutin uses it pretty heavily for platform stuff.
[03:49:17] <WindowsBunny> cmr: I can't use that!
[03:49:23] <WindowsBunny> cmr: I have to use something custom made :D
[03:49:42] <WindowsBunny> tailored to my tastes in macro style
[03:53:55] <Quxxy> WindowsBunny: One problem with automatic translation is that the headers don't specify which library a call comes from
[03:54:03] <Quxxy> (At least, I don't think they do)
[03:55:45] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: yep, that is indeed a minor issue
[03:56:08] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: Of course a custom tailored tool could easily just browse a dump of exports from each library and figure out which one it goes in
[03:56:22] <Quxxy> WindowsBunny: ... I suppose it could
[03:56:27] <Quxxy> Hmmm
[03:56:36] <WindowsBunny> but I mean who is gonna write such a fancy tool
[03:56:51] * Quxxy sighs
[03:56:59] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: I just use a small program I wrote that calls some dump utility that VS provides to generate a commented out list of exports
[03:57:04] <WindowsBunny> which I then fill in later
[03:57:09] <Quxxy> I know you know I already have a half-working prototype...

[05:41:28] <amstrad> ah ok
[05:41:31] <amstrad> thanks guys
[05:42:19] <amstrad> Mutabah: would PartialOrd be comparing things like "greater than and less than" ?
[05:42:27] <Mutabah> Yes
[05:42:32] <amstrad> where the op needs to return 1, -1 or 0
[05:42:35] <amstrad> gotcha
[05:42:40] <Mutabah> amstrad: It actually returns Ordering
[05:42:49] <Quxxy> amstrad: Lt, Gt, Eq, or No
[05:42:55] <Mutabah> which corresponds to those three values, but with nice anmes
[05:42:56] <Quxxy> There are *four* possibilities, *not three*

[06:49:02] <Quxxy> I had the "does it report async on success or failure" test backward
[06:49:23] <Quxxy> I thought that since it reports async via GetLastError than, naturally, it would do so by first signalling failure

[06:50:42] <Quxxy> Except the socket wrapper throws an exception as soon as it sees GetLastError != ERROR_SUCCESS
[06:51:06] <Quxxy> So, of course, as soon as Winsock reported that it was doing a non-blocking operation through GetLastError, the D standard library would freak out and throw an exception

[18:10:03] <erickt> Manishearth: thanks I had trouble finding it :)
[18:10:46] <c74d> ah, so like Haskell with more repetition of parameter names and less repetition of function names.
[18:10:57] <Astrum|Lap> and I'm not sure if erlang had something similar, I was a complete novice in that language, I just know there were some gross parts to it
[18:11:14] <Astrum|Lap> I don't know haskell too well
[18:11:35] <c74d> well, not necessarily more repetition of parameter names.
[18:11:45] <Astrum|Lap> but, having implemented numerous piecewise functions, I've always wished there was a better way to express it rather than internal logic to the function
[18:12:07] <c74d> I wouldn't say I “know” Haskell; I merely know enough of its syntax.
[18:12:07] <dfockler> I don't really see the point if you can just put it inside the function
[18:12:25] <Astrum|Lap> it allows you to be explicit about the purpose of the function
[18:12:48] <dfockler> isn't that what writing code is for?
[18:13:15] <c74d> …huh?
[18:13:33] <Astrum|Lap> I shouldn't have to look into the code to discover that it's a piecewise function, nor pray the developer left a comment that gets turned into documentation
[18:16:14] <dfockler> Maybe I haven't done enough functional programming to get it
[18:16:29] <c74d> Astrum|Lap: I think my hypothetical programming language has matching on function parameters like this, which I included as “I like Haskell's matching on function parameters but I don't like repeating the function name”; I wasn't aware another popular programming language already had it.
[18:16:51] <Astrum|Lap> well, elixir has it for anonymous functions apparently
[18:17:04] <Astrum|Lap> I'm still skimming through the language intro
[18:17:37] <Astrum|Lap> dfockler: well just like the match statement in rust it can be used to be explicit about what your function accepts as well
[18:18:00] <Astrum|Lap> you can have a default case where it returns an error
[18:18:24] <Astrum|Lap> syntactically I'd find that better as well
[18:18:43] <dfockler> that makes sense, it just seems weird to have logic relating to your function, outside of the function
[18:19:04] <Astrum|Lap> well it's not really outside of your function
[18:19:19] <Astrum|Lap> it really is like a piecewise function in mathematics
[18:19:38] <Astrum|Lap> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Step_function
[18:20:24] <dfockler> I get what a piecewise function is, it just seems like if a function is piecewise, then it's still a function like any other
[18:21:21] <Astrum|Lap> well, in (most) programming languages it's a function like any other
[18:21:34] <Astrum|Lap> in math it usually isn't
[18:23:27] <Astrum|Lap> I suppose you could think of it like being polymorphic over the domain of the function

[18:25:30] <cmr> I know of no formalization of functions in math that treats piecewise functions differently (beyond any continuity properties, but that's not special-cased either)
[18:25:38] <cmr> (in analysis)
[18:26:05] <Astrum|Lap> I suppose I was just thinking of continuousness, you're right
[18:28:17] <Astrum|Lap> but do you like the idea of guard clauses on a function, cmr ?
[18:28:23] <Astrum|Lap> wrt rust
[18:28:30] <cmr> no
[18:28:59] <cmr> I'm of the opinion that all functions should be total and if your function needs to be partial you use a type to paper that over.

[18:37:00] <Astrum|Lap> that's the only reason I have at the moment =P
[18:37:05] <eddyb> the problem with Haskell-like definition is that they're order sensitive if you reuse the match semantics
[18:37:36] <eddyb> and if you don't, you probably want specialization (*itches*)
[18:37:50] <eddyb> *definitions
[18:38:09] <c74d> I like the idea too, though I prefer inverting the order (more general to more specific, rather than more specific to more general).
[18:38:22] <eddyb> https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/26493
[18:38:24] <eddyb> WHAT
[18:38:39] <cmr> c74d: the implementations I know of go in order down the list (since they allow non-trivial properties to be checked against; ie, it's non-decidable to determine which subsume the others)
[18:38:41] <eddyb> who is that person and where did that come from?
[18:39:12] <eddyb> +2222 -1 // classy
[18:39:30] <cmr> Who is this person
[18:39:32] <cmr> oh you just asked that
[18:39:34] <cmr> lol
[18:39:34] <c74d> cmr: my non-implementation just goes up the list instead
[18:39:46] <cmr> c74d: I guess that works!
[18:40:24] <Astrum|Lap> it's not like I'm going to go off and make an RFC about this, just an idea I find neat
[18:40:30] <eddyb> cmr: if we start seeing more cool stuff show up out of nowhere
[18:40:40] <Astrum|Lap> I don't spend much (any) time in the language design trenches, so what do I know? =)
[18:40:48] <eddyb> I'll need medication for hereditary heart conditions
[18:41:19] <eddyb> watch incremental rebuilds show up next in a PR
[18:43:15] <eddyb> have to say, I'm jealous of the hard working not so much talking type
[18:43:51] <eddyb> I have to ask a million questions before I have a clue what I should be doing :P

[22:01:07] <dfockler> get a presharpened stick
[22:01:24] <Astrum|Lap> lol
[22:01:43] <dfockler> and open source stick if you will
[22:01:46] <Astrum|Lap> "Implement a sort function for an array"

[23:14:18] <Layl> so, I know this isn't even remotely related to anything rust and might even be too offtopic for this channel
[23:14:27] <Layl> but I need some help identifying the genre of music of this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzclOi3lGE4
[23:14:30] <Layl> so I can search for more
[23:15:46] <Layl> I mean it sounds kinda in an eletronic direction but I like that it's a lot slower than stuff generally is
[23:19:51] <reem> nathan7: O
[23:19:57] <reem> nathan7: I’ve actually never heard that before
[23:20:08] <reem> I mean, I try not to message people entirely out of the blue
[23:20:22] <reem> but since literally anyone can just /msg anyone I figure it’s not really a privacy concern
[23:20:41] <reem> (that first O was a typo)
[23:21:02] <nathan7> it's not about privacy in the most direct sense
[23:21:31] <nathan7> more about people's personal space, and one's question probably being applicable to a wider audience than one person

[23:23:34] <nathan7> in a channel, most will help as much as possible, but without obligation, knowing others will jump in too
[23:23:38] <c74d> “privacy” = “don't bother me”, vs. “privacy” = “don't look at me”?
[23:23:45] <nathan7> c74d: yeah
[23:25:40] <Layl> on the subject of privacy, I love that one Tom Scott presentation titled "2030: Privacy's Dead. What happens next?"

[23:26:32] <Layl> and on the opposite side, his Oversight video
[23:26:48] <nathan7> presumably, I sit quietly in a tinfoil-covered corner, tapping away at my keyboard cautiously
[23:27:26] <Layl> I'm one of those crazy people who throws away their privacy willingly for the latest tech consciously
[23:27:30] <bluss> I ask people that pm me randomly to just talk in the rooms.

[23:35:24] <cmr> I honestly hate it when people I don't know well privmsg me, it feels like the equivalent of receiving a phone call...

[23:37:05] <niconii> yeah, i've gotten privmsgs from a few people

[23:41:45] *** Joins: yjv (yjv@moz-ll38tk.pa.comcast.net)
[23:43:20] <c74d> I do typically ignore personal messages from people I don't know, though generally they're merely saying hello, and I do try to help (generally by referring them to a channel) on the rare occasions that they're asking for help.
[23:46:59] *** Joins: saml_ (saml@moz-rkfmct.res.rr.com)
[23:49:01] <c74d> Layl: I guess “What happens next” depends on whether it's really truly ding-dong squished-witch dead, or is merely bought up by oligarchs.
[23:49:32] <brandonson> niconii: wait, there's a question to ask about that?  I'd assume that if you're bothering to connect to Moznet, you'd vaguely understand IRC.
[23:49:46] <cmr> brandonson: it's easy to get on irc.
[23:49:52] <cmr> you just click the mibbit link on rust-lang.org
[23:49:59] <brandonson> cmr: ah
[23:50:08] <brandonson> cmr: forgot we had links like that
[23:50:25] * brandonson just assumes everyone is using some linux CLI
[23:50:27] <WindowsBunny> cmr: and then be sad because #rust is registered only? :P
[23:51:03] <niconii> WindowsBunny: nah, i unset it
[23:51:48] <niconii> brandonson: i imagine what happens is that they'll join and ask a question, then someone starts a line with their name
[23:52:26] <niconii> brandonson: then their client/mibbit shows it differently, and they assume it showed up differently because a special command was used
[23:53:10] <niconii> brandonson: rather than because their client just highlights mentions of their name
[23:54:19] <brandonson> niconii: that'd make sense I suppose.  I'm weird, long ago in the days of yore (aka ~5 years ago) I actually briefly read the wikipedia page on IRC before joining anything.
