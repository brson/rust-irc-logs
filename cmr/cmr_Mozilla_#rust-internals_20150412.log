[00:17:06] <Eridius> the first reply was at 12:30PM. I don't remember precisely when I submitted the ticket but it was probably less than an hour beforehand
[00:18:16] <erickt> that's awesome
[00:18:30] <erickt> sad it's going to take a while to get implemented though
[00:18:46] <Eridius> yeah, though the more people that ask for it the more likely they are to prioritize it
[00:19:14] <erickt> frankly I thought a lot more of the big projects would be asking for it
[00:19:20] <erickt> I doubt we're the first project with a CoC
[00:19:40] <Eridius> I dunno, most open source projects usually don't seem to have a CoC

[00:23:23] <c74d3> I don't recall ever seeing another OSS project with a code of conduct on GitHub. 
[00:23:23] <quantheory> It seems like I've seen CoCs mentioned on several projects before, but I can't think of one that both actually enforces it and uses something like GitHub (a lot easier to ban people when most/all discussion is on a forum or Trac on someone's private server).
[00:25:11] <scott> they're probably pretty easy to miss. I think Rust's is pretty easy to miss
[00:26:52] <c74d3> I don't think I've ever seen an OSS project or organization with a well-enforced CoC.
[00:28:07] <c74d3> Maybe one with… uneven enforcement, and some with… “enforcement-by-ragequit”.
[00:28:23] <scott> I don't have much experience with situations where a CoC needed enforcement in the first place
[00:29:00] <c74d3> (Though in the latter cases I wasn't paying much attention.)
[00:29:49] <Eridius> scott: I'm tempted to say a CoC is always needed when participation is open to more than a handful of people, it's just rare that anyone bothers
[00:30:15] <Eridius> a big issue is that it's impossible to tell how many people chose to never get involved in a project in the first place because of the behavior of the community
[00:30:23] <scott> Eridius: oh, I just meant I haven't seen the problem cases in the wild much

[00:33:36] <Eridius> blaenk: presumably you want Into<Vec<u8>>, although offhand I see impls of Into or From for converting String and &str into Vec<u8> but I don't see one for &[u8], which seems odd
[00:33:37] <Kingsquee> pls
[00:33:54] <blaenk> Eridius: thanks I just noticed, and it did seem odd to me as well
[00:34:33] <Eridius> looks like IntoBytes was deprecated in favor of the generic conversion traits, and then 12 days later, it got deleted as part of a large purge of #[deprecated] APIs, but it feels like we don't yet have the full set of From/Into impls that we should
[00:34:33] <Kingsquee> pls
[00:34:46] <Kingsquee> wups
[00:34:50] <quantheory> I just noticed something similar yesterday. IIRC as_bytes is still around, but there's no generic &str to &[u8] conversion?
[00:34:56] <Kingsquee> my shitposting regex is a bit overzealous it seems
[00:35:02] <tjakubo_> what is this `impl Trait for .. {}` syntax I've just seen for the fhirst time
[00:35:07] <tjakubo_> first*
[00:35:19] <tjakubo_> is it a new way of doing blanket impls?
[00:35:21] <quantheory> Oh, the default impl?
[00:35:25] <Eridius> I also admit to not knowing when you should be implementing From vs Into (Into has a blanket impl for things that implement From, but also has 3 separate impls)

[00:36:45] <Eridius> quantheory: if you want to go from &str to &[u8], that would be convert::AsRef, though I don't actually see an impl AsRef<[u8]> for str
[00:36:50] <quantheory> The `impl Trait for .. {}` thing is the default impl syntax from RFC 19: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0019-opt-in-builtin-traits.md

[02:07:59] <frewsxcv> lfairy: what do you think they meant?
[02:08:05] <lfairy> it's that the extra abstraction would put more load on the optimizer, which increases compile time
[02:08:56] <frewsxcv> lfairy: or_else gets inlined though
[02:08:58] <lfairy> it's a valid concern, but I can't intuit how much of a difference it makes
[02:09:10] <lfairy> frewsxcv: exactly
[02:09:21] <blaenk> is type ascription gonna be 1.0?
[02:09:23] <frewsxcv> that seems really silly
[02:09:32] <lfairy> inlining increases compile time, because the optimizer has to tear through all that code
[02:10:15] <frewsxcv> 'tear through all that code'?
[02:10:47] <lfairy> well, expand the definition of .or_else(), then simplify the result
[02:11:31] <frewsxcv> granted i don't know that the compiler that well, that sounds like a pretty trivial process in the grand scheme of things

[02:15:25] <lfairy> imo, the changes don't really make the code easier to read
[02:16:11] <lfairy> from my FP experience, I'd expect code that uses .or_else() to change the result some of the time
[02:16:26] <lfairy> but this doesn't actually modify the Option, but mutates some external state
[02:17:54] <scott> I would write: let x = self.iter().next(); if x.is_none() { self.done = true; } x   with x renamed to something by someone who read the code more closely

[05:08:41] <seanmonstar> is there an rfc for detecting feature staging in an attribute?
[05:09:16] <seanmonstar> i'd like to turn off the benchmarks (and thus the feature(test)) so that i can run the tests on beta, but keep them on for nightly
[05:11:08] <blaenk> yeah we need something like that -_-
[05:11:21] <blaenk> but I get the feeling the devs don't want that sort of thing

[05:12:28] <seanmonstar> whats the reason for not?
[05:12:46] <blaenk> oh I have no idea, just the impression I get
[05:13:02] <seanmonstar> it'd be easiest if a --cfg were always passed
[05:13:05] <blaenk> like whenever it's been brought it's been kind of like a "yeah we're gonna wait to see how it plays out" kind of response
[05:13:15] <blaenk> *brought up
[05:13:29] <seanmonstar> then i could just #[cfg_attr(staged, feature(test))]
[05:13:57] <seanmonstar> hrm
[05:14:23] <seanmonstar> its currently keeping me from running the test suite for each commit on beta
[05:14:59] <blaenk> I hope we come up with something instead of having to run forks of each package for nightly and stable respectively
[05:15:38] <seanmonstar> even though i keep #[feature] out of the crate, bug fixes and such still land in nightly first, so its possible a "fix" doesn't work yet on beta
[05:16:27] <seanmonstar> blaenk: has it been brought up as an rfc or on internals?
[05:16:48] <blaenk> I don't remember if I've seen one as an rfc, and I rarely go on internals. mainly it's been here in this channel
[05:16:52] <blaenk> that I've seen it be brought up
[05:17:07] <blaenk> if by internals you mean the discourse site
[05:18:08] <seanmonstar> right

[16:10:12] <semarie> I have a question about gh24345. does allowing #[link(name="...")] to be a filename would be acceptable ? it will result name="stdc++" to "-lstdc++" and name="/usr/local/lib/libstdc++.so.16.0" to "/usr/local/lib/libstdc++.so.16.0" in linker args (so just a check if the arg is a filename or not).
[16:10:12] <[o__o]> It seems impossible to link rust with specific version of libstdc++: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/24345

[22:18:01] <ebfull> simukis: i know, but i wasn't sure if my commit counts it as fixed. because perhaps the underlying cause (that closures are expanded into separate types regardless of their prototype) is one worth being an issue or being addressed in some way by a core dev
[22:18:35] <ebfull> though i think it's good behavior and should be like this.. didn't want to make the close judgment myself

[22:51:17] <reem> ya, that’s basically what I meant
[22:51:18] <nrc> :-)

[23:33:57] <reem> steveklabnik: I really think that explaining closures from the Fn traits first will lead to much less confusion. Questions like: “how do I take a closure as an argument” and “how do I store a closure” have clear answers when you view closures as just implementing Fn*.
[23:34:28] <reem> Normally I agree that examples are quite useful before delivering the major concept, but in this case the examples are actually really confusing imo.
[23:35:03] <reem> because in the vast majority of languages with closures closures and fns and such are all the same type
