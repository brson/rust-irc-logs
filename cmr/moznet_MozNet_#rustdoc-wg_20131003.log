[03:54:01] <dbaupp> acrichto: could you upload the example output of https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9691? (possibly including an example lib cross-crate linking to std/extra?)
[03:54:35] <acrichto> dbaupp: will do
[03:54:41] <cmr> I think I have my priorities wrong.
[03:54:48] <cmr> acrichto is going more rustdoc work than I am :p
[03:55:08] <dbaupp> acrichto is doing more rust<everything> work than everyone
[03:55:12] <cmr> yeah
[03:55:16] <cmr> acrichto: you truly are a powerhouse
[03:55:18] <dbaupp> (except for everything = pkg, I guess)
[03:55:45] <acrichto> cmr: it's like I'm paid to do this :P
[03:55:52] <cmr> acrichto: something like that :P
[03:56:07] <cmr> it makes me so happy to have another full-time rust dev
[03:56:14] <cmr> real rust, not servo
[03:56:24] * dbaupp would like to be a full-time rust dev
[03:56:45] <acrichto> if only we could hire like all of #rust
[03:56:48] <cmr> I worked full time on rust during the summer, it was awesome.
[03:57:18] <cmr> When I could actually devote 2 hours a week to triage, and still have ample time to do real work :(
[03:57:32] <dbaupp> acrichto: you're a mozilla employee, you can just hire people at will, right?
[03:57:36] * dbaupp is hopeful
[03:58:34] <acrichto> I should ask around...
[03:58:56] <dbaupp> hah
[03:59:23] * dbaupp is unlikely to be wanting a full-time for at least another year-and-a-bit
[03:59:45] <acrichto> you never know... :P
[03:59:45] <dbaupp> hence not even attempting to apply for that job
[04:01:22] <dbaupp> (in any case, people like strcat definitely know more/are more capable.)
[04:01:54] <cmr> my pick for next rust hire would be a tie between aatch, strcat, and Luqman
[04:02:37] <dbaupp> aarcan is the next hire. it's decided.
[04:02:41] <cmr> hah
[04:02:50] <cmr> Or a clone of pcwalton and/or nmatsakis :p
[04:03:54] <dbaupp> Not sure we can derive that, so we'll have to implemented it by hand.
[04:09:43] <dbaupp> acrichto: I have no idea how the html/format.rs stuff works
[04:10:13] <acrichto> that makes 2 of us!
[04:10:17] <cmr> hah
[04:11:02] <cmr> Hah, found one that works
[04:11:04] <cmr> 74efdf61
[04:12:53] <dbaupp> acrichto: didn't you write it? -_-
[04:13:04] * acrichto runs away
[04:28:02] <dbaupp> acrichto, cmr: clean::ImportSource is... ?
[04:28:43] <cmr> dbaupp: `use str = source` isn't descriptive enough? :P
[04:29:22] * dbaupp didn't even look at the code
[04:29:40] <cmr> heh
