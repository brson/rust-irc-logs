[00:00:55] <tiffany> I'm reading through these comments
[00:01:01] <tiffany> waiting for just one person to mention what emacs does
[00:01:03] <tiffany> which is wrap gnupg
[00:01:27] <tiffany> I don't know if emacs is safe from dumping plaintext into swap files and whatnot
[00:01:39] <tiffany> but it at least uses decent algorithms, on account of using gnupg
[00:02:48] <eternaleye> 'decent'
[00:02:50] <eternaleye> 'gnupg'
[00:03:14] <eternaleye> It's not sticking your face in a barrel of nitric acid the way Vim's encryption was, true
[00:03:23] <eternaleye> But it's still not pleasant.
[00:03:31] <tiffany> I currently manage my passwords using an rsa-encrypted gpg file from emacs
[00:03:52] <tiffany> it's really silly that the maximum supported gpg key size is 4096 bits
[00:04:46] <tiffany> what is wrong with gnupg?
[00:04:55] <tiffany> besides the horrendous user interface
[00:05:02] <tiffany> and the horrifically insecure key fingerprints
[00:05:33] <tiffany> I remember seeing a while back something about being able to trivially bruteforce the 32bit key fingerprints
[00:05:44] <bascule> lololol tiffany 
[00:05:57] <bascule> the horrible UX is a big part of the problem
[00:06:03] <tiffany> I would think so
[00:06:03] <bascule> see also the crazy mutability of ~/.gnupg
[00:06:13] <bascule> and yeah, short key fingerprints are bad too
[00:06:17] <tiffany> it feels like there's a lot of ways to accidentally render yourself completely insecure through that interface
[00:07:34] <eternaleye> There's also the unnecessarily complex and convoluted OpenPGP format
[00:07:39] <bascule> yeah
[00:08:04] <bascule> here's my favorite part
[00:08:12] <bascule> Please select what kind of key you want: (1) RSA and RSA (default) (2) DSA and Elgamal (3) DSA (sign only) (4) RSA (sign only)
[00:08:19] <eternaleye> I wonder how hard a sane replacement based on Noise would be
[00:08:20] <bascule> DSA AND ELGAMAL PLEASE
[00:08:31] <bascule> eternaleye: would be nice (noise boxes)
[00:08:39] <eternaleye> bascule: Yup
[00:08:49] <tiffany> I should probably make some new keys
[00:08:52] <tiffany> everything is rsa
[00:09:00] <Tobba> bascule: are any of those choices bad choices
[00:09:01] <tiffany> apparently openssh supports curve25519 now
[00:09:06] <Tobba> trick question: they're all bad choices
[00:09:09] <bascule> lol
[00:09:15] <bascule> RSA is fine
[00:09:24] <eternaleye> Just dog-slow
[00:09:25] <bascule> RSA is nice because it works with Yubikeys
[00:09:33] <tiffany> my ssh key is 8192 bits
[00:09:38] <bascule> lolwtf tiffany 
[00:09:43] <Tobba> I was mostly joking but it *is* pretty slow
[00:09:45] <bascule> that's totally pointless
[00:09:53] <eternaleye> tiffany: 8192-bit keys are like penis enlargement pills.
[00:09:56] <Tobba> ... I wonder if you can attack bad SSH implementations by sending them ridiculously large keys
[00:09:57] <tiffany> it's totally pointless, but it's also not really costing me anything
[00:10:05] <eternaleye> tiffany: A sign of being embarassed about something silly.
[00:10:13] <Tobba> please verify this 2^16 bit key
[00:10:16] <bascule> Tobba: haha one of my friends created some ridiculously large RSA key and tested it on a bunch of stuff
[00:10:19] * Tobba ducks and covers
[00:10:27] <bascule> and broken things
[00:10:30] <bascule> I don't remember what things
[00:10:34] <tiffany> well
[00:10:40] <bascule> it was like a 16k RSA key
[00:10:47] <bascule> which took him like a month to generate or something
[00:11:04] <tiffany> I figure that rsa is going to be broken in a significant way before I need to upgrade my key size, seeing how 1024bit keys are weak enough to break with significant effort
[00:11:16] <eternaleye> ...if he's going to do a silly test key why did he not force /dev/urandom?
[00:11:19] <tiffany> although 2048bit is quite a jump over 1024
[00:11:23] <tiffany> and 4096bit is already kind of silly
[00:11:24] <bascule> tiffany: by the time 2048-bit RSA keys are breakable, RSA will be obsolete IMO
[00:11:40] <tiffany> it only took me like 10 minutes to generate
[00:11:44] <Tobba> yeah I'm pretty sure you could make a 16k-bit key and just use /dev/urandom as the prime
[00:12:02] <Tobba> by the time anyone figures out it's completely incorrect they've probably spent a good while doing so
[00:12:05] <tiffany> it might possibly make ssh slower? but I have never seen ssh rise to the tp of htop
[00:12:07] <bascule> lolololol
[00:12:39] <tiffany> eternaleye: how hard is it to force /dev/urandom?
[00:12:51] <eternaleye> tiffany: ln -sf /dev/urandom /dev/random :P
[00:13:09] <tiffany> I guess that works
[00:13:17] <eternaleye> tiffany: Or just patch it in the source code
[00:13:32] <eternaleye> tiffany: Which he'd have to do _anyway_ for gnupg to generate such a key
[00:13:40] <tiffany> heh
[00:13:42] <eternaleye> tiffany: Since it caps it at 4k
[00:13:48] <tiffany> yeah, I noticed that
[00:14:02] <tiffany> I don't think openssl or openssh caps the key size

[22:16:53] <bascule> ok
[22:17:00] <bascule> that would make it easier for the tests to pass :|
[22:18:55] <Ilari> I think other banned things for gTLDs: Top-level host records.
