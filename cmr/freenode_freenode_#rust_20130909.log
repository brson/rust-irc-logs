[00:18:08] <mordof> Just heard of Rust.. looking into learning it. Anyone able to list off a few areas that it's good to use Rust in?
[00:18:18] <mordof> what it's good at, essentially
[00:18:38] <bjz> Basically where you'd used C++
[00:19:03] <mordof> heh, nice. alright then
[00:19:20] <bjz> For situations where you want a high-level of abstraction without the overhead
[00:19:24] <mordof> i never really enjoyed c++ - it always seemed annoying to try and follow / understand
[00:19:34] <bjz> and without mandatory GC
[00:20:41] <bjz> the thing about Rust is that it has sane defaults and can make garentees about memory safety at compile time
[00:20:53] * mordof nods
[00:21:10] <bjz> does that help?
[00:21:16] <mordof> yep :) a decent amount
[00:21:30] <bjz> there is an official channel are irc.mozilla.org #rust
[00:21:45] <mordof> since I'm not well versed in c++, or programming that usually is involved at that level, I'm still not sure how far i'll get into this
[00:21:47] <mordof> but we'll see
[00:21:50] <mordof> ah, good to know
[00:21:56] <bjz> it made it easier for me
[00:22:07] <mordof> the closest I've gotten is taking a liking to C#.net
[00:22:18] <bjz> C++ is very complex, and that makes it rather difficult
[00:22:49] <mordof> mhmm
[00:23:07] <bjz> Rust also separates some concepts that are conflated in C at a fundamental level
[00:23:16] <bjz> namely about pointers
[00:23:58] <mordof> i have an understanding of pointers, but haven't had much chance to make use of them
[00:24:06] <mordof> what is conflation in that context?
[00:24:22] <bjz> bear in mind, Rust is still very much in development, so code that works today might not work tomorrow
[00:24:43] <bjz> but it's an exciting time to be involved in the project
[00:25:10] <mordof> mhmm :)
[00:26:34] <bjz> mordof: make sure you use git master
[00:26:38] <bjz> not 0.7
[00:26:50] <bjz> also, this is a good place to start: http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/tutorial.html
[00:26:50] <mordof> I'm on windows - so i was just going to grab the installer
[00:27:07] <mordof> i'm currently reading through that page ^_^
[00:27:23] <bjz> not sure the situation on windows, you might need to head over to the official channel for that
[00:27:44] <mordof> i'll figure something out / if i can't, will do that too
[00:28:01] <mordof> i'm usually on freenode, so that's why i attempted #rust on here, heh
[00:28:16] <mordof> was like "i wonder if people have a channel here for this..." got lucky
[00:34:35] <mordof> i have an elementary OS VM that i can work in if necessary also

[00:41:50] <jeaye> bjz: How can I get rustpkg to build these examples?
[00:42:05] <jeaye> It'll build glfw, but it won't build any examples.
[00:44:12] <jeaye> Ah, figured it out.
[00:44:18] <jeaye> It's not actually based on directory.
[00:44:31] * jeaye was saying `rustpkg build src/examples/window` -_-
[00:44:49] <mordof> as much as I'd like to start learning Rust.. it seems like the install/setup process is quite tedious o.o
[00:45:41] * troutwine is eagerly waiting until closer to 1.0.
[00:45:56] <jeaye> mordof: On Windows, yes it definitely is.
[00:45:56] <mordof> troutwine: do you think the install process will be easier then?
[00:46:10] <jeaye> On Linux and Mac, it's much easier.
[00:46:17] <mordof> hmmm
[00:46:26] <jeaye> OS X, that is
[00:46:56] <troutwine> mordof: It's pretty easy on my Mac already. I've heard it will improve for Windows. Mostly I'm waiting because I'm awfully busy and I'd like for the language to be a little more stable before I truly dive in.

[00:48:47] <bjz> :(
[00:49:16] <jeaye> It creates subdirectories for me.
[00:50:01] <bjz> mordof: it'll probabaly work on elementary, seeing as its based on ubuntu. might be slowish to compile though, seeing as it's a vm

[00:51:16] <jeaye> Gotcha
[00:51:28] <bjz> not on `rustpkg build src/examples`
[00:51:35] <bjz> that should work
[00:51:41] <bjz> but doesn't
[00:56:39] <mordof> bjz: yeah, but i'm not very fluent in compiling stuff
[00:56:43] <mordof> it makes me nervous, lol

[00:58:41] <bjz> mordof: heh, it gets easier! :D
[00:59:16] <bjz> mordof: rust pulls in all the deps when it compiles
[00:59:22] <mordof> hm
[00:59:31] <bjz> mordof: so there's less hassle on that front
[00:59:44] <mordof> bjz: are you going to be around for a bit / and be willing to help in the process if i get stuck trying to get it working on elementary?
[00:59:44] * bjz heads out for coffee
[00:59:47] <mordof> oh
[00:59:48] <mordof> lol
[00:59:55] <bjz> I'll be back in a bit
[01:00:03] <mordof> ok
[01:00:06] <bjz> but shout out on the official channel
[01:00:10] <mordof> ok
[01:00:12] <mordof> bjz: thanks
[01:00:13] <bjz> should be somebody there
[01:00:17] <bjz> np!
[01:02:18] <bjz> jeaye: btw, before I go, would you be able to do up an example for shared windows as well?
[01:02:58] <bjz> would be super awesome
[01:02:59] <bjz> ok, bbl
[01:16:23] <jeaye> bjz: It's very difficult to show the effects of shared contexts without access to GL calls.
[01:27:35] <jeaye> bjz: PR for the managed callback example is in
[01:30:22] <bjz> jeaye: dang, oh well
[01:31:46] <jeaye> I'm not sure if the managed callback PR is what you wanted, or if it gets the point across well enough.
[01:31:54] <jeaye> Tough to do in a small amount of lines.

[02:09:05] <mordof> hmm
[02:09:19] <mordof> yeah there's a bunch of stuff i can't really follow right off the bat
[02:09:35] *** Joins: jcaudle (~jcaudle@184.17.176.150)
[02:09:55] <bjz> you'll understand it soon enough. :)
[02:10:20] <bjz> @mut declares a mutable GC pointer
[02:10:23] <mordof> the | variable set |   is .. odd.. to me
[02:10:28] <mordof> seems like something that came out of Haskell
[02:10:50] <bjz> basically everything in Java/C# is @mut by default
[02:11:09] <bjz> in Rust you have to specify that explicitly
[02:11:50] * mordof goes to read up on mutable/immutable objects
[02:11:54] <bjz> do local_data::get(tls_key) |opt| { ... } gets an Option<T> from task local storage
[02:12:17] <bjz> it's optional because it might not be set yet
[02:13:37] <bjz> Option<T> is really just a nullable pointer. the compiler makes sure you handle both cases, when the Option is either Some, or None
[02:13:48] <mordof> :s heh
[02:13:51] <bjz> have you used haskell?
[02:13:53] <mordof> wasted explanation at this point i think
[02:13:54] <mordof> very little
[02:14:07] <bjz> C#?
[02:14:08] <mordof> it's so far from what i'm used to - i found it difficult to grasp when i started into it
[02:14:25] <mordof> C# more so, but not anything more than standard usage.. nothing complex essentially
[02:14:30] <mordof> my main is javascript, hah
[02:14:34] *** Quits: SiegeLord (~sl@c-76-118-20-100.hsd1.ma.comcast.net) (Quit: It's a joke, it's all a joke.)
[02:14:42] <bjz> have you used Nullable in C#?
[02:14:46] <mordof> no
[02:14:51] <bjz> ok, no worries
[02:15:05] <bjz> yeah, I wouldn't worry about this example too much
[02:15:06] <mordof> if it's a concept foreign to js, then it's something i'll have to learn fresh more than likely
[02:15:29] <mordof> i have an ok grasp of pointers and structs.. but outside of that, not much else
[02:16:17] <mordof> I suppose i use C# a lot like I would js - in simpler ways it is actually similar
[02:16:23] <mordof> except with strict data types
[02:16:25] <bjz> the good thing about Rust is that it has an intelligent, modern static type system, so it's nicer to work with than the static type systems in Java/C/C++ etc
[02:16:58] <bjz> it's very strict in some ways, but in others it's much more expressive
[02:17:12] <mordof> sounds like that's a good thing :)
[02:17:17] * mordof isn't a fan of Java either
[02:17:20] <mordof> heh
[02:17:56] <bjz> yeah. lots of the ugly verbosity in java comes from the fact it has an antiquated type system and no pattern matching
[02:18:28] <bjz> do you use unit tests in js?
[02:18:52] <mordof> i'm aware of them, and want to get into using them, but don't know much about implementations or uses yet
[02:19:25] <mordof> from a professional standpoint, my js development i believe is still rather young... despite having a solid capability with it to make whatever i want.
[02:19:42] <bjz> well yeah, think of a static type system as automated unit testing
[02:20:14] <bjz> it may be annoying at first, but it catches lots of mistakes that could bite you later on
[02:20:28] * mordof nods
[02:20:41] <mordof> bjz: you're talking about data types for variables?
[02:20:48] <bjz> aye
[02:20:51] <mordof> ok
[02:21:07] <mordof> yeah, i'm capable with that - since C# uses a decent type system
[02:21:16] <mordof> i have no trouble understanding that, and what the implications are for switching data types, etc
[02:21:37] <mordof> i make my js with similar personal restrictions - i generally don't cross my data types or change variables anyway
[02:21:43] <bjz> but thankfully Rust provides expressive type like those found in Hsakell or ML, so the type system is much less constraining in some respects
[02:21:51] <mordof> oo
[02:22:38] <bjz> specifically algebraic data types (called 'enums' in Rust)
[02:23:06] <mordof> enums.. I've seen that keyword before somewhere else
[02:23:10] <mordof> can't remember where though
[02:23:23] <mordof> stands for enumerables doesn't it?
[02:23:38] <bjz> yeah, it's an unfortunate name because it's a little different in other languages
[02:23:50] <bjz> like in C#/Java/C/C++
[02:24:01] <bjz> they're like little dynamic type systems you can specify. but they make sure you you handle each case
[02:24:32] <bjz> Like Option is: enum Option<T> { Some(T), None }
[02:24:59] <bjz> So it has two possible values, either Some, or None
[02:25:15] <bjz> and Some can be accompianied by a generic value
[02:25:56] <bjz> in order to access that value you need to pattern match on it (or use a method that abstracts the pattern matching)
[02:26:05] <bjz> does that make sense?
[02:26:15] <mordof> the pattern matching part is what doesn't quite make sense
[02:27:38] <bjz> like: match Some(1) { Some(x) => println(x.to_str()); None => println("nothing!") }
[02:28:00] <mordof> and you have to do that every time you said? that seems tedious
[02:28:26] <bjz> well you can see I use .expect here: https://gist.github.com/bjz/afc9c1c999ff6d6edebd#file-managed-state-rs-L35
[02:28:33] <mordof> can you write getters (not sure if that term applies in this language, heh) that can do that for you?
[02:28:36] * mordof checks it out
[02:28:44] <bjz> and .unwrap here: https://gist.github.com/bjz/afc9c1c999ff6d6edebd#file-managed-state-rs-L57
[02:29:36] <bjz> basically unwrap does something like: match opt { Some(x) => x; None => fail!() }
[02:29:56] <mordof> is the Some(x) => x;  notation for a lamba that returns x?
[02:29:59] <bjz> expect does: match opt { Some(x) => x; None => fail!(msg) }
[02:30:10] <bjz> no, it's a pattern match
[02:30:20] <mordof> ok
[02:30:35] <bjz> like `switch` in C#/Java/C, but more powerful
[02:31:04] <mordof> alright
[02:31:11] <mordof> .expect / .unwrap are native to Rust?
[02:31:13] <bjz> http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/tutorial.html#pattern-matching
[02:31:29] <bjz> no, they are methods defined in std::option
[02:31:35] <bjz> that's the cool thing
[02:31:42] <bjz> Option isn't anything built in
[02:31:59] <bjz> it's just a library type
[02:32:18] <mordof> hmmm
[02:32:46] <bjz> https://github.com/mozilla/rust/blob/master/src/libstd/option.rs#L54
[02:32:49] <mordof> i think once I can start fiddling with this directly I'll understand that better
[02:33:11] <bjz> https://github.com/mozilla/rust/blob/master/src/libstd/option.rs#L297
[02:33:12] <bjz> yeah
[02:33:21] <mordof> ohh
[02:33:24] <bjz> hope I'm not confusing you more
[02:33:38] <mordof> so the Option library is setting up it's own iteration controllers and whatnot it seems
[02:33:46] <bjz> aye
[02:33:50] <bjz> I think
[02:34:13] <bjz> those methods are impled (implemented) on the Option Type
[02:34:26] <mordof> ahh
[02:34:29] <mordof> that's epic
[02:34:33] <bjz> :)
[02:34:54] <mordof> I've done some simple, but similar stuff in C# before
[02:35:06] <mordof> same with js, though obviously it's way different
[02:35:17] <bjz> mm.
[02:35:41] <mordof> you can't really implement data types in js that easily.. it gets kinda strange, haha
[02:35:52] <mordof> anyway, yeah i'm following what you're explaining for the most part
[02:36:00] <mordof> I'd let you know if i was confused/ struggling too much
[02:36:24] <bjz> well JS is tons more flexible than Rust
[02:36:26] <mordof> the notation / some syntax - it's new to me so it's hard to read for now
[02:36:56] <bjz> Rust allows you to do quite a bit, but you have to be explicit
[02:37:27] <mordof> bah llvm takes *so long* to compile, lol
[02:37:59] <bjz> unfortunately you have to be more explicit than Haskell or ML - they infer lots and you can basically leave all the types off
[02:38:10] * mordof nods
[02:38:12] <bjz> yeah
[02:38:32] <mordof> meh, i fully understand type strictness and am ok with it :) being explicit isn't a problem
[02:39:02] <mordof> just reading this though, even though I'm finding it difficult to comprehend exactly what's going on, i like the look of it
[02:39:08] <bjz> once you compile LLVM once though it'll cache it so you don't need to compile it all the next time you pull from the rust repo
[02:39:19] <mordof> mhmm
[02:39:23] <bjz> the tutorial you mean?
[02:39:24] <mordof> thankfully.. lol
[02:39:31] <mordof> bjz: your links
[02:39:54] <mordof> i can kind of follow it now - but i'm just missing parts that are more Rust specific.. i'll learn those later in the tutorials i'm sure
[02:39:57] <bjz> heh, they're not the best places to start tbh
[02:40:13] <bjz> in option source you'll see lots of weird <'a> or &'a stuff - those are lifetimes
[02:40:37] <bjz> they can seem pretty cryptic at first
[02:40:59] <mordof> is & still using a reference?
[02:41:04] <bjz> yep
[02:41:07] <mordof> ok
[02:41:23] <bjz> &mut is a mutable reference
[02:41:28] <mordof> this feels like i'm looking at 4 different languages jumbled together xD haha
[02:41:37] <bjz> heh really?
[02:41:47] <bjz> like which?
[02:41:49] <mordof> different aspects i recognize from different languages
[02:42:02] <mordof> i can't really pinpoint.. i just get that feeling that it seems to be a mix of several different languages
[02:42:37] <mordof> that's probably because i don't know which languages some of my knowledge is coming from though too... I've worked with a lot - to various degrees
[02:42:38] <bjz> well they do describe it as the lovechild of C++, Erlang and ML/Haskell
[02:42:48] <mordof> heh, nice
[02:43:16] <mordof> still trying to figure out exactly what immutable/mutable is. the links i found aren't describing it succinctly...
[02:43:29] <bjz> all though the Erlang influence is more semantic than syntactic
[02:43:37] <bjz> (thankfully)
[02:44:01] <bjz> ok, so every variable you declare is immutable by default
[02:44:14] <bjz> which means once you set it you can't change it
[02:44:20] <mordof> type, or value?
[02:44:24] <mordof> or both
[02:44:31] <bjz> if you try, the compiler complains
[02:44:33] <bjz> value
[02:44:43] <mordof> ok. type is always that way i'm assuming
[02:44:49] <bjz> let x = 0; x = 1; // error
[02:44:54] <mordof> alright
[02:44:58] <bjz> let mut x = 0; x = 1; // ok
[02:45:04] <bjz> that's basically it
[02:45:16] <mordof> constant vs not, essentially
[02:45:19] <mordof> why the name change?
[02:45:32] *** Quits: jvoorhis (~jvoorhis@71-214-127-199.ptld.qwest.net) (Remote host closed the connection)
[02:45:36] <mordof> are there any implications behind it that makes them differ?
[02:46:06] <bjz> if you just do: let mut x = 0;, the compiler will give you a warning saying you have a mutable variable which was not mutated, which can potentially help you find bugs
[02:46:22] <mordof> oh interesting
[02:46:26] <mordof> i like that
[02:46:28] <bjz> basically it means you get less logical errors
[02:46:33] <mordof> yeah :)
[02:46:42] <mordof> similar to when variables don't get used
[02:46:54] <mordof> could mean you've got something that you don't need / aren't using right,e tc
[02:46:56] <bjz> dunno if you've made any mistakes before when vars change under you
[02:47:21] <mordof> it's been a while since that's happened to me
[02:47:37] <mordof> been programming/coding for a long time - so i can usually know what a variables value/state should be just from memory
[02:47:50] <bjz> mmk
[02:47:59] <bjz> it's also good for concurrency
[02:48:05] * mordof nods
[02:48:24] <bjz> you're giving the compiler more information so it can check you're doing things ok
[02:48:39] <mordof> context - always a good thing to provide :)
[02:48:47] <bjz> in C++ the reccomended thing is to const all the args you don't mutate, or the variables
[02:48:58] <bjz> but it's annoying ergonomically
[02:49:11] <mordof> right
[02:49:57] <bjz> having it the default means it's ergonimacally nicer to leave things const, and it makes you think twice when you decide to start including mutation
[02:50:10] <bjz> there's often a better way
[02:50:48] <mordof> nice
[02:50:59] <mordof> i'm not quite used to that.. so that may take some getting used to
[02:51:04] <bjz> yeah
[02:51:07] <mordof> which, also might make my js turn into something weird, haha
[02:51:08] <mordof> we'll see
[02:51:19] <bjz> in Haskell you can't mutate anything :)
[02:51:42] <bjz> Rust is a little less strict :)
[02:51:48] <mordof> oh interesting. honestly I didn't get that far in Haskell, haha
[02:52:11] <mordof> i recognize it, and can follow it (very basic), but aside from that i spent very little time trying to learn it
[02:52:44] <bjz> lots of the concepts in Rust transfer into it, so it might be easier after you learn abit of Rust
[02:52:56] * mordof nods
[02:52:59] <mordof> that would be cool :)
[02:53:17] <mordof> I'd like to be able to work with Haskell a bit, even on a small scale
[02:53:37] <bjz> and Haskell is much more elegant than Rust. functions are nicer to compose, and the type system is much more expressive
[02:53:49] <bjz> but it's less suited to systems stuff
[02:53:55] <mordof> right
[02:54:17] <mordof> that's what it seemed like - though Haskell seems great, it doesn't feel like it has a wide range of uses
[02:54:38] <mordof> one of the reasons I just decided to use C# instead for what I wanted to do
[02:54:44] <bjz> heh :)
[02:54:51] <mordof> my friend loves it though
[02:54:56] <bjz> what made you curious about Rust?
[02:55:20] <mordof> bjz: *shrugs* same friend made quick mention of it, all he said was that it's a better c++
[02:55:48] <mordof> since i dabbled with c++ way back when and got annoyed with it, i wanted to check this out
[02:56:28] <mordof> I have time to kill right now anyway, heh... may as well learn something that could prove to be useful
[02:56:44] * mordof doesn't like being non-productive
[02:58:02] <mordof> bjz: essentially, I've known c++ to be the main language to go to when you really need power out of something... or at least that's what it was like in my mind
[02:58:59] <mordof> but since I didn't like it, Rust seemed appealing :p
[03:01:36] <bjz> C++ is quite a bit better now with C++11, but it's extremely hard to break into given the extreme level of complexity and competing code styles out there
[03:01:57] <bjz> there's lots of old tutorials out there that muddy the wters
[03:01:58] <bjz> *waters
[03:02:04] <mordof> mhmm
[03:02:10] <mordof> i found that when I was forced to learn ASP.net as well
[03:02:19] <mordof> i had to be *VERY* specific with my searches to find up to date info
[03:02:38] <bjz> it also suffers from all the baggage of backwards compatibility, and the C legacy it inherits
[03:02:42] <bjz> yeah
[03:03:43] <bjz> at least I'm sure that ASP.net deprecated features?
[03:03:51] <bjz> and removed them?
[03:04:07] <mordof> I don't know enough about it to say
[03:04:19] <mordof> honestly I don't like ASP.net, and after being forced to learn it for a class, I dislike it even more
[03:04:23] <mordof> it's so gross
[03:04:28] <bjz> heh
[03:04:49] <mordof> I've been a web developer for about 13 years. I care very much for clean output code, best practices, standards, etc
[03:04:56] <mordof> it just feels like ASP spits in the face of all of that
[03:05:01] <bjz> well C++ hasn't removed anything since C was invented
[03:05:02] <mordof> and doesn't let you do anything about it
[03:05:09] <bjz> dang
[03:05:19] <mordof> the output of an ASP project is beyond hideous
[03:05:45] <bjz> in what way?
[03:05:57] <mordof> well, when looking at the output HTML of an asp page
[03:06:15] <bjz> embarassing?
[03:06:18] <mordof> normally you'd have javascript in it's own external files, organized, css, comments, etc, all external and organized
[03:06:38] <mordof> ASP spits out a mangled mess that you can barely siv through to find what you want
[03:07:06] <mordof> a lot of the runat="server" stuff, the checks, everything.. it just drops large amounts of js in the middle of the pages amongst the html
[03:07:27] <mordof> id's become hard to follow because it prepends a ton of stuff to coordinate with server info
[03:07:37] <mordof> none of this shows up in visual studio
[03:08:14] <mordof> you can name an id something simple in the VS IDE, and you can refer to it no problem.. but then it modifies it for output and appends namespaces and wrappers and all the rest
[03:08:18] <mordof> </rant>
[03:08:20] <bjz> ugh
[03:08:36] * bjz grumbles something related to microsoft
[03:08:46] <mordof> i just don't see how someone that cares about the future of the web could use it, heh
[03:09:36] <bjz> jeaye: merged!
[03:09:46] <jeaye> Cheers
[03:09:49] <bjz> jeaye: looks pretty clean actually
[03:10:37] <mordof> bjz: i *think* the make process of rust is almost done
[03:10:48] <bjz> mordof: sweet!
[03:11:05] <bjz> mordof: they have to do more work on optimising the compiler
[03:11:08] <mordof> this VM has 2 cores and 1GB of ram.. i probably should've increased it for this had i known it would've taken so long, lol
[03:11:34] <bjz> mordof: you also have to bear in mind it builds the compiler three times over
[03:11:41] <mordof> o.o
[03:11:47] <bjz> the joys of a self-hosting compiler :)
[03:11:53] <mordof> lol
[03:12:16] <bjz> snake eating its own tail ;)
[03:12:43] <jeaye> heh
[03:12:52] <bjz> three times over
[03:13:02] * bjz tries to imagine that
[03:13:12] <mordof> probably not a good idea
[03:13:23] * bjz 's brain can't handle it
[03:14:54] <bjz> mordof: basically if you want to change something in the compiler you have to use the old compiler to build the new stuff. it gradually gets ingested down the stages until it drops off when a new snapshot is created
[03:15:08] <bjz> so stage0 is the oldest stuff
[03:17:19] <mordof> ah
[03:17:42] <mordof> hrmmm
[03:17:47] <mordof> it's kinda locked up a little :o
[03:17:49] *** Parts: pdurbin (~pdurbin@server1.greptilian.com) ("WeeChat 0.4.0")
[03:17:55] <mordof> and i'm not sure if that's a bad thing, or if it's just 100%
[03:17:55] <bjz> really?
[03:18:29] <mordof> i was trying to demonstrate to my gf that it's a VM - running fullscreen on one monitor, so i tried to hit win+q
[03:18:31] <mordof> and....
[03:18:34] <mordof> i hope i didn't close it....
[03:19:09] <bjz> hah! -_-
[03:19:23] <mordof> instructions are being carried out *very slowly*
[03:19:29] <mordof> so it's still maxing out the VM processor
[03:19:31] <bjz> well at least llvm was built
[03:19:45] <bjz> which is the main pain point
[03:19:56] <bjz> will be quicker next time
[03:20:11] <bjz> will have to try elementary
[03:20:14] <mordof> k it's still there
[03:20:16] <bjz> is it ok?
[03:20:19] <mordof> bjz: it is quite nice
[03:20:37] * bjz uses osx
[03:20:41] <mordof> i haven't used it for very long, but upon initial install, there's *very* little that is in your way
[03:20:50] <mordof> elementary mimics os x quite a bit, lol
[03:21:02] <mordof> dock / similar file viewer/settings panel
[03:21:12] <mordof> similar WM actually too
[03:21:34] <mordof> but on top of Ubuntu, which has a very large repository community / application base
[03:22:00] * jeaye loves Linux
[03:22:15] <jeaye> Haven't used Windows or OS X for a personal computer in years.
[03:22:29] <mordof> I'm so used to using Windows, it's hard for me to stick with linux
[03:22:43] <mordof> especially once Ubuntu jumped to Unity - that made me dislike it very much.. went back to windows
[03:22:56] <jeaye> Yeah, Unity is awful.
[03:23:08] <mordof> but with elementary, it's the feel of Ubuntu - but with a good WM and lack of clutter :D
[03:23:28] <jeaye> :)
[03:23:45] <bjz> ok, downloading it
[03:23:53] <bjz> :)
[03:24:03] <mordof> i know how to change windows to do just about whatever i want, so that's why Linux is kinda like.. not the ideal environment for me
[03:24:12] <bjz> payed them $10 too - the least I can do
[03:24:16] <mordof> nice :)
[03:24:29] <mordof> i'm a broke student right now. once i get money i intend to do the same
[03:24:34] <jeaye> mordof: Windows doesn't come close to doing what I want.
[03:24:44] <jeaye> A good start would be a proper package manager.
[03:24:56] <mordof> ah, that.. yeah
[03:25:04] <jeaye> A good terminal, then.
[03:25:04] * bjz love *nix systems, despite some of their flaws
[03:25:07] <mordof> jeaye: it is more convenient that way, lol.
[03:25:15] <mordof> jeaye: learning power shell + making my own currently
[03:25:21] <jeaye> oh god
[03:25:23] <bjz> super great dev environments
[03:25:29] <jeaye> bjz: Yup
[03:25:59] * bjz is a design/ui snob though, which makes it hard for him to use linux
[03:26:00] <mordof> i shall say this: let the record state, i'm moving into a job that is primarily a windows oriented software environment
[03:26:18] <mordof> so that's one of the main reasons i opted to look into power shell
[03:26:19] <bjz> mordof: np, I don't judge
[03:26:29] <mordof> going to be working with stuff that mainly runs on Win 2008 R2
[03:26:36] <mordof> and having powershell knowledge will be helpful
[03:26:43] <bjz> yeah
[03:26:53] <mordof> my C# custom console will help doing things like chaining commands, grep in results, etc
[03:27:02] <mordof> power shell does a lot of that too though
[03:27:03] <bjz> powershell is supposed to be pretty decent
[03:27:08] * mordof nods
[03:27:26] <mordof> it allows for the unix counter-part commands to be used for many things
[03:27:52] <mordof> it still is based off of the old console though, so the buffer is pretty bad
[03:29:50] <jeaye> I run irc, email, music, downloads, package management, and just about everything else through the terminal. I can't imagine doing so in powershell
[03:30:28] <mordof> jeaye: no, i imagine not
[03:31:03] <mordof> i have powershell linked to ctrl+alt+a key shortcut, and I've been making small exe files that allow me to launch any of my programs with a small command, that has been added to my PATH
[03:31:38] <mordof> so many of my programs and things that require flags and whatnot get reduced down to one-liners that i can easily remember, even if they're for managing database work and whatnot
[03:32:06] <mordof> after that I mainly stick to programs with some form of GUI
[03:36:44] <mordof> bjz: http://cl.ly/image/050X3n3l031l   is it supposed to take a long time at that line?
[03:37:35] <mordof> the cursor keeps alternating from blinking regularly, and then stops like it's locked up... so i'm assuming it's still doing something
[03:39:36] <bjz> hmm, can't see it
[03:39:41] <mordof> o.o
[03:42:28] <jeaye> mordof: A watched pot never boils.
[03:42:52] <mordof> entirely untrue o.o i don't like that saying, lol
[03:43:03] <mordof> that saying is 100% referring to the perception of time passing and that's all
[03:43:42] <mordof> while the idea behind it does apply here...
[03:43:42] <jeaye> Ensure that you're building with the -jN flag, too (where N is the number of jobs you'll allow).
[03:43:53] <mordof> hm?
[03:43:59] <mordof> all i did was type 'make'
[03:44:12] <jeaye> heh, single core compiling then
[03:44:25] <jeaye> make -j8 # Run 8 concurrent jobs for the build
[03:44:25] <mordof> that's fine, it's in a VM that has few resources applied to it
[03:44:53] <jeaye> You said you gave the VM two cores.
[03:44:55] <mordof> it's been well over an hour now, so i don't think it'll help if i cancel / restart with that
[03:45:14] <jeaye> Be sure to build `make -j2` next time.
[03:45:18] <mordof> ok
[03:46:02] <jeaye> This applies to any project using make.
[03:46:14] <mordof> ah

[04:46:52] <manud> I got sick of building Rust, luckily you don't need to… use this guy's PPA
[04:48:24] <jeaye> Yeah, my package manager gives me a daily build of Rust as well (Arch). If you can get that working, mordof, you should prefer it.
[04:50:51] <mordof> jeaye: i couldn't get cinnamon WM working on arch
[04:50:55] <mordof> it was being weird

[04:54:24] <manud> mordof: yep :)
[04:54:33] <mordof> okm
[04:55:16] <mordof> added the ppa, updated, can't locate rust or rustc.
[04:55:20] <mordof> what's it called in this?
[04:55:54] <mordof> ah, 0-7 - that's what it uses
[04:56:02] <mordof> 0.7*
[04:56:40] <mordof> woo ^_^ good to go

[05:48:25] <mordof> i had a pretty good idea of what it was doing, just .. the terminology is taking a bit longer to get used to as well

[06:30:40] <mordof> destructors and ~ heap memory allocation are confusing to me
[06:41:05] <mordof> yikes... pretty much everything after point 7 in the tutorial went right over my head
[06:41:40] <mordof> bjz: turns out this is going to be more painful than i imagined, heh
[06:41:58] <bjz> ok
[06:42:05] <bjz> umm
[06:43:24] <bjz> so (might be getting this wrong) in your GC languages like Java, usually everything other than numeric literals are allocated to the heap, and are managed by GC
[06:43:31] <bjz> like with @
[06:44:57] <bjz> the issue is cleaning up afteryourself, after you've allocated memory
[06:46:07] <bjz> GC does it automatically, but it causes overhead
[06:46:46] <bjz> it has to do this freeing of memory dynamically, at runtime
[06:47:02] <mordof> mhmm...
[06:47:13] <mordof> i think my brain might be too far gone tonight to handle this >.< lol
[06:47:42] <bjz> C on the other hand, allows you to allocate/deallocate memory manually, using malloc/free
[06:48:34] <bjz> the issue with that is that you a) have to remember to call free when your done (otherwise you get a memory leak), and b) not free anything that
[06:48:45] <bjz> 's in use by something else
[06:48:50] <mordof> right
[06:49:41] <bjz> the cool thing about Rust is that it can calculate where to put all the mallocs and frees statically at compile time
[06:50:03] <bjz> meaning no runtime performance hits, and no mistakes by silly humans
[06:50:11] <mordof> oh nice
[06:50:31] <bjz> it can do this using 'ownership' and 'lifetimes'
[06:51:16] <bjz> lifetimes are those <'a> and &'a things - that lets the compiler know how long things live for
[06:51:48] <bjz> ownership is indicated by ~ & and @ (I think)
[06:51:58] * mordof nods
[06:52:08] <bjz> anyway, ~ does the automatic malloc/free
[06:52:29] <mordof> why would you use allocated memory?
[06:52:44] <mordof> I've never researched it before, i have no idea of it's purpose
[06:52:56] <bjz> if you don't know the size of something is one reason
[06:53:14] <bjz> like with an vector or string
[06:53:22] <bjz> ~[T]/~str
[06:53:42] <bjz> or with a trait object ~Trait
[06:54:05] <bjz> it's faster to try and reduce allocations though
[06:54:51] <mordof> hm
[06:54:53] <bjz> but yeah, the condition with ~ is that it is only loaned out to one thing at a time
[06:55:14] <mordof> definitely too much to take in right now
[06:55:24] <mordof> i'll have to come back to this once I've worked with it a decent amount more
[06:55:29] <bjz> yeah
[06:55:30] <bjz> sorry
[06:55:36] <mordof> s'ok, thanks though
[06:55:44] <bjz> I find it a little tricky too
[06:55:46] <mordof> i kinda followed that.. but later parts of it just go way over my head
[06:56:07] <bjz> yeah, for now you can just use ~[] and ~str blindly
[06:56:20] <mordof> heh
[06:56:24] <bjz> and use stack allocated values otherwise
[06:56:36] <bjz> (that's if it has no sigil)
[06:56:43] <mordof> brain = fried
[06:56:43] <mordof> xD
[06:56:52] <mordof> 3am - bed time
[06:56:52] <bjz> you can actually get pretty far with that
[06:56:55] <bjz> ok
[06:56:57] <bjz> night!
[06:57:02] <bjz> stop by again!
[06:57:04] <mordof> goodnight, thanks so much for all your help :)
[06:57:09] <bjz> np
[06:57:11] <bjz> :)
[06:57:11] <mordof> i will indeed be back, and furthering my adventures

[17:15:30] <mordof> bstrie: just simple stuff.. but I'm used to a GUI environment more, so i can challenge myself better when it's something like that - apparently rust isn't mature enough for a solid GUI crate yet
[17:16:43] <mordof> bstrie: because i compiled Rust in a VM, and it's troublesome to use for windows right now, I'm more only using it to learn what it's about for the time being until it becomes more mature anyway
