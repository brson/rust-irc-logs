[01:28:56] <bascule> see also: http://ebats.cr.yp.to/cpucycles.html
[01:30:10] <Ilari> Also, it came to mind... Those hash truncation attacks, and we were wondering what schemes are like that... I think RIPEMD has some truncations, but less obscure example: SHAKE* (SHA-3 XOF).
[01:32:55] <Ilari> Skein has variable hash output length, but the different lengths are not truncations.
[01:42:32] <Ilari> Skein is the most kitchen sink hash algorithm I have ever seen.
[01:48:58] <bascule> heh

[12:37:56] <Ilari> Whee, Leap seconds.
[12:39:27] <Ilari> Well, at least it isn't quite as fun with leap seconds (at least you get months of warning) than DST of some countries (which seem to have national hobby tweaking DST rules, with couple weeks of warning).
[12:40:56] <Tiffany> eh
[12:41:05] <Tiffany> at least DST doesn't poison the machine representation of time
[12:41:11] <Tiffany> it just fudges up presenting time to users
[12:44:44] <Ilari> At least in LHC leap second didn't cause problems (well, the acclerator was essentially shut down for unrelated reason). :-)
[12:48:41] <Tiffany> actually, I'm wrong
[12:49:05] <Tiffany> only broken old ntp servers actually mess up unix time to adjust for leap seconds
[12:49:29] <Tiffany> I wonder how complex the rules of DST get
[12:49:49] <Tiffany> like, could I just create a time protocol which would automatically download a list of upcoming leap seconds and DST changes?
[12:50:08] <Tiffany> instead of everyone having to update their timekeeping software
[12:50:25] <Tiffany> I know ntp has some sort of leap second flag
[12:52:02] <Ilari> Well, timezone data files do have DST changes (including future ones as well as those can be predicted).
[12:53:05] <Ilari> And I think there is some work on protocol to access TZ database. Dunno about similar work with leap seconds.
[12:55:42] <Ilari> Also, with upcoming leap seconds, there can be at most one upcoming leap second currently.
[12:59:33] <Ilari> Things might get more interesting when Earth's rotation slows sufficiently that one would need to have leap seconds more often than once in 6 months.
[13:03:36] <Ilari> 5.5ms difference from 24 hours would already be enough for that, and the current difference is something like 1-2ms (it varies).
[13:06:09] <Ilari> I think current Linux kernel timekeeping code would accept leap second at end of any day (it has a flag that causes kernel to insert/delete a leap second at end of day).
[13:10:21] <Ilari> Apparently the rate Earth's rotation slows down is 1.4ms per rotation per 100 years. So in 1000 years, even 4 leap seconds a year wouldn't be enough.
[13:16:31] <Ilari> Tiffany: Then there is GPSTIME (which works like TAI, except it is 19 seconds behind).

[18:52:35] <Tiffany> https://twitter.com/thegrugq/status/618094554940489728 but how can you achieve forward secrecy without a handshake?
[18:55:57] <bascule> Tiffany: a system like Axolotl, where you have some sort of introducer
[18:56:00] <Ilari> Oh, found a link to wikimedia TLS cipher stats. ECDHE is at ~95% and TLS 1.2 at ~82%
[18:56:12] <Tiffany> it looks like this person is implying that it's not worth bothering with handshake-less communication at all
[18:56:19] <Tiffany> going through later tweets
[18:56:45] <Tiffany> I think the main thing here is that
[18:56:52] <Tiffany> I don't see how forward secrecy would help
[18:57:01] <Tiffany> these are *archives*, not sessions that will be thrown away afterwards
[18:57:08] <Tiffany> it's not off the record, it's on the record
[18:57:34] * bascule wants to build an encrypted chat system where all communication goes through the archive! :o
[18:57:39] <bascule> no multiparty Diffie-Hellman
[18:57:44] <bascule> no confusion about message ordering
[18:58:06] <bascule> no chance of different participants seeing different versions of the conversation
[18:58:16] <bascule> all you can do is DoS someone so they can't read the archive
[18:59:27] <Tiffany> I suppose for email it is reasonable to have a handshake
[18:59:44] <Tiffany> well, no
[18:59:51] <Tiffany> because you can send email to people while offline
[19:00:04] <Tiffany> although I suppose you could do the handshake once and then just store the key permanently
[19:00:12] <Tiffany> and derive a new one every message, like the old version of noise
[19:00:46] *** eddyb_ is now known as eddyb
[19:01:25] <Tiffany> my main usecase for PGP is storing certain files on my filesystem encrypted
[19:01:30] <Tiffany> I should probably enable whole-disk encryption
[19:01:41] <Tiffany> I don't know if I can do that after the fact, but I'll try to do it on my next OS install
[19:03:57] <bascule> Tiffany: Axolotl is designed for the offline use case
[19:04:20] <bascule> Tiffany: you can imagine the user's MUA is down, but they publish their keys through a key directory, and that key directory is always up
[19:04:33] <bascule> so the sender and key directory need to be online, but the recipient does not
[19:04:45] <Tiffany> when I google axolotl I get a salamander thing

[19:04:59] <bascule> https://whispersystems.org/blog/advanced-ratcheting/
[19:05:55] <bascule> the idea is you can piggyback new ephemeral D-H keys on previous messages

[20:15:41] <Elaine> Well openssl has an endless stream of bugs.
[20:15:51] <fkr> n+1
[20:16:04] <Elaine> Just be glad the public is finding them too :)
[20:16:15] <Lurkin> Well sure but not every bug is skid drive by ammo.
[20:17:23] <Lurkin> Honestly contemplating moving to boring or libre but boring said they would offer patches to openssl and libre said the same so I wasn't sure there was much to gain from switching.
[20:17:47] <Elaine> they deimplement some stuff and remove a lot of crap, don't they?
[20:17:56] <Lurkin> Yes they do.
[20:18:27] <Lurkin> But I had thought it might be be premature to toss the baby out with the bathwater just because openssl was getting some much needed scrutiny so I waited.
[20:18:40] <Elaine> personally NSS seems like a good bet to me for the client, given that Chrome and Firefox both use it, not sure what it's like a sa server though
[20:19:09] <Lurkin> Doubled down on proper configs/disabled bad ciphers and hoped for the best, all I could do really.
