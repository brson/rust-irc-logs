[02:33:44] <Kelet> Hi, nice channel. I was actually working on a 2D game in Ocaml but am thinking of riding the wave with Rust. Unfortunately it seems like the SDL2/SFML2 bindings are in flux and I can't seem to build them on Windows (although on Linux I've had a bit of success).
[02:33:58] * Kelet will try again tomorrow to get everything going perhaps.

[02:38:41] <bjz> Kelet: there are glfw3 bindings, but you'd have to do the 2d with raw opengl
[02:39:08] <bjz> Kelet: abit trickier than using SDL/SFML
[02:39:18] <Kelet> Graphics aren't a major part of my game, as they will be quite simplistic, but I'm hoping to have either SDL2 or SFML2 to abstract things away a little.
[02:39:31] <bjz> yeah
[02:39:50] <bjz> would be nice if we had a pure 2D rust lib
[02:39:56] <bjz> like Processing
[02:40:03] <Kelet> I'm having trouble building Rust master on Windows, which is what the SDL2/SFML2 bindings need though.
[02:40:26] <Kelet> And I do about half my development on Windows, so it's sort of a must-have.
[02:40:26] <bjz> Kelet: might want to chat on the main channel about that
[02:40:33] <bjz> yeah, definitely
[02:40:37] <Kelet> I've tried a couple of times
[02:40:47] <bjz> I don't use windows, but I will need it in the future
[02:40:54] <Kelet> The information about building Rust on Windows is outdated on the wiki.
[02:40:59] <bjz> mm
[02:41:21] <bjz> Kelet: if you figure it out, it would be awesome if you could update it
[02:41:28] <Kelet> Definitely will if I get it going.
[02:42:21] <Kelet> It's unfortunate that this is such a recurring problem for me. No matter what language I'm working in, trying to get a usable environment in Windows is an absolute bitch.
[02:42:31] <Kelet> Except maybe in C++ and such highly-used languages.
[02:42:59] <Kelet> And with Rust still being in such flux, and the bindings too, it's even harder. But ah well, I'm willing to spend the extra time possibly.
[02:43:31] <bjz> Yeah
[02:43:46] <bjz> trouble is Windows is a massive pain to develop on :(
[02:44:20] <bjz> hopefully with the Windows work on the llvm side of things, it might make it easier for Rust
[02:44:32] <Kelet> Kinda wish someone would just throw up some nightly or weekly Rust builds for Windows soon.
[02:44:37] <Kelet> Especially know that Rust has a build bot.
[02:44:46] <bjz> yeah

[12:03:26] <Amaranth> That reminds me, I need to wire up SDL_GL_GetProcAddress so I can try mixing rust-sdl2 and gl-rs
[12:04:04] <sebcrozet> refD: There are opengl and glfw bindings.
[12:06:14] <sebcrozet> refD: there is not a lot of applications yet. Q³ and kiss3d use those bindings and work well (not sure if Q³ uses gl-rs or opengl-es).
[12:07:57] <sebcrozet> refD: (just cheked, Q³ uses rust-opengles).
[12:13:38] <Amaranth> Wait, is rust-opengles actually a common subset of GL 2 and GLES 2?
[12:16:04] <Amaranth> Looks like it started as GL 2 and then got bits turned off conditionally until it was also valid for GLES 2

[20:30:09] <jeaye> :P
[20:30:12] <tiffany> kind of like love2d?

[20:30:40] <tiffany> it looks ilke it has more builtins
[20:30:48] <cmr> but yeah same idea
[20:31:48] <cmr> hm you're right, love is simpler
[20:32:10] <cmr> It'd be super cool if rust actually had working static linking, so one could distribute single binaries.
[20:32:25] <cmr> Someone was working on it
[20:32:25] <tiffany> I'm not a fan of packing everything into the binary
[20:32:36] <tiffany> is it really so hard to unpack a zip file instead
[20:33:10] <cmr> Not really, I suppose.
[20:33:19] <cmr> But you need to include a copy of the entirety of every library you use
[20:34:38] <tiffany> that is a bit annoying to do I guess

[20:48:29] <JesseH> I have something for you jmgrosen one moment
[20:48:34] <jmgrosen_> great
[20:49:53] <cmr> jmgrosen_: How did you get rustc to generate a static library? rustc -c plus manual ld?
[20:50:07] <cmr> Does it generate PIC by default?
[20:51:25] <JesseH> http://www.raphkoster.com/gaming/gdco12/Koster_Raph_Theory_Fun_10.pdf
[20:51:33] <jmgrosen_> cmr: `rustc --lib -Z static std.rs` gave me std.o, which I could then (…with some work) link into libstd.a
[20:52:30] <JesseH> I think thats the one, jmgrosen 
[20:52:31] <JesseH> checking
[20:53:53] <jmgrosen_> uh, I don't think so -- seems more philosophical than technical :P
[20:54:02] <JesseH> exactly :P
[20:54:08] <jmgrosen_> interesting, nonetheless
[20:54:44] <JesseH> I try to focus more on getting something that is finished and fun, before I worry about optimization and all that
[20:55:37] <JesseH> and learning other concepts if you can't figure them out yourself, is as simple as googling :P
[20:55:44] <JesseH> love the internet
[20:55:53] <jmgrosen_> well, I don't really even know where to start programming-wise
[20:56:02] <JesseH> The game loop
[20:58:19] <JesseH> Good place to start research on that, I think http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/651/tips-for-writing-the-main-game-loop
[20:58:50] <JesseH> The love framework I use takes care of the game loop, and provides us with callbacks
[20:59:01] <JesseH> like love.load() love.update(dt) and love.draw
[20:59:13] <JesseH> DT is deltatime, usually around 0.3333

[20:59:44] <Kelet> Would be nice to have such a framework in Rust but it'll probably be a year or three :/
[21:00:05] <JesseH> It's according to how long it takes me to learn Rust, and how long it takes me to produce it :P
[21:00:18] <JesseH> All of which, is at the mercy of my wallet
[21:00:28] <Kelet> Mostly just crying b/c it's hard to get a reasonable development environment in Rust on Windows, but then again that's the case with most heavily in development projects and/or more obscure projects.
[21:00:47] <JesseH> You would enjoy something like Ubuntu I think
[21:00:47] <Amaranth> Windows is sort of an odd man out
[21:01:11] <Kelet> It is, but in the context of game development you need to develop with it in mind.
[21:01:12] <Amaranth> If you make something for anything that isn't Windows it generally works on all of the non-Windows things with little to no extra work
[21:01:29] <Amaranth> While Windows is a completely different environment

[21:05:00] <JesseH> You know, once you got to that point
[21:05:02] <Kelet> What would be the basis of your library though?
[21:05:07] <Kelet> SDL 2 and OpenGL?
[21:05:09] <JesseH> opengl
[21:05:14] <cmr> I'd use opengl and glfw

[21:05:23] *** Joins: sebcrozet (sebcrozet@moz-2517AE39.w80-13.abo.wanadoo.fr)
[21:05:27] <JesseH> Use SDL for input
[21:05:31] <JesseH> sounds about right
[21:05:37] * cmr would use glfw for input
[21:05:53] * jmgrosen_ agrees
[21:06:02] * JesseH is neutral 
[21:06:03] <JesseH> :P
[21:06:22] <cmr> Mostly because glfw is the only thing that really works and is maintained
[21:06:27] <cmr> Because servo uses it
[21:06:36] <JesseH> So game loop + callbacks + lua + some love.gaphics stuff = success and profit
[21:06:40] <tiffany> kelet: it's because windows is a pretty awful environment to develop for
[21:06:48] <cmr> Although, sprocketnes is sdl and pcwalton keeps it working
[21:06:53] <cmr> Though you need to be runtimeless to use it atm
[21:07:09] <tiffany> my engine has been on and off with windows support through its history
[21:07:52] <JesseH> I havent focused on a game specifically for windows in so long :|
[21:07:56] <JesseH> or well
[21:08:06] <JesseH> focused on a game WORKING on windows
[21:08:11] <JesseH> love takes care of that for me :-)
[21:08:29] <tiffany> your choices are visual studio (which only started C99 support in 2013, and doesn't work on my computer because IE10 hates hybrid graphics), mingw (which is poorly supported by foss projects; their autoconf projects often fail spectacularly when given windows-style paths)
[21:08:45] <tiffany> and the likeliness of getting anything to compile rapidly drops off after that
[21:09:00] <cmr> tiffany: visual studio doesn't have a C compiler
[21:09:10] <cmr> so of course they don't work on supporting the latest C standards
[21:09:24] <Amaranth> That reminds me, I recently learned MSVC does not use an AST
[21:10:08] <Amaranth> I have no idea how that compiler works as well as it does
[21:12:11] <tiffany> I heard vs 2013 did C99, cmr
[21:12:16] <tiffany> my engine uses C99
[21:13:27] <Amaranth> They've added a few more things from C99
[21:13:46] <Amaranth> The rumor is since they started using git internally they updated the compiler so it can actually build it
[21:14:04] <Kelet> Well, I'm just glad that Windows is slated to have first-class Rust support by the actual release time. Too many languages look good, but because they don't support Windows very well they aren't suitable for many categories of programs.
[21:14:43] <cmr> Kelet: We're really close to first-class Windows support already
[21:14:53] <jmgrosen_> are we still going to use mingw?
[21:14:54] <cmr> I don't think there are any missing features
[21:14:54] <Amaranth> iirc a lot of the problems are on the LLVM side
[21:15:12] <cmr> All we need to do is use a different linker
[21:15:14] <tiffany> maybe someone should get working on a nice GUI-based rust repl
[21:15:18] <tiffany> windows cmd is pretty awful
[21:15:24] <cmr> tiffany: I use mintty
[21:15:32] <tiffany> I tried that and it crashed
[21:15:33] <cmr> cmd.exe is intolerable
[21:15:34] <Kelet> conemu + bash here
[21:15:36] <tiffany> mutiple times
[21:15:45] <tiffany> well, pretty much every terminal I tried ended up breaking or crashing
[21:16:01] <Kelet> conemu has never had stability problems for me, but it is slower than other terminal emulators.
[21:16:10] <jmgrosen_> cmr: are we going to keep using mingw for rust, or will we be switching to VS?
[21:16:21] <cmr> jmgrosen_: To do what?
[21:16:35] <Amaranth> To build libuv I guess
[21:17:02] <jmgrosen_> cmr: well, basically, all I care about is can I build rust programs on windows without installing mingw
[21:17:10] <jmgrosen_> because mingw is a huge pain
[21:17:14] <Kelet> Anyhow, I've tried to build Rust on Windows a multitude of times. Much of the information seems outdated, and I've spent about a full day trying to fix problems and get an environment which is capable enough. So while the language support might be there, it's confusing for us that just want to *use* Rust right now.
[21:17:29] <jmgrosen_> yeah, I've never been able to build rust on windows either
[21:17:45] <cmr> Kelet: Thad updated the wiki the other day
[21:17:54] <jmgrosen_> which is too bad, because I wrote something in it that I wanted to use on the school computers, which run windows
[21:17:58] <Kelet> I'm sort of content with waiting, and I realize the language is in flux so I don't bother with it too much. When everything stablizes this shouldn't be a problem as the official installer should be good.
[21:18:02] <Amaranth> I seem to remember recent comments on how a new snapshot would make the windows side much much easier
[21:18:14] <Kelet> But right now it seems every active library under the sun uses master.
[21:18:20] <Kelet> cmr, Thanks, I'll take a look
[21:18:35] <cmr> jmgrosen_: Until lld is finished, we're going to use mingw, unless someone contributes VS support
[21:18:51] <cmr> Kelet: that's because nobody uses releases :)
[21:19:02] <rsaarelm> My wishlist for Windows is basically being able to somehow set up a cross-compilation to work on a Linux box (Wine may be involved), and to be able to do statically linked binaries so that I can drop just the big exe on a vanilla Windows box and have it work.
[21:19:21] <Kelet> Which is sufficient on platforms like Linux where it's relatively easy to build Rust, but a huge pain for Windows users :<
[21:19:37] * Kelet wishes there were nightlies/weekly builds available now that we have a buildbot and such
[21:19:50] <jmgrosen_> rsaarelm: yes! static binaries are my biggest wish, particularly for windows
[21:20:21] <cmr> rsaarelm: --target-triples=i686-pc-mingw32
[21:20:30] <Amaranth> I've never actually shipped anything on Windows but I seem to remember it actually being the easiest environment to use your own libraries
[21:20:40] <cmr> Unfortunately doesn't build atm, but it's theoretically possible :P
[21:20:48] <Amaranth> Because by default it'll look in the working directory for libraries first, won't it?
[21:20:54] <cmr> (it has worked previously)
[21:20:59] <cmr> Amaranth: Yes.
[21:21:00] <jmgrosen_> cmr: is there anything in particular that lld is missing that we're waiting for?
[21:21:15] <cmr> In unix environments it's just LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH ./foo
[21:21:29] <cmr> For example, the run scripts in most steam games do that or something similar to it
[21:21:32] <Amaranth> cmr: Sure but that means a script instead of the binary itself
[21:21:41] <Amaranth> And there is always more to it
[21:21:59] <jmgrosen_> if I just want to run a rust binary on windows, do I need mingw?
[21:22:05] <cmr> jmgrosen_: good question
[21:22:07] <cmr> jmgrosen_: no
[21:22:09] <cmr> Well
[21:22:11] <jmgrosen_> (if I can figure out how to build it on one computer)
[21:22:12] <jmgrosen_> aww :(
[21:22:17] <jmgrosen_> wait
[21:22:20] <jmgrosen_> yay :)
[21:22:22] <cmr> I think you might need libgcc_s.dll or whatever it is
[21:22:29] <cmr> For the record
[21:22:31] <cmr> "good question" @ lld
[21:22:35] <cmr> "no" @ do I need mingw
[21:22:42] <jmgrosen_> okay
[21:22:55] <jmgrosen_> have we tried using lld?
[21:23:11] <cmr> Nope!
[21:24:02] <Amaranth> Writing a linker or switching to a new one isn't a very fast process
[21:24:09] <Amaranth> I seem to remember gold taking a couple years
[21:24:41] <rsaarelm> I think I had a virtualBox with a clean install of Windows 7 at some point to test whether my weird game binaries can be deployed without extra dependencies.
[21:27:01] <rsaarelm> I did learn that if you want to do anything with OpenGL, a Windows box that hasn't ever seen a graphics driver update probably has a pretty horrible OpenGL driver.
[21:27:21] <cmr> Yes, Windows ships a... GL 1.2 driver, I believe.
[21:27:28] <cmr> Pure software, of course.
[21:27:41] <jmgrosen_> that sounds wonderful
[21:27:55] <jmgrosen_> but anyone playing a game should surely have at least somewhat updated graphics drivers
[21:28:38] <cmr> I'm pretty sure windows update will automatically pull down a graphics driver authored by the vendor
[21:32:16] <Amaranth> I never actually checked, does the windows update driver include a new GL library or only the D3D part?
[21:32:27] <Kelet> On my laptop, running Linux I get OpenGL 2.1 support, but only OpenGL 1.4 on Windows :(
[21:32:47] <Amaranth> Kelet: You have a 10 year old laptop?
[21:32:56] <tiffany> kalet: probably software support
[21:33:04] <Kelet> Most likely, but it's still nice to have.
[21:33:05] <tiffany> oh, it's 1.2
[21:33:18] <tiffany> it's pretty sad how low opengl support is on some hardware
[21:33:23] <cmr> Amaranth: oh, good point
[21:33:27] <cmr> probably only d3d
[21:33:29] <tiffany> and how much people complain when they straight up can't run a game because of it
[21:33:38] <Kelet> Well
[21:33:47] <Kelet> Actually this laptop is somewhat new (although I bought it used :))
[21:33:54] <Kelet> My other laptop before this only had OpenGL 1.1 support
[21:34:02] <tiffany> my engine currently requires gl 3.1 but I'm going to be splitting it into a low-quality 2.1 renderer and a high-end 4.1 renderer
[21:34:18] <tiffany> just because there's still a lot of people running ironlake cpus
[21:34:31] <Kelet> My laptop is a GMA 950
[21:34:35] <Kelet> gfx card
[21:34:36] <tiffany> netbooks are still screwed though
[21:34:42] <tiffany> yeah
[21:34:47] <tiffany> intel was pretty far behind
[21:34:51] <Kelet> laptop was bought in like 2008-ish
[21:34:53] <Kelet> i think
[21:35:02] <Kelet> 1gb of ram 1.6ghz celeron
[21:35:06] <tiffany> they're up to 4.1 now
[21:35:12] <tiffany> but you need a shiny new ivybridge to get it
[21:35:17] <tiffany> and they don't backport drivers

[21:36:17] <tiffany> nvidia was at 4.4 the day after the spec was released, for multiple generations of products, which makes amd and intel look pretty lazy
[21:36:17] <jmgrosen_> OS X Mavericks is finally going to support 4.x, right?
[21:36:22] <Amaranth> Kelet: That's not really OpenGL 2.1 on linux
[21:36:22] <tiffany> so I hear
[21:36:36] <cmr> Amaranth: Urm, why isn't it?
[21:36:40] <tiffany> it's pretty silly how OS X supports ONLY 3.2, no more and no less
[21:36:51] <Amaranth> cmr: Vertex shaders are handled on the CPU
[21:36:54] <Kelet> Amaranth, Maybe it's just MesaGL or something weird providing it, but I don't really care because I can run games that use OpenGL 2.0+ on it, which is most games these days. Yeah, it's a bit slow but
[21:36:55] <cmr> Amaranth: So?
[21:36:59] <tiffany> amaranth: that's still opengl 2.1
[21:37:02] <Kelet> I don't think there's any way to do the same thing on Windows
[21:37:06] <Kelet> if there was, I'd use it
[21:37:06] <tiffany> there's nothing in the spec requiring hw acceleration
[21:37:16] <Kelet> There are a lot of 2d games that use a couple of 2.0 shaders
[21:37:21] <Kelet> that I'd love to play on my laptop
[21:37:23] <Kelet> but can't
[21:37:24] <jmgrosen_> tiffany: it also supports 2.1, though, right?
[21:37:32] <Amaranth> Right, I know you don't need hardware accel to support the spec
[21:37:33] <tiffany> I don't know
[21:37:41] <tiffany> it probably still offers fixed function just fine
[21:37:49] <tiffany> but if you request a context, it refuses anything but 3.2
[21:37:55] <tiffany> so I have an #ifdef in my engine for OS X because of that
[21:38:03] <Amaranth> But no one actually cares about that because if you're doing software GL you are not their market
[21:38:19] <jmgrosen_> tiffany, yeah, there's some weird stuff I have to do on OS X too
[21:38:30] <tiffany> 2d games will suffice just fine with software gl
[21:38:33] <jmgrosen_> well, it ends up being weird stuff on linux because I'm mostly on mac :P
[21:38:42] <Amaranth> And if something detects GL 2 support and switches to a shader based pipeline when they would otherwise have a fixed function pipeline for older cards you are actually going to get a slower game
[21:38:52] <tiffany> not many 2d games use gl though, because devs think it's easier to roll their own renderer
[21:39:15] <Kelet> It's pretty tempting to use semi-modern shaders for 2D games but it sucks knowing older Intel integrateds will flop on them, so you have to provide some type of fallback or just not have it
[21:39:28] <Kelet> Because otherwise they could likely handle the game
[21:39:39] <Amaranth> Personally I have decided to just not care about such hardware
[21:39:39] <tiffany> intel cards still flop on shaders even now
[21:39:53] <Amaranth> I've got sandy bridge graphics in my laptop
[21:40:00] <tiffany> my HD graphics 3000 dies on fragment ops with my engine, because of deferred shading
[21:40:03] <Amaranth> If you don't have something at least as good as that I guess you can play something else
[21:40:45] <Kelet> I do about half of my development on a GMA 950, which is what I use for the lower bound in my games, but I'm developing 2d games otherwise my lower bound would be much igher.
[21:40:48] <Kelet> higher*
[21:41:09] <Kelet> If I can keep it above 60fps consistently on my GMA 950/Celeron 1.6ghz, I go with it.
[21:41:34] <Kelet> My lower bound used to be my old EEEPC, with a 600mhz processor, but it just got too restrictive.
[21:41:49] <Kelet> (EEEPC 702 with a 2gb SSD for storage :|)
[21:42:16] <Kelet> err, 4gb
[21:43:07] <Amaranth> Kelet: Ouch, yeah, that's slower than cell phones :P
[21:44:14] <Kelet> My cell phone is like 6mhz
[21:44:15] <Kelet> :)
[21:44:18] <Kelet> but yeah
[21:44:35] <Kelet> I try to keep my games accessible to crappy hardware because they're just 2d games, and usually not too graphical on the 2d side of things anyhow.
[21:44:48] <Kelet> And I live with some relatively crappy hardware, although my main PC isn't bad
[21:44:52] <Kelet> so I kind of feel their plight
[21:46:46] <tiffany> I'm stuck with this laptop
[21:46:56] <tiffany> it has otimus but I can't use the dedicated gpu because it overheats, as the fan is broken

[21:52:47] <jmgrosen_> configuring curl on windows failed with "configure: error: ar not found in PATH. Cannot continue without ar." but mingw32-binutils is installed, which should provide it
[21:52:59] <jmgrosen_> any ideas?
[21:53:27] <cmr> jmgrosen_: Did the mingw bin dir get added to your path?
[21:53:40] <Kelet> I dunno, msys/mingw is kinda uck sometimes
[21:53:51] <Kelet> no matter how many times I install it, the msys-file package does not put a file utility in bin
[21:54:03] <jmgrosen_> cmr: what's the path to it? I'm inside msys
[21:54:53] <jmgrosen_> cmr: it's in C:\MinGW\bin, but what does that map to in mays?
[21:54:56] <jmgrosen_> *msys
[21:55:28] <cmr> C:\MinGW\bin I thought
[21:55:32] <cmr> *shrug*
[21:55:42] <cmr> I've never had any problems with mingw
[21:56:21] <jmgrosen_> cmr: it seems to be /c/mingw/bin
[21:57:47] <cmr> ah
