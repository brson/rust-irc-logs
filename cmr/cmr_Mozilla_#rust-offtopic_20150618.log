[01:12:25] * Havvy wonders why we don't see this kind of behavior on Freenode.
[01:12:28] <ChrisMorgan> Quxxy: spam occurs only occasionally; genuine unregistered users coming for support who will give up when faced with that hurdle occurs much more often.
[01:14:02] <Quxxy> Well, I have no data to back up my position
[01:14:14] <Quxxy> But I assume the mods exhausted every other option available to them
[01:14:31] <Quxxy> I know they had to start emptying out the ban list because it was full
[01:14:34] <Yurume> can we redirect a spontaneous traffic to some dedicated, moderated channel which title says the current incident and mitigations?
[01:15:21] <Yurume> so we can let unregistered users know how to register.
[01:16:00] <Quxxy> I remember niconii saying something along the lines of "can't figure out how to do that with this server"
[01:16:09] <Quxxy> The idea's *definitely* been floated
[01:19:06] <c74d> It's not `+L`?
[01:19:22] <Yurume> +f?
[01:19:25] <Yurume> not sure
[01:20:00] <c74d> +f is forward on freenode, here it's anti-flood.
[01:20:37] *** Joins: niconii (nicole@moz-r8dlmh.frgo.qwest.net)
[01:21:15] <c74d> Redirect is +L according to the server's help system, but I guess maybe its module isn't loaded.
[01:21:54] <niconii> c74d: talkin' about spam prevention stuff?
[01:22:09] <c74d> Indeed we were.
[01:22:19] <niconii> +L redirects, but only if the channel's full
[01:23:06] <niconii> that is, +l 20 would set the capacity of the channel to 20 people, and then after 20 people, no one else could join
[01:23:22] <niconii> and then +L #channel redirects any people who can't join to #channel
[01:23:34] <niconii> who can't join because of the user limit, that is
[01:23:42] <niconii> so it's not a general redirect, unfortunately
[01:24:16] <niconii> there's another module called banredirect though
[01:24:30] <c74d> …oh, there's no general way to exempt users from +l :s
[01:25:03] <niconii> i'm not sure if it's on this server or not, but basically it's an extension for normal bans
[01:25:37] <niconii> where a normal ban is nick!ident@host, a banredirect is nick!ident@host#channel
[01:25:45] <niconii> so anyone who fits that mask would be redirected
[01:25:47] <eddyb> > Rust is way past critical mass. The future looks extremely bright.
[01:26:02] <eddyb> Rust: thermonuclearly bright
[01:26:13] <c74d> Yurume: my apologies then, never mind about +L
[01:26:16] <niconii> theoretically you could use *!*@*#channel and redirect everyone who tries to join to that channel
[01:26:24] <Quxxy> eddyb: Said moments before burning up in an incandescent flare of disassociated matter
[01:26:42] <niconii> and it shouldn't move anyone already in the channel
[01:27:07] <niconii> however, bans have the side-effect of muting you; you can't talk while banned, even if you haven't been kicked
[01:27:18] <niconii> i don't know if that applies to banredirects as well
[01:28:24] <niconii> i don't even think you can talk while banned if you're voiced, i think you have to be at least an op
[01:28:29] <niconii> there might be another way around it

[02:27:40] <aatch> sunfish, I'm not seeing how reducibility is a useful property for a target language like this.

[02:28:46] <bstrie> oh hilarious, do java and windows actually assume different endianness for strings, on top of using UTF-16
[02:28:51] <sunfish> aatch: the ability to compute SSA form directly, without computing dominators, is pretty nice
[02:29:13] <sunfish> aatch: dominators themselves can be computed directly from the structure of the AST
[02:29:45] <sunfish> aatch: these properties can help really-fast JITs that still want to do some optimization
[02:30:41] <sunfish> aatch: it also happens that structured control flow tends to be more compressible than gotos, and code size is really important here
[02:31:33] <Quxxy> bstrie: I like how if you redirect output to a file in Powershell, it writes it as UTF-16, which renders the result incompatible with damn near everything else.  You cannot change this behaviour
[02:32:21] <aatch> sunfish, but is the code-size savings greater than the overhead of having to convert non-structured control flow into structured control flow first?

[04:40:54] <Quxxy> If you're not running Pro or better, you *cannot* turn of Windows Update
[04:41:01] <Quxxy> *turn off
[04:41:09] <o11c> not even though /etc/hosts ?
[04:41:27] <Quxxy> I mean through any sort of normal channel :P
[04:41:35] <Quxxy> That would *probably* work
[04:41:38] <o11c> but I'm glad I switch to Linux 6 years back and haven't looked back
[04:42:02] <Quxxy> I have too many games
[04:42:07] <o11c> I do think that "contracts" is a better approach for stability, rather than "versions"
[04:42:11] <Quxxy> And *nix desktop environments never really gel with me
[04:42:12] <o11c> I just got used to not playing games much
[04:42:30] <o11c> KDE was hell across the 3->4 transition but it's nice now
[04:43:06] <o11c> though Linux certainly has its share of fun games

[06:06:14] <WindowsBunny> oh
[06:06:20] <WindowsBunny> I think I found a mistake in winapi
[06:06:37] <WindowsBunny> GetEncSChannel is conditionally defined under #if (NTDDI_VERSION >= NTDDI_WS03)
[06:06:45] <WindowsBunny> I suspect it should be <, not >=
[06:06:55] <WindowsBunny> considering msdn says [The GetEncSChannel function is no longer available for use as of Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP.]
[06:07:12] <Quxxy> Too late, it's in the headers, it must be preserved for back compat forever :P
[06:07:33] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: It's not even in the import libraries!

[06:08:01] <WindowsBunny> what the fuck microsoft
[06:09:49] <ChrisMorgan> eddyb: I reckon that the biggest difficulty with Rust for the web client will be the impedence offered by DOM/ownership model mismatch. I wish DOM didn’t have parent/sibling tracking, then it could be purely owned. It will be interesting to see where it all goes in the future.
[06:12:30] <eddyb> ChrisMorgan: AFAIK atm wasm doesn't have DOM
[06:12:38] <WindowsBunny> I think I'll skip the bcrypt API unless someone needs it
[06:13:48] <ChrisMorgan> eddyb: sure, but it will eventually be tied in in some way.

[06:45:36] <benh> a DOM without being able to navigate to parent nodes sounds like a pain tho
[06:51:06] <WindowsBunny> benh: Perhaps pass a context structure around that stores the current path to that node
[06:51:28] <WindowsBunny> so you can get to the parent through the context, rather than the node itself

[14:20:44] <eddyb> bstrie: they should use ROM instead of DOM :P
[14:22:40] <Tiffany> quxxy: I suspect they mean assembly in the .NET sense rather than the machine code sense
[14:22:52] <eddyb> it's a much better use than asm.js
[14:23:27] <Tiffany> or maybe they did once intend to have an assembly-like format
[14:23:30] <Tiffany> and changed their minds
[14:23:33] <Tiffany>       n 1: a group of machine parts that fit together to form a self-
[14:23:33] <Tiffany>            contained unit
[14:23:44] <eddyb> Tiffany: AFAIK what they have is convertible to SSA
[14:24:01] <eddyb> so they're calling WebIR WebAssembly
[14:24:03] <eddyb> big deal :P
[14:24:18] <eddyb> I would honestly prefer if traditional assembly was forgotten
[14:24:19] <Quxxy> I was hoping for something more SPIRVy
[14:24:23] <Tiffany> uh
[14:24:32] <Tiffany> SPIR-V doesn't have goto either
[14:24:35] <Tiffany> it's all structured control flow
[14:25:05] <eddyb> someone should ask them about that
[14:25:10] <Quxxy> I remember seeing a linear sequence of bytecodes with jump labels
[14:25:33] <Tiffany> SPIR-V is careful to avoid anything which can't really be done on a GPU
[14:25:50] <eddyb> but it could be a proper subset of WebAssembly
[14:26:19] <eddyb> which means you could write your client and shader code in the same language, mmaybe
[14:26:23] <Tiffany> there are jumps and so on I think
[14:26:32] <Tiffany> but it's done in such a way that you end up with a DAG
[14:26:35] <Tiffany> iirc
[14:26:52] <eddyb> acyclic?
[14:26:57] <eddyb> you mean, no loops :P?
[14:27:14] <Tiffany> let me check the spec
[14:28:14] <Tiffany> yeah
[14:28:19] <Tiffany> there are special instructions for loops
[14:28:29] <eddyb> oh, that's diverging from LLVM
[14:28:49] <eddyb> I don't think MIR would even have that
[14:28:55] <Tiffany> OpBranchConditional
[14:28:57] <Tiffany> OpSwitch
[14:29:02] <Tiffany> OpSelectionMerge, OpLoopMerge
[14:29:13] <Tiffany> they're all "jumps" but they are very structured
[14:29:24] <eddyb> cool
[14:29:37] <eddyb> so cycles are easy to detect
[14:29:44] <eddyb> or rather, explicit
[14:30:11] <Tiffany> WebAssembly is supposed to be a literal AST though, so it probably won't be jumps but rather a tree of blocks of statements
[14:30:11] <eddyb> (kinda like weak/strong RCs)
[14:30:29] <eddyb> Tiffany: oh, I hope they make it friendly to value semantics
[14:30:39] <Tiffany> https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/blob/master/AstSemantics.md it's described here
[14:31:26] <eddyb> as long as I can put statements inside expressions, it should work fine
[14:32:37] <eddyb> (the main issue with JS is that foo || return bar; doesn't work. otherwise, it's equivalent to Rust if you use comma instead of semicolons and () instead of {})
[14:32:48] <eddyb> (actually, variable declaration is even worse)
[14:33:03] <Tiffany> "Callstack space is limited by unspecified and dynamically varying constraints. If program callstack usage exceeds the available callstack space at any time, a trap occurs." I like how they describe stack overflows as basically "your program can crash at any point in time"

[14:39:55] <Tiffany> eddyb: I don't think you'd be able to 1:1 convert very many languages to this AST
[14:40:04] <eddyb> that would be silly
[14:40:07] <Tiffany> it's basically assembly but with control flow
[14:40:13] <eddyb> you compile to it :D
[14:40:24] <Tiffany> so I don't know why you're going off about statements and expressions
[14:40:30] <eddyb> oh
[14:40:55] <eddyb> Tiffany: I was wondering whether value flow is first class or not
[14:41:10] <eddyb> i.e. whether you'd have to codegen temporary123 = value_at_end_of_block;
[14:41:20] <Tiffany> you probably would
[14:41:31] <eddyb> but they mention a "comma" instruction
[14:41:34] <Tiffany> what
[14:41:42] <eddyb> the link you sent me
[14:41:52] <Tiffany> what the hell
[14:41:56] <Tiffany> why doe this even exist
[14:42:13] <Tiffany> saving space?
[14:42:41] <Quxxy> Tiffany: I'm working on parsing it; it's just a binary serialisation of a JS AST
[14:42:50] <Quxxy> Or at least, the parts of JS that are used in asm.js
[14:42:59] <Tiffany> oh, that sounds more reasonable
[14:43:17] <Tiffany> I suppose so
[14:43:29] <Tiffany> that certainly makes a lot of sense for what it is
[14:43:39] <eddyb> bleh
[14:43:43] <sunfish> eddyb: the comma and conditional operator are very much not done deals
[14:44:06] <eddyb> sunfish: with value flow, (a, b, c) can be rewritten as {a; b; c}
[14:44:13] <Tiffany> apparently webassembly has a text format for viewing source
[14:44:30] <eddyb> sunfish: same with the conditional... but maybe that's too much like a phi
[14:44:43] <sunfish> yep, so then we start asking whether blocks should have return values
[14:44:46] <eddyb> a ? b : c => if(a) {b} else {c}
[14:44:51] <sunfish> and it's an interesting question that hasn't really been answered yet
[14:45:21] <eddyb> sunfish: in SSA form, you kinda get this for free (though the result of a block is "named")
[14:46:02] <Quxxy> sunfish: Are you involved with webasm?
[14:46:06] <sunfish> "free", which can also be thought of as "you get to rename everything" ;-)
[14:46:13] <sunfish> Quxxy: yes
[14:46:25] <Quxxy> Cool
[14:46:49] <Quxxy> I'm having fun porting the prototype unpack code from C++ to a Rust pull parser
[14:47:03] *** Quits: bombless (bombless@moz-pk7.rup.13.122.IP) (Quit: Leaving)
[14:47:18] <Quxxy> I really, *really* want a WebAsm -> native dylib AOT :D
[14:48:21] <eddyb> sunfish: the real question for the conditional is "do you want to have phi's in WebAsm?" for which I would understand an answer of "NOPE"
[14:48:39] <fmtq> so 
[14:48:45] <fmtq> WebAssembly seems to be the least worst way to do this 
[14:49:24] <eddyb> rewriting (a ? b : c) to {let result; if(a) {result = b;} else {result = c;} result} is a fine compromise
[14:49:49] <sunfish> eddyb: while nothing is finalized yet, that does seem to be the direction that best meets our goals
[14:50:14] <eddyb> mmmm excellent
[14:50:49] <Tiffany> fmtq: pretty much
[14:50:51] <eddyb> sunfish: I haven't seen any public mention of the relationship between WebAsm and SPIR-V. are they completely incompatible in designs?
[14:51:06] <Tiffany> eddyb: they're incompatible in goals, at least
[14:51:07] <eddyb> *in their
[14:51:20] <sunfish> eddyb: they're addressing quite different domains
[14:52:03] <sunfish> eddyb: although as GPUs move toward being more general-purpose, in the future it's possible we could see moves toward convergence
[14:53:40] <eddyb> cool
[14:54:53] <eddyb> sunfish: keep up the good work and the web might actually stop sucking :D
[14:57:58] <Tiffany> next up: capabilities and asking user permission
[14:58:14] <eddyb> the newer features kinda do that
[14:58:32] <eddyb> microphone, webcam, fullscreen, pointer lock, etc.
[14:58:39] <Tiffany> yeah
[14:58:47] <Tiffany> but I'd like to see it backported to other features too
[14:58:50] <eddyb> but not having the API available unless asked for is even better
[14:59:01] <Tiffany> oh
[14:59:08] <eddyb> actually :D
[14:59:09] <Tiffany> it's not like that?
[14:59:14] <eddyb> Tiffany: no
[14:59:18] <Tiffany> well then
[14:59:26] <eddyb> it just that it doesn't work until given permission
[14:59:36] <eddyb> it's the web, "does nothing" is a valid behavior
[14:59:59] <eddyb> Tiffany: I'm wondering if Mill's portals would be a good idea for FFI
[15:00:02] <Tiffany> in particular I'd prefer if webgl and offline storage asked permission
[15:00:27] <Tiffany> it'd also be nice if I could force videos to be click to play for certain websites
[15:00:31] <Tiffany> like tweetdeck
[15:00:50] <eddyb> in this case, it could be a "syscall" which gets passed slices of some buffers
[15:00:59] <eddyb> and the slicing part is first class
[15:01:20] <eddyb> (in lieu of fine-grained memory access control)
[15:01:58] <eddyb> that's probably enough for something like a 2D canvas or even WebGL
[15:02:12] <eddyb> not sure about the DOM. maybe coupled with a Virtual DOM it could work
[15:03:17] <Tiffany> but yeah my preference would be this
[15:03:40] <eddyb> I *think* the slicing part could be lowered to asm.js, unlike fancy MMU sandboxing tricks
[15:03:44] <Tiffany> the browser's preference thing has a list of checkboxes for each potentially dangerous or annoying feature, for enabled by default and enabled for this website
[15:04:00] <eddyb> Tiffany: chrome kinda has that already
[15:04:02] <Tiffany> in order to use a feature in javascript, you have to request the capability, which then either returns it, or asks the user
[15:04:10] <eddyb> but not for fine-grained features
[15:04:27] <eddyb> I think it lets you blacklist e.g. cookies for a certain domain
[15:04:31] <Tiffany> chrome's is fine grained enough for what I'm thinking of
[15:04:35] <Tiffany> but it doesn't support enough things
[15:04:41] <Tiffany> like, I'm pretty sure it allows webgl no matter what
[15:04:44] <eddyb> right, I meant fine-grained as in "every JS API ever"

[17:19:55] <WindowsBunny>  CERT_RDN_UTF8_STRING   An array of 16 bit Unicode characters UTF8 encoded on the wire as a sequence of one, two, or three, eight-bit characters.

[17:23:28] <WindowsBunny> fmtq: Don't worry, they have a few other encodings here
[17:23:29] <WindowsBunny>  CERT_RDN_T61_STRING   An arbitrary string of T.61 characters (8-bit).
[17:23:35] <WindowsBunny>  CERT_RDN_VIDEOTEX_STRING   An arbitrary string of videotext characters.
[17:23:37] <dfockler> haha is WTF-8 a real thing?
[17:23:46] <WindowsBunny> what is a videotext character?
[17:23:47] <fmtq> yes
[17:23:50] <fmtq> videotext wot

[17:24:29] <dfockler> I was thinking of characters that could play a tiny video in each one
[17:24:36] <dfockler> gif typing
[17:24:50] <WindowsBunny>  CERT_RDN_NUMERIC_STRING   Only the characters 0 through 9 and the space character (8-bit).
[17:25:16] <WindowsBunny> Imagine the poor Microsoft devs that have to support these APIs
[17:25:27] <dfockler> that's why they work at microsoft
[17:25:48] <dfockler> because if it was open source, they would be scolded for crappy api design
[17:26:39] <dfockler> and we would realize why they had to make some crazy workaround and forgive them for the crappy design choices
[17:27:44] <Astrum|Lap> I think most large code bases have lots of crappy designs
[17:27:54] <Astrum|Lap> *really large
[17:27:56] <dfockler> even small ones
[17:28:06] <Astrum|Lap> right, but it's easier to fix small code bases
[17:28:22] <Astrum|Lap> generally anyway
[17:28:27] <dfockler> yeah, but code architecture is something most people don't get to practice
[17:28:52] <Astrum|Lap> yeah
[17:29:03] <Astrum|Lap> actually, architecture seems to be more my speed
[17:29:21] <Astrum|Lap> but I don't really have an opportunity to practice as you say
[17:29:31] <dfockler> if you know all the pitfalls before hand, your project is less brittle to change, and probably goes together faster
[17:30:22] <dfockler> You don't get that kind of challenge with personal projects unless it gets really popular

[18:12:16] <Tobba> under Open GPU Documentation there's a set of utterly useless specifications

[18:15:01] <Tobba> if you want to program the GPU, you're not going to have a good time just by looking at this
[18:15:09] <Tobba> (there's an accompanying document which is also... reasonably useless)

[18:15:39] <Tobba> actually the programming guide has a list of commands, which is useful
[18:16:45] <cmr> I'm pretty confident I could write a GPU driver based on those documents alone, without too much extra hair-pulling beyond "why the fuck am I writing a GPU driver"

[18:20:13] <Tobba> cmr: I'm Ctrl+Fing through the register listing to figure out how to drive the outputs and all I see are the mad ramblings of a drunken hardware engineer
[18:20:23] <Tobba> heck a lot of these are completely undocumented
[18:21:41] <cmr> fkaa: When I was a high school freshman I was talking to one of the guys who I helped with AV at church about not being able to get something or another to work on Linux because of missing drivers and he was like "You can write a driver!" and I was like "Uh no I can't" and he showed me LDD4 and I wrote a driver. That is what started me on the path to enlightment.

[18:22:05] <fkaa> nice :)

[18:23:44] <fmtq> Crysis is not a valid char.

[18:24:25] <cmr> Tobba: a wave is a program running across many cores as a group.
[18:24:40] <cmr> it's like, the atomic scheduling unit
[18:24:50] <dfockler> they wave at each other as they execute
[18:24:58] <fkaa> sounds like something from the cold war
[18:25:23] <Tobba> cmr: that's what I was guessing, but that seems to be sort of wrong
[18:25:23] <fkaa> why is it even called atomic?

[18:25:51] <dfockler> should be called quantum
[18:25:52] <Tobba> they seem to be locked into running under one thread and executed arbitrarily
[18:25:57] <Tobba> well there's also threadgroups which does... something
[18:26:37] <cmr> Tobba: yeah if you don't know how the architecture works in general you're going to have a bad time
[18:26:45] <Tobba> cmr: it's not specified anywhere, so
[18:26:52] <cmr> I'm not sure whether that's actually documented in one place
[18:27:02] <cmr> I've just picked up a lot of it from dev marketing material mostly.
[18:28:37] <Tobba> cmr: there's 3 specs in total they tell you to read and all appear to be nigh-useless
[18:29:13] <cmr> I don't agree that they're useless.
[18:29:32] <Tobba> but afaict from a pretty graph (which happens to be one of the only places its mentioned), each core has a number of waves that are scheduled and executed according to some arbitrary rules
[18:31:08] <Tobba> cmr: they're illegible without some form of unspecified context, or extreme guesswork

[18:43:41] <dfockler> it's a continuum

[18:44:45] <WindowsBunny> >But among its many useful properties, graphene actually becomes a poorer  conductor of heat the hotter it gets, which means that despite its  incredibly high temperatures, the heat stays in a central 'hot spot'  along the suspended graphene strip, without damaging the rest of the  chip.

[20:01:35] <FreeFull> If I ever get a new computer in the future, I might put NixOS on it
[20:01:41] <c74d> that realization made me start worrying that something, somewhere on my system had been compromised in transit, so I starting fantasizing about making my own OS/package manager, and concurrently locked down my system with mandatory access-control to the point that pretty much nothing except tmux, vim, and Chromium (which had so many permissions from learning mode that it was basically
[20:01:41] <c74d> unconfined) would run
[20:02:01] <Sho_> A user in here mostly dissuaded me from trying out NixOS the other day
[20:02:23] <Tobba> what? NixOS is great
[20:02:39] <Tobba> (except when your root partition is too small, gah)
[20:02:42] <cmr> c74d: I reached the end of the paranoia rabbit hole and decided there was nothing I could do about security beyond building my own visually-auditable hardware and moving to the moon.
[20:02:55] <c74d> Tobba: use ZFS, forget partitioning!
[20:03:09] <cmr> beyond what I was already doing, at least.
[20:03:41] <Sho_> Tobba: Apparently using NixOS involves acquiring a ton of non-transferable domain knowledge (you configure things in Nix format, instead of directly) and that knowledge is hard to acquire because of poor documentation
[20:03:50] <Sho_> Tobba: So doesn't sound like something I want to invest any time in
[20:04:02] <Tobba> the Nix language is really simple
[20:04:15] <Tobba> it's easier to figure out than most configuration files themselves, anyways
[20:04:24] <Sho_> Yeah, but then you only know how to do things on nix
[20:04:25] <c74d> the documentation seems fine to me
[20:04:33] <Sho_> Which is only useful on nix
[20:04:37] <fmtq> as opposed to 
[20:04:40] <FreeFull> I've never had a root partition separate from /home
[20:04:43] <fmtq> only knowing how to configure each package?
[20:04:47] <fmtq> I mean you're never winning
[20:04:55] <fmtq> "I learned dovecot!"
[20:04:56] <fmtq> congrats
[20:04:57] <FreeFull> Not sure why I'd want to
[20:04:59] <fmtq> that is not transferable either

[20:05:13] <o11c> FreeFull: I tried it for a while, it was *really* annoying
[20:05:14] <Sho_> it's transferable to dovecot on every distro tho
[20:05:16] <Tobba> though I never bothered to set that up, so vOv
[20:05:26] <cmr> Tobba: encrypted root partition!
[20:05:28] <FreeFull> Tobba: You might want to encrypt the root partition too though
[20:05:44] <Tobba> cmr: broken last I tried :(
[20:05:50] <cmr> on nix or in general?
[20:05:52] <Tobba> though that was on something like 1.8 stable
[20:05:53] <cmr> certainly not in general
[20:05:57] * cmr doesn't use nixos
[20:06:04] <FreeFull> o11c: Back in the olden days, /home would have been on a separate drive
[20:06:14] <c74d> oh, don't use ZFS with LUKS, dm-crypt has some possible bug that's said to break ZFS
[20:06:20] <Tobba> broken due to a bug in NixOS's initrd, it'd see that the root device was missing, try to initialize LVM drives, initialize them 20 times then fail
[20:06:32] <Tobba> (and then try to mount the LUKS partitions)
[20:06:32] <cmr> lol
[20:06:39] <Sho_> i just use btrfs and don't even have partition tables anymore
[20:07:13] <cmr> I don't even remember how this machine is setup. I have documentation I wrote somewhere, but...
[20:07:28] <Tobba> FreeFull: I could encrypt it, but you can't reallth authenticate it, so
[20:07:31] <Tobba> really*
[20:07:35] <c74d> cmr: how long did building a LFS system take you?
[20:07:58] <cmr> c74d: I don't remember, this was roughly 5 years ago.

[23:31:32] <cmr> Well that's what you get for installing stupid extensions :P
[23:31:39] <cmr> Well, that's actually a useful extension.
[23:31:53] <cmr> It'd be nice if there were an extension that randimzed the utm_ parameters.
[23:31:56] <eddyb> it showed up as a novelty somewhere some time ago
[23:31:57] <c74d> it seems like a horribly trolly extension to me :|
[23:32:09] <eddyb> c74d: only if someone actually uses that data
[23:32:13] <cmr> In fact, let's just turn off query strings and all non-standard headers and cookies.

[23:33:00] <cmr> let's start a movement
[23:33:44] <eddyb> uBlock seems more limited in configuration options
[23:33:54] <eddyb> wait
[23:33:58] <eddyb> "I am an advanced user"
[23:34:07] <eddyb> hahahaha yeah
[23:34:34] <dfockler> eddyb: you could literally commit a pull request to it, I think you are advanced

[23:35:19] <eddyb> this thing https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Dynamic-filtering:-quick-guide
[23:36:01] <eddyb> it still seems limited to adblock-like filtering
[23:36:17] <fmtq> so 
[23:36:26] <fmtq> I have cookies disabled by default.
[23:36:34] <fmtq> it has been over a year since I did it.
[23:36:44] <fmtq> I still randomly have to enable cookies on websites I have visited even a month before

[23:36:54] <fmtq> :|
[23:36:58] <c74d> eddyb: may I ask, what are some other URLs that this thing has generated?
[23:37:01] <fmtq> moar tracking cookie for you melawd?
[23:37:13] <dfockler> fmtq: they just want to please their managers

[23:37:40] <cmr> eddyb: stop it.
