[00:00:24] <jack> I can see the implicit part, but .0 is also implicit.
[00:01:19] <nrc> well, there is a `.0` right there in the code, so in that sense it is not
[00:01:37] <njn> jdm: |no_jsmanaged_fields!(mem::ProfilerChan);| gives me "error: no rules expected the token `::`"
[00:01:39] <nrc> `foo.bar()` vs `foo.0.bar()`
[00:01:40] <jack> I mean, there will be a '*' in the code instead of .0.
[00:01:56] <jdm> njn: yeah, you need to `use mem::ProfilerChan`
[00:01:58] <mbrubeck> jack: Deref gets called implicitly without * for method calls and field access
[00:02:02] <mbrubeck> and for deref coercions on pointers
[00:02:11] <nrc> what mbrubeck said
[00:02:17] <jack> Ah. I thought you meant that the implementation of deref was implicit.
[00:02:25] <jack> (Which is true for .0 too)
[00:02:45] <njn> jdm: and is script_task.rs the right spot for that? lots of those decls are in trace.rs...
[00:02:57] <jdm> njn: right, I meant that you should add it to the list in trace.rs :)

[02:45:39] <jdm> njn: my first thought was that each time the report happened it could grab it list of pages contained in the script task and concatenate them like urls(a.com/page.html,a.com/page2.html)

[02:50:36] <mwu> they can't
[02:50:57] <mwu> we call into SM which instantiates them for us

[12:17:54] <Ms2ger> eddyb, so how do I hire you? :)
[12:17:54] <larsberg> eddyb: async/await, at least in C# world, is mainly used to async-ify blocking I/O operations. In Servo, we already move all of that into separate tasks and communicate with them over channels asynchronously, so I'm not super sure where we'd use it.
[12:18:03] <Ms2ger> Morning larsberg 
[12:18:16] <larsberg> Ms2ger: good afternoon!
[12:18:54] <jgraham> One might imagine that e.g. networking code could benefit from fewer tasks whilst maintaining concurrency, but that's more or less pure speculation
[12:19:21] <larsberg> eddyb: I've chatted a bit with niko about the need for something that would auto-CPS-transform blocking channel ops, as it would make it super easy to make a threadpool-style abstraction over it instead of our zillion-thread-madness, but that's still at the "ideas over beer" level
[12:19:40] <eddyb> larsberg: I'm asking because I have something figured out
[12:20:01] <eddyb> and it should work out with the MIR nmatsakis is designing
[12:20:19] <eddyb> larsberg: a common abstraction encompassing generators and async/await
[12:20:54] <eddyb> current sketch is at https://gist.github.com/eddyb/822c658190ccf18058db
[12:21:12] <eddyb> Ms2ger: you wait 5 more years?
[12:21:40] <larsberg> jgraham: Yeah, I like having all of the networking, image, and file I/O centralized in a single task so that we can manage the overall number of threads, modem usage, etc. sounds necessary. Having everything fired off async from each iframe seems like it may lead to madness (like our "pool of workers PER iframe" model today)

[12:24:54] <eddyb> you know I don't like reified stacks :P
[12:24:58] <Ms2ger> larsberg, but more threads!
[12:25:30] <Manishearth> dwins: (this is Amazon India, randomly got an email from them, the only  useful info in it was "transportation", the rest was all jargon)

[12:25:57] <Manishearth> eddyb: So currently reading from the net stack is a loop over a channel, basically
[12:26:11] <Manishearth> but we want to put things like a cache and mime sniffer and stuff in between
[12:26:22] <Manishearth> having individual threads for each is not great
[12:26:38] <Manishearth> async/await or ES6 generators would be great
[12:26:40] <larsberg> Ms2ger: it's almost worth it for the looks of shock and horror every time I tell an embedded systems engineer that CNN.com has, "oh, a few hundred pthreads"
[12:26:48] <eddyb> Manishearth: yeah, see my link
[12:26:53] <Manishearth> eddyb: Am I right in assuming that async/await closures do not need their own threads?
[12:26:57] <eddyb> larsberg: ahahahaha
[12:27:12] <Ms2ger> larsberg, that's all? :)
[12:27:17] <eddyb> Manishearth: in that example above they're just generators
[12:27:31] <eddyb> multiple input yield/return output generators
[12:27:34] <larsberg> Ms2ger: fortunately, we don't support document.write, so I'm pretty sure like 1/2 of the ad banner iframes don't actually load anything
[12:27:40] <eddyb> MIYROG
[12:27:45] * Ms2ger just saw something about ads using dozens of frames
[12:27:52] <eddyb> kinda like BALROG but more useful
[12:27:53] <Manishearth> eddyb: so basically closures that have multiple stopping points?
[12:28:02] <Manishearth> (Haven't read throuigh the whole thing yet)
[12:28:08] <eddyb> Manishearth: they're more or less ES6 generators

[12:28:33] <Manishearth> eddyb: swag
[12:28:35] <eddyb> but you need multiple implementations of Generator::next with different input types because you don't have JS' dynamic typing
[12:28:51] <eddyb> (the type that yield produces can vary between yield points)
[12:29:09] <Manishearth> eddyb: as long as they don't require threads to work I'm fine
[12:29:18] <eddyb> it also requires no allocation
[12:29:35] <eddyb> my example there can use fd's for files and it just allocates that 1kB buffer, once
[12:29:39] <Manishearth> eddyb: I was trying to write these as a plugin a few months ago, but handling loops and all needs me to basically half-compile things
[12:29:51] <eddyb> Manishearth: I started playing with it again beacause of the MIR
[12:30:22] <larsberg> Manishearth: the older term for this execution model is "trampolined style". There's an awesome paper from 1999-ish by Wand & Friedman on it that's totally worth reading if you're interested (as long as poorly-typeset scheme programs don't make your eyes cross).
[12:30:39] <eddyb> Manishearth: https://gist.github.com/nikomatsakis/3c59b0a48e0dcafc85e0
[12:31:10] <Manishearth> eddyb: MIR wooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
[12:31:39] <eddyb> it's a CFG with linear sequences of statements (mostly assignments. but not always SSA) as basic blocks
[12:32:15] <eddyb> a bit odd in places but good enough for transforms

[12:48:09] <larsberg> jgraham: but more seriously, it hasn't come up as a high priority for Q3 - or at least not higher than some of the critical layout issues, WebSockets support, and fixing our android/embedded woes. We're still having conversations about Q3 work, though, so feedback is welcome.

[12:56:11] <larsberg> jgraham: Though making document.write work will probably drive CNN up to 500 pthreads and I'll finally have to fix the madness left behind from the green threads removal :-)
[12:56:32] <SimonSapin> jgraham: larsberg: if we ignore unpaired surrogates, I *think* document.write is mostly a matter of wiring it up. html5ever should already allow inserting input at the from of the buffer queue
[12:57:36] <jgraham> Ignoring the hard architectural parts doesn't seem like a great idea, but on the other hand, that sounded like a volunteer ;)
[12:59:54] <larsberg> jgraham: If I get out ahead of the android/embedded stuff and nobody else hops on it, I'll look at it this quarter.
[12:59:57] * larsberg worries that it's a trap...
[13:01:50] <jgraham> I think the trap could be script scheduling
[13:02:20] <SimonSapin> jgraham: supporting surrogates in document.write and any other DOM API seems fairly orthogonal to supporting document.write at all
[13:03:39] <jgraham> SimonSapin: Yeah, I supppose there are just a few special cases around handling writes that end on an unpaired surrogate
[13:05:05] <SimonSapin> we could have a special case for that if we decide not to do wtf8 all the way

[19:42:57] <eddyb_> Manishearth: yeah, well
[19:43:02] <Ms2ger> wel'
[19:43:03] <eddyb_> Manishearth: borrowck already does its thing on a CFG
[19:43:04] <larsberg> edunham: yay! acrichto and brson mentioned something at the workweek about possibly being able to do "choose your own" snapshot by glomming together the self+cross-android+cross-arm builds, which would be great :-)
[19:43:08] <Manishearth> eddyb_: (as a plugin I mean)
[19:43:15] <larsberg> and get rid of my username from stack backtraces from the compiler
[19:43:16] <eddyb_> Manishearth: you can use the CFG as a plugin
[19:43:29] <Manishearth> eddyb_: I think linear types are comparatively easy to add to borrowck. I think.
[19:43:39] <Manishearth> I tried adding them to dropck and dynamic drop bit me
[19:43:58] <edunham> larsberg: yeah "easy cross-compiles" is on the wishlist and "servo's custom snapshot" is the stepping stone to it
[19:43:59] <eddyb_> Manishearth: were you around when I suggested that crazy rule
[19:44:11] <Manishearth> eddyb_: I have been around when you have suggested many crazy rules, which one?
[19:44:12] <eddyb_> Manishearth: "don't do anything which may unwind, with a linear type on the stack"
[19:44:31] <Ms2ger> But everything can unwind
[19:44:35] <Manishearth> eddyb_: I don't care too much about unwinding fwiw
[19:44:35] <eddyb_> forcing you to always own linear types in affine containers which do the right thing
[19:44:40] <eddyb_> Ms2ger: moves can't
[19:44:51] <eddyb_> or at least that was an example usecase
[19:45:08] <eddyb_> a Box<T, ExoAlloc<A>> where ExoAlloc<A> is zero-sized and linear
[19:45:11] <Manishearth> eddyb_: as in, most practical use cases for linear types would probably consider unwinding to be a disaster anyway
[19:45:15] <eddyb_> and you need to plug the allocator back in
[19:45:50] <eddyb_> the usecase was something like a linked list or a tree, where you only want to keep one copy of the allocator
[19:45:54] <Manishearth> eddyb_: I think we store only part of the cfg post-borrowck btw
[19:45:59] <Manishearth> borrowck discards data
[19:46:00] <eddyb_> Manishearth: the CFG is not stored
[19:46:05] <eddyb_> borrowck creates it
[19:46:14] <Manishearth> yes, and then discards it
[19:46:14] <eddyb_> it's entirely on-demand right now

[19:58:16] <eddyb_> what
[19:58:21] <Manishearth> eddyb_: sorry, bad wording
[19:58:53] <Manishearth> eddyb_: Only do codegen for #[derive] if the traits are being used, else store it as metadata
[19:59:04] <eddyb_> oh
[19:59:23] <eddyb_> Manishearth: I may have suggested HIR-based deriving
[19:59:30] <Manishearth> eddyb_: what now
[19:59:36] <Manishearth> how does that work?
[19:59:36] <eddyb_> which would allow things like automatic pass-through for all trait impls
[19:59:39] <Manishearth> oh wait I see
[19:59:43] <Manishearth> not MIR, HIR
[19:59:45] <Manishearth> makes sense
[19:59:56] <eddyb_> Manishearth: you just work on typed definitions instead of ASTs
[19:59:59] <Manishearth> yep
[20:00:17] <eddyb_> it might be easier to customize, I'm not sure
[20:00:45] <eddyb_> (can you beat higher-order macros?)
[20:01:29] <Manishearth> eddyb_: On a side note I was actually thinking of writing a derive that can apply to things from other crates (when the crate is local), using creader (not sure if it's possible).
[20:02:20] <eddyb_> Manishearth: yeah that's would be something HIR-based deriving would allow
[20:02:30] <eddyb_> harder to trigger it from a plugin
[20:02:33] <Manishearth> for example for JSTraceable and HeapSizeOf we have macros that fill in empty derive impls for external things but it would be nice if we could just run derive on the external class via metadata or HIR or something
[20:03:00] <Manishearth> (in case of jstraceable, it doesn't matter, but in case of HeapSizeOf, external objects may later decide they want to box something)

[20:32:44] <pcwalton> but so far, as far as I'm aware nobody has tried to do this level of expressiveness in a cross-platform multiprocess scenario
[20:33:04] <pcwalton> all of this pushback against modifying servo to be more multiprocess safe has pushed us way into experimental territory :(
[20:33:11] <pcwalton> but I'll keep trying
[20:33:46] <pcwalton> I guess instead of "multiprocess safe" I should say "a more conventional multiprocess application"
[20:33:51] <larsberg> AFAIK, most classic channel-oriented languages don't distinguish directionality in channels
[20:34:48] <larsberg> I'm happy that you're doing it - I'd hate to end up basically throwing away all the nifty bits of strongly-typed channel-oriented programming in the name of multiprocess (even if we *do* have to do that eventually, because security).

[20:37:10] <pcwalton> I'm fine with doing the work, I'm just worried that we may run into practical issues with becoming multiprocess because of the fact that we use OS APIs in such an idiosyncratic way in an effort to not change anything about the way servo is structured
[20:37:17] <pcwalton> kernel bugs, performance issues, etc
[20:37:36] <pcwalton> if it works, great
[20:37:45] <pcwalton> I just have a nagging worry that it may not be perfectly smooth :)
[20:37:47] <mwu> curious to see how this all works

[20:40:19] <Ms2ger> jgraham, so wpt hangs now
[20:41:03] <jack> i thought that gecko did sending pipes over pipes already
[20:41:18] <jack> at least when it came up in whistler no one sounded surprised
[20:42:03] <pcwalton> it does, but (a) I'm not sure it sends receivers over senders; (b) it uses IPDL to do so instead of trying to fit in into a serialization framework; © it uses already-existing Chromium code for this; (d) it works around kernel bugs on Mac with an acknowledgement protocol
[20:42:16] <Ms2ger> jgraham, looks like it's the stash
[20:42:49] <pcwalton> basically, what Gecko didn't do is to try to take a single-process browser and turn it into a multiprocess browser without changing any code
[20:42:59] <pcwalton> they restructured APIs to make it work
[20:43:14] <pcwalton> I'm having to try something much more ambitious because of pushback against the Gecko approach
[20:43:36] <pcwalton> which is fine, I'm happy to try this experiment
[20:43:42] <pcwalton> just warning that it may not succeed :)

[22:35:59] <pcwalton> unfortunately I'm completely stuck -- no improvements to IPC infrastructure will ever be able to let us send boxed traits because they can close over arbitrary data
[22:36:14] <jdm_> pcwalton: I guess we could just explicitly make it a Sender<ResponseAction> instead
[22:36:31] * jdm_ checks the implementations
[22:36:34] <pcwalton> ok, I'll look at that
[22:37:33] <jdm_> pcwalton: yeah, http://mxr.mozilla.org/servo/source/components/script/network_listener.rs#16 and http://mxr.mozilla.org/servo/source/components/net/image_cache_task.rs#103 just abstract over sending via a Sender
[22:37:53] <pcwalton> perhaps I can make AsyncResponseTarget into a struct wrapping a sender with a single impl?
[22:38:01] <pcwalton> that would be e10s-safe without changing the API
[22:39:37] <jdm_> pcwalton: looking at this further, this might require something like your previous server design
[22:39:59] <pcwalton> long-term or right now?
[22:40:08] <jdm_> since AsyncResponseTarget wraps sending a message to a Sender, but when that message is received it invokes methods on specific objects based on the original creator of the asyncresponsetarget
[22:40:18] <pcwalton> note that the server design should be easier now that you can send Senders and Receivers over Senders

[22:43:29] <SimonSapin> pcwalton: would `Trait + 'static` prevent closing over arbitrary data?
[22:44:01] <pcwalton> SimonSapin: yes, and we can do that in a pinch, but it has unfortunate implications for security
[22:44:33] <pcwalton> namely, if we do that, we have to be very sure that the messages only ever flow in one direction -- from trusted *to* untrusted -- never the other way around -- and Rust's type system will provide no help with this
[22:44:43] <pcwalton> if we ever mess that up, the content process can trivially take complete control of the chrome process
[22:44:58] <pcwalton> if the content process is compromised
[22:45:03] <pcwalton> so I really don't want to do that
[22:46:10] <pcwalton> (the specific attack would be: the content process sends a fake trait object with a malicious vtable pointer that points to some arbitrary code -- when the chrome process calls that method it will execute that arbitrary code using chrome privileges)
[22:46:12] <SimonSapin> pcwalton: are you thinking of an attacker crafting a vtable?
[22:46:16] <pcwalton> yeah
[22:46:23] <SimonSapin> didn’t think of that
[22:46:51] <pcwalton> there are possible defenses like vtable whitelisting or something like that… but it'll get ugly and I'm not confident in their strength

[23:15:32] <mrobinson> pcwalton: Perhaps you have some intuition about whether the following idea makes any sense:
[23:16:03] <mrobinson> pcwalton: Reusing GrContexts hasn't been very successful so far. It leads to crashes on X11 and on OS X the contents end up in the wrong textures (perhaps fixable).
[23:16:03] *** Joins: playjax (chatzilla@moz-csor9o.optusnet.com.au)
[23:16:44] <mrobinson> pcwalton: One thing we could do is to always render to the same hardware surface and then use hardware copies to "freeze" them to compositor surfaces.
[23:17:25] <mrobinson> pcwalton: The benefit is that we don't have to set up the framebuffer or switch GL contexts except once, but the downside is one more copy.
[23:18:06] <pcwalton> it seems OK to me as a strict improvement over the current Skia-GL situation
[23:18:11] <pcwalton> eventually we should try to fix it though
[23:19:07] <mrobinson> pcwalton: Do you have a sense of what the "correct" architecture is?
[23:19:26] <pcwalton> reusing GrContexts, I would assume
[23:19:28] <mrobinson> pcwalton: Chromium must just be using sharing textures?
[23:19:43] <pcwalton> so I believe Chromium on Android just does all its drawing in the content process
[23:19:47] <pcwalton> and doesn't even share over to the chrome process
[23:19:49] <pcwalton> (I'm not sure about this)
[23:19:59] <pcwalton> they do all their drawing on the compositor thread
[23:20:19] <mrobinson> pcwalton: At least on the desktop, where there is a separate GPU context, I think that the texture mailbox thing works because all of the GL calls are proxied to a single process. 
[23:20:30] <pcwalton> yeah

[23:23:42] <mrobinson> pcwalton: I guess the question is do the GL calls run serially or are they run in their own threads.
[23:24:08] <pcwalton> at this point I'm ready to give up and just run GPU painting in the compositor… they're usually proxied anyway
[23:24:13] <pcwalton> err, sorry
[23:24:20] <pcwalton> they're usually serialized in the driver's FIFO anyway
[23:25:05] <mrobinson> pcwalton: I guess the allure is that sharing contexts make everything super simple, but they have some downsides when used across threads.
[23:25:45] <pcwalton> I really don't want to use GL context sharing… I'd much rather run everything on one thread as opposed to that
[23:26:29] <mrobinson> pcwalton: Hrm. I was thinking that context sharing was only an option when using one thread.
[23:26:55] <pcwalton> context sharing works across threads, but it causes the driver to take locks internally, so it provides no advantages over single-threaded operation
[23:27:05] <pcwalton> also, I'm sure it's buggy on a lot of drivers
[23:27:26] <mrobinson> I suppose it is true that once you are on one thread, you can just use on GL context for everything.
[23:27:38] <mrobinson> (and just switch framebuffers)
[23:27:40] <pcwalton> yeah
[23:27:56] <pcwalton> at this point I'm about ready to just try that when doing GPU painting
[23:28:22] <pcwalton> at least, until we get the ability to set priorities
[23:29:33] <mrobinson> pcwalton: We probably want to do tile prioritization either way, I guess.
[23:30:02] <pcwalton> yeah, I think probably what we should do in GPU painting is to run everything in the compositor thread, but paint tile-by-tile, and pay attention to timing so that we never drop compositor frames
[23:30:06] <pcwalton> if the tiles are small that should be OK
[23:30:08] <pcwalton> kind of interleaved operation
[23:30:28] <pcwalton> but, I would only like to do that in GPU painting -- in CPU painting I'd like to continue having a separate paint thread that maintains a thread pool
[23:31:00] <pcwalton> with webrast we will probably want to repurpose that thread pool, but only for the CPU part of GPU painting
[23:31:06] <mrobinson> pcwalton: Yeah for CPU painting I think the current design is okay.
[23:31:53] <mrobinson> pcwalton: I guess what I could do is to compare the two approaches:
[23:31:57] <pcwalton> the only wrinkle is that if GPU vendors start giving us the ability to set thread priorities, then it might be attractive to be able to have a high-priority compositor thread that never drops frames and do painting in the background, to keep scrolling responsive
[23:32:18] <mrobinson> 1. Hardware copies in a separate thread
[23:32:19] <pcwalton> but I've also heard people say that due to the way GPUs work it's quite possibly impossible to ever have that fine-grained scheduling
[23:32:21] <mrobinson> 2. Serial GPU raster
[23:32:26] <pcwalton> sure, that sounds good
