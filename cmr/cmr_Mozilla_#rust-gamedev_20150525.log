[01:27:50] <Tiktalik> alright, well, blaster master is sort of like NES metroid, but way better in almost every way.
[01:29:02] <csherratt> So a game inspired by it?
[01:29:07] <Tiktalik> it's semi metroidvania. you control a nice rolly tank, explore the areas, find these doors around the world, and you can press select to get out of your tank, but then you're ridiculously fragile
[01:29:42] <Tiktalik> but you can go through the doors into a top-down section, where you shoot things, collect extra weapons for your tank, and the bosses are all in those
[01:29:48] <Tiktalik> yeah.

[06:26:37] <tomaka> HeroesGrave: There's a flag inside "Program" but I don't expose it yet
[06:27:17] <tomaka> I saw your two images the other day, and the one with sRGB is the correct result
[06:27:46] <HeroesGrave> Hmm. Maybe I'm too used to seeing linear colours
[06:28:11] <tomaka> HeroesGrave: I'm about to release 0.4.2, if you want I can add a quick hidden undocumented function to "Program" that disables sRGB
[06:28:15] <cmr> Embrace non-linear colorspaces, for there your users will thank you. Unless you're writing an image editor.
[06:28:20] <HeroesGrave> It's probably not too much of a problem, as long as its consistent
[06:28:41] <HeroesGrave> cmr: Funnily enough, that is my other project
[06:28:54] <cmr> HeroesGrave: have fun with color management, it's a living hell.
[06:29:12] <tomaka> HeroesGrave: Basically you are supposed to store images in SrgbTexture2d instead of Texture2d
[06:29:23] <tomaka> images taken with a camera or something
[06:29:34] <tomaka> because their colors are already in the sRGB color space
[06:30:13] <HeroesGrave> The image editor is Java, not Rust. I'm letting the AWT/Java2D libraries handle the colours for me.

[06:31:25] <tomaka> Images taken with a camera are in sRGB color space
[06:31:44] <tomaka> By default your screen supposes that the data sent to it is in sRGB and turns it into RGB
[06:31:49] <tomaka> (for historical reasons)
[06:32:13] <tomaka> This is not a problem as long as you don't do maths operations on colors, like adding two colors
[06:32:26] <tomaka> So in glium you put your images in an SrgbTexture
[06:32:44] <tomaka> Then in your shaders, sampling from that texture will convert from sRGB to RGB
[06:33:01] <tomaka> And then you choose whether your fragment shader outputs RGB (by default) or sRGB

[06:35:58] <niconii> all of that is sRGB
[06:36:00] <tomaka> the differences between a value in sRGB and in RGB aren't that big, so you don't necessarly notice when you do something wrong
[06:36:55] <niconii> basically the reason there's a sRGB/RGB split is
[06:37:26] <niconii> with sRGB, (127, 0, 0) isn't actually half as bright as (255, 0, 0)
[06:37:53] <niconii> rather than values being linear, there's a gamma curve that they follow
[06:38:20] <niconii> but to do math properly, you need linear values, so that's RGB

[14:38:17] <aepsil0n> mindtree: i agree. it's really difficult to deal with that split in piston libraries. if you use _one_ piston library from git, you pretty much have to change your entire set of piston dependencies, because the version in the git repos all depend on git repos.

[14:40:23] <bvssvni> it’s ok to switch to crates.io for gfx
[14:40:46] <kvark> mindtree: gfx sub-tree (as seen from piston tree) should be pretty self-contained, so I don't see how we affect your crates io dependencies
[14:41:29] <mindtree> kvark: I just mean that in piston libs, gfx deps always seem to be pointing to git repos instead of crates.io (not really any fault of gfx's :)
[14:41:40] *** Joins: Gamecubic (cubic@moz-bglmk5.mc.videotron.ca)
[14:41:53] <kvark> isn't piston using git dependencies internally too?
[14:42:01] <bvssvni> yes
[14:42:33] <bvssvni> if we switch to crates.io for gfx we need to switch all the libs
[14:43:08] <kvark> you'll need to switch all the deps pointing to gfx-rs org, but all other deps are unchanged
[14:43:16] <bvssvni> kvark: is gfx using crates.io internally?
[14:43:25] <kvark> no
[14:43:32] <kvark> will use in 0.6
[14:43:53] <bvssvni> kvark: then I think we should wait for 0.6 before switching in piston
[14:44:17] <bvssvni> because if you have git dependency to gfx, then the piston libs are broken
[14:44:20] <mindtree> bvssvni: agreed, perhaps we can do it all at once along with gfx when the time comes
[14:45:29] <kvark> bvssvni: are you sure? it's not obvious to me
[14:46:06] <kvark> piston libs are not carrying cargo.locks in them, so a simple "cargo update" should do it, no?
[14:46:39] <bvssvni> kvark: if a piston lib depends on a crates.io gfx library and you have a project using the piston lib + a git gfx dependency, then it breaks
[14:47:16] <kvark> of course, but that's not what I meant
[14:48:02] <kvark> I'm saying that all the dependencies outside of gfx-rs organization can be switched to crates.io, and it will still be fine
[14:48:36] <kvark> so technically, if you want to start converting your dependencies, you can do it now, just leave gfx-rs ones for later
[14:49:04] <aepsil0n> yep, there are many piston libs that don't depend on gfx at all. all the core abstractions and everything backed by glutin/glium
[14:49:50] <bvssvni> shall we try moving those libs now and see how it goes?

[14:51:52] <mindtree> true, I guess most of the piston stuff i've been using of late just happens to use git deps (gfx_graphics, conrod, piston_window). I'm happy to help start changing over all the stuff that can be done now though :)

[14:54:31] <aepsil0n> bvssvni: i think this is not an on/off situation. we can start at the bottom of the dependency chain and work up from there. in general, it should be sensible to move each repo to as many git-only dependencies as possible.
[14:55:16] <bvssvni> aepsil0n: are you thinking of starting with the core libraries and then take a second look?
[14:55:38] <aepsil0n> pretty much
[14:55:53] <mindtree> that sounds good - i'm sure if we miss anything, we'll hear about it :-p
[14:56:18] <aepsil0n> so input and window should be easy. and then we can look into the non-gfx backends or higher-level libraries.
[14:57:05] <bvssvni> vecmath is pretty stable, so we can move it
[14:57:23] <bvssvni> graphics too, there are not many changes
[14:57:40] <bvssvni> tell me if you need ownership on crates.io
[14:57:49] <mindtree> I'll do interpolation
[14:59:57] <aepsil0n> should we bump minor version numbers, as we go along? i guess mostly this change will simply reflect what is already on crates.io, so no, right?
[15:00:58] <bvssvni> aepsil0n: I sent you an inviation to the admin group. try edit the comment now
[15:01:39] <bvssvni> aepsil0n: if the minor version is the same, then it’s probably on crates.io
[15:02:01] <kvark> aepsil0n: FYI, our policy - https://github.com/gfx-rs/gfx-rs/issues/736
[15:02:14] <bvssvni> aepsil0n: so you just change the Cargo.toml in the library that depends on it
[15:02:32] <mindtree> one way to check is to check the date the last change occurred in the git repo and compare it to the last crates.io update (sometimes the version number is deceiving)

[15:08:00] <mindtree> aepsil0n: haha
[15:08:09] <aepsil0n> but there's one issue…
[15:08:14] <aepsil0n> "*" deps are a bad idea
[15:08:50] <aepsil0n> we should fix those to at least "0.x"
[15:09:08] <bvssvni> use “0.x.y” since “y” means smallest version
[15:09:46] <kvark> I believe it should be 0.x.*
[15:09:57] <kvark> since the last one is a patch number that doesn't affect compatibility
[15:10:32] <aepsil0n> 0.x is equivalent to 0.x.*, isn't it?
[15:10:42] <bvssvni> for 0. versions we’ll make breaking changes in the patch number, so using “0.x.y” makes it easier
[15:10:54] <kvark> aepsil0n: I didn't know that 
[15:11:18] <kvark> bvssvni: maybe just don't do breaking changes in "x" version?
[15:11:32] <bvssvni> kvark: too hard :)
[15:11:42] <aepsil0n> i'm not sure, i am just assuming…
[15:11:53] <kvark> oh cmon, as someone here noted having "0.94.15" is still legit ;)
[15:12:00] <mindtree> bvssvni: 0.395.* ;)

[15:16:30] <bvssvni> if there is a breaking change and a new version is published, cargo might try building it with older versions
[15:17:02] <aepsil0n> hm… ok, so you really want to make breaking changes between 0.1.4 and 0.1.5…

[17:19:59] <bvssvni> there are lots of stuff to keep track of…
[17:20:10] <mindtree> bvssvni: yeah I know
[17:24:29] <mindtree> I think what I'd like to see in piston one day is a non-generic window context that just uses one window and graphics back-end and requires only a crate or two with as little imports as possible - like an openFrameworks or Processing style setup, where all of those annoying decisions are made for you and setup is as easy as possible

[17:29:15] <bvssvni> mindtree: it uses gfx for graphics, but you can pick the window back-end which is just one line of code
[17:29:15] <mindtree> bvssvni: yeah I think it's close, but it still requires quite a bit of boilerplate
[17:29:42] <mindtree> the boilerplate is mainly in the imports and extern crates required I guess

[23:37:07] <Layl> kvark, ping
[23:38:45] <kvark> pong
[23:39:02] <kvark> Layl: you just need to speak to someone? :)
[23:39:44] <Layl> wanted to ask since no one else related to it seems to be here, is it alright if I publish gfx_text to crates.io as soon as I get a PR with its dependencies changed to crates.io as well up
[23:42:57] <Layl> I don't even know if it's doable to bring it all to crates.io right now since left and right git dependencies are still used
[23:43:04] *** Quits: dmac_ (dmac@moz-moa.puk.8.50.IP) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[23:43:20] <Layl> seems to work fine though in my little test
[23:44:14] <kvark> Layl: you shouldn't use gfx-rs from crates.io, since we are only going to switch fully in version 0.6
[23:44:30] <Layl> huh why shouldn't I right now
[23:44:33] <Layl> it seems to all work
[23:45:07] <kvark> because the code that is using gfx_text will likely to point to gfx-rs in git
[23:45:15] <Layl> ah, I see
[23:45:27] <Layl> well, what if I just publish gfx_text to crates.io as-is
[23:45:31] <Layl> without the dependencies changed
[23:45:36] <Layl> and just keep the PR up for staging
[23:45:49] <kvark> that's cool. We do that for gfx too (0.5.2 is on crates.io)
[23:46:08] <Layl> just "cargo publish" should do that right
[23:46:20] <Layl> with gfx_text should I look at a specific commit I should be publishing
[23:46:20] <kvark> assuming you temporarily change the dependencies, yes
[23:46:54] <Layl> yea I've got it all set up
[23:47:10] <kvark> ok, good. I've gtg now, good luck!
