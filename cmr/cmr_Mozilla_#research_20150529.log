[06:00:11] <Manishearth> edunham: aturon larsberg Since Rust compilation times (and people not running their own tests) was mentioned, I had an older design for how to make Rust automation resilient to these things
[06:00:16] <Manishearth> https://gist.github.com/Manishearth/f2971973e164be03890a
[06:00:45] <Manishearth> After doing manual rollups for a few months I think that the risk of independently passing PRs breaking each other is lower, though
[06:01:00] <Manishearth> (lower than it used to be)
[06:02:03] <Manishearth> however we still have a high rate of failing PRs. I catch many when I build locally before doing a rollup
[06:02:57] <Manishearth> These days I have a better idea of which PRs might fail (factoring in the code it touches, the type of PR, and the person behind it -- some people always run tests, some don't)
[06:03:27] <Manishearth> but I don't know how to teach that to the build machines (so doing reduced-try builds for individual PRs and then autorollups might be best)
[06:04:19] <edunham> Manishearth: good writeup; we were actually chatting about something like that during one of my interviews
[06:05:06] <edunham> if you roll up several PRs and only a single test fails, you can potentially git bisect on that test and throw out the bad commit a lot faster than testing several subsets of the rollup as well
[06:05:13] <edunham> and then you get something that'll "probably" pass
[06:07:34] <Manishearth> edunham: yep
[06:08:14] <Manishearth> edunham: So for Rust I've been doing "rollups" for a while now -- manually rolling up bunches of PRs 
[06:08:22] <Manishearth> mostly those marked "rollup" in homu
[06:08:26] *** Joins: ddamjano (Instantbird@moz-8j2vkl.ehig.7h68.8388.2a02.IP)
[06:08:34] <Manishearth> but sometimes I take a larger bunch and run a subset of the tests locally
[06:09:07] <Manishearth> usually we have 1-2 failures per 10 PRs (rough guess, I never counted)
[06:09:11] <edunham> are there some tests that seem to fail substantially more often than others? 
[06:09:27] <Manishearth> edunham: well .... we have three types of tests
[06:09:52] <edunham> I'm wondering how helpful it might be to gather metrics on the failures and rearrange the order of the tests so that the ones which fail most often are run first
[06:10:09] <Manishearth> one is unit tests. These are part of the libraries, and need a recompile of the library to run (so it takes a while to get them to run)
[06:10:22] <Manishearth> These break often for library changes because people generally run make check-cfail or whatever
[06:10:55] <Manishearth> The second type is compiletest. These take the full compiler +libs and try to compile various things. we have compile-fail, run-pass, and a few other types of tests here
[06:11:20] <Manishearth> We have thousands of these, so these fail often with both library and compiler changes
[06:11:57] <Manishearth> Finally, we have doctests. The code in the documentation itself is tested. It can break with library changes (and in the past, with compiler changes -- not so much anymore because most docs focus on stable stuff now)
[06:12:39] <Manishearth> edunham: rearranging the order isn't easy
[06:12:47] <Manishearth> okay, it sort of is actually
[06:13:00] <Manishearth> compiletest/cratetest/doctest can be run independently
[06:13:21] <Manishearth> compiletests are fast but are a lot of tests. cratetests are slower. doctests run last I think but are pretty fast
[06:14:25] <Manishearth> A "reduced test target" (check-stage1-rpass+check-stage1-cfail+check-stage1-doc-$crate+check-stage1-$crate) would be nice if we can isolate changes
[06:14:45] <Manishearth> stuff like pretty-rpass and the rest are mostly redundant
[06:14:53] <Manishearth> as is running cratetests for crates you haven't touched
[06:16:23] <Manishearth> edunham: the problem is that with a compiler stuff all ties in together. With Servo one generally can guess which tests will be broken; there aren't any surprises
[06:16:34] <Manishearth> with a compiler+libs you have everything being used everywhere
[06:16:55] <Manishearth> but ... I think this is less of a problem than it was a few months ago
[06:17:02] <Manishearth> (or I might've jsut gotten used to it)
[06:18:59] <edunham> I'd give the push toward beta some credit :)
[06:19:13] <Manishearth> yeah
[06:19:28] <Manishearth> we had regular PRs that broke common  libs before
[06:19:30] <Manishearth> or syntax
[06:19:31] <cmr> I suspect there is little to be gained by switching test order.
[06:19:45] <Manishearth> even worse, PRs which broke less-common libs
[06:20:05] <Manishearth> (so people won't test them, but they would be used in some corner of rpass or doctest, and then it would break the rollup)
[06:20:08] <Manishearth> cmr: agreed
[06:20:36] <Manishearth> cmr: but -- I think there's value in identifying a subset of nonredundant (eg, kill the pretty tests) easily-broken tests for a given change
[06:20:56] <Manishearth> twofold advantage: We can ask PR writers to run this reduced set on smaller PRs
[06:21:30] <Manishearth> if we switch to the auto-tryserver based system I proposed, we could use these reduced tests for individual checking
[06:22:11] <Manishearth> a reduced magic make target of course has the downside of people who already use make check migrating to it 
[06:22:44] <Manishearth> but ... I think very few people run full make check or even check-stage1 these days, except a few core folks
[06:23:02] <cmr> that saddens me somewhat.
[06:23:33] <Manishearth> cmr: full make check-stage1 takes an hour on my laptop when I'm using it iirc
[06:23:41] <Manishearth> with -j5 or something
[06:23:50] <Manishearth> It's faster when I'm not using it 
[06:23:56] <SimonSapin> I think a try server could help, there
[06:24:02] <cmr> SimonSapin: definitely
[06:24:13] *** Joins: Dexter (Alessio@moz-992a9r.retail.telecomitalia.it)
[06:24:18] <Manishearth> SimonSapin: note that we already have a tryserver, I'm proposing that we make it part of the auto-system
[06:24:26] <Manishearth> SimonSapin: @bors:try, fwiw
[06:25:15] <Manishearth> cmr: I'm pretty sure that folks with slower computers and/or work can't afford to run the full tests
[06:26:03] <SimonSapin> we do? nice
[06:26:08] <SimonSapin> Who has access to it?
[06:26:38] <Manishearth> From my experience with rollups, I think full time employees, and  people with the invovlement level of the team members/you run ful ltests. That too not all the time
[06:27:08] <Manishearth> A *lot* of our contribs come from outside of that circle -- people with a higher involvement level generally go for larger, but less frequent PRs
[06:27:51] <Manishearth> and for large changes people run make check anyway
[06:30:20] <cmr> SimonSapin: I don't think I knew about the bors feature, probably everyone with review rights.
[06:30:33] <cmr> Anyone with push access to the repo can push to the try branch to get buildbot to try something as well.
[06:30:49] <SimonSapin> shouldn’t it be a larger group?
[06:31:07] <Manishearth> SimonSapin: everyone with r
[06:31:28] <Manishearth> SimonSapin: I beleive it's possible to run arbitrary code on the builders via that, so no :)
[06:31:34] <SimonSapin> Gecko has "level 1" commit access (try), I don’t remember what is level 2, and level 3 is pushing to the equivalent of master
[06:31:40] <Manishearth> level 2 is special
[06:31:48] <Manishearth> l1/l3 are the important ones
[06:31:55] <Manishearth> l2 only applies to cases when you need a subtree
[06:31:58] <Manishearth> I think
[06:32:02] <Manishearth> like l10n or stuff
[06:32:25] <SimonSapin> yeah, I don’t mean give access to every anonymous bot of the internet
[06:32:30] <Manishearth> haha
[06:32:41] <SimonSapin> just to people we trust not to mine bitcoins on the CI servers
[06:32:56] <SimonSapin> but the bar can be lower than r+ access on the entire project
[06:32:57] <Manishearth> For Gecko L1 you just need someone to vouch for you, send a committers agreement (we don't need that)
[06:33:04] <Manishearth> so pretty low bar
[06:33:10] <cmr> SimonSapin: seems reasonable.
[06:33:13] <Manishearth> vouching gets done after a few easy bugs fixed IME
[06:33:59] * Manishearth proposes mining bitcoins on servo-*.build.servo.org when we're idle to recover the costs
[06:34:28] <Manishearth> .. or just use amazon spot bidding or whatever to reduce costs :p
[06:40:04] <SimonSapin> Manishearth: could you put r=alexcrichton on this while he’s (probably) asleep? https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/25747#issuecomment-106710044
[06:41:04] <SimonSapin> never mind, he’s not :)

[19:09:00] <jdm> iirc rr's reverse execution relies on running forwards from periodic snapshots
[19:09:04] <jdm> what do the snapshots store?
[19:09:38] <jdm> people asked me that at !!con and I could only guess that it was not a full dump of memory
[19:17:51] <cjones> jdm: it’s actually quite simple conceptually: a checkpoint is just a fork()d process tree (plus copies of other resources as necessary).  the checkpoints aren’t persistent
[19:18:03] <jdm> oh, wow
[19:18:09] <cjones> so the checkpoints share memory as much as possible
[19:18:22] <cjones> the algorithm is here: https://github.com/mozilla/rr/blob/6915ac068e6433b6e738e59dde9cde2dca0b36cd/src/Session.cc#L371
[19:18:59] <cjones> (some of the “details” are that there can be multiple processes, we also have to clone threads, we have to set up shared memory mappings correctly, etc.)
[19:19:20] <jdm> right

[19:25:54] <jack> Is there a way to get less to do ansi color sequences?
[19:26:06] <cmr> less -R
[19:26:54] <jack> taht leaves ^Gs everywhere, but -r worked although doesn't show colors.
