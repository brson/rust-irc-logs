[00:21:45] <bjz> cmr: it would be nice in the long term to have it all written in Rust :)
[00:26:11] <cmr> bjz: eventually yeah
[00:26:27] * cmr certainly doesn't know anything about production-quality numerics.
[00:26:31] <aatch> ALL OF THE CODE
[00:26:40] <aatch> EVERYWHERE
[00:26:44] <aatch> IN RUST!
[00:27:09] <nmatsakis> Eridius: perhaps you are on to something by permitting unsized types as last field of struct. I thought it'd make everything more complex but...maybe it makes it simpler. 
[00:27:19] <nmatsakis> kimundi would be happy in any case.
[00:27:54] <aatch> nmatsakis, isnt that similar to a C extension for variable-sized structs?
[00:28:02] <strcat> aatch: (it's standard C)
[00:28:08] <Eridius> nmatsakis: :D
[00:28:24] <strcat> struct Foo { int x; int y[]; } is standard C
[00:28:51] <nmatsakis> aatch: yes.
[00:28:56] <Eridius> nmatsakis: it just seems like your RC1 is using a whole mess of platform-specific (for maximum alignment) unsafe code that seeks to simply reproduce the effect of having a variable-sized field at the end of the struct. So why not let the compiler do it for you?
[00:28:56] <aatch> strcat, ah, thought it was an extension, still, not really my point.
[00:28:58] <strcat> struct Foo { int x; int y[0]; } // accessing anything in the last element is undefined behaviour, and gcc explicitly doesn't try to keep it working
[00:29:08] <strcat> aatch: well there was a pre-C99 hack
[00:29:21] <strcat> that's undefined behaviour and gcc no longer respects it since 4.8 iirc
[00:30:38] <aatch> Eridius, I was thinking that, with respect to DST, the "worse is better" concept applies.
[00:31:06] <nmatsakis> Eridius: in the end you will *still* need to specify alignment is maximal
[00:31:53] <nmatsakis> Eridius: but certainly I agree, it's just the matter of making it all work out -- but I may not have been thinking about things right
[00:33:17] <strcat> bjz: it has to mostly be asm
[00:34:45] <Eridius> nmatsakis: well, presumably the compiler can figure out the appropriate alignment. If that's maximal alignment, that's fine, because the compiler is dealing with it for me
[00:34:55] <Eridius> (and especially, is getting the maximal alignment for the target platform correct)
[00:35:57] <strcat> there's no maximal alignment though?
[00:36:06] <strcat> some things even need to be page aligned
[00:36:24] <nmatsakis> strcat: there is a maximal alignment that is used by malloc
[00:36:44] <strcat> well that guarantees alignment requirements are met for C types without alignas
[00:37:00] <nmatsakis> yes; that's as good as any smart pointer can do
[00:37:08] <bjz> cmr: D has it I think

[00:37:37] <nmatsakis> strcat: at least if it wants to support RC<Trait> style constructions
[00:37:38] <bjz> cmr: but I wouldn't be the one to attempt it
[00:37:51] <strcat> nmatsakis: if we supported alignas we would have to do better, wouldn't we?
[00:37:52] <bjz> cmr: I was pretty happy with frexp
[00:38:02] <bjz> strcat: yup
[00:38:07] <strcat> nmatsakis: I guess they'd be restricted from being cast as traits
[00:38:12] <nmatsakis> strcat: precisely
[00:38:28] <bjz> cmr: owait, I mean fpclassify
[00:38:46] <strcat> yeah but consider sqrt where you want to use asm
[00:38:49] <strcat> lots of platforms have sqrt
[00:39:03] <bjz> strcat: yep
[00:39:10] <strcat> there's a lot of asm you can use even if the platform doesn't have it
[00:39:16] <strcat> and you can provide varying degrees of accuracy
[00:39:20] <strcat> lots of fun ;p
[00:40:52] <strcat> openlibm doesn't have a lot of x86_64 specific implementations
[00:40:52] <bjz> :)

[05:22:44] <sfackler> acrichto: any idea why rustdoc would be failing with "main function not found?"
[05:23:02] <acrichto> compilation or running rustdoc?
[05:23:28] <sfackler> running "rustdoc src/rust-ssl/lib.rs"
[05:23:45] <acrichto> does it not have a crate_type?
[05:23:56] <sfackler> nope, but it worked as of a couple of days ago
[05:24:37] <acrichto> hm I may have removed that by accident
[05:24:44] <ChrisMorgan> I ran into trouble with these things a while ago when I tried removing #[crate_type = "lib"];, put it back when tools weren't behaving consistently.
[05:25:40] <acrichto> sfackler: yep, I broke that
