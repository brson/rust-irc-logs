[04:51:58] <niconii> you know, come to think of it
[04:52:14] <niconii> i never learned what the difference between x++ and ++x is in C
[04:52:39] <taryn> niconii: really?
[04:52:49] <taryn> ++x means increment x, and return x
[04:52:57] <taryn> x++ means return x, then increment
[04:53:01] <taryn> (kinda)
[04:53:07] <taryn> the ELI5 version
[04:54:46] <niconii> ...the fact that you have to be vague about it like that
[04:54:53] <niconii> reminds me why i stopped coding in C
[04:55:25] <niconii> anyway, i always just used `x++;` like a statement, so
[04:56:05] <niconii> never did any weird `y = x++;` or `function(++x);` type tricks or anything
[04:56:06] <taryn> if you're using it like a statement
[04:56:11] <taryn> then you should always ++x;
[04:56:27] <niconii> why?
[04:57:37] <quantheory> x++ makes a copy in some situations, because you return a different value than x actually becomes.
[04:58:01] <quantheory> An optimizing compiler shouldn't care which one you use if it's just a statement, though.
[04:58:24] <huon> taryn: "kinda"?

[09:47:58] <mrmonday> I've also been planning to ditch irssi for a couple of years now, a shiny script like this could be the motivation I need to finally do it :p

[09:53:09] <aji> imo you're better off building and installing your own instance in your ~
[09:53:18] <mrmonday> even once that's done I need to figure out how to port my config across and find replacements for the plugins I set up years ago and forgot about
[09:53:43] <mrmonday> pretty sure /home is mounted without execute permissions here
[09:53:47] <mrmonday> so I can't do that

[09:59:41] <mrmonday> is there a standard for colours on IRC now?
[09:59:56] <mrmonday> my understanding was that mIRC did it, and everyone else followed suit
[10:00:04] <mrmonday> but there was no standard
[10:00:11] <tilpner> No, still not. Only the mIRC pseudo standard, afaik.

[11:34:53] <eddyb> try flatten it
[11:35:10] <aji> i'm going the multi-pass route. convert graphs enough times and maybe an optimized one will pop out the end, lol
[11:35:11] <eddyb> trees suck for certain usecases
[11:35:58] <eddyb> LLVM has functions and globals and inside a function there's blocks with instructions. it's pretty flat, even if graphs form between components
[11:36:08] <eddyb> and that simplifies a lot of bulk processing algorithms
[11:36:20] <aji> well i only hold on to the parse tree for a short short time. i load everything up into hash maps and resolve as many references as possible, and that's what gets optimized and compiled

[11:41:09] <eddyb> the paper itself doesn't delve into much detail, but it does make it pretty clear what steps there are
[11:41:33] <Layl> say you've got marching cubes, you would want telemetry to find out what's going to be the actual amount of vertices and how to estimate it best
[11:41:59] <Layl> to avoid growing a vector
[11:42:12] <aji> that's cool
[11:42:23] <Layl> it's amazing how much performance that saved me

[11:51:08] <barosl> Uh, nope, just a slice
[11:51:10] <eddyb> ah
[11:51:17] <huon> barosl: no, not guaranteed
[11:51:37] <huon> i imagine it won't change, though
[11:51:37] <barosl> That means the internal representation of a slice could be changed in the future?
[11:51:39] <freefall> huon: if people need help dealing with tor-related abuse in the future, i may be able to help, i'm very familiar with both tor and irc administration :)

[11:51:50] <barosl> Hmm, I see
[11:51:53] <huon> barosl: yes, it's possible, but unlikely
[11:52:03] <huon> use std::raw::Slice to get the exact representation
[11:52:03] <Layl> "By the way, most of the critics have never seen C++ code in production."
[11:52:05] <Layl> woah woah
[11:52:05] <barosl> Aye aye sir
[11:52:11] <Layl> I see that ad hominem
[11:52:27] <eddyb> Layl: C++ code in production tends to be even worse
[11:52:34] <Layl> well aware
[11:52:37] <fmtq> anything in production tends to be even worse
[11:52:39] <fmtq> than anything else
[11:52:45] <aji> if you want to talk about production services languages, well, let me tell you about a thing called java which was, in fact, designed for that.
[11:52:45] <fmtq> because it's productive.
[11:52:55] <aji> that's why java is terrible anywhere except in industry
[11:53:02] <Layl> situations where deadlines are present tends to cause the lovecraftian code to brew up
[11:53:04] <aji> anywhere outside of industry rather
[11:53:49] <eddyb> aji: what good does Java do to the industry?
[11:54:32] <Layl> eddyb, well it sets a good example of what not to do
[11:54:34] <eddyb> though I guess that having 128GB of RAM makes it easier to use
[11:54:35] <aji> well the namespacing conventions are useful. it's also comparatively easy to write tools for.
[11:55:07] <Layl> oh yea I'm still afraid that syntax extensions might be the death of any rust IDE
[11:55:46] <aji> if the slower speeds and occasional GC interruption is not a problem,
[11:55:54] <aji> such as with non-realtime IO-bound processes,
[11:56:17] <eddyb> Layl: only marginally so
[11:56:17] <aji> then the only real problem with java is how much code it takes to do anything
[11:56:36] <eddyb> cmr was against non-guaranteed order of execution for syntax extensions
[11:56:40] <FreeFull> Java's type system isn't as good as some of the other JVM languages
[11:56:50] <eddyb> pretty vehemently IIRC
[11:57:13] <aji> i haven't used any other JVM languages :(
[11:57:16] <eddyb> cmr: it's actually better for an IDE if a syntax extension can't assume anything about when it's invoked
[11:57:22] <Layl> the thing is syntax extensions might make resharper-level tools a nightmare to make
[11:57:34] <huon> s/might/will/
[11:57:50] <Layl> of course the answer might be simple, "don't use syntax extensions"
[11:57:52] <huon> it'll be posisble to use syntax extensions to ridiculous things that make refactoring impossible
[11:58:07] <mkpankov`> but they still don't change grammar, do they? 
[11:58:12] <huon> not globally
[11:58:20] <Layl> are attributes syntax extensions?
[11:58:25] <eddyb> Layl: they can be
[11:58:28] <huon> but they can define arbitrary grammars internally, as long as they tokenise and brackets match
[11:58:38] <Layl> well, say for example, the #[derive(Debug)] attribute
[11:58:51] <Layl> suddenly you've got an entire new set of functions that weren't there before
[11:58:58] <eddyb> what's the real concern, though?
[11:59:13] <Layl> that tools might have a hard time finding out what to do with functions it can't find
[11:59:15] <huon> Layl: yeah, macros/implicit code generation are "dangerous"
[11:59:17] <eddyb> oh
[11:59:22] <eddyb> it's not like an IDE would use the pre-expansion AST
[11:59:27] <mkpankov`> so it's possible to have an analogue of errors C++ throws in templates, in Rust with extensions
[11:59:27] <huon> IDEs will have to be best-effort
[11:59:37] <fmtq> fun fact
[11:59:38] <huon> eddyb: users may not want their IDE running arbitrary code
[11:59:44] <mkpankov`> because parens don't match
[11:59:44] <eddyb> for loops and if-let/while-let aren't in the language
[11:59:47] <fmtq> if you code things the way the client wants, you can hardly ever show it in a portfolio
[11:59:49] <fmtq> because you'll never be proud
[11:59:56] <Layl> huon, I guess that's just the sacrifice you've got to give for this kind of stuff
[11:59:58] <huon> mkpankov`: not really
[12:00:02] <huon> Layl: yeah, exactly
[12:00:13] <Layl> but, what about for example, rust-peg
[12:00:14] <huon> Layl: but it sort-of becomes users shooting themselves in the foot
[12:00:20] <Layl> which generates an entire parser using macros
[12:00:29] <eddyb> huon: compiling already can execute arbitrary code, not sure what the point is
[12:00:29] <Layl> you can't run that every single time 5 characters are typed
[12:00:31] <huon> Layl: an IDE could perfectly well have hard-coded understanding of the built-in macros
[12:00:40] <huon> eddyb: may not compiler directly inside the environment of the IDE
[12:00:44] <Layl> huon, it could but what if someone wants to add their own
[12:00:49] <huon> eddyb: may hand off to a sandbox or something
[12:00:53] <Layl> then again, any IDE could have a meta language that handles that
[12:01:04] <huon> Layl: yeah, IDEs would have to best-effort / offer hook-in points
[12:01:13] <Layl> like, "consider whatever this macro returns to be dynamic and could contain whatever"
[12:01:33] <Layl> so, probably, solvable problems
[12:01:38] <huon> I just mean that the built-in ones are the ones that are going to be by far the most common macros, so we can "ignore" them in these considerations
[12:01:39] <eddyb> huon: ah, sure. I run every librustc in a thread and communicate over a channel, that could easily become IPC to a sandboxed process
[12:01:43] <Layl> and "this derive adds this function"
[12:01:43] <huon> it'll just be user-defined ones
[12:01:49] <huon> eddyb: true
[12:02:01] <Layl> you would just have to add a bit of metadata
[12:02:03] <aji> right, vec! try! println! etc these would almost certainly just have built-in IDE support
[12:02:17] <eddyb> aji: that seems silly
[12:02:25] <Layl> I'm gonna make a prediction here, a future rust IDE will allow library writers to add metadata in comments
[12:02:28] <eddyb> they are macro_rules macros
[12:02:36] <eddyb> Layl: we have attributes for this :P
[12:02:42] <huon> aji: it's the syntax-extensions that are the difficult ones (e.g. #[derive])
[12:02:46] <Layl> eddyb, metadata for the IDE to receive
[12:03:02] <Layl> though, I guess that could be in attributes as well
[12:03:30] <Layl> derive is pretty simple to configure in rather than try to parse it in though
[12:03:42] <eddyb> I should implement on-demand type-checking and try to make an android buildd :P
[12:03:52] <aji> why does having built-in support for the standard macros seem silly?
[12:04:01] <eddyb> aji: because they're not "standard macros"
[12:04:06] <aji> it would be easier and faster than trying to support all macros everywhere
[12:04:10] <aji> i'd think, anyway
[12:04:11] <eddyb> format_args! is built into the compiler
[12:04:23] <eddyb> println! is just a macro_rules macro
[12:04:46] <eddyb> so is debug!, info!, etc.
[12:05:04] <Layl> probably with an IDE at this point I'll be happy if it shows errors inline
[12:05:08] <Layl> after running cargo
[12:05:15] <huon> eddyb: really macro_rules vs. syntaxext is just an implementation detail for the ones accessible with just std

[12:05:31] *** Joins: VShell (Shell@moz-hh5bpk.hackr.org.uk)
[12:05:47] <aji> right but i was under the impression that the problem with macros and IDEs was that IDEs would have to expand macros, check things, and un-expand them to implement useful IDE features
[12:05:52] <huon> from a (usual) user's perspective format_args! and println! are the same
[12:05:56] <Layl> can you make libsyntax spit out a pre-expansion AST?
[12:06:03] <eddyb> sure
[12:06:08] <huon> of course the latter provides an IDE with more information, since it's not jsut arbitrary Rust
[12:06:14] <eddyb> you don't run expansion. or spit it before running expansion
[12:06:19] <huon> Layl: what format?
[12:06:28] <eddyb> Layl: > shows errors inline https://github.com/eddyb/r3/blob/atestat-cnitv-2015/assets/atestat.pdf
[12:06:48] <huon> Layl: e.g. the compiler has an option like -Z ast-json-noexpand (and -Z ast-json for expnaded) that'll dump the ast
[12:06:50] <eddyb> the implementation is trivial, too. can add cargo support now that cargo rustc is here
[12:07:21] <Layl> eddyb, I'm using atom, it has a plugin that lints rust using rustc
[12:07:32] <Layl> so it already does that to some extent
[12:07:34] <Layl> just not cargo
[12:07:50] <eddyb> Layl: does it have access to type info :P?
[12:08:09] <Layl> unfortunately the atom-lint project is being really slow with accepting pull requests, causing slowdowns
[12:08:14] <eddyb> (I meant to implement cargo at first, but I only had about a week to finish the demo, so it ended up being half-assed)
[12:08:37] <Layl> eddyb, it just runs rustc over the code and shows the errors inline
[12:08:38] <Layl> that's all it does
[12:08:48] <eddyb> I know that's what it does
[12:09:21] <eddyb> before cargo support, though, I need to figure out multi-file projects
[12:10:44] <eddyb> I have to substitute the contents of the file with the active "buffer" and I'm not sure if libsyntax lets you configure how files are loaded
[12:22:15] <Layl> this article just is one big train ride of nonsequiters, slippery slopes, ad hominems, etc etc
[12:22:17] <Layl> quite a fun read
[12:27:53] <mkpankov> yep, but made me quite angry back when it was first published

[15:54:00] <Yurume> ogham, file and line #s in backtrace are also affected by this problem
[15:54:20] <Yurume> when you are in the macro invocation, you cannot see the very stack frame including that macro

[16:20:33] <GaryOak_> Shit that's bananas
[16:20:45] <Yurume> ogham, if my understanding of that slide is correct, function calls have a lower priority for further optimization than method calls because of optimization heuristic, in this case, for the underlying built-in object implementation. this is pretty implementation dependent and (0,f) forces a faster implementation.
[16:22:05] <ogham> Yurume: Yeah, that looks like what's happening. Different pieces of code match to different patterns in the optimiser

[17:03:55] <Tiffany> what does heartbleed's media spread have to do with how fast it got patched?
[17:04:05] <Tiffany> I mean sure, the big mob over openssl led to it getting some better funding
[17:04:13] <Yurume> let's generate a cute name for every CVE identifier!

[17:04:29] <Tiffany> it's not like everyone griping about openssl actually makes vulnerabilities get fixed faster though
[17:04:34] <Tobba> libressl happened (openssl devs were criminally incompetent, so that's a good thing), and non-tech people took it seriously
[17:04:34] <XMPPwocky> Yurume: ooh, you could do it programmatically like keyart
[17:04:39] <Tiffany> the bug may have been old, but the issue report was not
[17:04:45] <Tobba> which means it *probably* got patched way more than if it hadn't
[17:05:00] <Tiffany> is libressl even production ready yet
[17:05:08] <Tobba> probably moreso than openssl

[17:05:28] <Tiffany> I got so mad I had to go and take a breather
[17:05:46] <Tiffany> I eventually settled on polarssl, which does not make me want to tear my hair out
[17:05:47] <Tobba> of course it won't, but at least it wont do hideously stupid shit with the allocator and implement features that are completely useless and expose vulnerabilities
[17:05:52] <XMPPwocky> yeah, that's why I just use XOR encryption
[17:06:06] <Yurume> nah, ditch tls and use libsodium
[17:06:29] <Tobba> I found someone using a completely reversible integer hash function as a stream cipher
[17:06:32] <Tiffany> polarssl actually has a partial correctness proof
[17:06:38] <Tobba> that's great
[17:06:40] <Tiffany> using one of those beefed up commercial static analysis tools
[17:06:45] <Tobba> oh
[17:06:54] <Tiffany> they market it as a static analysis tool
[17:07:02] <Tiffany> but it's basically a proof engine with static analysis bolted on
[17:07:14] <Tobba> interesting
[17:07:29] <Tobba> since TLS is notorious for being designed in a way that it's incredibly difficult to implement correctly
[17:07:32] <Tiffany> the company that made the proof is selling it as a product
[17:07:37] <Tiffany> it only applies to a specific configuration
[17:07:51] <Tiffany> and it only covers memory safety, not crypto
[17:08:08] <Tiffany> but the likeliness of polarssl having a memory safety CVE in the future is pretty low
[17:08:26] <Tobba> I wonder how the effort of TLS in rust is going
[17:08:28] <Tiffany> which chops off a pretty huge portion of crypto software CVEs
[17:08:35] <Tobba> I know someone was doing X.509 certificates
[17:08:46] <Tobba> I'm pretty sure that guy probably somehow died implementing that but still

[17:30:40] <Astrum|Lap> it was a point of contention with the community culminating with a few people discovering the file formats that BF3 used
[17:30:40] <eddyb> and I don't get paid for this
[17:30:47] <eddyb> Tobba: WHY DID I DO THIS
[17:31:00] <Astrum|Lap> and then just modifying the values
[17:31:02] <Tobba> to learn to invert matrices, of course.
[17:31:07] <eddyb> WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF LIFE
[17:31:17] <Astrum|Lap> at which point DICE put checksums into the game
[17:31:18] <eddyb> Tobba: invert what? the values are hardcoded
[17:31:46] <Tobba> I mean, the easiest way to do that is to calculate the transformation matrix that would produce the skew they've used and invert it
[17:32:26] <eddyb> I plugged in the coordinates of a perfect rectangle into a system and that inverted the matrix for me, I guess
[17:32:54] <Astrum|Lap> anyway, the tool that allowed you to remove the blue filter also allowed you to change the damage your guns did and other stuff like that, BF3's client-server model was one of mutual trust, heh
[17:33:11] <eddyb> I am that guy who still uses substitution and subtracting equations to solve large linear systems instead of doing it with matrices :P

[17:35:05] <eddyb> you just need a very good way of finding a perfect rectangle
[17:35:37] <Tobba> it's tied to the tick number, which means you can create a perfect anti-spread

[17:41:00] <Tiffany> I know it's totally screwed for password hashing
[17:41:59] <Astrum|Lap> hmm... actually, how do servers (attempt to) assure the client is using unmodified assets?
[17:42:14] <Tobba> in valve games? CRC32
[17:42:24] <Astrum|Lap> well just in general
[17:42:36] <Tiffany> it's kind of trivial to find hash collisions with crc32 isn't it
[17:42:40] <Tobba> of course
[17:43:21] <Astrum|Lap> but as a client shouldn't I be able to just tell the server what it wants to hear

[17:55:33] <XMPPwocky> seriously, this is like the infosec version of The Aristocrats
[17:56:17] <Astrum|Lap> XMPPwocky: you should start a security vulnerability firm dedicated to games
[17:56:38] <Astrum|Lap> you might have to hire an army to type up all of the exploits
[17:56:41] <Astrum|Lap> but it'd be funny
[17:57:34] <eddyb> Tobba: "It also occurs when you attempt to access an element of an array which does not exist."
[17:57:51] <eddyb> Tobba: because it divides something by the length of the array which doesn't exist and that length is obviously 0?
[17:58:07] <eddyb> "when the variable you are trying to divide has a value of zero"
[17:58:08] <eddyb> WAIT
[17:58:40] <eddyb> Tobba: y u do dis to maths?!
[17:59:00] <Tobba> this perfectly demonstrates why game companies suck at security
[17:59:52] <eddyb> excuse me
[17:59:57] <eddyb> Tobba: they suck at math
[18:00:47] <eddyb> also, the phrasing is weird, but the example shows it's an out of bounds for the array case, which removes all plausibally sane explanations
[18:00:48] <Astrum|Lap> tbh I can only assume most things in game development aren't done properly because there's no time to do them properly
[18:02:33] <fmtq> no
[18:02:58] <fmtq> there's probably a correlation between people who never grew up and people who make games
[18:02:58] <fmtq> ;) 
[18:03:28] <Tiffany> they don't have experience or a desire to become experienced in fields such as software architecture, security engineering, and so on
[18:03:31] <Astrum|Lap> that doesn't follow, I'll need to see your data
[18:03:39] <Tiffany> it's pretty common in game development
[18:03:59] <Tiffany> like how in enterprise land devs don't have experience or desire to become experienced in UX
[18:04:01] <eddyb> fmtq: how do you implement 0 / x throwing an exception? like, what kind of 9 year old doesn't know that's perfectly reasonable?
[18:04:08] <Tiffany> so you see these products which are just literally widget panels
[18:04:14] <fmtq> eddyb: what
[18:04:18] <Tiffany> with no concern whatsoever put towards the actual use of the software
[18:04:19] <fmtq> I have no idea what the sentence means
[18:04:26] <eddyb> fmtq: https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/Error_Zero_Divisor
[18:04:31] <Astrum|Lap> Tiffany: so linux in general then?
[18:04:32] * Astrum|Lap runs
[18:04:32] <fmtq> why are you doing this to me
[18:04:57] <Tiffany> kernel devs have a similar deficiency when it comes to understanding user space
[18:05:09] <Astrum|Lap> of course, we all tend to specialize
[18:05:25] <fmtq> I have no interest in specialising
[18:05:26] <Tiffany> and also yeah, a lot of problems in linux UI are because people care more about the project than the end result
[18:05:28] <fmtq> because I'm not special 
[18:05:39] <Tiffany> they wouldn't dare break their beautiful architecture to introduce a sane user interface
[18:06:12] <Astrum|Lap> I mean I suffer from the same problems
[18:06:16] <Tiffany> I think this is what people try to mean by "full stack developer"
[18:06:31] <Tiffany> someone who isn't sitting in their own little world programming outside the constraints of reality
[18:06:34] <fmtq> I am shit at every part of the stack, therefore I am full stack
[18:06:48] <fmtq> "SHIP IT" 
[18:06:50] <Tiffany> well yes fmtq
[18:06:55] <Tiffany> buzzwords inevitably lose all meaning
[18:07:08] <fmtq> angularjs os
[18:07:12] <Tobba> I need a stamp that says "SHIP IT"
[18:07:19] <Astrum|Lap> well... I think full stack developer is kind of unrealistic
[18:07:26] <fmtq> is it 
[18:07:26] <Tobba> fmtq: github.com/charliesome/jsos
[18:07:33] <fmtq> I know Tobba.
[18:07:35] <fmtq> I know.
[18:07:38] <GaryOak_> but there's a thousand jobs for full-stack developers
[18:07:54] <fmtq> what does full stack entail 
[18:08:06] <Tiffany> writing inline assembly in javascript
[18:08:06] <GaryOak_> You can eat 12 pancakes for breakfast
[18:08:08] <fmtq> I suspect I may have met the requirements once.
[18:08:16] <Tiffany> on your own CPU you lithographed in your kitchen sink
[18:08:19] <fmtq> hot
[18:08:25] <Astrum|Lap> fmtq: it means you know how to do everything =P
[18:08:28] <fmtq> I suspect their stack is thinner 
[18:08:38] <fkaa> specialising is fun
[18:08:38] <fmtq> Astrum|Lap: and it depends on what everything is
[18:08:43] <fmtq> everything does mean a lot anymore
[18:08:55] <Astrum|Lap> does or doesn't?
[18:08:56] <fmtq> SQL, Java, JavaScript, CSS, XML, Buzzword 6, AngularJS
[18:09:00] <fmtq> doesn't * 
[18:09:02] <fmtq> lel
[18:09:19] <Astrum|Lap> it definitely depends on whatever you'll be working on, I agree
[18:09:23] <Tiffany> yeah, full stack in the world of web and mobile is awfully horizonatl
[18:09:25] <Tiffany> and not very vertical
[18:09:32] <fmtq> make the database "work well enough", and a backend that functions "well enough", with a frontend that "works perfectly without ever failing or we will literally fucking kill you" 
[18:09:33] <Tiffany> so it's not really full stack, but full web suite
[18:09:42] <GaryOak_> More like "Are you familiar with the stack we use, here at this specific company?"
[18:09:47] <fmtq> GaryOak_: yes
[18:09:49] <Astrum|Lap> fmtq: so basically my job
[18:09:52] <fmtq> are you OUR full stack dev.
[18:09:52] <Astrum|Lap> spiff
[18:09:57] <fmtq> yeah
[18:10:06] <fmtq> I am a specialist in Adobe JavaScript backends

[18:10:23] <fmtq> without prefacing it with "so I was about to massacre" 
[18:10:28] <Tiffany> I keep an interest in UX and security
[18:10:42] <fmtq> I am looking at doing a masters degree in human-computer interaction actually Tiffany
[18:10:42] <Tiffany> it's something that people should really pay more attention to
[18:10:50] <fmtq> particularly on how to make encryption more accessible to the derps
[18:10:52] <Astrum|Lap> Tiffany: I know I am bad at UX and security is hard as hell to do well
[18:11:06] <Astrum|Lap> I agree
[18:11:14] <Astrum|Lap> don't get me wrong
[18:11:15] <Tiffany> I have trouble imagining how you could fuck anything up by using libsodium and not leaking your keys everywhere
[18:11:17] <fmtq> I'm people! I'm paying attention! :D
[18:11:26] <Tobba> fmtq: that'd actually be great
[18:11:34] <Astrum|Lap> but I'd rather have someone who is legitimately an expert in these areas rather than relying on myself
[18:11:36] <Tobba> I thought about that for a second and the main problem is password recovery
[18:11:45] <Astrum|Lap> while also doing everything else required of the project
[18:11:47] <Tiffany> fuck password recovery
[18:11:55] <fmtq> how about identity recovery?
[18:11:57] <Tobba> it turns out lusers are really good at losing their passwords
[18:11:59] <fmtq> fuck the password
[18:12:00] <fmtq> just go again

[18:22:02] <Tobba> why do I not have a billion of these
[18:22:23] <fmtq> because you're a responsible adult that knows what happens when you have too many USBs
[18:23:26] <Tiffany> the fuck
[18:23:29] <Tiffany> this is a thing, fmtq?
[18:23:39] <Astrum|Lap> Tobba: because you don't need 8 exabytes of usb drives?

[18:24:18] <Astrum|Lap> though if you do I gladly accept donations =P
[18:24:26] <Tiffany> I'm pretty sure that tape cartridges are more cost effective than usb drives
[18:24:28] <Tobba> hm
[18:24:32] <Tiffany> although they are slightly less compatible and portable
[18:24:37] <Tobba> slow though
[18:24:44] <Tiffany> only for seeking
[18:24:50] <Tiffany> linear read/write rivals SSD
[18:24:57] <Astrum|Lap> really?
[18:25:00] <Tiffany> yeah
[18:25:05] <Astrum|Lap> that's impressive actually
[18:25:18] <Tiffany> they're usually backed up by a cache of a couple harddrives and maybe SSDs
[18:25:26] <Astrum|Lap> hmm
[18:25:37] <Tiffany> but load latencies can still be around a minute or two
[18:25:56] <Tiffany> and that's assuming the cartridge is either already in the drive or you have a robot arm to quickly load it
[18:26:07] <Tiffany> instead of a human that has to bumble around in a pile of poorly organized unmarked tape cartridges
[18:26:43] <Astrum|Lap> humans are so useless
[18:26:53] <Astrum|Lap> also, how have we not drown in our own data yet?
[18:27:03] <Tiffany> tape cartridges
[18:27:16] <Tobba> at some point something will go wrong in a landfill full of disused tapes
[18:27:22] <Tobba> and someone will literally drown in data
[18:27:30] <Tiffany> CERN fills an SL8500 tape library about once a year
[18:27:33] <Tiffany> iirc
[18:27:47] <Tiffany> a hundred thousand tape cartridges, 8 terabytes each
[18:28:28] <Astrum|Lap> I mean we have the computing power the crunch all of this data we record, but it still boggles the mind just how much data we record
[18:28:52] <Tiffany> it's also basically impossible to measure
[18:29:05] <Tiffany> the numbers for just the public internet vary by two orders of magnitude
[18:29:10] <Tiffany> the private internet is way more
[18:29:19] <Tiffany> the LHC, for example, does not have its data available on the public internet
[18:29:27] <Tiffany> it's only available on internetworks such as internet2
[18:32:18] <Astrum|Lap> here's one to ponder, how much of our recorded data is utterly useless? heh
[18:35:51] <Tiffany> that depends on how you define useless

[19:12:00] <Tiffany> they don't really work beyond demonstrating that you are indeed capable of programming
[19:12:01] <GaryOak_> Once they became all about dat cash
[19:12:09] <Tiffany> which filters out the people who blanket apply to any job opening they can find
[19:12:38] <Astrum|Lap> meh
[19:12:39] <Tiffany> like, at a certan point, interview questions stop demonstrating skill, and start demonstrating domain knowledge, usually totally unrelated to the position at hand
[19:13:06] <Tiffany> there are literally books which show answers to common interviewing questions
[19:13:18] <Tiffany> answering interview questions is a skill totally unrelated to software development
[19:13:19] <Astrum|Lap> I've found that the majority of solutions to questions asked by places like google is a hash map =P
[19:13:47] <Tiffany> "create a tool which allows users to look up other users by their phone number" hash map
[19:13:49] <Tiffany> like that?
[19:14:01] <Astrum|Lap> mmm.. not quite so obvious
[19:14:06] <Astrum|Lap> it's usually the most 'optimal' solution
[19:14:08] <aji> Go to me is like "C, but we scratched some itches"
[19:14:11] <aji> "and added decent tooling"
[19:14:20] <Tiffany> I suppose the majority of google's tools are built around processing stupidly large databases
[19:14:33] <Tiffany> which are sort of like giant hash tables
[19:14:42] <Tiffany> except based on indexes instead of hashes
[19:14:43] <Astrum|Lap> I'm sure I still have a lot of the questions that amazon asked me
[19:15:13] <Tiffany> go's tooling seems pretty awful though aji
[19:15:26] <Tiffany> they use that crazy NIH assembler which is apparently from plan 9
[19:15:44] <Astrum|Lap> though one question during that interview still irks me
[19:15:48] <Astrum|Lap> or... task I should say
[19:15:50] <aji> what i mean is a unified control program, inline testing, and some kind of package management
[19:15:52] <aji> all stuff C lacks
[19:15:57] <Astrum|Lap> 'design a chess game'
[19:15:59] <aji> (dear god autotools, dear _god_)
[19:16:22] <Astrum|Lap> and every time I asked for some sort of concrete requirements they just answered with, 'whatever you feel is best'

[19:16:28] <aji> Astrum|Lap: "like reversi, but you use pawns on a chess board!"
[19:16:33] <fmtq> I did an interview with thoughtworks once.
[19:16:44] <GaryOak_> Astrum|Lap: yeah that's the worst
[19:16:50] <fmtq> that was an experience I have mostly forgotten
[19:16:53] <fmtq> lel
[19:16:57] <aji> the question i got in my second amazon interview was neat
[19:17:10] <GaryOak_> "Are you Agile enough?" - all I know about Thoughtworks
[19:17:11] <fmtq> I had mono about 4 years ago and for about 2 years, I had spontaneous bouts of massive fatigue
[19:17:16] <fmtq> like just suddenly you can't fucking move or think
[19:17:31] <aji> it was to determine if there were two list members that added to a given number in O(n) time or something i think
[19:17:32] <fmtq> what I recall is: "we peer program!"
[19:17:36] <fmtq> this scares the fuck out of me now 
[19:17:40] <aji> amortized O(n)
[19:17:51] <fmtq> I basically had an arrogant American guy talking down for me for 30 minutes until I just stopped coding at all.
[19:17:55] <fmtq> that was the interview.
[19:18:09] <fmtq> I looked like a complete fuckwit because I ended up second guessing everything I was doing because he was a psycho
[19:18:19] <fmtq> but I did learn the company _was not for me_
[19:18:33] <Astrum|Lap> aji: I think my second (maybe third) interview question was grabbing the first thousand points nearest some coordinates in 3D space given a few million points
[19:18:37] <Astrum|Lap> or something like that

[19:22:45] <Astrum|Lap> I'm far more interested in exploring and learning than... producing anything
[19:23:00] <fmtq> what's a sane strategy for buffering a chunk of a map that builts of tiles
[19:23:10] <fmtq> builts
[19:23:10] <fmtq> lel
[19:23:12] <fmtq> is built* 
[19:23:32] <Astrum|Lap> how large is this map?
[19:23:44] <GaryOak_> HashMap
[19:23:52] <Astrum|Lap> ^
[19:24:01] <Tiffany> Z-curve encode the map and load in the contiguous section that maps to the current area?
[19:24:06] <Astrum|Lap> that's always the right answer!
[19:24:21] <fmtq> infinitely large let's assume
[19:24:43] <Astrum|Lap> oh, well then that rules out my 'just store it all in memory, how big could it be?' approach...
[19:25:04] <fmtq> heh
[19:25:11] <fmtq> nah the map is a Tiled map 
[19:25:17] <fmtq> so it's just a bunch of ints in an array 
[19:25:30] <fmtq> those ints map to a tile in a spritemap
[19:25:37] <fmtq> so gotta draw the map manually
[19:25:42] <fmtq> then pan it somehow, sanely.
[19:25:51] <GaryOak_> are you still using Lua?
[19:25:53] <fmtq> haha I am
[19:26:02] <fmtq> I did not yet run away
[19:26:06] <fmtq> I accepted my fate
[19:26:35] <Astrum|Lap> also depends on how you scroll/pan the map
[19:26:47] <Astrum|Lap> is it continuous or screen sized scrolling
[19:27:36] <Astrum|Lap> actually I suppose it doesn't matter too much...
[19:27:47] <fmtq> continouus
[19:27:57] <fmtq> it's meant to be a boat in the centre zooming around the map
[19:28:01] <Tiffany> the only downside of Z-curve ordering is that the map has to be square
[19:28:03] <fmtq> so it's always centre focused 
[19:28:04] <Tiffany> it can't be rectangular
[19:28:11] <Tiffany> so you'll have to fill empty sections with null tiles or something
[19:28:15] <fmtq> it's a rectangle 
[19:28:38] <Tiffany> well, at least if you want to store it contiguously
[19:28:46] <Tiffany> you could also store it in a radix trie
[19:28:51] <Astrum|Lap> I mean old games would just load the current screen plus 1 or 2 more screens worth of data on all sides
[19:29:00] <Astrum|Lap> as you move load/unload what is needed
[19:29:04] <fmtq> that's what I'm thinking to do 
[19:29:12] <fmtq> but wouldn't that lead to tearing
[19:29:44] <Astrum|Lap> I mean computers are so powerful and tile based games are so simple by comparisson I don't think you really need to find the most optimal solution
[19:29:57] <fmtq> but 
[19:29:59] <fmtq> I will know

[19:31:29] <niconii> i don't remember the song going like that...
[19:31:44] <Tiffany> all of the games I know of written in lua just keep the entire map in memory
[19:31:52] <Tiffany> and some of them keep the entire game in memory, every level
[19:32:02] <Astrum|Lap> Tiffany: only works if it's not an infinite map, heh
[19:32:11] <Astrum|Lap> but yeah, if it's not infinite, chances are you can store it all in memory
[19:32:19] <Tiffany> if it's an infinite map it's going to be procedurally generated

[19:32:27] <Astrum|Lap> true
[19:32:34] <XMPPwocky> this seemingly normal data format has support for loading arbitrary files from the FS in
[19:32:35] <Tiffany> in which case you generate as needed and cache if it's expensive

[19:33:26] <GaryOak_> I could mean blit, if I knew what blit meant
[19:33:37] <Tiffany> blitting is basically a 2D memcpy

[19:33:46] <Tiffany> but rarely rotation or scaling
[19:33:51] <fmtq> blitting is mad
[19:33:55] <fmtq> and for some reason I know how to blit
[19:33:57] <fmtq> but not how to do normal shit
[19:33:58] <Astrum|Lap> yeah, what Tiffany said
[19:34:17] <fmtq> so do I not buffer this at all and instead just draw raw pixels to the viewport repeatedly
[19:34:19] <fmtq> is this a fine idea
[19:34:51] <Astrum|Lap> I assume somewhere under the hood you're using opengl

[19:44:03] <fmtq> that I draw the viewport plus some bleed to a buffer

[22:39:53] <niconii> FF("/Some/Path/M*;*Z*");
[22:40:33] <niconii> if you want to filter out ones that end in A, it ends up being

[22:41:13] <niconii> "There is no way to include multiple base directories."
[22:41:18] <niconii> well then
[22:41:45] <niconii> it's either full-on recursion or just an individual directory i guess

[23:23:41] <bstrie> if you mean "why did I do it", it's because I'm a weirdo who likes any excuse to troll people with the subreddit css
[23:24:14] <fmtq> good choice
[23:24:17] <Tiffany> I meant what in particular about majora's mask, and I didn't realise 1.0 is about to come out
[23:24:20] <bstrie> especially if it starts to approach a level of invasiveness such that it renders the subreddit nigh-unusable
[23:24:34] <Tiffany> pfffft
[23:24:38] <Tiffany> smallcaps wasn't nigh-unusable
[23:24:40] <bstrie> Tiffany: nothing in particular, it was just the first thing that came to mind
[23:24:50] <niconii> anyway, after the subreddit is obliterated, we can finally give /r/rust to its rightful owners, that game that angry 12-year-olds occasionally scream about on /r/rust instead of /r/playrust
[23:25:13] <bstrie> I have had people from that subreddit angrily contact me demanding that I hand them the sub
[23:25:15] <fmtq> where is the sauce bstrie
[23:25:23] <niconii> bstrie: wow
[23:25:30] <bstrie> fmtq: right click -> view sauce
[23:25:38] <Tiffany> I don't think those people would have been any good at moderating a subreddit
[23:25:44] <fmtq> bstrie: but how do I see the CSS
[23:26:30] <bstrie> fmtq: you can open your browser tools and inspect a page with ctrl+shift+c
[23:26:48] <fmtq> bstrie: I am not new here, but I am new to sleuthing where the damn CSS is
[23:26:48] <bstrie> from there click on elements in the html view and it will display their associated styles on the right
[23:26:50] <fmtq> lol
[23:27:00] <fmtq> but the moon is in the background
[23:27:06] <fmtq> is it attached to a div of some kind
[23:27:14] <bstrie> nah it's just the background of the body tag itself
[23:27:17] <bstrie> no divs
[23:27:33] <fmtq> does it get larger over time
[23:27:45] <bstrie> when I command it to, yes
[23:27:49] <fmtq> haha
[23:27:52] <fmtq> you are MANUALLY fucking with people
[23:27:59] * fmtq provides bstrie 50 points
[23:28:05] <bstrie> I am the skull kid
[23:28:16] <bstrie> fuck you, four giants
[23:28:18] <fmtq> it doesn't affect the usability at all
[23:32:07] <swgillespie> It's too bad people took out the terrible fate fatal exception message
[23:33:01] <Tobba> I don't get what the complaint about that was about anyways
[23:33:15] <Tobba> its a 2kb message in a fuckhuge library that's never linked in in any applications where space matters
[23:33:30] <fmtq> shut up Tobba
[23:33:34] <swgillespie> :P
[23:33:35] <fmtq> 2kb matters 
[23:33:49] <fmtq> I still carry around a floppy diskman
[23:34:03] <GaryOak_> that's one floppy disk man
[23:34:17] <Tobba> the floppy disk man

[23:39:32] <Tiffany> really tobba?
[23:39:37] <Tiffany> I thought it was in libcore or something
[23:39:44] <Tiffany> which isn't that big, is it?
[23:39:48] <swgillespie> It was in the runtime
[23:40:05] <Tiffany> there were lots of people complaining that it was unprofessional
[23:40:15] <Tiffany> someone brought up copyright
[23:40:28] <Tiffany> the zelda thing is copyrighted, but I think lovecraft might be public domain by now?
[23:40:41] <Tobba> you can't really copyright a quote
[23:40:53] <Tiffany> yeah but legal departments will still have none of it
[23:41:19] *** Quits: GaryOak_ (GaryOak_@moz-etoj16.hfc.comcastbusiness.net) (Connection closed)
[23:43:21] <Tiffany> it looks like all of the lovecraft works before 1923 are public domain and it's a complicated question whether the rest are still in copyright
[23:44:47] <Tobba> yeah you might run into trouble with those
[23:47:25] <fmtq> Tobba: you can copyright a quote.
[23:47:32] <fmtq> especially in Sweden 
[23:47:41] <Tobba> fun
[23:47:42] <fmtq> Sweden has some of the most restrictively retarded copyright laws int he world lel
[23:48:01] <fmtq> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_Under_%28song%29#Copyright_lawsuit
[23:48:23] <fmtq> Australia doesn't have fair use.
[23:48:30] <fmtq> and no fair dealing exception for quotation.
[23:48:40] <fmtq> Sweden has no fair use nor fair dealing execptions iirc 
[23:49:07] <fmtq> the worst part about this court case was if this case were in the US, it would have been found to be fair use.

[23:50:19] <Tobba> that's actually incredible
[23:50:41] <Tobba> Australia fucked up harder than the US courts would have
[23:51:25] <fmtq> our law is like this because of shit like TTIP 
[23:51:33] <fmtq> we signed the precursor to that in the 2000s, AUSFTA 
[23:51:41] <fmtq> made chipping a PS1 illegal lel
[23:51:50] <fmtq> legal protection to DRM and TPMs.
[23:51:51] <fmtq> all that good shit.
