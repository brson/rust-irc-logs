[01:32:38] <Seldaek> cmr: yup?
[01:33:14] <cmr> Seldaek: What's the most important feature for you that I should prioritize? I'm working on filling out the remaining items in reverse order of importance
[01:33:36] <Seldaek> reverse? :)
[01:34:01] <cmr> yeah, importance is directly correlated with difficulty :(
[01:34:06] <Seldaek> hehe
[01:35:17] <Seldaek> well if you could finalize closures that'd be cool so I can spend some time building the output
[01:35:29] <cmr> ok, I'll do that when I'm finished with typedefs
[01:35:33] <Seldaek> fixing the external ids issues obviously would be good 
[01:35:47] <Seldaek> that'd remove all the artifacts
[01:35:49] <cmr> Ah yes I forgot about that
[01:35:51] <Seldaek> then it's only missing data
[01:36:11] <Seldaek> the impls obviously would be awesome (and that's probably gonna be a bunch of work on my end too)
[01:36:23] <Seldaek> but I realize this is probably non trivial :)
[01:36:33] <cmr> yeah, impls are the hardest
[01:39:02] <cmr> opened https://github.com/cmr/rustdoc_ng/issues/23
[01:39:43] <Seldaek> sounds good
[01:40:04] <Seldaek> is the GH issues labels nomenclature of rust described anywhere?
[01:40:21] <Seldaek> I never quite got the logic behind all the X- prefixes
[01:42:27] <cmr> A- is for area
[01:42:32] <cmr> I- is for importance, for rust
[01:42:36] <cmr> I have no idea what the rest are :D
[01:47:00] <Seldaek> alright, we do it because we do it then ;)
[02:05:59] <cmr> Seldaek: So closures are pretty much insane
[02:06:06] <cmr> fn foo(x: &unsafe once fn:Send+Freeze()) {} 
[02:06:08] <cmr> This is valid.
[02:06:41] <Seldaek> I seriously have no idea how to parse this :p
[02:06:50] <Seldaek> what's the + doing there?
[02:06:56] <Seldaek> and once?
[02:07:05] <Seldaek> one-time-closure?
[02:07:25] <Seldaek> or is it unsafe once but then safe because it's frozen? :p
[02:07:29] <cmr> yeah, once you means it can call it once
[02:07:36] <cmr> unsafe... no idea what it does or even how to make a unsafe closure
[02:07:45] <cmr> the Send+Freeze is like trait bounds
[02:08:32] <Seldaek> not sure what that is but cool. good luck :/
[02:08:43] <cmr> me neither tbh
[02:08:46] <cmr> closures confund me
[02:09:30] <Seldaek> I mean there is always the option of doing.. {"type": "closure", "def": "&unsafe once fn:Send+Freeze", "args": []}
[02:09:33] <Seldaek> or something
[02:09:44] <Seldaek> if that's more helpful for you
[02:09:51] <Seldaek> we could live with it for now I guess
[02:09:58] <Seldaek> but I suppose the AST is already a wreck
[02:58:30] <cmr> Seldaek: you around?
[03:03:10] <cmr> Well, I didn't break anything it seems...
[03:03:53] <cmr> http://octayn.net/benches/std.json.gz
[03:12:09] <cmr> Hm, did jedestep add traits?
[03:12:20] <cmr> They seem to be in everything but the json
[03:12:32] <cmr> ... *I* added traits
[03:12:35] * cmr does not remember doing this
[03:13:00] <dbaupp> cmr: sleep-coding?
[03:13:11] <cmr> dbaupp: 2013-07-04 20:22:17 according to git
[03:13:35] <dbaupp> months ago!
[03:13:45] <cmr> Oh, no, jedestep *did* add most of it
[03:14:05] <cmr> I probably had just added the stub Trait struct
[03:15:31] <cmr> He did all the hard work!
[03:15:35] <cmr> <3
[03:15:52] * cmr loves it when other people do stuff he doesn't like doing
[03:16:19] <cmr> Also, one month ago, your date order is wrong :p
[03:16:19] <dbaupp> it's the best way of getting stuff done
[03:16:39] * dbaupp knew that it was 1 month
[03:17:02] <dbaupp> cmr: what sort of a person does yyyy-dd-mm. that's even crazier than mm-dd-yyyy. :P
[03:18:00] <cmr> I never know what order things go in
[03:18:07] <cmr> I barely know the order of the months or the alphabet
[03:19:51] <dbaupp> haha, doesn't everyone?
[04:02:39] <dbaupp> cmr: does rustdoc_ng indicate if a method is default or not?
[04:02:44] <cmr> dbaupp: yes
[04:02:53] <cmr> or, will, once I'm done with this
[04:03:01] * cmr almost done typedefs
[04:05:27] <dbaupp> ok, cool.
[04:15:41] <cmr> Seldaek: A new Type was added, "barefn"
[04:15:45] <cmr> It seems to only appear in typedefs
[04:15:51] <cmr> And I have no idea what language concept it maps to
[04:15:56] <cmr> But, it's there, and it's complete
[04:15:58] <cmr> so
[04:16:00] * cmr shrugs
[04:19:50] <cmr> Seldaek: Typedefs are now in the json, and I've bumped the schema revision
[04:20:03] <cmr> mostly because of barefn

[10:04:04] <robert> Hi
[10:04:14] <Seldaek> hey
[10:05:31] <robert> I have just heard that you are gonna make a new website, I would like to know if there is a way to contribute
[10:08:31] <Seldaek> robert: one way to help if you have decent rust skills is to look at https://github.com/cmr/rustdoc_ng/issues 
[10:08:54] <Seldaek> but as I understand it some of it is pretty tough AST "crystal ball reading" :)
[10:09:16] <Seldaek> otherwise I'm working on the web part which you can see the current state of at http://seld.be/rustdoc/std/
[10:10:09] <robert> I see, do you use any library or framework?
[10:10:23] <Seldaek> if you'd like to help there, we could use better search tokenization IMO if that's something you'd like to do, other than that it's not so much work left I think
[10:10:33] <Seldaek> well just implementing new types as they come from rustdoc_ng
[10:10:47] <robert> Which language do you use?
[10:10:59] <Seldaek> robert: it's just a nodejs script that dumps static html + some js for search https://github.com/Seldaek/rustdoc_web
[10:10:59] <robert> To create the web.
[10:11:36] <robert> I will take a look.
[10:11:59] <Seldaek> it could use some splitting up of the code too right now it's slowly grown into a big mess :)
[10:14:14] <robert> Are you the only developer?
[10:14:46] <Seldaek> pretty much :)
[10:15:02] <Seldaek> on the web at least
[10:15:29] <Seldaek> cmr and jedestep have done most the rustdoc_ng bit
[10:16:20] <robert> Anyway you are doing pretty cool stuff.
[10:16:25] <Seldaek> but it's not so much work really it's just looping through and rendering the json that rustdoc_ng outputs
[10:17:05] <Seldaek> well thanks, if you got any feedback feel free
[10:17:50] <robert> I will, I hope you have news about me.

[12:00:49] <Seldaek> cmr: typedefs have no source is that by design?
[14:08:17] <cmr> Seldaek: no
[14:08:39] <cmr> No, it will neer beableto parse 0.7, correct
[14:09:15] <cmr> Typedefs are also uninentional
[14:18:24] <Seldaek> ok
[14:18:53] <Seldaek> cmr: I created an issue then
[14:18:59] <cmr> thanks :)
[14:19:02] <Seldaek> I'm struggling with displaying them still.. 
[14:19:17] <Seldaek> well I have it working but not in full detail
[14:19:33] <cmr> what is the problem?
[14:23:49] <Seldaek> I get stuff like "type RevIterator<'self, T> = std::iterator::Invert;" instead of  "type RevIterator<'self, T> = Invert<VecIterator<'self, T>>;"
[14:24:05] <cmr> Oh hm
[14:24:07] <Seldaek> reason is that I show the right side as a resolved type link 
[14:24:16] <cmr> Is it all there in the JSON?
[14:24:31] <Seldaek> well the resolved type yes
[14:24:56] <Seldaek>  from that I guess I could derive Invert<T> at bes
[14:24:59] <Seldaek> best
[14:25:15] <Seldaek> by looking at the definition of std::iterator::Invert
[14:25:23] <Seldaek> but I don't think I can know that it's a VecIterator 
[14:25:35] <Seldaek> so I guess I leave it as is for now
[14:25:50] <Seldaek> not ideal though
[14:28:25] <cmr> it's possible I am forgetting some information.
[14:28:33] <cmr> forgetting meaning not extracting from the AST
[14:29:21] <Seldaek> ok
[14:40:44] <cmr> Ah here it is
[14:40:54] <cmr> On ty_path I'm ignoring typarams and lifetimes
[14:40:56] <cmr> that'd do it :p
[14:42:37] <Seldaek> sounds like
[14:56:43] <Seldaek> ok now http://seld.be/rustdoc/master/std/index.html includes the version in the url and if I had more than one crate it should build both at once for each version, one search and shared links etc (though not cross-linking yet since ext ids are broken anyway)
[14:57:04] <Seldaek> cmr: did you say closures were good to go or did I dream that?
[14:57:11] <cmr> Seldaek: they are good to go
[14:57:24] <Seldaek> ok I'll take a quick look at that then
[14:57:34] <cmr> I almost have statics ready but I'm getting some really obnoxious errors from rustc
[14:57:36] <Seldaek> "quick" :)
[14:57:46] <Seldaek> statics?
[14:58:40] <cmr> https://github.com/mozilla/rust/blob/master/src/libstd/libc.rs#L1280
[14:59:21] <Seldaek> ah right those compile time consts thing
[14:59:48] <Seldaek> dude I'm running out of colors fast :p
[14:59:52] <cmr> heheh
[15:00:06] <cmr> All that is left after it is traits
[15:00:06] <Seldaek> already typedefs are black 
[15:00:35] <Seldaek> traits already have a color though ;)
[15:01:20] <Seldaek> but I think those statics and typedefs can remain black and just be listed on the module page but not in the sidebar, wdyt?
[15:01:49] <Seldaek> they don't strike me as very important beyond just listing that they exist
[15:01:59] <cmr> statics are important, typedefs aren't
[15:02:13] <Seldaek> yes but they don't deserve a standalone page right?
[15:02:13] <cmr> typedefs are almost second class citizens
[15:02:34] <Seldaek> they can just be listed in the mod or struct or wherever they can appear as pub entities
[15:02:44] <cmr> sure
[15:02:54] <Seldaek> with name, value, and short desc if available

[19:26:28] <Seldaek> cmr: so closures http://seld.be/rustdoc/master/std/cleanup/fn.each_live_alloc.html
[19:26:48] <Seldaek> and that function signature makes me think I should probably format them as one arg on each line if they get longer than X
[19:26:56] <Seldaek> because it's pretty messy
[19:27:12] <Seldaek> and that's only two args
[19:36:03] <Seldaek> ok reformatting now, e.g. http://seld.be/rustdoc/master/std/u64/generated/fn.range_step_core.html
[19:45:33] <n0v> Is rustdoc_ng dropping markdown output entirely? I use rustdoc's markdown output a good bit for my own documentation. 
[21:06:19] <Seldaek> no no markdown will come
