[08:29:01] <niconii> ...so, for some reason the question "what if there was a memory-safe forth?" popped into my head
[08:29:48] <niconii> and the thing is... "memory-safe" and "forth" are so ridiculously far removed from each other i'm not even sure what that would look like
[08:31:21] <niconii> for reference, forth doesn't have a type system
[08:31:48] <niconii> and i don't mean "it doesn't have a *static* type system, but the interpreter still keeps track of things behind the scenes"

[08:32:36] <niconii> i mean it has exactly *one* type, an integer (implementation-defined size)
[08:33:11] <niconii> and *you're* the one who has to keep track of what it is, whether that's a pointer, bytes packed into an integer, or what have you
[08:35:06] <niconii> i think by the time you made it memory-safe, it'd stop being forth...
[08:37:55] <niconii> hmm, i dunno though... maaaybe borrow-checking would work out? even forth knew goto was a bad idea, so there are technically scopes
[08:38:28] <niconii> ...though you can also manually fiddle with the return stack, so... might have to take that part out
[08:38:52] <niconii> might have to add a third stack or something...

[08:40:08] <blueridanus> I can't even fathom what memory safety means in this context
[08:40:28] <niconii> yeah i'm not really sure either
[08:47:14] <niconii> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_safety
[08:47:21] <niconii> i'm just sorta going down the list here and
[08:47:35] <fkaa> Tiffany: have you seen https://cowlark.com/cgi-bin/fossil.cgi/luje/doc/stable/doc/index.wiki ?
[08:47:48] <niconii> forth passes a lot of this not because of what it does have, but... what it doesn't have
[08:48:02] <niconii> "Buffer overflow"? well... first you need to invent the concept of a buffer......
[08:48:47] <niconii> "Dynamic memory errors"? well, you don't really have dynamic memory in forth, you just have... whatever ram there is... and you stick stuff in it
[08:50:14] <niconii> i guess "Dangling pointer" is kind of a concern... more likely it'll be "whoops i thought this random integer was a pointer"
[08:50:38] <niconii> "Double frees" and "Invalid free"... again, we don't have malloc *or* free...
[08:51:51] <niconii> "Null pointer accesses" are an issue if you're in an operating system, depending on how the forth is implemented, so maybe... a lot of forths run bare-metal though, so it still kinda depends
[08:52:06] <blueridanus> Forth sounds very hardcore.
[08:52:33] *** Quits: listochk_ (listochkin@moz-u28j0j.interview.volia.net) (Quit: My Mac has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[08:52:42] <blueridanus> I could as well be using magnetized needles or butterflies to program.
[08:52:52] <niconii> yeahhhh, the basic philosophy is "build the simplest possible program to do what you want"
[08:53:02] <niconii> so sometimes that turns into "well, do you really *need* arrays"
[08:54:15] <niconii> forth is still pretty neat for a low-level language, though; it's interactive (you can type in stuff and it gets evaluated)
[08:54:32] <niconii> you can basically just hijack the parser if you want
[08:54:55] <niconii> you have total control over the language
[08:55:10] <niconii> ...but you still gotta build a lot of stuff yourself
[08:55:53] <blueridanus> So, basically... it's for microcontrollers?
[08:55:57] <Elaine> no
[08:56:30] <Elaine> forth is many things, and modern forth can be quite large and sophisticated (although Moore might disavow such things from being "forth")
[08:56:39] <niconii> it certainly finds some use there, but you can build up to pretty high-level stuff
[08:56:57] <fkaa> game scripting :)?
[08:57:31] <niconii> yep, one of the benefits of forth is that because it's so simple, you can stick it just about anywhere
[08:58:29] <niconii> anyway, as Elaine says, there are dialects of forth that are more sophisticated, some do have type systems and things
[08:58:43] <Elaine> Factor is the most modern of the concatenative languages I think
[08:59:11] <niconii> yeah, that kinda gets on the edge of what i'd call forth though, but it's kinda hard to classify
[08:59:23] <Elaine> (most concatenative languages are stack-based)
[08:59:32] <Elaine> (<3 stack languages)
[08:59:50] <niconii> personally i like to get my hands dirty, so i tend to like the simpler, more low-level ones
[08:59:53] <Elaine> I'm always torn between whether I think J or Factor is cooler.
[09:00:16] <Elaine> (J is the modern successor to APL)
[09:00:57] <blueridanus> Do you know of any large projects using Forth?
[09:01:02] <Elaine> niconii: yeah, I generally use a forth for hardware bringup when I'm too lazy to write a compiler
[09:01:10] <fkaa> i feel like i should learn some assembly
[09:01:14] <Elaine> fkaa: yes you should
[09:01:25] <Elaine> blueridanus: there are many large, production uses of forth.
[09:01:30] <Elaine> iirc wikipedia has a list
[09:01:38] <Elaine> if not, forth.org 
[09:01:50] <fkaa> but there's a myriad of exotic architectures
[09:02:19] <blueridanus> I didn't find it in Wikipedia. Will take a look at forth.org
[09:02:29] <niconii> it's been used quite a number of times in space... dunno quite how recently though
[09:03:48] <blueridanus> I'm not too familiar with low level programming.
[09:03:56] <blueridanus> Rust attracted me for its functional style
[09:08:19] <Elaine> got the sound chip at 100%, https://goo.gl/photos/M5wPvLQ3WvQo4CgCA
[09:08:36] <Elaine> still don't know why the microscope controller had a sound chip, but w/e

[09:13:25] <niconii> nice
[09:14:28] <Elaine> It also, inexplicably, had about 30 buffers, 20 4-bit adders, and 512K of RAM scattered across 256-bit bit-addressed chips, in an array.
[09:15:09] <Elaine> like $700 worth of old chips that we ripped off it, and that's only the socketed ones...
[09:15:24] <fkaa> is there different assembly instructions for each OS as well? i thought it was dependant on architecture?
[09:15:34] <niconii> Elaine: bizarre
[09:15:51] <Elaine> fkaa: no, there are not.
[09:16:10] <blueridanus> They are dependent on architecture.
[09:16:16] <niconii> fkaa: it's architecture, as you say
[09:16:17] <Elaine> fkaa: assembly is a textual encoding (with sometimes some syntax sugar) over machine code, which is per-architecture, not per-OS.
[09:16:34] <niconii> however, interfacing with the OS itself will be different from OS to OS
[09:16:45] <niconii> different syscalls and things like that
[09:16:48] <Elaine> But different assembly languages on different assemblers on different OS's can look completely different.
[09:17:29] <niconii> yeah, i guess that's an important distinction to point out
[09:17:52] <niconii> machine code is all the actual bytes the processor executes
[09:18:05] <niconii> assembly is a human-readable representation of those bytes
[09:18:34] <blueridanus> And the instructions the processor knows depends on architecture.
[09:18:34] <niconii> which can have different styles, since it's just a representation
[09:18:48] <fkaa> gotcha
[09:18:49] <niconii> blueridanus: right
[09:19:17] <blueridanus> It's called an "instruction set". Two notebooks, for example, probably use the same one, but your phone does not use the same as your PC.
[09:19:31] <niconii> fkaa: basically assembly exists because writing actual raw machine code sucks
[09:19:32] <blueridanus> Which I personally find unfortunate.
[09:21:15] <blueridanus> (and by "notebook"/"phone", I mean "their CPU", considering GPUs are much more arcane in this sense)
[09:21:28] <blueridanus> (which I also find very unfortunate)
[09:22:41] <niconii> imo, i'd rather have more variety in CPUs, not less
[09:22:52] <blueridanus> Why?
[09:23:49] <niconii> well, in a sense that's kinda like asking "why would you ever want more than one programming language"
[09:24:20] <Elaine> RISC-V is clearly the only architecture we need.
[09:25:00] <blueridanus> But... wouldn't that make it more of a hassle to write compilers?
[09:25:41] <Elaine> It's already a hassle to write compilers. Targeting 3 architectures once you already support 2 if eons easier than the other way.
[09:25:55] <Elaine> LLVM makes writing a target is pretty straightforward, if tedious.
[09:26:10] <Elaine> It's also not like existing ISAs are perfect.
[09:26:24] <niconii> also, i'm not a compiler writer :D
[09:26:30] <blueridanus> Yeah, LLVM does make things easy.
[09:26:39] <Elaine> I wouldn't call it easy
[09:26:39] <blueridanus> Well, I'm not too sure about CPUs, but GPUs frustrate me.
[09:26:47] <blueridanus> Easier?
[09:26:54] <Elaine> definitely
[09:27:20] <blueridanus> I had an idea for a graphics library.
[09:28:43] <blueridanus> And, one of the core concepts is that you could use lambdas to do stuff.
[09:29:18] <blueridanus> Like, map an lambda that always return "red" to a rasterized surface would make it red
[09:29:35] <blueridanus> Mapping a lambda that takes the position could make a gradient
[09:30:24] <blueridanus> But that means it can only run in CPUs, because most programming languages don't support GPUS.
[09:30:34] <blueridanus> And that sounds worthless.
[09:30:59] <Elaine> Most programming languages wouldn't be capable of running on a GPU at the speed they run on the CPU.
[09:31:22] <Elaine> Programming GPU cores is mostly an exercise in data and work parallelism
[09:31:27] <blueridanus> But you see, the map operation is a fundamentally extremely parallel problem
[09:32:45] <blueridanus> Wouldn't it be nice if you could just do something like "1..100.parallelMap(|n|{n*n})"?
[09:34:07] <blueridanus> You can - for CPUs only.
[09:34:16] <Elaine> Maybe with existing technology...
[09:34:51] <Elaine> Renaissance was before its time, but on today's GPU you could probably take it much further.
[09:36:02] <blueridanus> You mean, "you can already do that"?
[09:36:16] <blueridanus> You can't without ridiculous boilerplate.
[09:36:30] <Elaine> No, I mean, you probably can't with existing technology but it's not inconceivable.
[09:36:44] <Elaine> It'd take a lot of hard work to boil away the abstractions, but it'd be doable with careful design.
[09:36:45] <blueridanus> Oh. It's surely not.
[09:37:26] <fkaa> Elaine: does it matter which architecture i learn? (do most concepts translate to other archs?)
[09:37:42] <Elaine> fkaa: Most concepts translate reasonably well.

[11:48:57] <XMPPwocky> oh i'm scrolled up a bit
[11:51:08] <XMPPwocky> i learned asm with ARM first, and i found that a nice way to go about it
[11:51:37] <XMPPwocky> because it's RISC, there's less mysterious things going on
[11:52:17] <Elaine> arm is still pretty gnarly.
[11:52:42] <Elaine> MIPS or m68k is a nice starting architecture I think, at least among the modern ones.
[11:52:58] <Elaine> I'm becoming convinced that the PDP-11 is among the easiest, most consistent, and simplest though.
[11:53:02] <Elaine> from working with it
[11:53:14] <Elaine> it's just not "modern"
[11:53:34] <XMPPwocky> the nice thing about arm for me was, like, not having function calls as a real thing
[11:54:18] <XMPPwocky> you just pop the pc (program counter) off the stack to return, and call is just a branch that happens to push the pc onto the stack
[11:54:28] <Elaine> mhm
[11:54:43] <XMPPwocky> it's not very ergonomic but you can get an idea of how it works pretty easily
[11:55:48] <XMPPwocky> in unrelated news i happened to find this: http://community.arm.com/groups/embedded/blog/2013/05/07/how-arm-compiler-detects-stack-overflows-or-malicious-tampering
[11:55:54] <XMPPwocky> apparently you need to set the stack cookie manually
[11:56:15] <XMPPwocky> now i'm not an expert here but i bet at least 50% of programs in the wild never set that
[11:57:55] <FreeFull> ARM has the whole THUMB mode thing
[11:58:17] <XMPPwocky> FreeFull: yeah, but you don't need that if you don't enable it explicitly
[11:58:21] <Elaine> when I was learning arm I only did thumb because gameboy.
[11:58:45] <XMPPwocky> i did ARMv7 which is probably different somehow
[11:59:58] <FreeFull> I think ARMv8 got rid of it
[12:00:55] <XMPPwocky> > To use backports, do $ pip install enum34, installing enum (no numbers) will install a completely different and incompatible version.
[12:01:01] <Elaine> FreeFull: only the 64bit chips
[12:01:02] <FreeFull> Oh, nevermind, ARMv8 still has thumb
[12:01:03] <XMPPwocky> you can always tell when somebody's run into the issue they're warning you about
[12:01:27] <Elaine> there are various "profiles" of arm for various applications
[12:01:46] <Elaine> the cortex-m series (which is what I mostly have experience with) only does thumb

[16:03:30] <mrmonday> I'm kinda hopeful github will last longer than sf managed
[16:03:54] <mrmonday> like it has an actual business model in place, and has a far stronger community (it seems, anyway)
[16:04:16] <mrmonday> I dunno if it's profitable, mind
[16:04:42] <mrmonday> I assume so, since all the big tech companies have started using it for their open source stuff
[16:04:53] <dfockler> I guess they have enterprise, but is that funding everything?
[16:06:04] <dfockler> I'd rather see Github turn into a not for profit or something more inline with the public's interest, it's nearing dev utility status at this point
[16:06:32] <mrmonday> you also pay for private repos
[16:06:41] <dfockler> that's true
[16:06:50] <mrmonday> I know quite a few people that do that
[16:07:10] <mrmonday> since it's very little money, and if all your stuff is already there it's super convenient
[16:07:20] <mrmonday> more so than setting up a bitbucket account
[16:08:14] <dfockler> bitbucket feels empty compared to github, maybe it's just the focus of the different products
[16:08:55] <niconii> i dunno, it might have something to do with the design too
[16:09:00] <mrmonday> well, it was originally just mercurial, and git seems to have won the DVCS fight
[16:09:23] <mrmonday> if it had turned out the other way I think we'd be having the same conversation but the other way around
[16:10:44] <Tobba> mrmonday: I'd assume so, I never really liked sourceforge even when it was widely used
[16:10:51] <Tobba> it was just kind of... a mess

[17:01:56] <Astraea> frustrating to say the least
[17:02:01] <dfockler> Definitely
[17:02:16] <Astraea> so we just handed a project off to a new developer
[17:02:27] <Astraea> I was the only one to work on it mind you, doing stuff I had never done before
[17:02:41] <Astraea> the new company has... 3 developers
[17:02:45] <Astraea> just for maintenance
[17:02:54] <Astraea> irritating
[17:03:37] <dfockler> I'm doing maintenance on the project I built and it's so boring
[17:03:58] <dfockler> because I'm the only person who knows how to work on it, so I have to work on it now
[17:04:10] <kimundi> Hm, does anyone know what the C++ pattern is for instantiating a template type parameter? Eg, like if you had a trait CreateMe { fn construct(A, B) -> Self } in Rust
[17:04:12] <Lurkin> Dat job security.
[17:04:26] <Astraea> well, this client switched to a new developer at launch

[17:06:19] <mrmonday> kimundi: is it not just the same as any other type? ie T t(args); or new T(args) or whatever?
[17:06:28] <Astraea> anyway, my salary is also abysmally low (I don't even get any benefits)
[17:06:31] <mrmonday> or did I misunderstand?
[17:06:41] <Astraea> so... when I interview for a job it's very uncomfortable
[17:07:00] <kimundi> mrmonday: No, thats right I guess... Just wondering if there is a way to make it type safe in any way :P
[17:07:09] <Astraea> maybe I'll become a blacksmith, I have a lot of frustration to hammer out =P
[17:07:12] <mrmonday> Astraea: being the only person who knows the software puts you in a great bargaining position for a raise
[17:07:35] <dfockler> I work fulltime hourly without benefits, it's pretty butt
[17:07:38] <Astraea> mrmonday: the client moved to a new developer, we handed everything over
[17:07:40] <mrmonday> I know a guy who just asked for a raise, got it, then moved to another company, using the raise as a way to get even more money at the new place :p
[17:07:57] <fkaa> kimundi: typedef SomeType<int, int> NewType; NewType n(2, 4);?
[17:08:10] <dfockler> I tend to the view that the company doesn't care about you, so you might as well look out for yourself
[17:08:11] <Astraea> dfockler: hopefully it's decent hourly
[17:08:16] <dfockler> Yeah it's alright
[17:08:20] <dfockler> for the area I live in
[17:08:37] <Astraea> rent around here for a 1 bedroom is ~$1200/mo
[17:08:41] <mrmonday> kimundi: I believe concepts solves that problem... but that's no use to you right now, since it's a C++17 thing which isn't finalised and isn't implemented by any compilers
[17:08:52] <dfockler> Astraea: :(
[17:08:52] <Astraea> which is more than a third of what I take home
[17:08:55] <kimundi> fkaa: I'm not sure how that is applicable here :)
[17:09:01] <fkaa> maybe i misunderstood
[17:09:23] <kimundi> mrmonday: yeah... I'd be happy with just being able to define a interface for the method, even if its not checked in instantiation
[17:09:25] <Astraea> I dunno, I'm not super hopeful when it comes to finding a new job
[17:09:46] <dfockler> Astraea: just got to fake it til you make it
[17:09:57] <mrmonday> kimundi: I think there are limited ways to put restrictions on T, my C++-foo is pretty limited though :(
[17:10:05] <kimundi> hm...
[17:10:34] <Astraea> dfockler: perhaps...
[17:10:45] <Astraea> I'll be applying for other jobs soon
[17:11:06] <mrmonday> in D you can just add an if statement to your definition, so you can do things like T some_func(T)(T arg) if ( this_code_compiles!q{the code} ) { . . . }
[17:11:07] <Astraea> which means I'll have super exhausting interviews that I get all the way through before they say no to me
[17:11:09] <mrmonday> which is pretty cool
[17:11:46] <Lurkin> Astraea get hired by a startup.
[17:11:49] <mrmonday> you'll get a lovely error message anyway from C++, if you can't instantiate your T how you're trying to
[17:12:12] <Lurkin> And then tell them this is your favorite song.

[17:12:53] <eddyb> I love his "sorta kinda maybe" bits
[17:13:08] <kimundi> mrmonday: yeah, my issue is more with not getting an error message if I happen to put a unrelated type in there that happens to have the same constructor signature :D But I guess I'm doomed with stuff like that in C++
[17:13:14] <Astraea> I hate saying my age... ever, but I just turned 30 a few days ago, it's extremely depressing

[17:14:45] <mbrubeck> it's kinda awesome

[17:16:24] <Astraea> I was there 5 years ago =P
[17:16:51] <mrmonday> kimundi: there are lots of ugly hacks you could use if you know that the instantiator is gonna be in control of the types they're instantiating with... such as requiring a function with a certain name be defined for the type, or requiring that it has some dummy field or something
[17:17:05] <Astraea> kimundi: I took classes with a few older people, they were out of place at the time though
[17:17:07] * kimundi gives Lurkin a mid-twenties-no-clue high-five
[17:17:19] <mrmonday> there might even be some nice hacks you could use, but, again, lacking in the C++-foo
[17:17:43] * dfockler third high five to kimundi and Lurkin
[17:17:46] <Astraea> actually I spent most of my 20's unemployed because I couldn't find a job because I was inexperienced because I couldn't find a job because... yeah =P
[17:18:08] <kimundi> mrmonday: yeah... I guess I'll just not bother, this is semi-internal anyway :P
[17:18:11] <zofrex> Astraea: I was in a similar boat to you a few years back, I managed to get out of that trap
[17:18:21] <zofrex> it's possible... but it was hard work
[17:18:46] <dfockler> I live in a pit as far as jobs are concerned, just trying to get a sweet remote gig

[17:21:51] <Astraea> Adderall is just a stimulant

[17:23:08] <Manishearth> Astraea: Go into the academia. Pick the right subfield and univ, and generally you earn very less but can sustain yourself (esp because all these univs provide housing and shit), so you can focus your time on stuff you want to do
[17:23:21] <Manishearth> but this is highly dependent on the subfield and univ
[17:23:27] <zofrex> Lurkin: I had experience just crappy PHP chop shop stuff.

[17:23:28] <mrmonday> which is bad, given that I'm unemployed, and as of Saturday crashing at a friend's due to not having found somewhere to live yet
[17:23:40] <Tobba> Lurkin: apparently adderal just consists of... various amphetamines
[17:23:44] <Tobba> I thought it was more than that
[17:23:46] <zofrex> I also took a below market rate starting salary which probably helped
[17:24:05] <zofrex> mrmonday: I have some good articles on procrastination!
[17:24:21] <Manishearth> Astraea: also I'm not sure if you can randomly drop into academia like that. But as a grad students in most fields you break even wrt finances and you are able to sustain yourself
[17:24:23] <Astraea> Manishearth: I did like academia... Will have to take the gre tho
[17:24:31] <Manishearth> but then planning for the future is hard
[17:24:39] <Manishearth> Astraea: it's just english :)
[17:24:43] <zofrex> one of the main things is that if you divide your time into work and play, you get more work done AND you enjoy the play more... it's less guilty if you're not procastinating. so that was a key learning experience.
[17:24:52] <mrmonday> zofrex: that sounds like great procrastination! Do you have links? :>

[18:04:50] <Astraea> well yeah, I've always done that =P

[18:05:36] <Astraea> I suppose I can work on my modal editor

[18:06:01] <Astraea> or rather, think of a piece to do
[18:06:01] <kimundi> Does anyone have a tip how to format a integer as a ASCII string into a vector<uint8_t> without going through a temporary string? :D
[18:06:03] <Lurkin> Another option might be to find a way to make it so my shiba can't tell time.
[18:06:21] <Astraea> shiba?
[18:07:17] <Lurkin>  Shiba Inu
[18:07:44] <huon> kimundi: I know how to do it in rust :P
[18:08:01] <Astraea> umm... I have a suggestion but I don't think the shiba or you would like it... at all...
[18:08:07] <kimundi> huon: Had that feeling ten times today already :P
[18:08:41] <kimundi> Can a ostream be used with arbitrary binary data?
[18:08:53] <huon> kimundi: you could pre-allocate space and snprintf
[18:08:57] <huon> but that's rather C-y
[18:09:45] <scott> kimundi: Apparently you can stringstream into a buffer you allocated separately: http://stackoverflow.com/a/16360560
[18:10:05] <scott> C++'s stdlib makes reasonable things really awkward.
[18:10:20] <kimundi> scott: Oh! Well thats perfect
[18:11:05] <kimundi> hm... I would have to calculate the exact capacity of my vector, but I actually can do that here...

[18:46:40] <zofrex> anyone have opinions on passing around tzdb-style timezones instead of offsets between apps and apis? it seems like those have strictly more information to me, but I'd appreciate a holla if you can see a problem with doing that
[18:47:02] <mbrubeck> The tz database is published by IANA, so it's kind of a standard? http://www.iana.org/time-zones
[18:47:05] <mbrubeck> also http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6557
[18:47:31] <scott> Yeah, the tzdb feels pretty standard to me, but I don't know what your standard is for standards.
[18:47:58] <scott> zofrex: Passing tzdb timezones seems better, but I guess that depends on your usecase.
[18:48:01] <zofrex> Usually RFCs or ISOs
[18:48:41] <zofrex> scott: tbh 99% of the time everything is in the same timezone, but we're potentially talking about making reservations in the future on objects in a different timezone to the app user / device the app is running on
[18:49:24] <scott> Then tz could potentially help you out, especially if the future date is in a different DST state than the current date.
[18:49:40] <mbrubeck> zofrex: Looks like the iCalendar format does that, e.g. DTSTART;TZID=America/New_York:19980119T020000
[18:49:41] <zofrex> that's what I'm thinking
[18:49:52] <zofrex> ooh
[18:50:01] <zofrex> yeah I think this is common enough to count as a standard then :)
[18:50:24] <mbrubeck> http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545#section-3.2.19 "This document does not define a naming convention for time zone identifiers.  Implementers may want to use the naming conventions defined in existing time zone specifications such as the public-domain TZ database [TZDB]."

[19:41:28] <dfockler> I guess that's like setting up layouts in iOS & Android, it's better to do that visually
