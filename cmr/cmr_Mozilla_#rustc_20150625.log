[19:47:30] <jroesch> Eddyb: you are refactoring ty.rs?
[19:47:51] <eddyb> compiling now
[19:49:51] <jroesch> I'm just wondering because my current patch is probably going be at minimum 1-1.5k lines and I have my hands all over tyoeck
[19:50:11] <eddyb> eek
[19:50:26] <eddyb> jroesch: outside middle::ty the replaces are pretty mechanical
[19:51:31] <jroesch> sweet
[19:51:50] <jroesch> I'm just lazy and like avoid merging work
[19:52:46] <jroesch> You'll probably beat me to PR again we've mostly been talking all week, haven't had much time to code
[19:58:07] <eddyb> you know what's going to break horribly?
[19:58:13] <eddyb> aatch's TyDef rewrite
[19:58:23] <eddyb> and arielb1's rebase of it (IIRC)
[19:58:48] <arielb1> eddyb: its already broken horribly
[19:59:38] <arielb1> eddyb: what are you doing?
[19:59:51] <eddyb> just turned every function in middle::ty into a method
[19:59:57] <arielb1> nice
[20:00:10] <arielb1> eddyb: that's because you want to add more lifetime parameters?
[20:00:19] <eddyb> yupp
[20:00:43] <eddyb> I actually figure out how to do a local/global split without using two pointers (which could be a perf degradation)
[20:00:47] <eddyb> *figured out
[20:01:22] <eddyb> one raw pointer but it can have a safe interface on top (basically emulating 'self)
[20:13:19] <jroesch> eddyb: I think we should all try to sync up this week, we have been talking about incremental compilation the past couple of days and it would be good for everyone to be the same page 
[20:13:27] <jroesch> not sure when we will have time
[20:13:32] <jroesch> been busy with all the work week stuff
[20:13:44] <jroesch> all => compiler people
[20:14:14] <eddyb> jroesch: aturon wanted to discuss some things too
[20:14:42] <eddyb> impl Trait and something to do with specialization and all that DOM "inheritance" stuff
[20:15:00] <jroesch> yeah we had a 4ish hour conversation about related topics yesterday, just want to make sure we aren't wasting each others time by working on similar things 
[20:18:57] <eddyb> librustc just compiled :D
[20:43:59] <eddyb> jroesch: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/26575
[20:44:03] <eddyb> lol acrichto
[20:44:06] <eddyb> *sorry*
[20:45:06] <eddyb> jroesch: what I don't understand is how I keep removing half a thousand lines (last PR had a similar diff inbalance)
[20:45:44] <eddyb> nmatsakis: this is so going to rot
[20:46:09] <eddyb> I'll go to sleep and I'll wake up and I'll have 100 merge failures
[20:46:43] <arielb1> eddyb: I don't think there are any changes to ty.rs in the queue
[20:46:59] <eddyb> arielb1: are there any compiler patches in the queue?
[20:47:16] <eddyb> oh the queue is empty :P
[20:48:54] <eddyb> jroesch, arielb1, nmatsakis: also worried some of the changes might be controversial

[22:49:21] <jroesch> eddyb: I have a patch I'm trying to land with Niko today towards the incremental compilation stuff. I'll see if we can get both reviewed tonight
[22:49:43] <jroesch> waiting on a build to come back to make sure my changes are stable
[22:50:16] <eddyb> jroesch: can I see it :D?
[22:51:32] <eddyb> last I checked incremental compilation wasn't feasible because of LLVM information loss (about all the optimizations it performed. e.g. it could devirtualize a call and then inline it and the compiler couldn't know there was ever a dependence)
[22:54:56] <jroesch> eddyb: yeah I'll cc when I push
[22:55:15] <eddyb> thanks!
[22:55:21] <jroesch> this is just the first steps of gluing the various contexts together so we can localize the data
[22:55:36] <jroesch> Mostly Niko's design that I've implemented 
[22:55:40] <eddyb> but do we have enough data? or is there some limitation in the design?
[22:56:12] <jroesch> I'm not sure about the LLVM piece
[22:56:19] <jroesch> I've only been thinking about the frontend 
[22:56:34] <eddyb> fair enough
[22:56:43] <jroesch> we should all chat later, we are doing a rust tutorial at the ww right now
[22:56:55] <eddyb> good luck!
[22:56:55] <jroesch> I would like to keep all the compiler-y people in the loop
[22:57:06] <jroesch> I'm mostly sitting here but I think everyone else is afk
