[22:25:40] <mitsuhiko> wycats: maybe we should use npm
[22:25:44] <mitsuhiko> they have the monies!
[22:25:49] <wycats> done
[22:25:54] <mitsuhiko> and it solves such complex problems as dependencies
[22:25:58] <wycats> confirm
[22:26:27] <wycats> as you know, I got a time machine so I could use the npm solution in bundler
[22:28:43] <steveklabnik> heheh
[22:28:49] <steveklabnik> i was gonna make a joke about that
[22:46:25] <mitsuhiko> i actually think the hard part is not the package manager but the build systme
[22:46:35] <mitsuhiko> the tricky part is scripting the build process in a platform independent way
[22:47:27] <mitsuhiko> (unless you ignore windows, then it's easy)
