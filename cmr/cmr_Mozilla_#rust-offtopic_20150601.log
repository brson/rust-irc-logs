[16:37:04] <Tiffany> so like
[16:37:04] <Tiffany> to compare
[16:37:16] <Tiffany> crank up your view distance to 32 chunks and install the glsl shaders mod
[16:37:22] <WindowsBunny> xD
[16:37:32] <WindowsBunny> Tiffany: Minecraft can't be compared
[16:37:43] <WindowsBunny> because it is bottlenecked by CPU
[16:37:44] <Tiffany> on a system with GTX 980
[16:37:56] <Tiffany> not the terrain rendering, windowsbunny
[16:37:59] <Tiffany> at least, with VBOs enabled
[16:37:59] <WindowsBunny> I'm already using only 10% of my GPU for minecraft
[16:38:21] <Tiffany> you'll find that if you're CPU bound, cranking the view distance doesn't affect your FPS much
[16:38:21] <WindowsBunny> Minecraft is horribly inefficient
[16:38:27] <Tiffany> yes, in some ways
[16:38:34] <Tiffany> but comparing it to lego worlds?
[16:38:45] <Tiffany> minecraft is efficient at drawing terrain, because it has to be
[16:38:52] <Tiffany> if it used immediate mode for terrain, it would run at under 1 fps
[16:39:01] <Tiffany> unless you were running it on an IBM mainframe
[16:39:19] <Tiffany> it uses either display lists or VBOs, depending on your graphics settings
[16:39:26] <Tiffany> one per chunk
[16:39:53] <Tiffany> usually minecraft is dealing with less than 100 chunks
[16:40:17] <Tiffany> the sources of CPU load that hurt fps are tile entities and regular entities (both of which are drawn in immediate mode)
[16:40:20] <WindowsBunny> Tiffany: render distance at far, still only 12% of gpu being used
[16:40:27] <Tiffany> if you need a demonstration, build a 32x32x32 cube of stone, and then replace it with chests
[16:41:06] <Tiffany> or spawn in 500 zombies
[16:41:16] <Tiffany> I don't see any mobs in that lego game
[16:41:20] <Tiffany> there's just players + terrain
[16:41:36] <Tiffany> they're probably using batching extensions and relying on you having a GPU that can deal with 5 million tiny polygons
[16:42:08] <Tiffany> for reference, a typical minecraft scene has about a million polygons
[16:42:22] <Tiffany> it depends heavily on view distance and the number of tile entities and entities within range
[16:43:36] <Tiffany> oh
[16:43:37] <Tiffany> you know what
[16:43:50] <Tiffany> I just noticed that all of the blocks in lego worlds are grid aligned
[16:44:07] <Tiffany> it's that way in blockland too
[16:44:18] <Tiffany> also, as for editing tools
[16:44:37] <Tiffany> mojang has stated on many occasions that minecraft is and they want it to stay as a game where you build one block at a time
[16:44:58] <Tiffany> there are editing tools if you want them, in the form of world edit
[16:45:27] <WindowsBunny> But worldedit/voxel whatever don't have as nice an interface

[22:02:51] <niconii> yeah, that's the reason
[22:03:05] <niconii> it doesn't matter if it's your *own* kid building dicks
[22:05:06] <XMPPwocky> i mean, even an automated classifier would need training
[22:05:28] <XMPPwocky>  so you'd probably need to get a whole bunch of interns and have them build lots of dongs for an initial corpus

[22:06:38] <niconii> that'd certainly be an... interesting job
[22:10:09] <WindowsBunny> lego worlds not being an mmo seems really cool

[22:20:08] <zofrex> that's a lot of search space
[22:25:21] <niconii> tbh i don't really think kids seeing a lego dong is as big of an issue as it's made out to be, like
[22:25:35] <niconii> half of the kids *have* one
[22:25:52] <niconii> a lot of kids aren't even gonna know what it is, making it about as unremarkable as any other random lego thing

[23:21:26] <Tobba> it would be cool if the translator could ask for the context it needs
