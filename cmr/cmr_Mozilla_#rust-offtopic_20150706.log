[01:10:27] <eddyb> Elaine: I would gladly use a different CLI for git if someone makes it
[01:10:35] <Elaine> eddyb: multiple exist.
[01:10:42] <eddyb> ignorance is bliss :P
[01:10:47] <Elaine> it's not that bad once you already know how to use it lol
[01:10:51] <Elaine> same goes for cvs.
[01:10:54] <eddyb> that said, I'm doing pretty fine right now with a few basic commands + git gui
[01:10:55] <Elaine> but they're both objectively bad.
[01:11:01] <eddyb> so, like pacman?
[01:11:05] <eddyb> and nix-*
[01:11:19] <Tiffany> yeah but what should we use instead elaine? mercurial?
[01:11:33] <Elaine> Tiffany: I like fossil.
[01:11:34] <aatch> What's so bad about git? I've never had much trouble with it.
[01:11:44] <Elaine> aatch: the cli is obtuse and inconsistent.
[01:11:46] <Tiffany> fossil is strange
[01:11:50] <Tiffany> having a built in bug tracker and wiki
[01:12:06] <eddyb> zypper on the other hand, you would be hard-pressed to find someone who can type into a console and not figure out how to use it
[01:12:09] <Elaine> I mean, I use and like git, I'm not trying to shit on it.
[01:12:34] <fmtq> I think apt-get is simpler than zypper, eddyb
[01:12:41] <aatch> Sure, it can be tricky to fix things if they break, but at least you *can* fix things, the way you "fix" things in SVN is to just revert everything and try again.
[01:12:50] <eddyb> fmtq: it's also harder to use
[01:12:52] <Elaine> Sure, feature-wise it's great.
[01:13:10] <fmtq> riiiight
[01:13:15] <eddyb> fmtq: aptitude is closer to zypper
[01:13:18] <Astraea> I wish gpl had not have won
[01:13:24] <Astraea> Also, bleh with got
[01:13:27] <Astraea> Git
[01:13:30] <eddyb> what you don't get by default on Debian:
[01:13:33] <eddyb> zypper search foobar
[01:13:45] <eddyb> zypper install foobar
[01:13:48] <fmtq> apt-cache search foobar
[01:13:51] <eddyb> no manual update required
[01:13:55] <Elaine> why are there multiple programs
[01:14:03] <Elaine> how do you discover apt-cache
[01:14:09] <eddyb> fmtq: but you have to figure out that apt-cache exists in the first place
[01:14:10] <fmtq> apt<tab>
[01:14:13] <aatch> That's my biggest complaint.
[01:14:17] <Elaine> how do you discover tab completion
[01:14:20] <fmtq> git used to be like this
[01:14:34] <eddyb> it took me a couple years of screwing around with a Debian server
[01:14:37] <fmtq> how do you discover the terminal 
[01:14:39] <fmtq> literacy 
[01:14:39] <aatch> It's not obvious that apt-cache is what you use to search.
[01:14:54] <eddyb> apt-cache sounds like some back-end stuff
[01:14:54] <fmtq> none of this is obvious
[01:14:58] <fmtq> there is no such thing as obviousness.
[01:14:59] <fmtq> it is a unicorn.
[01:15:05] <eddyb> like nix-store
[01:15:15] <aatch> fmtq, it's not about obviousness, it's about discoverability.
[01:15:21] <fmtq> nix-store sounsd like a frontend in simple english
[01:15:24] <eddyb> you don't use nix-store to search, but nix-* has other issues
[01:15:24] <WindowsBunny> a GUI has very good discoverability
[01:15:25] <fmtq> a store being a _front_ 
[01:15:26] <fmtq> lol
[01:15:41] <eddyb> this is fun
[01:15:52] <WindowsBunny> And honestly, most of the time discoverability is way more important than being able to optimize my actions to a few keystrokes
[01:16:22] <eddyb> instead of sudo zypper search foobar I use sypper se foobar
[01:16:34] <eddyb> I made an alias so I don't have to type sudo because it hurts
[01:16:36] <aatch> Anyway, pacman is reasonably easy to work with. `pacman -S package` to insteall `pacman -Ss package` to search.
[01:16:58] <eddyb> aatch: right, but it's not clear what those flags do without looking at a manpage
[01:17:09] <fmtq> ... --help
[01:17:13] <aatch> eddyb, I'll give you that.
[01:17:14] <eddyb> and you have to remember around 5 useful combinations
[01:17:15] <fmtq> lol
[01:17:23] <eddyb> it's better than apt-*, for sure
[01:17:31] <fmtq> -Syuf
[01:18:02] <eddyb> I'm just amazed at how much shit OpenSUSE gets when it has the best UX so far. and a pretty impressive collections of packages, though Arch is beating it atm AFAIK
[01:18:32] <fmtq> OS X is still the winner.
[01:18:34] <Elaine> it uses fucking rpm, second only to apt in how obtuse it is to write a package.
[01:18:40] <eddyb> I switched to NixOS for novelty and due to global state paranoia
[01:18:42] <fmtq> elementary OS is shiny.
[01:18:57] <eddyb> I hate not knowing where everything came from
[01:19:03] <eddyb> on NixOS, everything comes from the store :P
[01:19:16] <eddyb> *almost
[01:19:20] <fmtq> and how did it get into the store
[01:19:24] <eddyb> the internet
[01:19:26] <eddyb> or local build
[01:19:37] <Havvy> fmtq:  Almost every package is source based.
[01:19:44] * fmtq knows
[01:20:02] <Havvy> eddyb:  Sublime Packages don't go into the nix-store though. :(
[01:20:05] * eddyb closes 15 playpen and gist tabs
[01:20:37] <eddyb> this is what I get for idling in #rust
[01:20:48] <eddyb> Havvy: are they like plugins?
[01:20:55] <Havvy> Yesh.
[01:21:15] <eddyb> you can't get applications to fully conform without rewriting parts of them
[01:21:33] <eddyb> NixOS has to become an indiviually relevant platform to get nice support
[01:21:50] <Havvy> Yeah...the only way we can get NixOS to be relevant is to get more users though.
[01:22:19] <Havvy> Also, for whatever reason, the maintainers trust me to update io.js, but not node.js.  :S
[01:22:20] <eddyb> or by bribing Gaben... oh wait, he's too rich :(
[01:22:35] <aji> try to get richard nixon to sponsor it
[01:23:33] <Elaine> We booted the PDP-11 today, and got the disk controller working.
[01:24:00] <Elaine> Using an rpi and a python script to manipulate the q-bus. technology!
[01:24:12] <Elaine> Jokingly referred to as the "ipmi" module.
[01:25:29] <eddyb> Elaine: you're crazy <3
[01:25:35] <eddyb> I can't wait to see what happens with that
[01:25:48] <Tiffany> whoa
[01:25:57] <Elaine> I'm going to port rust to the damn thing if it kills me.
[01:26:02] <Elaine> the LLVM backend is moving slowly though
[01:26:16] <Elaine> as I need to learn both llvm and the LSI-11 architecture
[01:26:33] <Tiffany> hah
[01:27:04] <Tiffany> reimplement the original UNIX in rust!
[01:27:31] <eddyb> https://eyes.nasa.gov/dsn/dsn.html
[01:27:50] <eddyb> since when are there 2 downlink data streams?
[01:28:24] <eddyb> same rate and frequency, but varying power levels
[01:28:32] <Elaine> I dunno, multiqueue nic's are popular ;P
[01:28:50] <eddyb> is it duplex, or is that just an artifact of the signal processing?
[01:29:00] <eddyb> Elaine: there was just one stream a few hours ago
[01:29:26] <eddyb> maybe it's 2 under normal conditions and I was looking at it during the aftermath of the safe mode
[01:29:30] <eddyb> *safe mode event

[01:30:46] <Elaine> the PDP-11 chasis. Q-Bus backplane on bottom, PDP-11 is rightmost, serial controller to the left, and then the disk controller.
[01:30:52] <Elaine> We just got a shell (DMON) on the disk controller.
[01:30:54] <Elaine> It has a Z80.
[01:31:17] <Elaine> oh, and that's a PC power supply too.
[01:31:25] <eddyb> write a Z80 backend, too
[01:31:32] <Elaine> eh it's pretty much just x86
[01:31:36] <Elaine> like, almost exactly.
[01:31:59] <Elaine> that fat ribbon cable is hooked up to the pi's gpio. it's not actually a connector for the pi, but it has the right spacing, so lol.
[01:32:00] <eddyb> how good is LLVM's x86_16?
[01:32:10] <Elaine> Not even sure if it exists :P
[01:32:25] <eddyb> it was WIP a few months ago
[01:32:27] <Elaine> https://goo.gl/photos/HzJMZUNTZDAocCRt5 is the full setup.
[01:32:35] <eddyb> with a pretty detailed description
[01:32:41] <eddyb> now the description is gone everywhere I looked
[01:32:49] <eddyb> maybe it was wiped
[01:32:54] <Elaine> (pi shell on left, CRUX running on an older dell with the serial connection to the 11)
[01:33:05] <eddyb> Elaine: looks like some kind of alien spider being disected
[01:33:34] <eddyb> I probably need some sleep
[01:33:48] <eddyb> Elaine: but that's the coolest thing I've seen all month
[01:33:57] <eddyb> well, ignoring the fact that the month just started :P
[01:34:07] <Elaine> the PDP-11 has, in ROM, the 'on-line debugging tool' which is pretty much a software implementation of an old switch panel. can poke, peek, frob registers, etc.
[01:34:17] <Elaine> all by pulling a pin high!
[01:34:45] <eddyb> good old JTAG :P

[05:06:55] <Tobba> one of them is 8 MB/s and the other is at 1.7-2.5 MB/s
[05:07:06] <Tobba> one of these is the download speed and one is the upload, but it doesn't tell you which
[05:07:21] <Elaine> WindowsBunny: Well, "cached" is a bit inappropriate given that most fds are not backed by anything that can be retrieved more than once, but yes.
[05:07:26] <eddyb> Tobba: it's download/upload AFAICT
[05:07:36] <Tobba> that's what I was guessing
[05:07:56] <eddyb> wait what
[05:08:17] <eddyb> All value pairs (f.ex rate and queue size) will be in the UP/DOWN order. 
[05:08:34] <WindowsBunny> Elaine: yeah, I don't know of a way to get that info on windows either
[05:08:42] <eddyb> that would mean it's crawling even worse than I thought
[05:08:47] <eddyb> at 1.6MB/s
[05:08:49] <Tobba> eddyb: obviously.
[05:08:55] <Tobba> and that means I'm uploading at 8MB/s
[05:09:02] <eddyb> given that I've uploaded more than I downloaded, it makes sense
[05:09:05] <Tobba> which somewhat makes sense because the uploaded amount is way higher

[05:34:44] <aatch> Fullmetal Alchemist was pretty good too actually.
[05:34:55] <Tobba> I don't know how to explain that
[05:35:05] <Quxxy> Tobba: If we were talking about Excel Saga or Puni Puni Poemi, I'd agree wholeheartedly :D

[05:35:44] <Tobba> eddyb: too much compiler dev
[05:35:59] <aatch> I definitely prefer the direction Brotherhood took, but the anime writers did an excellent job at continuing the story when they caught up to the manga
[05:36:09] <Quxxy> Aside from the occasional anime animation tropes (like scenes where the animation becomes simpler to indicate someone is surprised), it doesn't really do anything anime-ish
[05:36:11] <Elaine> eddyb: fullmetal alchemist.

[05:37:05] <Quxxy> It's set in an analogue of early 1900's central Europe, there are *four* characters who are vaguely asian (and basically Chinese, at that)
[05:37:13] <Tobba> I need to watch the ghost in the shell movie, but there aren't any translations of the original :/

[05:43:54] <Quxxy> The actors' voices are *much* better fits for the characters
[05:43:56] <aatch> Quxxy, I find that some sub-titled stuff is weird though.
[05:44:02] <Quxxy> But they tend to just speak in monotone
[05:44:34] <Quxxy> The dub captures the fact that one of the main characters talks in an archaic way, while the subs don't...
[05:44:51] <Quxxy> ...but the dubs manage to miss or mishandle just about *every single joke* in the whole script
[05:45:01] <Elaine> lol
[05:45:08] <Quxxy> It's so badly done, there's one hilarious scene that goes like this:

[05:45:30] <Quxxy> Guard: "What are you carrying?"
[05:45:32] <aatch> I think that in the rough order is good dub > good sub > bad dub > bad sub
[05:45:37] <Quxxy> Lawrence: "As you can see, I'm transporting a load of weapons."
[05:45:47] <Quxxy> [Camera pans over wagon full of full suits of plate armor]
[05:46:16] <Elaine> aatch: Agree.
[05:46:22] <Quxxy> Apparently, no one checked to see if the words matched the pictures

[05:47:21] <Quxxy> As in suits of plate mail; he's not carrying any weapons

[06:05:31] <Elaine> Honestly how often do you want a public field on a struct that allows users to mutate, it shouldn't even be the default.
[06:07:09] <eddyb> make it `pub const foo: bar`
[06:07:11] <eddyb> or something like that
[06:07:14] <Tobba> immutable-by-default fields could be a good idea

[13:01:58] <Quxxy> For the exit shall be only 101 columns away, but for them, unreachable
[13:02:05] <benh> oh dear
[13:04:44] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: Hmmm, when did you start using your style anyway?
[13:05:19] <Quxxy> (Oh, I can't pass up the opportunity to do this...)
[13:05:24] <Quxxy> WindowsBunny: Just after eddyb told me about it
[13:06:02] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: Can you give me an approximate date?
[13:06:13] <mrmonday> I just spotted the bikeshed D:
[13:06:36] <eddyb> Quxxy: wat?
[13:06:39] <Quxxy> Well, I dunno... presumably shortly after where clauses were a thing, since I obviously couldn't use it *before*
[13:06:48] <eddyb> ahhh
[13:06:52] <eddyb> iswydt
[13:07:01] * Quxxy gives eddyb the double guns
[13:07:37] <WindowsBunny> I used that style of indenting the parameters of function definitions for as far back as I've used Rust
[13:07:47] <benh> What's this style :I
[13:08:13] <Quxxy> benh: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1190#issuecomment-118849205 See eddyb's and my own comments
[13:08:18] <WindowsBunny> But I only discovered this glorious addition of how to style where with eddyb's mention of how Quxxy does it
[13:08:57] <Quxxy> WindowsBunny: Well, if you ignore the where clauses... I've done it like that for ages
[13:09:10] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: Do you prefer to give each parameter its own line, or pack as many in as possible?
[13:09:13] <Quxxy> I mean, normally I use brace-on-the-next-line, but I adjusted that for Rust
[13:09:16] <benh> cripes how did i miss a bikeshed
[13:09:23] <Quxxy> :D
[13:10:01] <fmtq> put your hand up if I've offended you
[13:10:03] <benh> Down with brace-on-the-next-line heretics
[13:10:09] <Quxxy> If the arguments have some sort of logical grouping, I might make an exception, but otherwise it's a line a piece
[13:10:17] * WindowsBunny puts his paws up
[13:10:22] * WindowsBunny mauls fmtq
[13:11:04] <eddyb> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4v_JK_qbY
[13:11:10] <benh> I'm vaguely categorically opposed to any style that has me align things
[13:11:19] <eddyb> > when it comes to the arts, passion should trump common sense
[13:11:35] <benh> but I guess that battle is lost in rust
[13:12:01] <eddyb> benh: before Rust I could have 150 column lines
[13:12:37] <benh> I'm going back to C++ if this rfc gets accepted, this is unconsciable
[13:13:53] <eddyb> lol
[13:15:36] <WindowsBunny> benh: So are you in favor of Quxxy's style which just indents parameters instead of aligning them?
[13:15:51] <benh> I believe so
[13:16:52] <bluss> Quxxy: your where style is ok, the function argument style.. no
[13:16:57] <fmtq> if Rust didn't insist on { } 
[13:17:00] <benh> I can deal with { in their own line or { in the preceding line but not if it is one way for some blocks and another way for other blocks D:
[13:17:00] <fmtq> we'd not have this problem
[13:17:01] <fmtq> DO 
[13:17:02] <fmtq> END
[13:17:06] <fmtq> DO DO END END
[13:17:32] <Quxxy> Bikesheds are fun :D
[13:17:36] <fmtq> fn foo<A, B, C> DO a: A, b: B, c: C END -> Foo DO /* ... */ END 
[13:18:50] <niconii> fn foo DOPARAMS A, B, C ENDPARAMS DOARGS a: A, b: B, c: C ENDARGS -> Foo DOBLOCK /* ... */ ENDBLOCK
[13:19:10] <eddyb> benh: yes, that's my problem
[13:19:25] <eddyb> (and if it do it everywhere, it's a bit too much given value flow)
[13:19:44] <eddyb> think let x = if ... or let x = match ...
[13:19:53] <eddyb> if you have { on the next line it almost looks like that's a block scope
[13:19:58] <eddyb> unrelated to the if or match above
[13:22:04] <eddyb> Tobba: I don't get why reddit isn't talking about HackingTeam
[13:22:40] <niconii> SUBROUTINE FOO WITHPARAMS TYPE_A, TYPE_B, TYPE_C ENDPARAMS WITHARGS A IS TYPE_A, B IS TYPE_B, C IS TYPE_C ENDARGS RETURNS FOO DOBLOCK DOCOMMENT ... ENDCOMMENT ENDBLOCK
[13:22:44] <niconii> there
[13:22:45] <niconii> it is done
[13:22:49] <niconii> the perfect language
[13:23:20] <eddyb> niconii: the 70's called
[13:23:45] <niconii> eddyb: ;)
[13:23:52] <benh> I really don't like the thing where you do
[13:23:54] <benh> fn foo<
[13:23:55] <benh> >(
[13:23:57] <benh> ) ->
[13:24:01] <eddyb> benh: me neither
[13:24:17] <Tiffany> not even IBM RPG is that ugly
[13:24:28] <eddyb> any space on the inside of <> or () is annoying
[13:24:40] <eddyb> admitedly newlines are not as bad as ( a, b, c )
[13:24:58] <eddyb> that tuple just feels like an air hug
[13:25:00] <Tiffany> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_RPG
[13:25:18] <niconii> the fun part is that you can translate that to rust syntax with just basic find-and-replace
[13:25:38] <Tiffany> #define SUBROUTINE fn etc and then run CPP over it
[13:25:41] *** Joins: pczarn (piotr@moz-9un7t9.izacom.pl)
[13:25:57] <eddyb> Tiffany: wait wat how old is SQL?!
[13:26:03] <Tiffany> eddyb: old
[13:26:26] <Tiffany> it was standardized in 1986 but first appeared in 1974
[13:27:30] <Tiffany> eddyb: why do you think SQL loves uppercase english keywords so much?
[13:27:37] <benh> also own-like { for lambdas would look silly
[13:27:55] <eddyb> benh: oh dear
[13:27:58] <eddyb> so much cringe
[13:28:00] <benh> line*
[13:28:08] <eddyb> rustfmt --style=cringe
[13:28:23] * benh really wonders how such strong syntactic preferences are formed
[13:28:40] <eddyb> benh: the same way we subjectively appreciate beauty
[13:28:47] <benh> hm
[13:28:55] <benh> but there's a strong cultural element to beauty
[13:28:56] <eddyb> and slick-looking cars
[13:29:00] <eddyb> benh: bingo
[13:29:03] <Tiffany> it is also more significant when you don't know the language very well
[13:29:05] <benh> and here we go having slapfights even within the rust culture
[13:29:20] <eddyb> the cultural element is the cause, not the mechanism
[13:29:21] <Tiffany> new programmers are always fighting over which language has the better syntax
[13:29:32] <Tiffany> for me syntax is mostly ergonomic, and even then not that important
[13:29:50] <Tiffany> and this was before I learned C++, so don't blame that
[13:29:54] <eddyb> in programming everything is fuzzier, the difussion happened on a much shorter period
[13:30:14] <WindowsBunny> I came from the world of C++
[13:30:21] <WindowsBunny> So Rust's syntax was easier than C++
[13:31:08] <eddyb> benh: maybe beauty was the wrong word to use
[13:31:11] <eddyb> "neatness"
[13:31:17] <eddyb> almost OCD
[13:31:20] <benh> probably just familiarity, ultimately
[13:31:25] <benh> :(
[13:31:36] <eddyb> benh: clean desk vs messy
[13:31:39] <eddyb> discipline
[13:32:03] <eddyb> though that's more a question of self-consistency
[13:32:05] <benh> I'm looking at Delphi code right now and I wonder how anyone could have accepted this mess
[13:32:22] <benh> ; between parameters, but , between arguments!
[13:32:38] <eddyb> "parameters"?
[13:32:42] <benh> some blocks are delimited by begin/end, some blocks are just implicit!
[13:32:51] <benh> eddyb: in declarations you have ; and in calls you have ,
[13:32:57] <eddyb> no
[13:32:59] <eddyb> just no
[13:33:07] <Tiffany> delphi is an awful language
[13:33:11] <Tiffany> and not because of its syntax
[13:33:16] <eddyb> and here I thought the codegen was the worst part of it
[13:33:23] <benh> I think it's because you can write procedure Foo(X, Y, Z: Integer; T: DateTime);
[13:33:27] <eddyb> (I reverse-engineered a Delphi+C++ mess once)
[13:33:39] <eddyb> benh: ah, old C style
[13:33:48] <Tiffany> that's not old C style
[13:33:53] <eddyb> not exactly
[13:33:58] <Tiffany> oh
[13:34:03] <Tiffany> I had to read it backwards to see what you mean
[13:34:08] <eddyb> heh
[13:34:11] <benh> No it's just giving the type once for multiple parameters sharing the same type
[13:34:17] <eddyb> benh: you can do that in C
[13:34:23] <benh> oh
[13:34:33] <Tiffany> void foo(X, Y, Z, T) int X, Y, Z; /* redundant because default type is int */ struct datetime T;
[13:34:33] <eddyb> int foo(a, b, c) int a, b, c
[13:34:36] <eddyb> or something like that
[13:34:38] <benh> ok i never looked in detail at the K&R decls
[13:34:48] <benh> datetime actually appears to be an alias for float
[13:35:01] <Tiffany> ...
[13:35:03] <benh> so you can literally define DateTime as Date + Time
[13:35:14] <benh> b/c Date returns an integral float counting days, afaict
[13:35:14] <eddyb> benh: huh
[13:35:22] <Tiffany> that
[13:35:23] <Tiffany> why
[13:35:45] <Tiffany> is there a single facet of the semantics and standard library of delphi which is not utterly horrifying
[13:35:54] <Tiffany> who wrote this
[13:36:00] <eddyb> so I was looking at its codegen
[13:36:10] <eddyb> and this app was doing something weird with factories
[13:36:16] <Tiffany> borland
[13:36:17] <eddyb> in the C++ side, *I think*
[13:36:22] <Tiffany> god damnit, borland
[13:36:28] <eddyb> it wasn't clear which parts were C++ and which were Delphi
[13:36:42] <benh> It's really great, all objects live behind pointers so you have to do the equivalent of remembering to use C++ "delete" every time or you leak memory and don't get destructors
[13:36:57] <benh> no GC, no refcounting, no RAII
[13:37:11] <eddyb> I mean, if you saw if(!(string & 0x1))  if(!--*(string - 8)) free(string); that was Delphi
[13:37:17] <eddyb> benh: it doesn't ref-count strings?
[13:37:32] <benh> ~but~ if you use interfaces, which are apparently designed heavily after COM (and for COM interopt), you get refcount inc/decs codegenned for your interfaces
[13:37:34] <eddyb> if I got that part wrong it could be a weird C++ library
[13:37:51] <benh> so afaict a reasonable way to get almost-RAII would be to hide all your objects behind interfaces...
[13:37:55] <benh> eddyb: oh, surely it does
[13:37:59] <benh> eddyb: strings just aren't objects
[13:38:03] <eddyb> ahh
[13:38:06] <eddyb> that's what you mean
[13:38:19] <eddyb> yeah, so, strings were like old ~str's
[13:38:26] <eddyb> with the length before the data
[13:38:28] <eddyb> well, no
[13:38:31] <benh> @strs maybe
[13:38:32] <eddyb> they were basically the old @str
[13:38:40] <benh> also they're copy on write
[13:38:50] <eddyb> with the lowest bit indicating &'static str
[13:39:01] <eddyb> so Cow<'static, str, @str>
[13:39:13] <benh> and I *think* for WideStrings it's different, because those too were invented for COM interop, so they use a different allocator and no refcounting
[13:39:17] <eddyb> lol
[13:39:22] <eddyb> it was a bloody mess
[13:39:27] <eddyb> the C++ parts made some sense
[13:39:36] <eddyb> but then these factory-building factories
[13:39:38] <benh> Also it's Windows code so there's weird issues around DLL boundaries
[13:39:43] <eddyb> and their unholy vtables
[13:39:49] <eddyb> maybe they were COM-like
[13:39:53] <benh> I think we have a whole DLL just to make sure the other DLLs can share some info without running into allocator issues
[13:40:05] <benh> I don't really get it
[13:40:40] <benh> and in the end, we can't do anything really cool with DLLs anyway because the Delphi runtime with all its GUI stuff has to be sorta present for everything anyway
[13:41:17] <Tiffany> the wikipedia page has 5 paragraphs on the advantages of delphi and doesn't mention any of the horrifying disadvantages
[13:42:09] <benh> imo the advantage is that it's compact enough that you can fit all the weirdness in your head at the same time
[13:42:18] <benh> so you can just get on with making your buttons talk to your sql server or whatever
[13:42:29] <eddyb> benh: so are useful subsets of C++
[13:42:32] <benh> yeah
[13:42:38] <benh> well
[13:42:44] <benh> you don't get a compiler enforcing that you stay in that subset
[13:42:44] <eddyb> the argument there would be it's easier to misuse C++
[13:42:45] <Tiffany> don't subset C++
[13:42:56] <Tiffany> who even subsets C++ besides for writing java in C++
[13:43:14] <benh> delphi is probably fairly close to what you would get if you invented a weird syntax for writing java in C++
[13:43:21] <eddyb> Tiffany: things like not using new/delete
[13:43:40] <benh> since it does the whole thing where stack types are separate from heap types etc
[13:43:41] <eddyb> not overloading operators for weird usecases
[13:43:48] <benh> and didn't have generics for the longest time
[13:43:51] <eddyb> not abusing templates for CTFE
[13:44:04] <eddyb> benh: successful GC languages do that
[13:44:08] <eddyb> Java is an exception
[13:44:10] <Tiffany> why abuse templates for CTFE when C++ already has CTFE
[13:44:12] <eddyb> and all the scripting ones
[13:44:15] <eddyb> Tiffany: that's my point
[13:44:23] <eddyb> C++ didn't use to have CTFE
[13:44:26] <benh> who needs new when you have unique_ptr::release
[13:44:35] <Tiffany> well, this doesn't sound like subsetting, it sounds like writing idiomatic C++
[13:44:41] <benh> make_unique<T>(...).release() <-> new T(...)?
[13:44:46] <eddyb> by not touching the unidiomatic subsets :P
[13:44:49] <WindowsBunny> (9:39:58 AM) benh: I think we have a whole DLL just to make sure the other DLLs can share some info without running into allocator issues
[13:45:05] <Tiffany> so what's the deal then
[13:45:15] <eddyb> Tiffany: also things like not using privacy
[13:45:15] <Tiffany> are there only 4 subsets?
[13:45:22] <Tiffany> C, C++98, java, and C++11?
[13:45:22] <eddyb> never typing "class"
[13:45:26] <eddyb> LOL
[13:45:32] <WindowsBunny> benh: If two separate DLLs want to use the same static variable, then the static variable needs to be in a DLL that is shared by those DLLs
[13:45:47] <eddyb> C with polymorphism is already a pretty good thing
[13:45:48] <eddyb> Tiffany: oh
[13:45:51] <eddyb> Tiffany: never using inheritance
[13:45:59] <eddyb> or virtual calls
[13:46:03] <Tiffany> anyway, I use any feature when appropriate
[13:46:05] <benh> WindowsBunny: DLLs can't get at static variables from the exe?
[13:46:15] <Tiffany> the only features which are antipatterns are those which have been deprecated in favour of new ones
[13:46:16] <eddyb> Tiffany: right, but some projects stay best within certain boundaries
[13:46:27] <Quxxy> benh: IIRC, DLLs can't load symbols from the host executable
[13:46:35] <Tiffany> you can't quite get away with always avoiding new/delete
[13:46:36] <WindowsBunny> benh: A DLL can only get at static variables from their own dependencies
[13:46:37] <benh> wow, weird
[13:46:38] <benh> ok
[13:46:39] <eddyb> Tiffany: but there's no fucking point
[13:46:47] <eddyb> I don't plan on ever writing C++ code again
[13:46:47] <WindowsBunny> benh: and the dependency tree is an acyclic graph
[13:46:51] <eddyb> except maybe in uni
[13:46:52] <benh> then that's basically reasonable i guess
[13:46:56] <benh> but it looks so weird
[13:47:01] <Tiffany> I still write C++
[13:47:04] <eddyb> and LLVM patches but I usually cba
[13:47:08] <benh> you link to a dll that has all these variables and exposes accessors that have a C like interface
[13:47:17] <Tiffany> rust's type system isn't as powerful as C++ templates
[13:47:36] <WindowsBunny> I want Rust to have friggin integer generics already
[13:47:36] <Tiffany> and some people think that's a good thing
[13:47:38] <Tiffany> I disagree
[13:47:50] <benh> then you also import a module that has accessors with the same names that have a Delphi like interface (returning String instead of taking PChar) that dynamically look up the functions in that DLL and grab the value
[13:47:55] <WindowsBunny> Let me be generic on the size of a fixed size array already!
[13:48:01] <Tiffany> I want to be able to build an SQL EDSL that statically compiles to regular old SQL
[13:48:08] <Tiffany> with every error being caught at compile time
[13:48:11] <benh> WindowsBunny: yeah seriously :(
[13:48:13] <Tiffany> you can get pretty close to that in C++
[13:48:19] <Tiffany> you can't in rust
[13:48:27] <benh> WindowsBunny: but also generic over tuples, thanks
[13:48:38] <WindowsBunny> benh: variadics would be nice as well I guess
[13:48:48] <benh> Tiffany: you can get pretty close to it in C# too, can't you
[13:49:01] <Tiffany> there's LINQ or whatever, which does a lot of stuff at runtime
[13:49:05] <benh> mhm
[13:49:14] <Tiffany> like, it gets rid of syntax errors, but I bet it still has type errors and constraint errors
[13:49:19] <benh> was it F# that came with a bunch of stuff to generate types from your sql schema?
[13:49:30] <mrmonday> Tiffany: huh, I did that in D at one point
[13:49:52] <Tiffany> ur does sql, somehow
[13:49:52] <Quxxy> Huh wha D wazzat?
[13:50:00] <Quxxy> Compile-time parsing?
[13:50:20] <Tiffany> oh yeah, D has functions that run at compile time
[13:50:23] <benh> Nemerle probably also did that sort of thing
[13:50:28] * Quxxy wrote an article on that for D
[13:50:47] <Tiffany> I suppose rust macros will get you somewhere
[13:50:55] <Tiffany> I'm not sure if you can actually parse SQL with them
[13:50:55] <eddyb> Tiffany: or `const fn`
[13:51:09] <eddyb> Tiffany: with syntax extensions you can validate and compile SQL :P
[13:51:20] <Tiffany> I suppose
[13:51:24] <Tiffany> those would also be lessu gly
[13:51:29] <mrmonday> can I read about const fn somewhere? I keep seeing people mention it, but I haven't actually seen any kind of specification for it
[13:51:30] <benh> only if your build system has the password for your database server :(
[13:51:50] <eddyb> mrmonday: it's just `const` with arguments
[13:51:51] <mrmonday> eddyb: syntax extensions are rubbish though :(
[13:52:04] <eddyb> Tiffany: sfackler's postgres crate does something like it
[13:52:08] <eddyb> not sure what exactly though
[13:52:13] <WindowsBunny> with syntax extensions you can run a linux VM, build rust from source, run some code on that rust, then extract it from the VM and expand the invocation to the output from the VM
[13:52:29] <Tiffany> it's kind of necessary for sqlite
[13:52:38] <Tiffany> because sqlite doesn't have reasonable error messages
[13:52:39] <mrmonday> hmm, maybe I should write up an article about my experiences with syntax extensions/why they're rubbish
[13:52:53] <eddyb> mrmonday: oh the current state of implementation details is somewhat rubbish
[13:52:55] <Tiffany> you'll get "syntax error" or "constraint error" but have fun figuring where they came from
[13:52:57] <benh> WindowsBunny: ... the "run a vm in syntax extensions" thing seems like a novel approach to cross-compilation
[13:53:05] <Tiffany> the sqlite client somehow has better error messages, but I don't know how
[13:53:11] <eddyb> mrmonday: mostly because we haven't gotten stuff like quasi-quoting down
[13:53:11] <Tiffany> I assume it pokes around at undocumented internals
[13:53:18] <eddyb> mrmonday: and into the best shape possible
[13:53:26] <WindowsBunny> benh: You should totally try it and write a paper on it :D
[13:53:28] <eddyb> it's one of the things I've wanted to work on
[13:53:30] <WindowsBunny> Maybe even get it published
[13:53:35] <eddyb> but I keep wasting time
[13:53:36] <mrmonday> eddyb: I won't be happy until I've got type information... but it doesn't look like that's gonna happen :(
[13:53:46] <eddyb> graduating highschool, exams, crap like that
[13:53:52] <eddyb> and now I'm frying
[13:53:59] <mrmonday> currently I have to add lots of hacks to work around the lack of type info
[13:54:02] <eddyb> mrmonday: that's not what syntax extensions are for
[13:54:12] <eddyb> you want to work on a MIR
[13:54:44] <eddyb> lints actually are pretty nice in that regard
[13:55:00] <eddyb> I got a good look at this recently https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/librustc_lint/builtin.rs#L1867
[13:55:12] <benh> What's a MIR
[13:55:18] <eddyb> benh: mid-level IR
[13:55:27] <mrmonday> I've not played with lints fully yet, I believe they should have all the info I neeed... but I can't do codegen based on lints unfortunately
[13:55:31] <eddyb> yeah
[13:55:50] <eddyb> I kinda wonder what could be done to simplify that CFG visiting loop
[13:56:06] <eddyb> it's pretty simple, though
[13:56:08] <mrmonday> https://github.com/libpnet/libpnet/blob/master/src/packet/ipv6.rs#L17 <= this is the kind of thing I'm doing
[13:56:20] <mrmonday> automatically generating a zero copy parser for network packets
[13:56:33] <mrmonday> but due to lack of type info I have to add extra annotations, I can't just look at the type
[13:56:59] <mrmonday> and there are quite a few places where I have to make assumptions based on the name of the type, rather than checking it's actually the right type
[13:57:10] <eddyb> oi
[13:57:19] <eddyb> I have some ideas for zero-copy parsers
[13:57:29] <eddyb> with the same problems
[13:58:00] <eddyb> mrmonday: I thought I could use trait impls to handle cases like your source and destination
[13:58:10] <eddyb> also, payload isn't zero-copy :P
[13:58:19] <mrmonday> yeah it is
[13:58:22] <eddyb> huh
[13:58:25] <mrmonday> that thing is just a description
[13:58:31] <eddyb> then why not [u8]?
[13:58:45] <eddyb> that's what I would use
[13:59:00] <mrmonday> I tried that, it didn't work out for lots of reasons, and ultimately doesn't matter
[13:59:04] <eddyb> hmm
[13:59:17] <eddyb> mrmonday: if you're not using it as a type and just matching on it, I don't see why it can't work
[13:59:20] <mrmonday> eddyb: http://octarineparrot.com/assets/libpnet/doc/pnet_macros/index.html <= list of stuff that's generated is there
[14:00:27] <mrmonday> [also, pull requests are welcome, for anyone wanting to do zero-copy parsing... it's not just for network packets, that's just wha tI've focussed on :)]
[14:01:20] <eddyb> it looks really good, actually
[14:01:29] <eddyb> what I want to do cannot use Rust types though
[14:01:33] <mrmonday> eddyb: actually, iirc, the reason it doesn't work with[u8] is lack of type info :p
[14:01:40] <eddyb> and attributes are too heavy
[14:01:52] <eddyb> mrmonday: what I meant is match on syntactical [T]
[14:01:54] <mrmonday> I can't differentiate between it and some other use case
[14:02:18] <eddyb> but it wouldn't work with aliases or anything like that
[14:02:45] <eddyb> (in my case, [T] wouldn't mean Rust [T], but rather a random access iterator of sequential T values)
[14:02:59] <eddyb> mrmonday: I should write the ELF 1.0 spec and show you what I mean
[14:03:06] <eddyb> has been on my mind for months now
[14:03:13] <Tiffany> I'm not entirely sure how powerful rust macros are
[14:03:21] <eddyb> macro_rules?
[14:03:23] <Tiffany> I know syntax extensions can do pretty much anything
[14:03:24] <Tiffany> yeah
[14:03:33] <eddyb> turing-complete
[14:03:44] <Tiffany> are they a turing tarpit though?
[14:03:48] <eddyb> with TCO they could execute, e.g. arbitrary brainfuck
[14:03:57] <mrmonday> I actually generate iterators for the Vec<Whatever> stuff so that you can avoid copying stuff :p
[14:04:01] <Tiffany> can you do string operations needed for parsing?
[14:04:14] <eddyb> Tiffany: no, you work on tokens
[14:04:35] <eddyb> you could have a syntax extension take a lexer description and a string and produce Rust tokens :P
[14:05:04] <Tiffany> but you can branch on tokens, right?
[14:05:12] <eddyb> more or less, yeah
[14:05:20] <eddyb> you can't branch on exact token types, except for a few things
[14:05:24] <eddyb> but you can match literal tokens
[14:05:26] <mrmonday> eddyb: just glanced at the file header for elf, should be super easy to write a parser for it with pnet_macros
[14:05:27] <Tiffany> I think that's enough to implement compile-time SQL
[14:05:33] <eddyb> oh dear
[14:05:37] <mrmonday> doesn't look like there's anything too fancy in there
[14:05:41] <eddyb> Quxxy: look at Tiffany
[14:06:05] <eddyb> Tiffany: have you heard the story of the Hodor! macro that took two days to execute and still ended up in a stack overflow?

[14:06:51] <mrmonday> e_entry/e_phoff/e_eshoff might be interesting actually, not sure what the best way to handle them would be
[14:06:58] <eddyb> so you're limited by recursion
[14:07:05] <Quxxy> I had the idea, Manishearth wrote the first macro compiler, I wrote the second, more complete one, and he wrote the brainfuck interpreter in it
[14:07:21] <eddyb> mrmonday: mhmm
[14:07:33] <Quxxy> After two days of running, his interpreter crashed with a stack overflow, having produced no output at all
[14:07:39] <eddyb> mrmonday: assume non-contiguous and provide sugar for contiguous
[14:08:16] <Quxxy> I have looked into the abyss, and saw myself

[14:10:04] <mrmonday> eddyb: I haven't had a chance yet, I've been wanting to build up a comprehensive library of packet types though and fill in the missing gaps in terms of functionality
[14:10:18] <mrmonday> I believe it can handle everything right now, it's just that it might be... a little ugly
[14:10:40] <eddyb> mrmonday: be thankful (if) you don't need absolute/relative positioning
[14:10:44] <mrmonday> actually, it can't handle fields which are defined to be at the end of the buffer, wherever that may be
[14:10:51] <eddyb> hehehe
[14:11:16] <mrmonday> actually, it might be able to now, with some of the recent changes...
[14:11:44] <eddyb> btw you can use associated types

[14:21:42] <Tiffany> they use single-letter identifiers and nonsense words almost exclusively

[14:27:32] <Tiffany> nested ternary, you say

[14:28:16] <benh> noice
[14:28:23] <fkaa> ?_?
[14:28:42] <mrmonday> I'm not looking forward to getting a job and finding code like this
[14:28:49] <benh> I like how it gracefully degrades to vertical string literals as it moves up against the column limit
[14:29:03] <Tiffany> I think clang-format can be blamed for that, benh
[14:29:04] <mrmonday> all my previous jobs I've started code from scratch, or had minimal interaction with existing codebases
[14:29:05] <WindowsBunny> before I actually go to sleep
[14:29:13] <benh> also those parens are superfluous, aren't they
[14:29:14] <WindowsBunny> Tiffany: I raise your ternaries with my ternaries
[14:29:15] <WindowsBunny> https://github.com/NoLifeDev/NoLifeStory/blob/master/src/client/physics.cpp#L122-L169
[14:29:53] <Tiffany> I had to run clang-format on this codebase before I could start working on it
[14:29:55] <Tiffany> it was too painful
[14:30:09] <Tiffany> there were places where they started back-indenting because there was too much rightward drift
[14:30:15] <mrmonday> I can't even remember the precedence for ternary these days
[14:30:22] <mrmonday> makes reading nested impossible
[14:30:31] <benh> it usually does the right thing for chaining
[14:31:23] <Tiffany> there was whitespace at the end of lines, DOS newlines, inconsistent indentation in the same file
[14:31:40] <mrmonday> benh: the right thing is a compile error telling the programmer to reconsider their career :<
[14:31:42] <Tiffany> there was this one function that had a combination of 3 width spaces, 4 width spaces, 8 width spaces, and tabs which were supposed to be 8 wide
[14:32:21] <mrmonday> I've written some horrible code, but I don't get how that happens Tiffany 
[14:32:27] <mrmonday> I've seen it a lot
[14:32:38] <mrmonday> even when sleep deprived I manage to get indentation right
[14:32:48] <mrmonday> it's probably the only thing that reminds vaguely right
[14:32:50] <Tiffany> it's what happen when you have 20 sequential maintainers and none of which use the same editor and none of which ever got past the beginner stage of knowing how to program
[14:32:52] <mrmonday> but still
[14:33:02] <benh> we're using three spaces for indentation here, but apparently the delphi-generated code is generated with two spaces, and afaict it's not part of the style to change it
[14:33:13] <Tiffany> I think I am the second developer on this project to use an editor which actually does indentation automatically
[14:33:30] <mrmonday> o.o
[14:34:13] <Tiffany> emacs is usually pretty good at figuring out which indentation to use
[14:34:18] <Tiffany> except on struct and array literals
[14:34:51] <Tiffany> I think it parses them as code blocks
[14:34:54] <mrmonday> vim tends to get it right, until I've fucked it myself and it has no idea what's going on
[14:35:08] <mrmonday> that usually only happens when I use weird languages though
[14:35:28] <Tiffany> the indentation is not as good outside C/C++ yeah
[14:35:38] <Tiffany> there is some indentation support for rust
[14:35:58] <Tiffany> there's this weird "cycle tab to find the appropriate indentation level" for things with significant whitespace
[14:36:06] <fmtq> how can emacs not have it perfect by now
[14:36:07] <fmtq> it's 2015
[14:36:39] <Tiffany> it's because stallman doesn't want gcc to expose something akin to libclang, because he's afraid of companies using it to build proprietary compiles off gcc
[14:37:00] <Tiffany> and as a result, emacs doesn't have native support for fully parsing C/C++
[14:37:00] <mrmonday> I thought they'd got around that issue?
[14:37:18] <Tiffany> maybe they have, but I haven't seen any of it
[14:37:20] <mrmonday> or at least come to some kind of middle ground?
[14:37:25] <benh> they could just use libclang tho
[14:37:37] <Tiffany> the auto completion plugin I use uses clang
[14:37:54] <Tiffany> I'm not sure if you can actually use libclang for figuring out which indentation to use
[14:40:56] <benh> I'm still basically mystified that it's possible to use a compiler frontend for suggestions has to how to complete a program that doesn't currently parse
[14:41:37] <Tiffany> well, I think it tries to ignore some parts, and it also probably caches results for when the current file is totally borked
[14:41:56] <Tiffany> the unfortunate thing is that it's really slow
[14:42:03] <Tiffany> maybe if I had a better CPU it would work better
[14:42:06] <eddyb> I actually did tha thing in rid3
[14:42:10] <eddyb> though line-based
[14:42:13] <Tiffany> I mainly use auto complete for when I forget the name of a method
[14:42:20] <proc> it's a black box making strange noises, pray for it :D
[14:42:39] <eddyb> if you broke the compile, known types before and after the modified section would still be used
[14:42:50] <Tiffany> I can just hit ctrl+tab and get a list of all the methods in the object to the left of my cursor

[14:43:35] <proc> I've still my pre-1.0 program running till now :D
[14:43:46] <Tiffany> oh, I'm talking about C/C++
[14:43:47] <proc> and I'm planning to upgrade it to 1.1 now as I've more time
[14:43:52] <Tiffany> I don't know of any rust autocompletion
[14:44:01] <proc> I know, was switching the theme, sry
[14:44:16] <proc> eh, I'll try out the eclipse thing, while it's really slow in the VM..
[14:46:04] <Tiffany> rust autocompletion may actually work better
[14:46:26] <Tiffany> the language is a lot faster to parse, and more things are traits
[14:46:50] <Tiffany> I wonder how hard it would be to add librustc integration to company-mode
[14:47:30] <eddyb> fwiw, this is my code https://github.com/eddyb/r3/blob/master/src/ide/rustc.rs
[14:47:46] <benh> I wonder if the rust syntax is simple enough that you'd be better off writing your own parser that's better integrated with what you already have rather than adapting libsyntax
[14:47:53] <eddyb> and this is the part that can be used to query types https://github.com/eddyb/r3/blob/master/src/ide/rustc.rs#L233
[14:47:59] <eddyb> benh: hahaha but that's pointless
[14:48:06] <eddyb> you don't get very far with just syntax
[14:48:14] <eddyb> you need types and that's not trivial

[15:04:08] <proc> in fact a whole company specialized on that
[15:04:13] <Tiffany> I imagine it doesn't improve performance at all
[15:04:28] <eddyb> refcounting?
[15:04:29] <proc> would agree on that
[15:04:33] <eddyb> boehm?
[15:04:38] <Tiffany> cache locality, GC
[15:04:39] <proc> sec
[15:04:46] <proc> c++ with gc ;)
[15:04:52] <proc> CGC++
[15:04:56] <eddyb> proc: that's not saying much at all
[15:04:58] <Tiffany> that really bothers me
[15:05:07] <eddyb> unless CGC++ is a thing
[15:05:08] <Tiffany> unreal is kind of self defeating
[15:05:15] <Tiffany> it uses a GC and is heavily OOP
[15:05:19] <Tiffany> so like, why use C++
[15:05:23] <proc> that was a joke
[15:05:31] <eddyb> Tiffany: at this point, C# or Swift
[15:05:35] <eddyb> and don't look back
[15:05:42] <eddyb> if you want GC
[15:05:51] <Tiffany> unity uses C#
[15:06:02] <proc> well java is still too much in use for financial systems
[15:06:03] <eddyb> maybe Julia for some scientific applications, I don't know
[15:06:25] <Tiffany> I like julia
[15:06:58] <Tiffany> but yeah
[15:07:12] <Tiffany> minecraft has a GC throughput measured in the hundreds of megabytes per second
[15:07:17] <Tiffany> compiling to C++ wouldn't change that
[15:07:20] <proc> still searching for the real company, but look at that.. https://code.google.com/a/eclipselabs.org/p/j2c/
[15:07:27] <Tiffany> although, it would provide the ability to eliminate it
[15:07:32] <Tiffany> they wouldn't have to heap allocate Vec3 anymore
[15:08:09] <eddyb> Tiffany: C# would let it do that
[15:08:13] <proc> AH found it http://www.excelsiorjet.com/
[15:08:17] <eddyb> or Java... 9?
[15:08:17] <Tiffany> yeah
[15:08:29] <fkaa> unity does il2cpp though
[15:08:36] <Tiffany> some upcoming (or available now?) version of java has immutable classes which are really limited
[15:08:44] <Tiffany> and C# has structs
[15:08:58] <Tiffany> both are kind of bad, they pretty much only work for Vec3 classes and the like
[15:09:09] <eddyb> proc: I'm seeing a lot of marketing BS there
[15:09:11] <eddyb> nothing too concrete
[15:09:19] <proc> ofc.. http://www.excelsior-usa.com/pdf/jet-1050-datasheet.pdf
[15:09:22] <fkaa> java doesn't have value types yet
[15:09:22] <eddyb> buzzword soup
[15:09:24] <proc> looking at that atm
[15:09:33] <eddyb> proc: oh that sounds more promising
[15:09:34] <fkaa> maybe in java n+2
[15:09:38] <Tiffany> excelsior JET is kind of neat
[15:09:49] <Tiffany> they don't compile java to C++ though do they
[15:09:54] <eddyb> nope not really
[15:09:55] <Tiffany> I thought they went straight to machine code
[15:10:02] <eddyb> I mean nope at the PDF
[15:10:18] <proc> os-optimized binary if you're trusting the data sheet (which lacs a lot of information )
[15:10:40] <Tiffany> this is not a data sheet
[15:10:47] <proc> but they seem to really compile it to machine code and simply replace the java API with and own version of it
[15:10:58] <Tiffany> it's an advertisement in the form of bullet points
[15:11:15] <proc> ..
[15:11:23] <eddyb> Tiffany: were you around last night when the whole HackingTeam thing went down?
[15:11:28] <Tiffany> yeah
[15:11:29] <proc> "the pdf called datasheet"
[15:11:49] <Tiffany> I saw you complaining about it being almost 400 gigabytes
[15:11:49] <eddyb>             177328.2 / 396507.3 MB Rate: 7592.8 / 4798.8 KB Uploaded: 237301.8 MB [44%]  0d 12:59 [   R: 1.34]
[15:12:06] <Tiffany> wow your internet is fast
[15:12:24] <eddyb> 5MB/s is like half of what it can do
[15:12:36] <proc> :( that's my conn
[15:12:37] <eddyb> but inter-state is not great
[15:12:46] <Tiffany> the best I've ever gotten in rtorrent was like under 300
[15:12:51] <proc> and I'm proud of it, had a 250kb limit till last year
[15:13:09] <proc> and before that for 7 years 46kbyte/s
[15:13:14] <eddyb> Tiffany: it maxes around 10-12MB/s when someone else in Bucharest has the torrent
[15:13:20] <niconii> my connection's about 1 MB/s
[15:13:41] <niconii> used to be like 25 KB/s...
[15:13:41] <Tiffany> my issues are all between the router and the local DSLAM
[15:13:53] <niconii> the jump between the two was kind of a huge shock tbh
[15:14:06] <Tiffany> the only way to get faster internet would be for them to put in a box which isn't so far away
[15:14:15] <Tiffany> the further you are from the DSLAM, the lower the speeds you get
[15:14:34] <niconii> suddenly i could actually download a 1 GB file in about 20 minutes instead of like
[15:15:13] <niconii> ...12 hours.
[15:15:31] <proc> but you're getting used to it too fast is my experience
[15:15:38] <niconii> yeah
[15:15:38] <proc> then you're back to bragging about the speed
[15:15:39] <proc> :D
[15:15:57] <niconii> unfortunately humanity is very good at adapting
[15:16:05] <niconii> and then wanting even more speed...
[15:16:37] <eddyb> 10Gbps would be nice
[15:16:37] <delma> well I have 100/10 cable modem...
[15:16:43] <proc> it was very easy to detect a speed problem from the ISP with the old 56-250 KB
[15:16:44] <delma> and it's too slow
[15:16:54] <eddyb> I could download all of this in less than 10 minutes
[15:17:04] <Tiffany> it takes me hours to download stuff and a lot of games are really painful to play online because of the lag
[15:17:22] <proc> know that..
[15:17:27] <niconii> anyway, i'm really glad i got a decent connection before web sites started packing megabytes of shit in them
[15:17:31] <Tiffany> I have worse lag to US servers than people in europe
[15:17:43] <eddyb> Tiffany: move to Europe!
[15:17:49] <proc> 300MS ping when I'm talking over teamspeak, that where funny days
[15:18:08] <niconii> oh god, yeah, i remember having awful ping
[15:18:38] <proc> but with the 5mb/s: only steam can really deliver it over a bigger time is my experience
[15:18:41] <niconii> 250ms was the average for me when it came to playing tf2
[15:18:55] <proc> most other servers are going down after some time or never even reaching it
[15:19:04] <niconii> awful lag was just a fact of life
[15:19:17] <proc> niconii: you where hating the lag & the others hated you for walling ;)
[15:19:29] <niconii> proc: pretty much :)
[15:21:37] <proc> hehe some guys where complaing about the lack of linux support of the HackingTeam software
[15:21:44] <proc> *complaining
[15:21:49] <niconii> the strange thing is that i got this weird sense of pride about having such a shitty connection
[15:22:06] <proc> I know that..
[15:22:07] <niconii> like "ha, you think *your* connection sucks? well, mine is *worse*, so *there*!"
[15:22:11] <eddyb> opression pride?
[15:22:43] <eddyb> wrong word though
[15:22:48] <niconii> "you kids don't know how good you've got it! back in *my* day, we had to download files uphill both ways!"
[15:22:57] <eddyb> lel
[15:23:17] <proc> "send me dvd or usb stick, that's faster"
[15:23:29] <eddyb> proc: nope
[15:23:40] <eddyb> proc: https://what-if.xkcd.com/31/
[15:23:49] <proc> oh no.. here it goes
[15:25:09] <niconii> eddyb: ...where's the "nope" here
[15:25:21] <proc> searching for that too
[15:25:35] <Tiffany> humble bragging, niconii
[15:25:36] <eddyb> niconii: μSD cards
[15:25:45] <proc> prob. about transfer time - size relation or so
[15:26:38] <niconii> eddyb: i still don't see where the "nope" comes into that
[15:26:47] <eddyb> well
[15:27:03] <eddyb> niconii: "nope, you don't want to use those, you want microSD cards instead"
[15:27:04] <proc> there's none..
[15:27:10] <proc> ah k
[15:27:14] <niconii> ahh
[15:27:19] <proc> but I would a reader for them..
[15:27:24] <eddyb> brevity, ikr?
[15:27:25] <proc> and the cards
[15:27:52] <proc> and if I send my phone (with it's micro-sd card & USB) ?
[15:27:57] <niconii> honestly, though, even one dvd would be plenty fast
[15:28:09] <proc> blue ray..
[15:28:11] <niconii> as long as it showed up within five days, it'd be faster than my connection used to be
[15:28:57] <niconii> for a blu-ray, it just needs to show up within a month...
[15:29:06] <niconii> two months for dual-layer...
[15:29:41] <proc> well the german telekomm doesn't want to give out glass fibre
[15:30:01] <proc> they're bumping rather even more into the old cable
[15:30:26] <niconii> i'm not even sure how i lived with that connection for so long
[15:30:32] <proc> so you're getting 100MB/s with a limit of 300M distance to the street box
[15:30:49] <proc> niconii: disabling javascript & picture loading ?
[15:31:21] <niconii> nah, i never resorted to that
[15:31:35] <niconii> i'd probably *have* to, with today's web
[15:33:40] <Tiffany> I actually had to suffer through web 2.0 on dialup
[15:34:08] <Tiffany> if the site didn't set a timeout on connections (many webservers will just close a connection after 5 minutes or less), then I would be able to load the site
[15:34:12] <Tiffany> but it would take upwards of half an hour
[15:34:29] <Tiffany> half an hour to download all the html, javascript, css, and images
[15:34:37] <niconii> eesh
[15:35:41] <Tiffany> that was in 2007 too
[15:35:47] <Tiffany> back before css was as powerful as it is now
[15:35:53] <Tiffany> rounded corners, drop shadows, all that
[15:35:56] <Tiffany> it was implemented with images
[15:35:58] <Tiffany> instead of css
[15:36:54] <niconii> anyway, one thing that hasn't really changed since my days of shitty internet is my distaste for bloat and large file sizes
[15:37:28] <Tiffany> there is one flaw with fedexnet
[15:37:32] <Tiffany> I can't get steam games over it
[15:38:02] <eddyb> I have a solution :P
[15:38:08] <eddyb> make steam use Nix
[15:38:13] <Tiffany> gamestop could probably save their business by offering a service where you bring in an SSD or high-capacity flash drive and download your games over a very fast internet connection with a large cache
[15:38:54] <Tiffany> or even just rent SSDs that already contain the games on them
[15:39:03] <eddyb> (with nix-store you can "precache" entries any way you like)
[15:39:44] <Tiffany> it's a lot faster to drive down to the mall than it is to wait 18 hours to download a 10 gigabyte game
[15:39:47] <Tiffany> for me, anyway
[15:40:06] <Mutabah> Tiffany: That would be interesting actually
[15:40:15] <Tiffany> it's pretty ridiculous
[15:40:19] <Tiffany> I bought portal 2 at gamestop
[15:40:23] <Mutabah> Wouldn't really need to be downloaded either, as they could cache them
[15:40:34] <Tiffany> but it turned out the disk contained nothing but a steam installer and the CD key to be inserted into steam
[15:40:38] <Tiffany> it didn't contain the actual files of the game
[15:40:54] <niconii> wow.

[15:46:21] <proc> great now I'm browsing more xkcd -.-
[15:47:50] <niconii> now i'm just imagining, like, an SCP object

[15:49:30] <Tiffany> my relatives have bought several of those, niconii
[15:49:38] <Tiffany> usually it works like this
[15:50:07] <Tiffany> the box has like a knockoff of a classic game from the 80s, to give it appeal, and then there's the logic that it's a good deal because it has "10 000 games"
[15:50:20] <Tiffany> but then you buy it, and you find out they consider individual levels as entire "games"
[15:50:50] <Tiffany> so you have like this combinatorial explosion of difficulty levels, map layouts, and game rule tweaks leading to 5000 different "games" of breakout
[15:50:57] <Tiffany> and so on
[15:51:11] <niconii> nice
[15:51:12] <Tiffany> they're usually jammed full of adware and malware too
[15:51:50] <niconii> at least it's marginally better than how the nes bootleg equivalents tended to do things
[15:52:05] <niconii> (though they tended to shoot for lower, like 100 games in 1 or whatever)
[15:52:16] <Tiffany> oh man
[15:52:21] <Tiffany> how did they do it?
[15:52:23] <niconii> where there'd be some games that are literally just the same
[15:52:27] <Tiffany> hahaha
[15:52:34] <niconii> like multiple menu items would start the same game
[15:52:39] <Tiffany> yeah, there are duplicates in these too
[15:53:08] <niconii> the "each level is a game" thing happened sometimes too
[15:53:40] <niconii> other times they just didn't give a shit and didn't even bother actually having that many items in the menu
[15:53:48] <Tiffany> hah
[15:54:09] <eddyb> this reminds me of the popstation
[15:54:21] <niconii> and of course, they usually didn't bother actually making their own games, they'd just steal others and like
[15:54:27] <niconii> make one of the sprites mario or whatever

[15:54:50] <niconii> or just steal the game, who the fuck has time to edit a sprite
[15:55:05] <delma> Why they didn't claim having infinite games and just rnadom gen levels? :pr
[15:55:13] <eddyb> this was the last episode https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMtBZrDY814
[15:55:21] <eddyb> delma: because PRNGs are complicated
[15:55:33] <niconii> delma: well, that means they'd have to figure out how to randomly generate shit
[15:55:43] <niconii> delma: on the nes, that means making the random generator yourself
[15:55:45] <eddyb> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAnNzWB-4zY omg
[15:55:59] <niconii> delma: and who wants to bother with that when you can just make a quick buck
[15:56:17] <Tiffany> I think I've seen one which did claim to have infinite games, delma
[15:56:18] <niconii> delma: more likely they'd just *say* they have infinite games
[15:56:22] <Tiffany> there have been ones with a million games, anyway
[15:56:35] <Tiffany> same thing, if you go by roman numerals
[15:56:54] <delma> xD
[15:57:21] <Tiffany> now I'm trying to see if I am wrong about that
[15:57:24] <niconii> anyway, i said most didn't bother making their own games but
[15:57:45] <niconii> there was *one*... one specific set of games that comes to mind...
[15:57:58] <niconii> a little, uh, "gem" called action 52
[15:58:26] <eddyb> https://www.youtube.com/user/ashens/search?query=pop+station
[15:58:30] <eddyb> these are all fun
[15:58:33] <eddyb> if you can stand them

[15:59:13] <eddyb> > PCP
[15:59:24] <eddyb> that name
[15:59:54] <niconii> rather than steal other games, action 52 was basically an attempt to make a shitty nes bootleg many-games-in-one thing, minus the bootleg
[16:00:13] <niconii> so they just shat out 52 awful games instead
[16:00:34] <niconii> a handful of them just crash the nes
[16:00:56] <niconii> and then there's
[16:01:01] <niconii> the cheetahmen games
[16:01:08] <niconii> well
[16:01:18] <niconii> "games"
[16:01:37] <niconii> they basically did the whole "each level is a separate game" thing
[16:01:58] <niconii> except they sorta *were* separate games because
[16:02:06] <niconii> none of them actually shared the same engine
[16:02:30] <niconii> anyway, this was like, the focal point of action 52
[16:02:52] <niconii> because the dude behind the thing thought it was going to be a massive hit
[16:03:18] <niconii> like the guy wanted to make action figures, t-shirts, a cartoon
[16:03:48] <niconii> of course, the games are complete garbage
[16:04:05] <niconii> except for one thing
[16:04:37] <eddyb> OMG
[16:04:37] <niconii> *somehow*... cheetahmen ii's theme became a classic

[18:33:22] <zofrex> language theory question
[18:33:45] <zofrex> in some languages, eg Ruby, you can declare a variable inside an if block, and then use it outside the if block afterwards
[18:33:48] <zofrex> in other languages you can't
[18:33:50] <zofrex> what's that called?
[18:34:21] <Tiffany> it's called not having lexical scoping and is a horrible crime
[18:35:58] <zofrex> but Ruby does have lexical scoping, I think?
[18:36:14] <Tiffany> I don't know about ruby
[18:36:16] <eddyb> JS doesn't
[18:36:20] <Tiffany> but in lua, variables are global by default
[18:36:21] <eddyb> not in ES5
[18:36:24] <eddyb> Tiffany: LOL
[18:36:28] <zofrex> just in this case, inside an 'if block', a 'var = 3' statement is sending the message 'var' to 'self' which is outside the if block
[18:36:29] <Tiffany> and the local keyword is opt-in lexical scoping
[18:36:43] <eddyb> zofrex: that's not a variable
[18:36:44] <eddyb> that's a field
[18:36:52] <zofrex> ah, so if this was inside a method for example, it WOULD be limited to use within that method
[18:36:52] <eddyb> except with Smalltalk lingo
[18:36:55] <zofrex> in Ruby
[18:37:14] <zofrex> eddyb: I think technically all variables in Ruby are fields on *something*, maybe?
[18:37:18] <eddyb> wat
[18:37:27] <eddyb> I thought Smalltalk wasn't *that* crazy
[18:37:32] <eddyb> or did Ruby just go nuts
[18:38:12] <eddyb> oh it doesn't have variable declarations
[18:38:57] <eddyb> so @foo is self.field
[18:39:34] <eddyb> Local variables begin with a lowercase letter or _. The scope of a local variable ranges from class, module, def, or do to the corresponding end or from a block's opening brace to its close brace {}.
[18:39:36] <zofrex> I know if you do @foo in a method, foo is a field on the object that method belongs to, but "var foo" in a method would not be a field on that object
[18:40:04] <eddyb> zofrex: so Ruby has lexical scoping
[18:40:10] <zofrex> yes
[18:40:19] <zofrex> I said that!
[18:40:40] <eddyb> > [21:36] <zofrex> just in this case, inside an 'if block', a 'var = 3' statement is sending the message 'var' to 'self' which is outside the if block
[18:40:43] <eddyb> it's not sending anything
[18:41:06] <eddyb> @var = 3, sure
[18:41:26] <zofrex> ok so is the answer to this "variables are scoped to blocks, but an if statement doesn't count as a block"?
[18:41:46] <eddyb> zofrex: is the variable assigned before the if block?
[18:41:53] <eddyb> a variable with the same name, I mean
[18:42:11] <eddyb> maybe "block" in Ruby is "closure"
[18:42:18] <eddyb> I forget how that went
[18:43:09] <zofrex> no, the variable is created only inside the if block
[18:45:06] <zofrex> ugh I'm so confused. I think I'm just gonna memorise the special case and chalk it up to "ruby is weird"

[21:44:28] <Layl> it seems my mistake was that I did -o and not -O
[21:46:08] <Layl> huh actually I needed -P
[21:46:15] <Tiffany> -o is such a nonsense option
[21:46:31] <ogham> yeah, I get bitten by -o every frickin' time.
[21:46:37] <Layl> blimey
[21:46:40] <Tiffany> why would the default be the log file
[21:46:41] <Layl> powershell does not like wget
[21:46:48] <ogham> -o just looks like the standard "output" param
[21:47:22] <ogham> curl is usually nicer in that regard
[21:47:54] <Layl> can I change the way wget outputs so it won't do this: http://i.imgur.com/1RHurzi.png

[22:15:05] <zofrex> Astraea: if you like your current macbook and you like OSX then I'd recommend a newer macbook, tbh
[22:15:36] <zofrex> they're very nice. it's our standard engineer laptop.
[22:16:15] <fkaa> i'm growing less fond of apple software
[22:17:47] <Astraea> zofrex: well the MacBook pros have ssds which are expensive (it's not in the m.2 form factor either iirc) and the ram is soldered in. I like having the ability to upgrade both myself, which is why I'm looking around this time
[22:18:09] <zofrex> ah
[22:18:21] <zofrex> fair enough. I don't really care that they're soldered in as long as they don't break
[22:18:38] <zofrex> I'd -1 the thinkpad, btw. that company has done some shady shit recently, they're not the same as they used to be imo
[22:18:49] <zofrex> (the thinkpads that is. maybe lenovo have been evil this whole time, I dunno)

[22:23:36] <Astraea> Also, what's the difference between the new MacBooks and MacBook airs. It seems like they should just merge those two product lines
[22:24:28] <ijks> speaking of laptops, can anyone recommend a good laptop for a CS student? was thinking about buying a thinkpad actually, but it seemed like they didn't have much models with a discrete GPU (which I probably need)
[22:25:20] <ijks> oh and good (Arch) linux compat would be nice too
[22:25:41] <ytain> ijks what's your budget?
[22:26:18] <Layl> reminds me I should get a new laptop for the next school year
[22:26:30] <ijks> eh, somewhere around €1000 but I'm willing to go somewhat higher
[22:26:47] <ytain> ijks you can look at Asus ROG laptops
[22:26:57] <ijks> thx, i will
[22:26:58] <ytain> they have discrete GPUs

[22:36:58] <Elaine> yes
[22:37:36] <ytain> I disable the trackpads
[22:37:43] <ytain> because it interferes with my typing
[22:37:59] <Elaine> had I not bought this a few months earlier I would have gotten the new MacBook.
[22:38:07] <Astraea> I would on most laptops, they're great on apple laptops though
[22:38:25] <Astraea> The new MacBook looks under powered.
[22:38:31] <Astraea> Pretty tho
[22:38:38] <Elaine> My laptop is primarily an ssh client.
[22:38:41] <Elaine> :P
[22:39:06] <ytain> you can use an n atom laptop as a ssh client
[22:39:13] <ytain> or even a cheap chromebook
[22:39:37] <mbrubeck> Marco didn't like the new MacBook (esp. the keyboard and trackpad). http://www.marco.org/2015/05/19/mistake-one
[22:39:57] <mbrubeck> It seems like a very "1.0" product, which explains why they haven't replaced the MacBook Air range yet.
[22:39:58] *** Quits: yjv (yjv@moz-ll38tk.pa.comcast.net) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[22:40:18] <mbrubeck> I assume they'll phase out the Air over the next couple of years.
[22:40:23] <Elaine> Yeah the keyboard is what I'm most hesitant about.

[22:41:00] <Elaine> mbrubeck: Nice review, good to see.
[22:45:23] <Astraea> Doesn't the MacBook Pro update have the new haptic feedback trackpad as well, or is that just a MacBook feature
[22:46:08] <mbrubeck> Astraea: Yes, the new Pros have it too.
[22:47:01] <brandonson> on the topic of laptops, what's a good-sized one with decent linux compat?  I could always get a chromebook and just ssh out I suppose, but... meh, annoying while traveling or anything like that.
[22:47:21] <brandonson> Biggest issue is screen-size - my surface is too small for programming :/
[22:47:47] <Astraea> If I get the MacBook Pro it's going to be like $2000 for the smaller version, ugh
[22:47:54] <Elaine> brandonson: I have an Asus UX303LN
[22:48:01] <Elaine> which I enjoy very much
[22:48:41] <Astraea> Apples are overpriced, but I got around it by replacing components myself, lol
[22:49:45] <mbrubeck> brandonson: I'm quite fond of the ThinkPad X1 Carbon, if you're willing to pay "ultrabook" prices in return for extra thinness/lightness
[22:50:07] <brandonson> Elaine: wow, that thing is almost killing my desktop on specs.  Sheesh.
[22:50:32] <Elaine> yeah, the X1 Carbon's are sweet.
[22:50:36] <mbrubeck> Dell's new Ubuntu laptop looks fairly nice too. http://www.dell.com/us/business/p/xps-13-linux/pd
[22:51:19] <brandonson> that said, I probably should've mentioned I don't really need much in the way of power
[22:51:31] <brandonson> so these are probably overkill haha
[22:51:51] <Elaine> Oh, on the cheaper end there are plenty of great options.

[23:35:05] <Elaine> Haskell's unsafe surface is surprisingly large.

[23:40:39] <Elaine> brson: that sucks.
[23:40:43] <brson> i'm pretty brutal on my laptops i guess
[23:40:58] <mbrubeck> Ouch.  I'm still using my 2013 (I think?) model
[23:41:17] <mbrubeck> but it mostly just sits on my desk all day
[23:41:28] <Elaine> bstrie: Gankro: there's also Safe Haskell, in comparison.
[23:41:29] <brandonson> Elaine: my take-away from that is mostly 'don't use exceptions'
[23:41:38] <brandonson> (the haskell link)
[23:41:52] <Elaine> brandonson: the first paragraph briefly mentions some other unsafeties.
[23:42:00] <bstrie> so granted that I don't really know anything about hardware, but if I were buying a laptop I'd wait until intel comes out with skylake later this year
[23:42:06] <ijks> wait, wait, Haskell has exceptions?
[23:43:03] <huon> gotta get that AVX-412
[23:43:05] <huon> *512
[23:43:30] <Gankro> I'm pretty sure exceptions are the only hard requirement for turing completeness, if programming languages are any evidence
[23:43:33] <huon> ijks: yes, and it causes pain AIUI, since laziness makes this behave unexpectedly
