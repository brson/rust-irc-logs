[00:22:23] <Havvy> Err...
[00:22:26] <Havvy> !botloop2
[00:22:43] <Havvy> rustbot didn't actually learn that.
[00:22:57] <huon> yeah, I was sad
[00:23:04] <huon> playbot is too correct :P
[00:23:12] <Havvy> Which is weird, because I thought it would.
[00:23:12] <huon> (and rustbot)
[00:23:17] <panicblit> Just a few hours ago I started to use stored functions instead of inline SQL and it already pays out :>
[00:23:18] <huon> playbot uses NOTICE
[00:23:39] <Havvy> Ah right, the NOTICE.
[00:24:23] <panicblit> How are irc messages quoted anyway?

[00:25:00] <Havvy> panicblit:  They're sent as `MESSAGETYPE arg1 arg2 :multiword arg`

[00:25:38] <panicblit> Hm
[00:25:41] <panicblit> Ok
[00:25:57] <Havvy> So, e.g., `PRIVMSG #rust-offtopic :Hello world!`
[00:25:58] <panicblit> It's just newline seperated
[00:26:12] <Havvy> Oh right, yeah. Lines are separated by \r\n.
[00:26:32] <panicblit> So if playbot splits the program output at newlines there's no way to slip in custom irc commands
[00:27:09] <huon> I believe playbot uses a "real" IRC lib, so presumably that should handle that sort of stuff
[00:27:17] <panicblit> Yeah

[00:36:36] <Havvy> Anyways...I do wonder if Spidermonkey will ever switch to Rust.
[00:38:37] <FreeFull> Probably not
[00:38:51] <FreeFull> It might end up being a mixture of Rust and C++
[00:39:21] <FreeFull> The JIT part itself can't be made safe by Rust
[00:39:40] <FreeFull> But preventing buffer overflows and such would still be good
[00:40:57] <huon> how many JIT bugs are bugs in the generated code vs. bugs in the jitting infrastructure itself?
[00:41:18] <FreeFull> Not sure. Rust can definitely help with the latter
[00:41:26] <Havvy> You can reify more abstractions in the code with Rust than in C++.
[00:41:53] <tiffany> build a formally proven JIT
[00:42:28] * Havvy is cringing while watching Handmade Hero and the guy is saying "this is a circular buffer" but leaves no comment saying so and it's just a u32 array.
[00:43:18] <Havvy> No wait, it was a byte array, so a u8.
[00:43:28] <tiffany> yuck
[00:44:24] <Havvy> Also fun is twice he gets the delta between two cursors in circular buffers, and both times there's an if and some math just inlined into the general function instead of being pulled out.

[00:46:38] <bstrie> Havvy: given that interfacing Rust and C++ is always going to be a pain point, in a hypothetical future where Servo becomes A Big Deal then I could see an effort to write a new javascript engine in rust
[00:47:02] <tiffany> wasn't someone working on making it so you could FFI to C++?
[00:47:32] <cmr> doomlord put some work into it
[00:48:10] <bstrie> there's also been some work to compile both Rust and C++ to LLVM IR and interleave the bits there
[00:48:24] <bstrie> way more hilarious than mere FFI
[00:48:46] <cmr> meh, that's mostly straightforward.
[00:48:56] <cmr> FFI is harder.
[00:49:32] <bstrie> FFI is only harder because C++ has no standard abi, it's a boring kind of hardness
[00:49:58] <huon> using LLVM IR still requires Rust-level FFI
[00:50:02] <bstrie> shuffling together the IR of two different compilers for two different language is mad-scientist hardness
[00:50:04] <tiffany> at least on 64bit linux everyone uses the sysV ABI
[00:50:11] <huon> to get the calls into the C++ into the Rust IR
[00:50:31] <huon> using IR allows for cross-language inlining etc. (which'd be pretty awesome)
[00:50:46] <c74d> gentoo.org, wiki.archlinux.org, bpaste.net are available over IPv6, but github.com and twitter.com aren't. :/
[00:50:52] <tiffany> IR doesn't fix the template expansion template does it?
[00:50:59] <cmr> tiffany: no it does not.
[00:51:15] <cmr> bstrie: shuffling together the IR is easy! seriously! LLVM makes it easy!
[00:51:29] <tiffany> I wonder how far backwards you have to bend in order to make templates work across languages without having to call into the original language's compiler
[00:51:54] <bstrie> cmr: implement it for servo then! :)
[00:54:19] <cmr> bstrie: Luqman already did :P
[00:56:25] <bstrie> then why is servo still on a three-year old version of spidermonkey :P
[00:57:55] <cmr> It was nothing more than a demo, it was pretty finicky.

[05:43:34] <scott> cool, because that's the first thing I thought of and I barely even program Rust right now
[05:43:39] <eddyb> tiffany: dat ending
[05:44:21] <scott> one look at the doc line for char_at raises major red flags... indexing bytes returning chars :|
[05:44:33] <scott> I mean, there are special case usages where that is what you want, but it's not common
[05:49:08] <eddyb> I blame JS
[05:49:14] <eddyb> I guess C and JS both

[05:50:12] <eddyb> it just gets tiring to keep asking the same old question "why do you think you *need* to index a string?"
[05:53:30] <XMPPwocky> impl Index<usize> for String { fn index(&self, index: usize) -> &char { panic!("please don't") }

[19:21:27] <bluss> lahwran: it's as old as luajit2
[19:21:33] <Hannibal_Smith> Yes, the client had "unlimited resources"
[19:21:41] <lahwran> bluss: I'm just joking about how long ago 2009 was
[19:21:46] <bluss> oh
[19:21:47] <Hannibal_Smith> Big server at Softlayer
[19:21:53] <barosl> Ha, that's awesome
[19:22:16] * bluss slowpokes around
[19:24:02] <barosl> bluss, Unfortunately I'm too stupid to understand the wizardry spells in the article :(
[19:24:52] <barosl> However it does seem a lot of micro-optimizations
[19:25:03] <barosl> And evidently, millions of micro-optimizations can make a huge difference
[19:25:20] <bluss> well it is a lot about making sure pipelines and memory are scheduled efficiently
[19:25:50] <lahwran> barosl: I really have no idea how to read your benchmarks
[19:26:07] <lahwran> there are so many things I don't know enough about in your benchmarks to get any idea of the accuracy of them
[19:26:35] <barosl> lahwran, Uhm, that's just average CPU usages while running each server
[19:26:41] <lahwran> what kind of load are they being put under? what are you using to measure "cpu use" in the numbers? why does each table have multiple columns?
[19:26:50] <lahwran> um. I see.
[19:27:10] <barosl> I checked them every ~5 minutes, not sure about the accurate timing though
[19:27:17] <lahwran> ._.
[19:28:34] <barosl> To be honest, I personally laughed at Lua for not having dedicated integer types, and no utf-8 strings...
[19:28:48] <lahwran> yeah lua is bleh
[19:29:09] <lahwran> apparently there's a fast implementation, but it's a really meh language
[19:30:12] <barosl> At least it should be less meh than PHP, right?
[19:30:29] <barosl> If that is the case I want to believe it's bearable
[19:34:45] <barosl> Hannibal_Smith, What was your solution to the GC pauses? Does C# support something like "GC throttling"?
[19:35:26] <Hannibal_Smith> barosl, switch where possible to struct types, and use memory pools
[19:35:44] <Hannibal_Smith> The final solution anyway was a rewrite in C++
[19:35:51] <barosl> Oh, are struct types allocated on stack in C#?
[19:36:22] <Hannibal_Smith> Yes, even if .Net team says not always agree with it

[19:37:14] <Hannibal_Smith> There was also an interesting article on .Net (terrible) GC and how using struct types helped Stackoverflow backend to get decent performance
[19:37:31] <Hannibal_Smith> But it was some years ago, and I don't have any link at the moment
[19:38:21] <tiffany> you can store structs inside of other structs and inside classes can't you?
[19:38:25] <barosl> It is interesting they have distingushed structs from classes. I imagined C++/Java which both have only one-sided opinions
[19:38:29] <tiffany> that would count as not being on the stack
[19:38:34] <tiffany> embedded inside of something on the heap
[19:38:41] <Hannibal_Smith> Yes tiffany, it will also help memory locality
[19:38:53] <Hannibal_Smith> Uhm...or data locality
[19:39:01] <tiffany> cache locality
[19:39:18] <tiffany> I'm quite used to thinking about cache and the cost of indirection
[19:39:30] <barosl> Oh, and values types in C# is actully not nullable!
[19:39:40] <barosl> Just like the plain POD in C/C++!

[19:59:43] <io2_> I know that there are Qt bindings, but I'd like to know what is going to be the definitive case post 1.0
[20:00:00] <io2_> barosl: hmm
[20:00:24] <barosl> Qt bindings would not work well until considerable amount of time passes, as they have to struggle with interfacing C++
[20:00:59] <io2_> ok here is my scenario of use and I'd really like some feedback on this
[20:01:18] <Hannibal_Smith> barosl, if you are curious https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/master/src/gc/gc.cpp
[20:01:36] <barosl> Hannibal_Smith, Ah, that is the code!

[20:01:51] <Hannibal_Smith> With https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/master/src/gc/gc.h
[20:02:32] <barosl> Oh wait. It's C++
[20:02:38] <io2_> barosl: I need to make a plan for a project that is at least yearlong that involves gui rendering of several "things"
[20:02:50] <GaryOak_> it's so large github can't even show it
[20:02:51] <barosl> Yeah... why did I think the implemention of the .NET platform was written in C#?
[20:02:58] <Hannibal_Smith> Yes, .Net is written in a strange and not so high quality C++
[20:03:02] <io2_> barosl: what's the prospect of having rgtk work well enough to depend upon it
[20:03:23] <io2_> hi Hannibal_Smith, long time
[20:03:29] <Hannibal_Smith> Hi io2
[20:03:43] <cmr> nice, Z3 released under MIT.
[20:03:50] <Hannibal_Smith> Wow
[20:03:55] <Hannibal_Smith> That is big
[20:04:27] <barosl> io2_, I'm not good at anticipating future ;) But I think rgtk is at least currently being actively maintained
[20:04:33] <bvssvni> 3.9% of GAP is written in Brainfuck https://github.com/gap-system/gap
[20:04:34] <bvssvni> haha
[20:04:42] <io2_> barosl: so, how dependable is rgtk? I can't have the project not have a gui part on this, in native mode :/
[20:04:58] <io2_> barosl: of course, but I haven't played at all with gui programming in rust :)
[20:05:12] <Hannibal_Smith> cmr, maybe even Rust can make some dependency on it now :-P
[20:05:13] <cmr> bvssvni: it's just the file extension.
[20:05:22] <bvssvni> cmr: oh
[20:05:28] <io2_> it is one thing to do command line stuff and small servers, but gui programming is kind of more twisted because ... dependencies.
[20:05:30] <barosl> io2_, I heard about rgtk since at least 1 year ago, so it may keep its devlopment pace in future too
[20:05:39] <io2_> ok, nice

[20:07:51] <barosl> io2_, The more concerning is that as I heard, rgtk currently works on Linux only... There might be a way to use it on Windows, but it is possibly bothersome. You need to investigate it first if you're planning to use in on Windows
[20:08:08] <barosl> I mean, Linux and OS X, not Windows
[20:08:35] <io2_> linux and osx will do actually, but hrmmmm lack of windows support is problematic
[20:09:02] <barosl> "rgtk should build and work on both OSX and GNU/Linux. We plan on adding windows support in the future." says the official README

[20:11:04] <io2_> writing an alternative is much harder if you do not dedicate yourself to it; one has to have strong motivation to do it and be able to put together a good team. I was looking for something ready in order to have efforts better spent on the actual project I have in mind, which is not a toy project.

[20:13:38] <io2_> goddamn, I know it is early for native gui programming in Rust, but if there is only one serious alternative and it isn't really cross platform, I can't go forward, pragmatically
[20:13:57] <io2_> the thing is that rust is easier to teach to somebody as well
[20:14:43] <barosl> Is your project targetting newcomers?
[20:14:59] <io2_> it isn't low expectations language and you don't feel like a braindead moron if you use it, it is just right for putting together a few people who code systematically following guidelines etc
[20:15:08] <XMPPwocky> i'd like to see https://docs.python.org/2/library/turtle.html as a crate
[20:15:33] <barosl> Good ol' turtle!
[20:15:57] <io2_> barosl: well, we were discussing with a few people on how to implement a particular application and the vote isn't for using something C++ or Java based; the coders are pro.
[20:16:14] <barosl> But wait. Was turtle part of the *standard* library in Python?
[20:16:21] <barosl> Surprising
[20:16:27] <XMPPwocky> it's python
[20:16:30] <XMPPwocky> they shipped everything
[20:16:40] <io2_> now, there was the discussion of looking what other language compiles to native that most of us know well enough and there the options are varied
[20:17:00] <barosl> Varied? There's no choices other than Rust!
[20:17:28] <cmr> io2_: what's the exact usecase for the native gui? rendering 3d graphics in a portion of the window?
[20:17:46] <io2_> barosl: part 3d, part 2d, lots of time series and the rest
[20:17:49] <io2_> like lots.
[20:18:07] <cmr> would embedding a web rendering engine be feasible for some of the lighter lifting and widget/interaction?
[20:18:31] <io2_> I think that it wouldn't be able to keep up with the data if javascript was to render these things
[20:18:49] <FreeFull> XMPPwocky: It shouldn't be too hard of a project to create a turtle graphics library, I think
[20:18:52] <cmr> you can still blit bitmaps onto the window for perf-sensitive parts.
[20:18:57] <io2_> so web servers and the like are most likely a no, that's what everybody voted
[20:18:58] <XMPPwocky> i hear this "servo" thing is pretty fast
[20:19:07] <FreeFull> XMPPwocky: You should write it ;)
[20:19:19] <io2_> cmr: how complicated can that get though and how reliable is it
[20:19:28] <cmr> sure, using the browser only might be infeasible, but embedding webkit can work really well.
[20:20:16] <cmr> io2_: it can get pretty complicated if the region you want to be natively-rendered is animated or needs to be occluded by widgets.
[20:20:16] <io2_> cmr: is there a solution that has already been tested by someone with rust and is hassle-free to sell for deployment?
[20:20:23] <cmr> for rust? no.
[20:20:54] <cmr> in C++ there's https://coherent-labs.com/ (made for games)
[20:21:07] <io2_> there is three of us that would like to use rust and the others are indifferent right now since they'll be doing other parts
[20:22:39] <io2_> it isn't something that has to ship soon, but it has to go through the dev cycle for a few months; I have a feeling that it is already pretty ok to do backend stuff with rust but as you guys confirm, gui isn't going anywhere anytime soon :/
[20:22:50] <cmr> yeah.
[20:23:07] <FreeFull> QT would be nice to have, but it's C++
[20:23:27] <FreeFull> Although I suppose some languages have managed to develop QT bindings
[20:23:29] <cmr> I don't know of anyone actively working on robust GUI.
[20:23:33] <io2_> FreeFull: you might as well use C++ there, which by vote people wish to avoid.
[20:23:36] <cmr> FreeFull: there's SMOKE, but it's very slowly.

[20:27:42] <Hannibal_Smith> If I remember well, the author behind Python Qt binding, work on that project at full time
[20:28:40] <Hannibal_Smith> And the result is really great
[20:28:53] <io2_> the problem is that the uber-alternative with the various unsafeIO hacks one might need for this could very well be Haskell, whose gui bindings are mature enough.
[20:29:29] <Hannibal_Smith> Never used Qt from Haskell...at first don't seems really "fun"
[20:29:33] <io2_> the problem is that only two of us are really into Haskell and I don't think that threadmilling people into a haskell bootcamp for such a thing is feasible or even thinkable

[20:36:09] <io2_> the temptation of using legacy bases because "they work" or introducing new legacies is more than sure to send us into development hell.
[20:36:37] <io2_> so given that a single language scenario is unlikely, we'll end up discussing this... again damn it.
[20:37:03] <io2_> gui programming is such a snake.

[20:41:55] <io2_> lahwran: we are considering it yes
[20:42:03] <cmr> io2_: personally, I'd be pretty inclinded to use gtk and either implement windows support myself when the time comes, assuming it wasn't added by the time I needed to ship.
[20:42:25] <io2_> to be exact, we are considering to do serious work with rust on the backend, it is the gui part that hasn't made us say "yes, rust, now".
[20:42:39] <cmr> rgtk*
[20:42:44] <Hannibal_Smith> Is not also Mac OS X support subpar?
[20:43:08] <lahwran> of what?

[20:43:49] <lahwran> I think gtk3 looks much closer to native, but it's still icky
[20:44:49] <lahwran> io2_: what sort of cross-platform requirements do you have? are we talking about a game, or a desktop app that uses graphics?
[20:46:21] <io2_> lahwran: it is desktop app using graphics, not at all a game
[20:46:27] <lahwran> if it's a game, I think opengl support should be ready to go, and if you have any cross-platform need at all you'll probably end up being stuck with opengl so you might as well use it from the start
[20:46:28] <lahwran> ah
[20:46:33] <io2_> and we'd like to be cross-platform
[20:46:49] <io2_> no windows support is a bummer as you can understand :/
[20:46:53] <lahwran> right
[20:47:07] <XMPPwocky> could you write the GUI stuff in lua or python or something
[20:47:12] <XMPPwocky> and the backend in rust?
[20:47:27] <lahwran> it sounds closed-source
[20:47:36] <lahwran> which makes that seem unlikely
[20:47:45] <io2_> pretty much
[20:47:52] <XMPPwocky> idk if people are going to steal your ui glue code
[20:48:56] <io2_> well, I'd need to find a combination that works well with rust
[20:49:34] <io2_> then we'd need to discuss this again, I don't know if somebody else came in here lately and asked for rust/gui programming in a scenario similar to mine, perhaps he was of the same group as me
[20:49:58] *** Joins: larhat (Adium@moz-fmfrc4.mfe0.h1q1.2168.2a02.IP)
[20:50:44] <io2_> thing is, that everybody is on crack with rust; fandom aside, there are concerns that for a slightly long term project that has to have some serious backend chops, the gui part is going to betray us in a year or so from now if the core language isn't properly usable with widget toolkits
[20:51:20] <io2_> and the almost unianimous vote is to avoid legacy language use, which is a pretty heavy constraint
[20:52:08] <io2_> for what we want and how we want it, rust *is* production worthy and what isn't there it is easily implementable library wise from us
[20:52:42] <io2_> if there wasn't the gui concern in the span of a year, we wouldn't even blink.
[20:58:59] <io2_> ok, screw this, my vote counts as two; rust back end then streamed to a Qt rendering application via a binding we make for the important parts. And anybody trying to pull stunts with the backend placing cppoison in, gets a kick in the nuts and horsestumped.
[20:59:44] <io2_> or horsef'ed, depends on how pissed everybody will be
[21:00:37] <io2_> within a year rust will be more than adequate hopefully, so more things will emerge
[21:00:52] <io2_> gui-level adequate I mean
[21:01:17] <io2_> what can I say guys, thanks for the chat; I don't see any other pragmatic way out of this if we don't want legacy pouring into us
[21:01:43] <WindowsBunny> io2_: Someone needs to rewrite Qt in Rust :D
[21:01:46] <io2_> but this means extra work grrrr
[21:01:51] <lahwran> yeah seriously
[21:02:15] <io2_> if somebody had a team up for giving proper bindings to it, it wouldn't be bad
[21:02:21] <lahwran> let's get a rust library that wraps platform gui libraries
[21:02:47] <io2_> lahwran: that's just too broad
[21:02:49] <lahwran> wrap win32 or whatever it is, wrap cocoa, and then also wrap qt/gtk
[21:04:03] <WindowsBunny> I'll handle the low level win32 bindings
[21:04:15] <WindowsBunny> Anyone wanna do the high level win32 wrapper? :D
[21:04:23] <cmr> is there a point?
[21:04:28] <io2_> ---^
[21:04:48] <cmr> even microsoft doesn't care about win32 gui
[21:06:30] <WindowsBunny> cmr: It still is the underlying implementation for most native GUI stuff on windows
[21:06:51] <cmr> WindowsBunny: GDI maybe.
[21:07:26] <WindowsBunny> oh whatever, GDI
[21:07:32] <cmr> Direct2D moreso I suspect
[21:07:46] <cmr> they've poured a ton of work into that for win8/win10.
[21:08:19] <io2_> dealing with win32 is a PITA
[21:08:49] <io2_> if you have ways to use this and need to through any kind of custom proxy lib, it is less painful
[21:09:01] <io2_> plus most people just use Qt for complex gui apps
[21:09:19] <io2_> that's how qt makes money
[21:09:37] <io2_> and especially cross-platform wise, you don't have many other choices anyway
[21:10:08] <io2_> I have rarely seen somebody saying "let's use wxWidgets"
[21:10:25] <c74d> Are 32-bit Windows systems still in production?
[21:10:35] <c74d> ...or is that not what win32 means
[21:10:41] <WindowsBunny> c74d: That is not what win32 means
[21:10:46] <io2_> ---^
[21:11:16] <cmr> c74d: win32 is pretty much everything native-code windows on the PC.
[21:11:30] <cmr> there's the WinRT for much newer stuff, but a lot of it's still just COM
[21:11:46] <c74d> mm, 'k
[21:12:30] * c74d was going to jestingly ask whether it was like Win95... released in 1932
[21:12:49] <cmr> lol
[21:13:03] <WindowsBunny> 2032
[21:13:09] <WindowsBunny> And sent to us via time machine
[21:13:23] <cmr> maybe an alternate-universe dystopic 2032 :P
[21:13:25] <io2_> WindowsBunny: no, windows was invented bi Vlad Tepes and was sent to the future.
[21:13:48] <io2_> Windows Impaler Edition
[21:14:13] *** cmr changes topic to 'Only vaguely offtopic. The Rust addiction runs deep.'
[21:14:36] <io2_> HA HA
[21:15:32] <c74d> “win32 is pretty much everything native-code windows on the PC.” — “win32” is, collectively, the Windows software not written in C#/Java/other runs-in-a-VM languages?
[21:16:02] <WindowsBunny> win32 is the user mode subsystem written on top of the NT subsystem
[21:16:08] <cmr> c74d: that's how it's used in practice, yeah.
[21:16:33] <cmr> WindowsBunny: but not the only user mode subsystem! :)
[21:16:33] <WindowsBunny> Everything is practically implemented in terms of win32
[21:16:50] * c74d doesn't know what a subsystem is in this context, decides to stop poking my nose into Windows for now.
[21:17:06] <cmr> The new gadgeteer-plus platform is NT, but only WinRT/XAML.
[21:18:23] <io2_> win32 is evil incarnate
[21:18:37] <WindowsBunny> there's also the posix subsystem
[21:18:40] <WindowsBunny> But nobody uses that
[21:19:07] <io2_> nobody /*cares*/ to use that on win32
[21:19:14] <io2_> win*
[21:19:50] <WindowsBunny> Plus the version of posix it provides is severely outdated
[21:19:57] <io2_> boh, anyway, at least I made up my mind unless there was any other non-trivial option involving my problem
[21:20:47] <io2_> search engines gave no results as last time, channel consensus is obviously on a wait-and-see and we are only wasting time not doing the backend which is the actual core
[21:21:41] <io2_> we'll put up with the plan "B" of binding to the parts of Qt we want to while threatening to annihilate anybody pouring legacy language code into the backend.
[21:22:12] <io2_> if ONLY rust was here a year earlier
[21:22:56] <io2_> we'd know what would happen within a year from now gui-wise
[21:23:02] <io2_> almost
[21:23:03] <io2_> :/
