[18:33:24] <nmatsakis> aturon acrichto : ok so I think I had the def'n of Reflect slightly wrong
[18:33:27] <nmatsakis> in particular
[18:33:33] <nmatsakis> I had `trait Reflect : 'static`
[18:33:49] <nmatsakis> but that doesn't work with trait objects well because you get
[18:33:59] <nmatsakis> Box<for<'a> Fn(&'a int)>
[18:34:03] <nmatsakis> er
[18:34:05] <nmatsakis> Box<for<'a> Fn(&'a int)>: Reflect =>
[18:34:15] <nmatsakis> for<'a> (&'a int: Reflect) =>
[18:34:24] <nmatsakis> for<'a> (&'a int: 'static)
[18:34:27] <nmatsakis> which doesn't hold
[18:34:48] <acrichto> hm well TypeId won't work for anything that isn't 'static
[18:34:50] <nmatsakis> also, it makes Reflect not suitable for other reflection-y things like that discriminant_value intrinsic
[18:34:53] <nmatsakis> so I cahnged it to this
[18:35:00] <nmatsakis> trait Reflect : MarkerTrait{ }
[18:35:05] <nmatsakis> trait Any: Reflect + 'static { }
[18:35:23] <nmatsakis> impl TypeId { fn of<T:Any>(t: &T) -> u64 
[18:35:31] <acrichto> hm interesting
[18:35:36] <nmatsakis> note that there is a blanket impl
[18:35:46] <nmatsakis> impl<T:Reflect+'static> Any for T
[18:35:58] <acrichto> I think that makes sense eah
[18:36:02] <nmatsakis> so you can just write `T: Any` in `TypeId`
[18:36:08] <nmatsakis> and it is no loss of convenience
[18:36:28] <acrichto> is it planned to ever allow types to opt-out of Reflect?
[18:36:53] <nmatsakis> I don't know of a use case, but it would work today I think
[18:36:56] <nmatsakis> with the current impl, that is
[18:37:13] <nmatsakis> (modulo feature gates on neg impls)
[18:37:23] <acrichto> hm ok
[18:37:27] <nmatsakis> I feel like I had found a problem with that...? but no I can't think what it would be
[18:37:28] <acrichto> just trying to get this all straight in my head
[18:37:48] <acrichto> it's kinda odd that sometimes you bound by Any and others by Reflect
[18:37:50] <nmatsakis> I think the problem I foresaw was when you found that OIBIT was not a good fit
[18:37:53] <nmatsakis> but this variant on OIBIT that I made
[18:37:56] <nmatsakis> well, basically, 
[18:37:59] <nmatsakis> you should never bound by Reflect I thikn
[18:38:24] <nmatsakis> it's kind of a core marker trait but I thikn you should bound by Any if your purpose is to be able to call type-testing methods 
[18:38:34] <nmatsakis> though you could do Reflect+'static
[18:38:36] <acrichto> interesting
[18:38:45] <acrichto> how does that closure example work then?
[18:38:59] <acrichto> b/c doesn't Fn(&int) not impl Any ?
[18:39:06] <acrichto> b/c you're saying the &int isn't satisfying 'static

[18:43:13] <nmatsakis> acrichto: Fn(&int) : 'static  holds
[18:43:23] <nmatsakis> acrichto: and doesn't require us to recurse in the same way that Reflect does
[18:43:28] <nmatsakis> I'll explain in a bit, leaving this cafe :)
[18:57:34] <eddyb> nmatsakis: did I totally misunderstand carllerche's inference issue aka https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/23728?
[19:04:19] <nmatsakis> eddyb: I think so? :) I don't quite understand what you were suggesting
[19:05:15] <eddyb> nmatsakis: I completely misunderstood the issue
[19:07:48] <nmatsakis> acrichto: so basically the interesting thing is that a constraint like `T: 'static` is a constrint over the *data reachable* through `T` (same with standard OIBIT) 
[19:08:03] <nmatsakis> but Reflect is constraining the *types reachable* visible `T`, essentially
[19:08:13] <nmatsakis> so having Reflect: 'static seems to be overconstraining
[19:08:19] <nmatsakis> beacuse it's ok to have types that are not 'static, if those are bound regions
[19:08:22] <acrichto> nmatsakis: hm interesting
[19:08:42] <nmatsakis> hence something like
[19:08:46] <nmatsakis> Fn(&int),
[19:08:57] <nmatsakis> the &int data is not reachable from the fn,
[19:09:02] <nmatsakis> er, from the environment,
[19:09:07] <nmatsakis> it's supplied as argument when the fn is called
[19:09:16] <eddyb> Any cannot support trait objects, can it ever - oh I remember that I realized &&&Trait would still need to be supported, that's why I didn't make a comment. I think
[19:09:32] <nmatsakis> eddyb: "support trait objects"?
[19:09:38] <acrichto> nmatsakis: ok I think I understand then
[19:09:52] <acrichto> e.g. you can Reflect over basically everything unless it opts out (and you know type parameters are ok)
[19:09:57] <acrichto> but you cannot downcast/Any something unless it is 'static
[19:09:58] <eddyb> I was thinking "Trait: Any" but that's not the issue, is it now?

[19:13:27] <nmatsakis> impl IntoIterator for &Vec
[19:13:33] <aturon> yes, to allow blankets for tuples in the future, for example
[19:13:35] <nmatsakis> oh wait
[19:13:41] <nmatsakis> hmm I remember now...
[19:13:45] <nmatsakis> ...I was thinking something like
[19:13:47] <eddyb> are we getting coherence hacks?
[19:13:50] <nmatsakis> that we might be able to avoid it
[19:13:56] <nmatsakis> eddyb: maybe...
[19:14:38] <nmatsakis> eddyb: this is a draft that I want to significantly revise, but it explains the problem I am worried about https://gist.github.com/nikomatsakis/08b7a4b9c6071ec02e0d#file-negativity-md 
[19:15:11] <nmatsakis> aturon: well, concievably if we allowed for some more targetd like,
[19:15:15] <nmatsakis> aturon: inextensible(ref)
[19:15:23] <nmatsakis> aturon: we could leave the option open
[19:15:33] <aturon> yeah
[19:15:43] <aturon> it's not clear how much of a problem it is to slightly overcommit for now
[19:15:53] <aturon> e.g. we could make that revision during beta, perhaps
[19:16:01] <nmatsakis> indeed
[19:16:22] <nmatsakis> anyway I am going to press on
[19:16:22] <aturon> nmatsakis: i'm running into an associated type not living long enough issue
[19:16:32] <nmatsakis> aturon: yeah, I think i've seen it :)
[19:16:40] <nmatsakis> aturon: show me?
[19:16:41] <aturon> nmatsakis: https://gist.github.com/aturon/d4355fe915a7bdaeadeb
[19:16:52] <aturon> i was trying to generalize the blanket for As
[19:16:56] <aturon> previously this only worked over &
[19:16:59] <eddyb> ugh, specialization
[19:17:08] <eddyb> nmatsakis: this is all very gloomy stuff
[19:17:27] <nmatsakis> aturon: so I think that the rule I wanted to do
[19:17:28] <eddyb> who would've thought type systems are hard? :P
[19:17:44] <nmatsakis> eddyb: I am very excited about specialization, surprised tos ee you say "ugh", but yeah I hear you
[19:17:48] <nmatsakis> aturon: would solve this problem
[19:18:00] <nmatsakis> aturon: I should prob get cracking on that, I had some thoughts about how to make it possible
[19:18:11] <aturon> nmatsakis: ok, np, i will go with the more specialized thing for now --
[19:18:14] <aturon> nmatsakis: is there an issue open?
[19:19:08] <aturon> (i would like to add a FIXME flagging it)
[19:19:32] <eddyb> nmatsakis: specialization is a bit of a rabbit hole, to say the least
[19:20:05] <nmatsakis> aturon: yes I did open one I think, let me find it
[19:20:18] <nmatsakis> eddyb: probably, but what isn't?

[19:20:57] <aturon> eddyb: i think it's a rabbit hole with one end connected to coherence; i'm hoping it'll let us dig our way back out to the surface
[19:21:40] <eddyb> it's funny how you say that
[19:21:51] <eddyb> aturon: so you want decoherence :P?
[19:22:38] <eddyb> that's why we can't have quantum compute^W^W nice things
[19:22:40] <nmatsakis> aturon: sent Emily $20 in the mail as her weight loss challenge winnings.
[19:22:51] <nmatsakis> aturon: um
[19:22:57] <nmatsakis> not at all whatI meant to cut-and-paste :)
[19:22:57] <aturon> lol
[19:23:01] <nmatsakis> aturon: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/23442
[19:23:07] <aturon> thanks
[19:23:14] <eddyb> nmatsakis: publicly logged!
[19:23:21] <nmatsakis> yeah, well, she was the winner
[19:23:26] <nmatsakis> so it's not so bad

[20:55:05] <eddyb> I forgot about something :(
[20:55:40] <eddyb>         while let Ok(Some(traits::VtableUnsizeStruct(nested))) = result {
[20:56:09] <eddyb> nmatsakis: that nice loop to descend into an unsized structure won't be enough anymore
[20:56:50] <eddyb> I would have to repeatedly flatten the obligations and keep those referring CoerceUnsized impls or VtableUnsizeStruct
[20:57:17] <eddyb> *referring to
[20:57:34] <eddyb> though that may be confusing to work with
