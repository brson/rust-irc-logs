[00:01:15] <Tiffany> all this GOST stuff appears to be obscure russian crypto
[00:03:05] <Tiffany> I wonder why camellia isn't more widely used
[00:03:14] <Tiffany> is there anything wrong with it, or does it just have no benefits compared to AES?
[00:03:31] <Tiffany> I guess the patents don't help
[00:03:37] <Tiffany> but they're under a royalty-free license
[00:05:06] <Tiffany> it looks like IDEA suffers the same problem
[00:05:21] <Tiffany> patented, other algorithms which aren't patented exist
[00:05:39] <Tiffany> I wonder why so many ciphers have a block size of 64 bits
[00:06:12] <eternaleye> Tiffany: Because of when they were created?
[00:06:43] <eternaleye> Tiffany: DES had a 64-bit blocksize, and it wasn't until relatively recently that 4gb in a single session was a reasonable thing to consider
[00:07:01] <eternaleye> Tiffany: So the birthday bound didn't make 128-bit blocks necessary until recently
[00:07:21] <Tiffany> oh
[00:07:23] <eternaleye> Tiffany: In addition, IIRC SEED was meant for constrained devices - phones and such
[00:07:39] <eternaleye> Tiffany: So the birthday bound's relevance may have been delayed further
[00:07:54] <Tiffany> do you mean IDEA?
[00:08:11] <eternaleye> Tiffany: You mentioned SEED shortly before the comment; I thought it was related
[00:08:28] <eternaleye> But yeah, IDEA is definitely old enough that it was probably just a case of "DES does it"
[00:08:31] <Tiffany> I mentioned seed because they both seem to be e-commerce standards for their respective governments
[00:08:37] <eternaleye> Mm
[00:08:38] <Tiffany> oh, I mentioned it because of GOST
[00:08:49] <eternaleye> I must have been thinking of Kasumi being meant for cell phones
[00:08:49] <Tiffany> I'm just looking through the list of TLS cipher suites
[00:08:53] <Tiffany> most of these can be organized into like
[00:09:19] <eternaleye> "General-purpose", "special requirements", "government", "obsolete" ?
[00:09:23] <Tiffany> good crypto, stuff which is okay but there's no reason to use over the good crypto, old bad crypto, and wtf-level garbage
[00:09:56] <Tiffany> all the fortezza stuff falls into that last category
[00:10:06] <Tiffany> I guess that second category could be called special requirements
[00:10:13] <Tiffany> SEED is required by law to be used for e-commerce in south korea
[00:10:13] <eternaleye> Sort of
[00:10:20] <Tiffany> other than that, there's no reason to use it
[00:10:28] <eternaleye> Special requirements would include stuff like Kerberos with modern ciphers
[00:10:35] <Tiffany> oh, yeah
[00:10:36] <eternaleye> "Needs to fit into existing auth"
[00:10:54] <Tiffany> what about PSK? can you not just hook KRB5 up to PSK?
[00:10:59] <Tiffany> or am I misunderstanding how this works
[00:11:10] <Tiffany> do the KRB5 suites not require special implementation considerations?
[00:11:11] <eternaleye> A bit
[00:11:22] <eternaleye> kerberos isn't just about keying
[00:11:39] <eternaleye> And the auth doesn't have the same properties as PSK
[00:11:47] <eternaleye> Where you just know "the other side has the same info"
[00:11:59] <eternaleye> In Kerberos, you can authenticate the server and client by different names
[00:12:51] <Tiffany> by different names?
[00:12:59] <eternaleye> Kerberos principles are named
[00:13:08] <eternaleye> So I might be eternaleye@foo
[00:13:27] <eternaleye> And the server might be BLARG-API/bar
[00:13:41] <eternaleye> Since I'm a user, and the service would have an SPN
[00:13:57] <eternaleye> Kerberos is nothing like PSK
[00:14:24] <Tiffany> I'm not sure which category SRP auth falls under
[00:14:34] <Tiffany> what's RSA_FIPS?
[00:14:52] <eternaleye> RSA that is guaranteed to obey FIPS guidelines?
[00:15:02] <eternaleye> Consider it a cross-machine behavioral assertion
[00:15:25] <eternaleye> It's RSA, it just tells the peer "and you can count on me not making you non-compliant"
[00:16:12] <Tiffany> uh huh
[00:16:54] <eternaleye> I'd say that if client-auth in TLS hadn't flopped in the market, SRP would be general-purpose
[00:17:12] <eternaleye> If it wasn't FFDH-only, it'd be special-requirements
[00:17:13] <Tiffany> what the hell is the point of DHE_PSK
[00:17:24] <eternaleye> But it's both, so it's obsolete
[00:17:33] <eternaleye> Tiffany: PSK auth, forward secrecy
[00:17:44] <eternaleye> Tiffany: plain PSK has no FS at all
[00:17:45] <Tiffany> oh
[00:18:18] <eternaleye> Should still die in favor of ECDHE though
[00:18:30] <frewsxcv> https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/6505
[00:18:38] <Tiffany> so you can use KRB5 with IDEA, 3DES, or broken crap
[00:19:38] <eternaleye> Pretty much
[00:19:54] <eternaleye> Which is another annoying result of the combinatoric bullcrap
[00:19:58] <Tiffany> yeah
[00:20:13] <Tiffany> it would be nice if kex/auth were separate from AE
[00:21:30] <eternaleye> Well, TLS 1.3 seems to be converging on that
[00:21:41] <eternaleye> About 20 years after it was past due.
[00:26:47] <Ilari> Well, fair amount of noise at least...
[00:31:34] <Tiffany> is DSA okay?
[00:32:49] <Ilari> eternaleye: Where would algorithms that are secure but obsoleted (not that TLS has those, but e.g. SSH does)? And isn't there division between old bad crypto and true garbage crypto (mere implementation should be taken as a security hole).
[00:33:36] <Tiffany> there actually aren't as many cipher suites in TLS as I was expecting, at least according to this page (https://www.thesprawl.org/research/tls-and-ssl-cipher-suites/)
[00:34:02] <Tiffany> I was expecting more broken crap crypto + more combinatorial explosion
[00:34:03] <Ilari> Tiffany: How many were you expecting? 1,000?
[00:35:04] <Tiffany> I guess a couple hundred
[00:35:24] <Ilari> Tiffany: Also, that list isn't up to date. There are ciphersuites that are standard but not on that list.
[00:35:30] <Tiffany> oh
[00:35:33] <Tiffany> is there a better list?
[00:35:53] <Tiffany> I was about to say, the only broken ciphers I see are DES, fortezza, RC2, and RC4
[00:37:11] <eternaleye> Ilari: I'd personally say that obsolete is obsolete.
[00:37:23] <eternaleye> Ilari: I called it "obsolete" not "insecure" for a reason.
[00:37:41] <eternaleye> Ilari: It doesn't say anything about *why* they're obsolete.
[00:37:46] <Ilari> Apparently there are 316 defined ciphersuites in TLS (plus some nonstandard widely used ones).
[00:38:09] <Tiffany> https://www.iana.org/assignments/tls-parameters/tls-parameters.xhtml#tls-parameters-4 there's this, apparently
[00:38:40] <eternaleye> Ilari: And personally, I'd consider the distinction between "old bad crypto" and "true garbage crypto" non-meaningful there
[00:39:01] <Ilari> eternaleye: I consider there to be pretty major difference between "obsolete because it is slow compared to modern stuff" and "obsolete because it is insecure".
[00:39:04] <eternaleye> Ilari: Since I'm talking about categorizing *stuff specified in standards*, not "whatever might happen to be exposed by a library"
[00:39:44] <eternaleye> Ilari: I don't consider the former "obsolete"
[00:39:51] <eternaleye> Ilari: I consider that "non-optimal"
[00:40:01] <Tiffany> or otherwise inferior to modern stuff
[00:40:02] <eternaleye> Ilari: Performance is a function, not a variable or a constant
[00:40:05] <Tiffany> like being patent encumbered
[00:40:21] <eternaleye> Ilari: You're making "obsolete" broader than I would.
[00:40:34] <Tiffany> ah, there's a cipher that the list I had doesn't mention
[00:40:36] <Tiffany> ARIA
[00:40:44] <eternaleye> Ilari: A patent-encumbered algo that is technically great and specced, would still be general-purpose
[00:41:01] <Tiffany> thoroughly broken
[00:41:07] <eternaleye> Ilari: A slow algo that is *only* slow and specced would also still be general purpose
[00:41:18] <Tiffany> oh
[00:41:21] <Tiffany> 8 rounds, not the full round
[00:41:22] <Tiffany> nevermind
[00:42:00] <eternaleye> Case in point: AES is quite slow compared to ChaCha... unless you have hardware accel.
[00:42:18] <eternaleye> But, you know, *people do have that* in a nontrivial number of cases.
[00:42:19] <Ilari> E.g. if TLS had defined AES-SDCTR-HMAC-SHA1... That can't match AES-GCM in speed, but would otherwise be fairly reasonable even today.
[00:42:43] <Tiffany> apparently TLS supports SAML assertions as certificates?
[00:42:48] <Tiffany> is SAML worse than x509?
[00:43:11] <eternaleye> When I say "Obsolete", I specifically mean "due to changed circumstances, it is no longer fit for purpose"
[00:43:43] <bascule> Tiffany: SAML is thoroughly terrible, yes
[00:43:54] <eternaleye> That can be a crypto break, or some framework it fits into dying off (like if KRB5 completely died), etc.
[00:43:56] <Ilari> Tiffany: Nope, it is authorization stuff, not certificate stuff (for certs, there is only x509, openpgp and x509 SPKI).
[00:44:08] <Tiffany> openpgp has certs?
[00:44:30] <bascule> Tiffany: SAML suffers from XML-itis (XXE-induced RCE, repeatedly in practice) and is just generally poorly designed 
[00:44:52] <bascule> Tiffany: e.g. when transferring claims, SAML is by default ambiguous as to whom those claims pertain to
[00:44:59] <Ilari> Tiffany: BTW, the reference for SAML stuff is to one of the most infamous (if not THE most infamous) TLS RFCs.
[00:45:23] <Tiffany> what makes it infamous?
[00:45:40] <bascule> Tiffany: SAML 2.0 added "AudienceRestrictions" but they're poorly implemented and enforced
[00:46:18] <Ilari> Tiffany: TLS can use openpgp keys for authentication (BTW: I once found a nasty bug in GnuTLS regarding that, allowing forging arbitrary authentication).
[00:46:50] <Ilari> Tiffany: IPR.
[00:48:13] <Ilari> Also, "The filing is extremely unclear, even for a patent - the reason is that the lawyer translated my input to German, filed that and later translated back to English, all without checking back with any of the inventors." ... And that's merely the most funny stuff.
[00:53:00] <Ilari> Tiffany: So IPR is another reason why you don't want to use SAML with TLS.
[00:53:08] <Ilari> (As if the other reasons were not enough)
[01:07:26] <bascule> https://koz.io/android-m-and-the-war-on-cleartext-traffic/
[01:07:34] <bascule> penaltyDeathOnCleartextNetwork()
[01:09:45] <Ilari> Also, it says what application that really goes out of its way can do... Well, if one has flexibility with the protocol, one could also make something that looks close enough to TLS.
[01:14:01] <Ilari> Lol... QUIC probably won't look like DTLS and thus that check would likely think QUIC is cleartext (QUIC design won't even work without crypto)

[15:03:49] <Tiffany> whoa
[15:03:53] <Tiffany> is that still the case?
[15:26:57] <eternaleye> Ilari: Yeah, it is - although personally, I think it'd be even better if TLS a.) mandated MRAE b.) used CHAIN for SOCK_STREAM and SOCK_SEQPACKET c.) used STREAM for SOCK_DGRAM
[15:27:44] <eternaleye> Ilari: For one, because CHAIN enforces the "Bad record? Terminate session." bit in a very robust manner
[15:27:59] <eternaleye> Ilari: If you get a corrupt record, you _do not have_ what you need to decrypt any more.
[15:28:35] <eternaleye> Ilari: So a bug along the lines of "goto fail" can't skip the session termination
[15:30:15] <eternaleye> Ilari: (Incidentally, any support for SOCK_SEQPACKET at all)
[15:30:40] <eternaleye> It could be done without any additional overhead past what TLS _already has_, just exposing a little extra info.
[15:55:02] <bascule> Ilari: oh hey look, some fun Russian crypto

[16:43:56] <eternaleye> oh god
[16:43:58] <eternaleye> So if someone doesn't have gpg set up, then when you email they just get a "click this link to read my email!"
[16:44:00] <eternaleye> ffs, what crack-addled drug monkey's used towelette came up with this?
[16:49:39] <Ilari> eternaleye: In GnuTLS, there is already receive support for SEQPACKET (done in name of "high performance"). I don't find enough guarantees in functions to send that sort of stuff tho.
[16:55:28] <eternaleye> Ilari: Oh, so each record is received as a packet?
[16:55:29] <eternaleye> Ilari: Or do you mean running on top of SEQPACKET?
[16:55:30] <eternaleye> Ilari: My meaning was "the user of the secure channel observes SEQPACKET semantics - record separation, etc"
[16:55:50] <Ilari> eternaleye: Yeah, receive record at a time.
[16:55:59] <eternaleye> Neat
[16:57:29] <eternaleye> Hm, although that would cause problems for 1/n-1 splitting &c
[16:58:31] <eternaleye> Ah, I see: http://gnutls.org/manual/html_node/Data-transfer-and-termination.html
[16:58:51] <eternaleye> Looks like you can send records, and can receive records with in-order semantics
[16:59:10] <eternaleye> Although unlike SEQPACKET, it's per-call, rather than a typing property
[17:01:00] <Ilari> eternaleye: Altough if gnutls_record_send is guaranteed to always just send one record, that would be a way to send data as packets.
[17:07:06] <eternaleye> Ilari: It looks like it only sends one record, but that might be a shorter record than the data - it won't error out on long data except on DTLS :/
[17:07:31] <eternaleye> Ilari: And without a flags parameter, I don't think that's tunable
[17:07:56] <Ilari> From description, it does short write if data is too long. But I'm not sure what the heck happens if the underlying write is interrupted.
[17:08:35] <eternaleye> Ilari: EINTR is defined as "the call returning EINTR must be safe to call again with identical parameters"
[17:08:50] <eternaleye> Ilari: So if the underlying send() returns EINTR, it needs to obey that
[17:09:01] <eternaleye> Ilari: Under that assumption, Gnutls provides the same semantics
[17:09:29] <eternaleye> Ilari: IOW, if send() returns EINTR, that send must have had no effect.
[17:09:59] <eternaleye> Ilari: Gnutls holds onto the data and size, so it can pick up where it left off if you do the NULL/0 thing
[17:10:21] <eternaleye> Ilari: That's likely it keeping it for the case where a send() in the _middle_ failed - it needs to track position in the buffer
[17:30:43] <Ilari> Haha, Dan Brown preferring ECDSA instead of Schnorr.
[17:58:41] <bascule> heh
[17:58:41] <bascule> yeah
[18:00:58] <Ilari> Also, deterministic blinding for r? That is just plain unsafe if rG is not constant-time anyway.
[18:03:41] <Ilari> And nondeterministic blinding needs random values...
[18:06:29] <Ilari> As how EdDSA deals with that hash problem, it requires fixed hash length.
[18:20:25] <Ilari> I looked at gnutls internals, looks like gnutls_record_send sends the accepted part of data as one record.
[18:20:50] <Ilari> -> One could run the thing in SEQPACKET mode.
[18:32:34] <Ilari> Well, at least there was some discussion, if not new proposal of different type.

[20:25:56] <bascule> eternaleye: lolol
[20:28:22] <Tiffany> is there any benefit to big endian than a kind of misplaced ideological purity
[20:29:29] <bascule> Ilari: " Your proposal's making PH (pre-hash) optional seems to be an instance of
[20:29:32] <bascule> option #3 from the IUF CFRG poll, but the CFRG chairs seem to require option
[20:29:35] <bascule> #1 from the poll."
[20:29:38] <bascule> ^^^ grumble grumble
[20:29:43] <bascule> (from me, re #1 over #3)
[20:29:53] <bascule> Tiffany: foolish consistency!
[20:30:18] <bascule> and an adherence to mathematical purity over mechanical sympathy
[20:30:28] <Tiffany> is it mathematically pure
[20:30:33] <Tiffany> it seemed like one of those arbitrary things to me
[20:30:37] <Tiffany> like column-major vs row-major
[20:30:58] <Tiffany> I mean sure, the way numbers are written in english is most-significant-digit first
[20:32:15] <bascule> I mean, effectively little endian "won" when it comes to CPUs people actually use
[20:32:25] <bascule> if there are CPUs that support both, they're mostly running in little endian mode
[20:32:40] <bascule> converting from little -> big -> little is needless complexity
[20:33:09] <bascule> I think some people are confused that there's a nonexistent IETF document somewhere that demands on high that all numbers serialized to the network be big endian
[20:35:05] <Tiffany> from what I've seen, CPUs that support both are usually run in little, and CPUs which are exclusively big endian often have instructions for quickly converting from little endian
[20:35:07] <Ilari> Statements like "CFRG poll result doesn't say anything about (doesn't recommend and doesn't prohibit)" don't help.
[20:35:12] <Tiffany> I don't know if x86 can load big endian quickly
[20:35:44] <Ilari> Tiffany: Well, it has bswap instruction. And some x86 CPUs have load big endian instruction.
[20:36:15] <Tiffany> hm, two bswaps for a 32-bit word?
[20:38:42] <eternaleye> Tiffany: Big-endian has some benefits in network handling, if you can switch as bits of the address stream in
[20:38:59] <eternaleye> Tiffany: However, for general purpose computing, little-endian has many advantages
[20:39:13] <Tiffany> sure
[20:39:22] <eternaleye> Tiffany: Including that if you truncate an N-byte value to an M-byte value where M < N, the address *does not change*
[20:39:29] <eternaleye> Tiffany: On big-endian, it does.
[20:39:34] <Tiffany> yeah
[20:40:17] <eternaleye> Another is that significance and memory address increase in the same direction
[20:40:31] <eternaleye> So doing a radix sort gets easier
[20:56:48] <Ilari> Oh yah, I think I actually got consistent interpretation of the (weak) consensus chairs called regardin IUF.

[21:29:39] <bascule> Ilari: yeah that was... annoying
[21:36:16] <Ilari> And that consistency does include the infamous "doesn't recommend and doesn't prohibit" statement.
[21:43:02] <eternaleye> Ilari: Amusing how close those initials come to "Derp'd"

[22:06:14] <Ilari> Simon seems to really like EdDSA for some reason...
[22:11:06] <bascule> hahaha yeah Ilari
[22:12:43] <bascule> does defining an OID for EdDSA+Curve41417 make sense until someone's actually implemented EdDSA+Curve41417 (provided it's even possible)?
[22:15:14] <Ilari> EdDSA+Curve41417 is AFAIK not possible (curve does not meet constraints).
[22:15:30] <Ilari> EdDSA-like schemeas with Curve41417 are possible.
[22:16:25] <Ilari> Main points there are defintion of Curve41417 point encoding and the hash function to use (plus seed/a generation).
[22:17:04] <Ilari> seed/a generation do not affect interop between signing/verification, only between signers (private key).
[22:18:23] <Ilari> Also, the examples look to be wrong. :-)
[22:19:47] <Ilari> Combining some of the docs by Simon would yield everything one needs to use Ed25519 in TLS.
[22:22:12] <Tiffany> bascule: uh, how does key lookup in whiteout work?
[22:22:26] <Ilari> One possible encoding for EdDSA with those larger curves is next-bit encoding (bit 6 of byte 51 for Curve41417, bit0 of byte 56 for Curve448). And use SHA-512 for both.
[22:22:38] <Tiffany> it doesn't use the public key servers, does it?
[22:22:51] <Tiffany> I just found out that they don't verify email addresses
[22:24:05] <bascule> Tiffany: yes
[22:25:10] <Tiffany> there are three keys for my email address, and one of them isn't me
[22:25:59] <Tiffany> bascule: wtf?
[22:29:47] <bascule> :(
[22:29:52] <bascule> needs better key directories

[22:44:57] <Ilari> Oh yup, draft-josefsson-pkix-eddsa-02 + draft-josefsson-tls-eddsa2-02
[22:56:51] <c74d> a keyserver should perhaps be thought of more as a public file-hosting service than an authoritative directory of people

[22:58:06] <eternaleye> Honestly, keyservers should be tied to the IDs the keys are over
[22:58:49] <eternaleye> Wasn't there an SMTP extension to interrogate the key associated with an address?
[22:59:34] <Ilari> Also, no discussion of implications of putting seed at beginning of one hash and running two hashes in parallel?
[23:00:03] <Ilari> And I don't mean security implications, but implications to protocols using signing.
[23:05:32] <Tiffany> howcome the chacha RFC messed with the nonce/block size layout?
[23:06:23] <Tiffany> eternaleye: it probably wouldn't work very well with the federated sync model they have
[23:06:54] <Tiffany> I don't think there's really a way to get proof someone owns an email address like you can with twitter or github keybase signature things, either
[23:07:35] <eternaleye> Tiffany: I mean that I think the entire HKP/out-of-band model is busted
[23:07:57] <eternaleye> Tiffany: You should be asking the mail server for gmail.com if foo@gmail.com has a key
[23:08:06] <Tiffany> yeah
[23:08:35] <eternaleye> Tiffany: And then using web-of-trust to make sure they aren't pulling a fast one
[23:08:51] <eternaleye> The former protects against fake uploads
[23:08:59] <eternaleye> The latter protects against malicious providers
[23:09:17] <eternaleye> Currently, web-of-trust is having to protect against both
[23:18:16] <Ilari> I think such double-pipe construction would be really "fun" with TLS 1.2 CertificateVerify.
[23:19:11] <eternaleye> Ilari: My opinion of TLS is rapidly approaching "Made entirely from DF levels of !!FUN!!"
[23:19:23] <Ilari> DF?

[23:23:08] <eternaleye> Yup
[23:23:27] <eternaleye> The Dwarf Fortress tagline is "Losing is fun"
[23:23:35] <eternaleye> Where "losing" means "everything dies"
[23:23:49] <eternaleye> And items that are on fire are denoted by surrounding the name with !!
[23:46:54] <bascule> https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tls-tls13-06
[23:52:23] <Ilari> Well, at least it doesn't contain all the WIP stuff.
[23:54:27] <Ilari> And thus might (almost) be implementable. :->
