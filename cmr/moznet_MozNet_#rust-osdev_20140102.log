[19:29:35] <hejo> may someone contrast systems dev with rust vs c please?
[19:30:06] <_Lucretia_> Tobba: yo
[19:30:16] <Tobba> 'ey
[19:30:26] <_Lucretia_> hejo: i didn't think it'd be possible or nice enough
[19:30:56] <hejo> well it's not that a new systems dev lang can't come out and displace C, it'd just take some serious merit
[19:31:01] <hejo> i'd love to see it
[19:31:06] <hejo> but i'm not holding my breath
[19:31:22] <Tobba> I expirmented with Rust a bit, I was considering porting some of the parts of my system that only shuffle about other parts to Rust
[19:31:25] <_Lucretia_> well, they managed to write one in java, so it's possible

[19:57:09] <cmr> hejo: there's not really a big difference, besides that writing data structures is harder since the compiler enforces correctness.
[19:57:40] <cmr> and that if the rust code compiles it's safe :)
[19:58:02] <Tobba> * unless unsafe is involved
[19:58:17] <cmr> well obviously
[19:59:11] <Tobba> the thing with osdev and why I kinda dropped the idea of rust is that I couldent find any way to make an unsafe pointer safe
[19:59:45] <cmr> what do you mean?
[19:59:48] <Tobba> and with osdev you have lots and lots of unsafe data
[20:00:14] <Tobba> if I do
[20:00:31] <Tobba> 0x1000 as *i8, I get an unsafe pointer, but from what I can see theres no way to make the pointer "safe"
[20:00:41] <cmr> transmute it into the type you want.
[20:01:00] <cmr> let x: &i8 = transmute(0x1000 as *i8)
[20:01:06] <Tobba> oh
[20:01:16] <Tobba> thats great actually
[20:01:39] <cmr> transmute lets you do any conversion between types of the same size
[20:02:20] <cmr> shouldn't even need that as *i8
[20:02:44] <cmr> rusti: let x: &i8 = unsafe { std::cast::transmute(0x1000) }; println!("{:p}", x);
[20:02:48] -rusti- pastebinned 10 lines of output: http://ix.io/9Dq
[20:03:08] <cmr> rusti: let x: &i8 = unsafe { std::cast::transmute(0x1000) }; println!("{:?}", x);
[20:03:09] -rusti- &application terminated abnormally with signal 11 (Segmentation fault)
[20:03:13] <Tobba> what does transmute actually do internally
[20:03:14] <cmr> heh
[20:03:32] <cmr> it's a type cast. it's an intrinsic, no runtime anything.
[20:03:39] <Tobba> oh
[20:03:50] <Tobba> yep this is great
[20:04:28] <Tobba> is there any way to make fixed size arrays
[20:04:38] <cmr> [T, ..N] where T is the type and N is the length
[20:05:06] <cmr> rusti: let x: [u8, ..48] = [0, ..48]; x
[20:05:08] -rusti- pastebinned 1 lines of output: http://ix.io/9Dr
[20:05:14] <_Lucretia_> weird
[20:05:27] <hejo> nice
[20:05:31] * _Lucretia_ will stick with Ada
[20:05:41] <Tobba> well
[20:05:43] <Tobba> I think that sets it
[20:05:43] <sbalmos> LOL
[20:05:56] <sbalmos> and so begins Rust Kernel #23427261
[20:05:57] <sbalmos> :)
[20:05:59] <Tobba> (Rust really should get better documentation though)
[20:06:09] <Tobba> I mean theres the gigantic manual but who wants to read THAT
[20:06:46] <Tobba> I never actually managed to find much information on rustc other than what I could gather from --help, anyways
[20:06:58] <Tobba> I should read some of that gigantic page
[20:07:08] <cmr> the manual isn't all that useful
[20:07:20] <Tobba> yeah that was kinda what I thought
[20:07:26] <cmr> http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/master/tutorial.html#what-next
[20:07:40] <cmr> but #rust is the primary source of documentation until someone writes some :)
[20:07:53] <Tobba> hahahaha
[20:07:57] <cmr> all the docs are getting rewritten and restructured
[20:08:10] <Tobba> that was also my concern when trying to figure out if I should port parts of my kernel to it or not
[20:08:13] <cmr> there's some stuff in the queue already, some of it is blocking 0.9
[20:08:28] <Tobba> I'd leave all the unsafe as fuck guts in C++ and port over the general shuffling about of components to rust
[20:09:19] <Tobba> though, a concern with that is that C++ FFI would have to work
[20:09:28] <Tobba> I dont think much work was done on that was there
[20:09:47] <cmr> there's no C++ FFI at all
[20:09:49] <cmr> just C
[20:10:05] <Tobba> well yeah
[20:10:23] <Tobba> though I could just declare the mangled function names as externs
[20:10:29] <Tobba> and make horrible assumptions about calling convention
[20:11:21] <cmr> or just use extern "C" { ... } :)
[20:12:11] <Tobba> well that works too I guess
[20:12:32] <Tobba> I actually have much of the framework in place required to support rust, heck, I even have kernel coroutines, so I can support spawn etc
[20:14:36] <sbalmos> I never quite realized how much of a mess it is to init a 64-bit kernel, even with Multiboot
[20:14:49] <Tobba> hahaha yep
[20:14:55] <Tobba> god 64 bit is a special kind of mess
[20:14:59] <Tobba> you sort of need ACPI in there
[20:15:35] <hejo> rust is looking great, but i'm going to give it another year or two and then decide which systems dev lang to switch to from C
[20:15:45] <Tobba> oh that reminds me, maybe I should consider rewriting the entire kernel in rust, I cant tell what to do
[20:15:51] <hejo> there's enough demand and time passed that i think it's going to happen this time
[20:15:54] <cmr> Tobba: I suggest not touching Rust yet :)
[20:16:12] <cmr> Unless you're crazy and want to deal with the craziness.
[20:16:17] <sbalmos> oh c'mon, slice your hand with a rusty bleeding edge blade.
[20:16:22] <sbalmos> You need a new tetanus shot
[20:16:31] <Tobba> been there, done that
