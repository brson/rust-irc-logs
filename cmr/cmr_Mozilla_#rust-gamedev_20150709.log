[03:23:37] <Kingsquee> I am so sad
[03:24:00] <Elaine> wait what?
[03:24:04] <Elaine> why are you sad and happy?
[03:24:34] <Kingsquee> [ The unfortunate part about passing this flag to the linker is that we have to preprocess the rlib to remove the metadata and compressed bytecode found within. This means that creating a dylib will now take longer to link (...) ]
[03:24:42] <Elaine> sure
[03:24:55] <Elaine> presumably it doesn't take *that* long though
[03:25:27] *** Quits: palodequeso (quassel@moz-i85m6b.pa.comcast.net) (A TLS packet with unexpected length was received.)
[03:25:31] <Kingsquee> https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/19183
[03:25:40] <Kingsquee> enough for it to have gotten rejected the first time
[03:25:55] <Kingsquee> [So linking time has increased 0.167 -> 0.564, and it would be more if there are more dependencies. Right now I'm not sure if this is a right approach..]
[03:26:06] <Elaine> that's for hello world though
[03:26:13] <Elaine> and for the smallest executable
[03:26:19] <Elaine> with the full cost of all of std's transitive deps
[03:27:11] <Kingsquee> if that's supposed to be reassuring, I'm not following
[03:27:38] <Elaine> so only for dylibs mixed with rlibs say you pay, from that, ~30ms for each dep
[03:27:57] <Kingsquee> yup
[03:28:00] <Elaine> which is a very uncommon situation, and probably only in the last step of compilation (producting the final artifact)
[03:28:17] *** Joins: palodequeso (quassel@moz-i85m6b.pa.comcast.net)
[03:28:55] <Kingsquee> I've been making a framework that compiles instructions into dylibs for hotloading
[03:29:05] <Kingsquee> and since cargo forcibly compiles damn near everything to rlibs
[03:29:16] <Kingsquee> it's common enough for me
[03:29:19] <sp3d> dylibs 4 lyfe
[03:29:26] <Kingsquee> dylib pride
[03:29:44] <Elaine> So the fix there is to not use rlibs everywhere
[03:29:56] <Kingsquee> oh yes, I know
[03:30:37] <Kingsquee> but cargo seems to put that beyond the scope of my control
[03:31:01] *** Joins: SHC (quassel@moz-7v4.348.3.61.IP)

[03:34:03] <Kingsquee> I've mentioned it in #cargo before, but the reaction's been, at best, reluctant
[03:35:16] <Kingsquee> http://doc.crates.io/manifest.html#building-dynamic-or-static-libraries
[03:35:32] <Elaine> Implement it yourself? That'd also help for code size assuming your plugins share a lot of code.
[03:35:46] <Elaine> On the other hand, it means they all need to use the same versions of every dependency.
[03:36:02] <Elaine> Which is hard to guarantee for plugins
[03:36:14] <Elaine> Also passing objects across the plugin boundary is challenging to do correctly.
[03:36:35] <Kingsquee> the latter's not a problem with my use case, anyway
[03:36:44] <Kingsquee> (versioning)
[03:36:58] <Elaine> if you say so
[03:37:17] <Kingsquee> it's mainly for development, so each plugin is just a rust source file
[03:37:33] <Kingsquee> it recompiles whatever needs to be recompiled
[03:39:48] <Kingsquee> guess I could fork cargo again

[08:53:02] <Elaine> https://github.com/geal/nom
[08:57:05] <OmniMancer> that will probably help but doesn't really help with the arbitrary bitfields
[08:58:14] <Elaine> you're right, I see why now.
[08:58:15] <aatch> OmniMancer, I have a bitstream library I've been working on.
[08:58:47] <OmniMancer> aatch: :)
[08:58:50] <aatch> OmniMancer, it's mostly untested and only has the reader side, so it's not on crates.io, but I can throw it on github if you like.
[08:59:26] <OmniMancer> shrug, I will probably use nom and just take apart the requisite bytes manually
[08:59:57] <Elaine> I use a combination of https://github.com/bluss/fixedbitset and https://github.com/cmr/rust-bitmap myself.
[09:01:14] <OmniMancer> that seems useful
[09:02:26] <Elaine> I really ought to fix bitmap, I don't remember if it's still broken.
[09:02:32] <Elaine> worked for my filesystem driver though
[09:03:10] <OmniMancer> FLAC isn't too bad about it though
[09:04:45] <OmniMancer> though I am a bit confused about the wasted bits per sample flag :/
[09:07:16] <aatch> Oh, I figured that out, but I've forgotten...
[09:08:41] <OmniMancer> its pretty clear how its coded I just don't understand what its even for
[09:09:12] <OmniMancer> there is a bit, if its 0 the number is 0 ifits 1 then the number is 1+ the number of 0s before the next 1
[09:09:42] <OmniMancer> why does rust-bitmap use usize
[09:10:04] <OmniMancer> it seems like a terrible idea because you can have code that will work fine on 64 bit, then break horribly on 32 bit
[09:10:50] <OmniMancer> any by break I mean refuse to work
[09:11:46] <aatch> OmniMancer, I *think* it's how many bits-per-sample will never contain any data.
[09:12:27] <aatch> OmniMancer, so if you have 32-bit samples, then a bits-wasted-per-sample of 2, the samples for that subframe are actually 30-bits.
[09:12:41] <OmniMancer> mhmm
[09:13:05] <OmniMancer> but everything either uses the bits per sample of the block or does entropy coding of things...
[09:13:07] <aatch> OmniMancer, the reference impl shifts the samples wasted_bits right
[09:13:16] <aatch> OmniMancer, after decoding.
[09:13:22] <OmniMancer> ah
[09:13:49] <OmniMancer> unless it shifts the samples before hand to make them more compressable or something :/

[18:25:18] <jpernst> FerrousOxide, you can't, unless Pixel were a type parameter of GenericImage

[18:28:49] <jpernst> Only the author could answer that, but in terms of technical reasons, not really, it's just an API decision with tradeoffs

[18:30:05] <WindowsBunny> or is it already not object safe?
[18:30:29] <jpernst> i think it would be (and is) object safe
[18:31:10] <jpernst> the main thing that kills object safety is if you have methods that take self by value
[18:31:16] <FerrousOxide> but they way things are, it is not generic if it can only be associated with one type of Pixel? or is that a shortcoming of DynamicImage?
[18:31:17] <jpernst> something else might do it, but i forget
[18:32:35] <jpernst> DynamicImage only currently provides u8 pixel formats

[18:34:07] <jpernst> for now you can probably bypass DynamicImage and use ImageBuf directly with a u16 format
[18:34:14] <jpernst> that requires you to know ahead of time what you're loading though

[18:38:23] <jpernst> if it were me i'd probably have GenericImage have a pixel type of normalized floats, and if you wanted the actual bytes you'd need to destructure it to the actual image type that it is
[18:39:58] <FerrousOxide> Why can;t it just carry the pixel type as a parameter all the way through saving or converting to another type when it is actually required to know the type
[18:40:20] <FerrousOxide> then those functions can be implemented for each type 
[18:40:34] <jpernst> ImageBuf already does that
[18:40:48] <FerrousOxide> then what is the benefit of DynamicImage?
[18:41:58] <jpernst> DynamicImage is just an enum of common image types so you can get the actual concrete type
[18:42:19] <jpernst> you could add a u16 tiff to DynamicImage no problem, it's GenericImage that's blocking you since it needs to be able to encompass anything

[18:44:50] <FerrousOxide> but when saving u16s endianness has to be considered when converting to &[u8], I would have preferred to defer it to as late as possible
[18:45:52] *** Joins: eerie (eerie@moz-qbn2t0.red.bezeqint.net)
[18:46:32] <jpernst> i think in save_buffer's case, the u8 just means "byte stream" not pixel width, but that's just my impression
[18:47:03] <jpernst> in that case the tiff saver would probably transmute the slice into a &[u16]
[18:48:16] <jpernst> that would preserve platform endianness since the bytes aren't being individually packed or unpacked
[18:48:47] <FerrousOxide> yeah and it would have to do that twice, once when calling save_buffer u16 to u8 and then agian in the encoder, u8 to u16
