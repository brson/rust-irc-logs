[00:10:04] <Gankro> Booooo marking big-Oh stuff
[00:11:10] <reem> huh?
[00:11:27] <reem> are we adding O(..) annotations to the collections APIs?
[00:12:18] <Gankro> reem: No TAing
[00:12:28] <Gankro> 160 Big-Oh proofs in a row is exhausting
[00:12:51] <reem> that sounds like a bunch
[00:13:38] <Gankro> The most frustrating part is how... interpretive it is
[00:14:58] <reem> Do you get to just +1 the right answer or are you doing more extensive grading
[00:15:03] <Gankro> Like here's some psuedo-math on this page. I could probably give them 0 on the grounds of what they wrote is incoherent. But I can vaguely see what they're trying to say. But if they don't write much they somehow have it easier because I have more room for interpretation. If they write their actual thought process I'm liable to dock them marks because it's
[00:15:03] <Gankro> probably wrong
[00:15:49] <reem> I have definitely done that intentionally before
[00:15:59] <Gankro> The class is trying to focus on the process of proofs over actual math. But at some limit dogshit math is dogshit.
[00:16:28] <Gankro> And if you *only* focused on structure you would get like 100% for vaguely apeing what you saw in class
[00:16:28] <reem> I feel like math and proofs are already pretty close
[00:16:29] <scott> shorter proofs should definitely be preferred
[00:16:56] <scott> if it takes a lot of words to explain they probably don't understand very well
[00:17:04] <Gankro> It doesn't help that formal Big-Oh proofs are so worthless
[00:17:11] <reem> scott: So so so so true
[00:17:43] <Gankro> And then there's shit where it's like "you wrote a correct proof but then you kept writing and now this is garbage"
[00:17:57] <reem> hahaha, ya, take yes for an answer :P
[00:18:13] <Gankro> reem: Eh, highschool math is more computation than proving
[00:18:23] <Gankro> And a lot of uni math, too
[00:18:47] <Gankro> I took a whole math class that was basically "run simplex by hand"
[00:19:08] <scott> I got the proofs stuff from my CS class called "discrete math and logic" or something to that effect
[00:19:20] <Gankro> scott: Yeah that's this class
[00:19:25] <Gankro> discrete math 1
[00:19:51] <scott> I did big-oh in the intro to data structures/algorithms course
[00:20:15] <reem> Fundamentally the issue is that from the student’s perspective the assignment is at least 50% about getting a good grade, so they’re likely to optimize for that rather than understand
[00:20:32] <Gankro> Honestly I think that's a better place to discuss Big-Oh. No one cares what the mathematics of big-oh is. It's the fudge-the-constants-take-the-big-thing operator
[00:20:40] <reem> at least that is my experience of what happens when you introduce grades and other such rankings
[00:20:48] <Gankro> reem: Totally
[00:20:53] <scott> yeah. we learned the math but most people forget the precise definition
[00:20:54] <reem> I agree with your point too :)
[00:21:08] <Gankro> On the other hand how do you make students give a fuck? Or is it even the schools responsibility to try?
[00:21:39] <scott> my discrete math course was more about propositional calc, predicate calc, what the different connectives mean, induction (mostly just with natural numbers), formal proofs, and for some horrible reason, SQL
[00:21:41] <reem> ime from hack reactor the best way to get a group of really good students is just to let them self-select
[00:21:55] <Gankro> reem: self-select?
[00:21:59] <scott> they built up to SQL with relational algebra and relational calculus but that was the least useful part of the course
[00:22:22] <reem> everyone at hack reactor is really enthusiastic about learning/understanding even though there are no grades, there isn’t even a certificate, because everyone self-selected to be there and try to get value
[00:22:30] <scott> we also learned a handful of random things like the pigeonhole principle, which is neat
[00:23:01] <Gankro> reem: In theory everyone's self-selected to be in university, no?
[00:23:06] *** Quits: brson (brson@moz-e9i.crj.56.172.IP) (Quit: leaving)
[00:23:07] <reem> i.e. their explicit goal in joining is not to do well at the program but to learn a lot.
[00:23:15] <Gankro> Ah, I see
[00:23:32] <reem> Gankro: Right, but the presence of grades/certificates/etc. shifts what it actually makes sense to optimize for
[00:23:40] <reem> from the student’s perspective
[00:23:58] <scott> also, students don't necessarily self-select for a given class, just for the degree overall
[00:24:03] <Gankro> reem: I imagine you had a more manageable scale than 300 student classes too
[00:24:12] <reem> if I’m at harvard my number 1 goal is to leave with an impressive resume, I’m still gonna learn more on the job in the next 5 years so my actual understanding doesn’t matter as much
[00:24:14] <scott> e.g. I had to take a software engineering course and it was a waste of my time
[00:24:50] <Gankro> scott: well, technically that's an accurate demonstration of the topic :P
[00:24:56] <scott> heh
[00:25:08] <scott> but I already knew that about it before I took it
[00:25:13] <reem> Gankro: The issue is just generally that people self-select for college and courses for non-understanding reasons, and often don’t self-select at all (parents, mandatory courses).

[00:26:05] <reem> For instance, if I decide to actually go to college next year, the place I’m admitted to has a bunch of mandatory intro stuff, so I’m gonna be bored out of my mind learning hello world in java for a semester
[00:26:06] <Gankro> reem: Unfortunately we're fairly stuck with university-as-a-system, so how can we extract value from that?

[00:26:31] <scott> to add to the final point, also the thought that "I need to get a degree to be successful" or "extended highschool"
[00:26:51] <scott> some people just don't know what to do, so university lets them delay the decision
[00:27:21] <Gankro> scott: Sure, but we might as well try to give them something worthwhile while they think it out
[00:27:22] <reem> the most common freshman major at tons of schools is undecided
[00:27:32] <reem> I don’t really have a better system, this is mostly me griping :)
[00:27:34] <pingveno> reem: That was my major.
[00:27:40] <pingveno> Technically speaking
[00:28:48] <pingveno> My brother found out that his passion was in film, but it took a couple of hops.
[00:30:02] <scott> my life path has been decided since one of my dad's coworkers handed out ubuntu CDs at his office when I was in middle school
[00:30:04] <scott> bless that man
[00:30:17] <reem> Gankro: Don’t get me wrong, I still think there is value in the college system, that’s why I’m considering going next year at all, I just don’t necessarily think it’s still the best way to produce people who are really good at field x. 
[00:30:49] <reem> specifically for software engineering, I have no experience seriously educating people about other stuff beyond a high school level
[00:31:01] <scott> reem: I don't even think that's the goal of university, or if it is, it's not even close to achieving it
[00:31:19] <scott> I personally loved university just because I like learning almost everything, including all my electives
[00:31:20] <Gankro> reem: Yeah CS degrees are shit at educating programmers
[00:31:34] <reem> scott: Definitely, most of the reasons I’m considering university have not a lot to do with academics.
[00:32:05] <Gankro> scott: unfortunately no one *at* university seems to be able to tell me what the point*is*
[00:32:23] <scott> the point for me is that I like it :p
[00:32:50] <Gankro> reem: Software engineering in university is a complete joke as far as I can tell. It's a bunch of old men clinging to UML and waterfall
[00:33:09] <scott> CS is a really confused field, at least at my university. it's cut up between teaching SE/programming/engineering on the one hand and math/what I actually call "CS" on the other hand
[00:33:38] <scott> can confirm UML is alive and well in my intro CS classes
[00:33:58] <scott> except with the younger profs who actually understand the world to some extent
[00:33:59] <reem> Gankro: woo…
[00:34:44] <Gankro> To paraphrase my SE prof: "Agile is doing whatever works for you. Waterfall works for me, therefore waterfall is agile"
[00:34:58] <reem> hahaha
[00:35:02] *** dmu is now known as dmu|away
[00:35:28] <scott> teaching is passing your own misunderstandings on to trusting minds
[00:35:33] <Gankro> reem: I would seriously avoid uni unless you need the creds or want to go into academia itself
[00:35:53] <Gankro> Although maybe my school is *really* shit, and other schools actually no what's going on
[00:39:12] <reem> Ya, I dunno.
[00:39:25] <reem> I’ve had *a lot* of conflicting advice and discussion about this
[00:40:20] <Gankro> Any theory you might be able to glean I could probably teach you in a few months :P
[00:40:52] <bstrie> the point of going to college is to learn that the point of going to college isn't to learn
[00:41:46] <Gankro> tl;dr linked hash map is the best theoretical collection. fibonacci heap is the best theoretical queue. Both of these are really poor choices in practice. Amortization is great. Randomization is ok but everyone is scared of it.
[00:42:11] <bstrie> randoization === random memoization
[00:42:17] <reem> tbh I’m actually more concerned about the social aspects since I’ve already basically given up on it being a good career/engineering knowledge move
[00:42:24] <scott> my algorithms class went into a lot more depth than that
[00:42:31] <scott> it was also very hard
[00:42:41] <Gankro> reem: It seems like you've already built a pretty legit social network?
[00:42:43] <scott> I'm considering taking the advanced algorithms class in my final year
[00:43:06] <reem> Gankro: Ya, but basically none of them are my age. It doesn’t usually bother me much, but.. it can be challenging.
[00:43:17] <Gankro> reem: How old are you?
[00:43:20] <reem> 18
[00:43:26] <reem> almost 19 at this point
[00:43:36] <reem> my birthday is two days after rust 1.0 :)
[00:43:45] <Gankro> Oh wow, how'd you end up working at Hack Reactor?
[00:44:22] <reem> My high school is weird and graduates a few months early, so I went to Hack Reactor as something productive to do before college, then upon witnessing adult life, I took a gap year and they hired me
[00:44:36] <reem> ^ is the short version
[00:44:39] <Gankro> heh
[00:45:43] <Gankro> More important than anything, though. If you go to uni and the stress/depression destroys your glorious hair it will be a travesty

[05:49:05] <XMPPwocky> but that's firefox
[05:49:20] <XMPPwocky> at least in Chrome, it doesn't blow up your whole browser (just a tab)
[05:49:24] <whipsch> what was that file:// bug in osx a while ago
[05:49:26] <whipsch> that was neat

[05:51:56] <cmr> there was that fun CoreText bug too.

[05:52:35] <XMPPwocky> okay good we're fine
[05:52:37] <whipsch> no fires burning
[05:52:39] <whipsch> seems okay
[05:52:51] <||> or those affected are behind zncs
[05:53:18] <whipsch> there was actually a funny irc related crash for a long long time
[05:53:33] <XMPPwocky> whipsch: yeah, but be careful talking about it
[05:53:39] <whipsch> a lot of routers would inspect connections on common irc ports for a dcc send initiation
[05:53:40] <XMPPwocky> a lot of IRCDs will gline you for it
[05:53:42] <whipsch> yeah i almost typed it
[05:53:43] <whipsch> haha
[05:53:44] <XMPPwocky> hilariously enough
[05:53:51] <whipsch> well there were a few

[05:54:37] <||> lel ath0
[05:54:44] <whipsch> the original
[05:55:32] <whipsch> but anywya || a lot of routers tried to pre-open ports for dcc transfers, and many implementations were terrible
[05:55:40] <whipsch> so you could craft a fake dcc initiation
[05:55:46] <whipsch> and drop people with bad routers
[05:56:21] <whipsch> and by craft i mean
[05:56:29] <whipsch> type dcc send in all caps and put some junk in quotes

[18:05:17] <reem> in rust it’d probably be called Map

[18:05:25] <scott> Map conflicts with map data types

[18:07:58] <scott> it's actually a good exercise to try to come up with more evocative name for common Haskell things

[18:08:31] <scott> functor also has a different usage in C++
[18:08:35] <scott> no idea where they got that from
[18:08:46] <scott> functor and vector and map are all really overloaded terms
[18:09:02] <scott> well, functor is only overloaded when you combine Haskell and C++
[18:09:40] <tiffany> C++ reuses all kinds of terms strangely
[18:10:26] <scott> and comes up with the opaquest acronyms
[18:10:31] <scott> RAII, SFINAE, ADL
[18:11:12] <tiffany> RAII is a quite strange one
[18:11:15] <scott> all of which are complicated, except maybe RAII which is okay
[18:11:24] <scott> but RAII is the least sensibly named
[18:11:51] <tiffany> like.. resource acquisition is initialization? how is that supposed to translate into scoped ownership rules?
[18:11:59] <proc> I hate different java versions and trying to use them..
[18:12:08] <proc> eclipse should switch to rust -.-
[18:12:42] <tiffany> like.. it sounds kind of like it's trying to express that you can 'acquire' resources using copy and move constructors
[18:12:49] <tiffany> but that still says nothing about destructors

[21:47:54] <barosl> http://hitchhikersclojure.com/blog/hitchhikers-guide-to-clojure/
[21:47:55] <barosl> lol
[21:48:09] <barosl> The first image made me just laugh
[21:48:31] <barosl> Cause that's what I have been imagining what Clojure is
[21:49:20] <barosl> Dear Clojure users, is that true? Am I OK not to be afraid of parentheses?
[21:49:34] <fmtq> no be afraid it's insane
[21:49:45] <barosl> Are you really a Clojure user?
[21:49:51] <fmtq> yes
[21:50:08] <fmtq> I am telling the truth when I say I don't lie on the internet.
[21:50:26] <barosl> Hell, how can you be! I thought every LISP user defends on the parantheses to the death
[21:50:39] <fmtq> Clojure is not LISP 
[21:50:43] <lahwran> yes it is
[21:50:48] <fmtq> it is on the JVM so lispers aren't fans.
[21:50:52] <sillesta> (is it?)
[21:50:52] <fmtq> they will say NO OS X IS NOT UNIX 
[21:51:04] <sillesta> lahwran: a dialect of lisp, rather ;)?
[21:51:18] <lahwran> osx is as much unix as linux ;)
[21:51:21] <fmtq> is a lisp syntax on a JVM still a lisp?
[21:51:29] <fmtq> lahwran: no. OS X is based on FreeBSD.
[21:51:30] <lahwran> I'm pretty sure lisps are languages
[21:51:39] <barosl> I also heard that there was a popular Emacs mod that visualizes the LISP-y code beautifully, but unfortunately, I'm not an Emacs user, so...
[21:51:40] <lahwran> fmtq: I'm not sure how what I said contradicts that
[21:51:40] <tiffany> the fun thing about lisp is how if function parameters had static length you wouldn't even need parens
[21:51:51] <fmtq> lahwran: FreeBSD inherits from 4.3BSD 
[21:51:55] <lahwran> fmtq: and...?
[21:52:04] <fmtq> 4.3BSD comes from the family of TRUE UNICES.
[21:52:09] <lahwran> so?
[21:52:13] <tiffany> barosl: the only thing I've seen so far of emacs' lisp-editing powers is really fast autocompletion
[21:52:21] <fmtq> ... it literally inherits code from Unix.
[21:52:24] <fmtq> Linux doesn't.
[21:52:37] <tiffany> uh
[21:52:41] <lahwran> okay, well, I guess it does inherit a little code
[21:52:48] <tiffany> freebsd doesn't contain any code from sysV
[21:53:00] <lahwran> in the sense that freebsd is a total rewrite of it
[21:53:08] <lahwran> but it was an incremental rewrite on top of the original
[21:53:10] <lahwran> w/e
[21:53:13] <barosl> tiffany, I'm more concerned of manipulating the parentheses... Is it like indenting a code? Are editors capable of helping me in this aspect?
[21:53:18] <proc> it inherits the ideas from it, should be enough :P
[21:53:26] <fmtq> do not make me get into the concept of existentiality 
[21:53:29] <tiffany> emacs has very smart indentation, barosl
[21:53:31] <fmtq> we've been here
[21:53:32] <sillesta> barosl: there are plugins for removing opposite parens, yeah
[21:53:32] <fmtq> :D
[21:53:40] <lahwran> my point is that osx isn't based on unix ideas, even if parts of it are code from unix
[21:53:53] <tiffany> I assume there are modes which deal with parens nicely, but I have not used any
[21:53:54] <lahwran> (and I consider this to be a perfectly ok thing)
[21:53:59] <fmtq> anyway thank you for proving my point lahwran
[21:54:04] <fmtq> that LISP people argue nonsense :D
[21:54:14] <barosl> tiffany, O.o So you didn't need them
[21:54:14] <fmtq> barosl: you caused this
[21:54:18] <fmtq> you housebreaker
[21:54:19] <XMPPwocky> fmtq: nonthenth?
[21:54:20] <lahwran> fmtq: I'm not a lisp people
[21:54:24] <lahwran> and I'm here to argue nonsense
[21:54:28] <lahwran> so I don't think I proved your point
[21:54:36] <lahwran> (though I try to keep my nonsense reasonably sensible)
[21:54:37] <tiffany> barosl: I haven't written much of significance in lisp
[21:54:39] <fmtq> let me stop you at "I don't"
[21:54:41] <barosl> fmtq, Sorry, I wasn't careful enough regarding the LISP-y people
[21:54:47] <lahwran> wat
[21:54:54] <tiffany> the nesting of parens doesn't seem to get too deep, though
[21:54:59] <tiffany> it's a lot like rightward drift
[21:54:59] <proc> lahwran: that's basically every argument fight on the net
[21:55:03] <lahwran> yay
[21:55:06] <fmtq> barosl: always wear pwotection
[21:55:36] <fmtq> now everyone just for once accept vim as your lord and saviour
[21:55:38] <lahwran> proc: there's something of a difference between just saying nonsense and saying things that are actively meant to cause argument
[21:55:53] <fmtq> oh
[21:55:56] <fmtq> actively causing argument is much easier
[21:55:59] <proc> lahwran: you won
[21:56:36] <fmtq> Israel is the true successor state of the protectionate of Palestine.
[21:56:39] <lahwran> what
[21:56:46] <lahwran> this is a non sequitor
[21:56:46] * fmtq gets popcorn.
[21:56:47] <proc> lahwran: while I'm still feeling kinda dump by asking some questions about rust :/
[21:57:07] <lahwran> can I have doritos instead of popcorn
[21:57:12] <proc> so: at least you are in the position to willingly write nonsense
[21:57:18] <tiffany> I switched to emacs when I got sick of how unstable vim is with a few dozen plugins, and have yet to have a good enough reason to switch to neovim
[21:57:19] <lahwran> hehe
[21:57:25] <lahwran> proc: don't worry, I'm not good at rust yet either
[21:57:35] <fmtq> I use MS Word for all my coding
[21:57:42] <lahwran> that sounds impressive
[21:57:47] <proc> I'm still trying to get rustcdt for eclipse working..
[21:57:57] <GaryOak_> eclipse!
[21:57:57] <lahwran> cdt == crdt?
[21:58:01] <fmtq> if the method doesn't fit to a page at 12pt Times New Roman
[21:58:03] <fmtq> it's not short enough
[21:58:03] <proc> while he asks me where rust is installed, looking for non existend folders ( except windows installations )
[21:58:35] <proc> *RustDT
[21:58:41] <proc> based on eclipseCDT
[21:58:41] <GaryOak_> ewww coding in Times New Roman
[21:58:59] <proc> GaryOak_: that's point of your settings..
[21:59:02] <lahwran> what is cdt
[21:59:02] <sillesta> monospace is so yesterday..
[21:59:10] <sillesta> lahwran: c/c++ toolchain for eclipse
[21:59:11] <lahwran> I use non-monospace in irc now, actually
[21:59:13] <lahwran> sillesta: oic
[21:59:21] <GaryOak_> lahwran: get outta here!
[21:59:23] <lahwran> I don't see ascii art and such, but it actually feels nice
[21:59:34] <lahwran> which is weird, because two years ago I would have felt like you
[21:59:35] * lahwran shrugs
[21:59:50] * GaryOak_ lolz
[22:00:06] <proc> sitting here using hexchat, hating the guys activating playbot so my border line gets moved into the mid -.-
[22:00:30] <GaryOak_> I use limechat on my macintosh ;)
[22:00:31] <proc> according to hexchat I'm using atm "Consolas 10" as font
[22:00:37] <lahwran> what does playbot do that moves your border line?
[22:01:01] <fmtq> Quassel.
[22:01:02] <fmtq> always
[22:01:25] <proc> lahwran: sry my English .. the line between usernames and their msg
[22:01:37] <lahwran> I don't like quassel
[22:01:42] <lahwran> I use it tho
[22:01:51] <lahwran> it has some features I love
[22:01:56] <lahwran> as a whole it's kind of annoying though
[22:01:56] <proc> and it's quite thin the column of the names, except sb activated the playbot: -playbot/#rust-
[22:02:07] <lahwran> oh, I see
[22:02:22] <lahwran> I have like 60 chars of nick column
[22:02:30] <lahwran> no particular reason why

[22:03:57] <lahwran> it's not meaningfully worse than hexchat, and some notable things about it are nicer
