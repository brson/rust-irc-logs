[13:51:30] <eddyb> after that, I could just go for hours
[13:51:57] <eddyb> I couldn't do that on a virtual touch keyboard :(

[13:54:50] <eddyb> hmpf. I don't like how the developer edition was like $600
[13:55:00] <eddyb> (and at some point I had the money to order it)
[13:55:09] <eddyb> and now it's $3k+ :(

[13:57:03] <eddyb> then again, I'm not profession enough for Rust, that's just waaay over my head

[14:05:12] <eddyb> that "all" was misleading, sorry
[14:06:14] <huon> and by "misleading" you mean "wrong", right? :P
[14:06:24] <eddyb> ooooh https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Rail
[14:07:06] <eddyb> can we name that "Something Phoenix Something" if we ever bring it back?
[14:07:25] <huon> "something" doesn't quite have the right ring to it, I feel
[14:07:42] <eddyb> my latin is pretty bad :(
[14:07:43] <huon> seems a little generic
[14:08:03] <eddyb> I don't know how to add "phoenix" to "Aphanapteryx bonasia"
[14:08:08] <huon> romanian is pretty close to latin, so yours would be far better than most of ours :P
[14:08:40] <eddyb> The name itself perhaps refers to bonasus, meaning "bull" in Latin, or bonum and assum, meaning "good roast".
[14:09:06] <huon> the latin word for pheonix is phoenix, btw
[14:09:26] <eddyb> well... in Romanian "bull" is "bou", "good" is "bun", and "assum" isn't really close to anything
[14:09:36] <eddyb> so I guess I should've seen half of it
[14:10:15] <huon> bah, I can't spell phoenix consistently, let alone correctly :/
[14:10:45] <eddyb> I've taught myself to pronounce it wrong, just so I can spell it right
[14:11:03] <eddyb> also, I depend on a spellchecker :D
[14:12:15] <eddyb> actually, I pronounce it as /finics/ which doesn't have oe or eo. I guess I just remembered it for some reason
[14:13:14] <huon> well english text doesn't correspond to pronounciation in any sane way, so that's fine :P
[14:13:22] <eddyb> phóinīx in greek... oh, and latin took that, with the phoenīx form
[14:13:35] <huon> and the IPA from wikitionary is ˈfiːnɪks
[14:13:51] <huon> fee-nics
[14:13:59] <eddyb> right, Romanian c is k in IPA
[14:14:19] <eddyb> and I wasn't sure if one of the i's was long
