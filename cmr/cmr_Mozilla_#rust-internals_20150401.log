[00:18:43] <cmr> nrc: I planned on putting in a few hours a week minimum over the beta cycle, and do a redesign over the summer.
[00:19:10] *** Joins: zmack (zmack@moz-htpein.home.aster.pl)
[00:19:32] <cmr> My current thought is that rustdoc's `clean` etc components should be redesigned to be a part of rustc, and unified with metadata and the DXR export stuff.
[00:20:01] <cmr> So there is a single source of truth: metadata, which rustdoc can generate docs from directly.
[00:20:12] <cmr> this is going to need a metadata redesign too
[00:22:18] <cmr> this ties together also with desugaring into a kernel ("MIR" I think I've heard it called?) and having monomorphization work with that

[00:33:37] <nrc> the latter question being a bit tricky

[00:51:12] <reem> aturon: The "two default impls" plan for adding buffers doesn't work with object safety - you can't call the generic method from the non-generic one at all, even if you supply only concrete types (since Self: !Sized and generic methods have to require Self: Sized).
[00:52:19] <reem> basically, you cannot provide a default implementation for the non-generic method in terms of the generic method
[00:52:33] <reem> which blows the whole plan

[12:51:07] <pnkfelix> nmatsakis: I ended up posting my Q on the PR itself
[12:51:13] <nmatsakis> which PR?
[12:51:14] <nmatsakis> :)
[12:51:36] <pnkfelix> nmatsakis: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/23938#commitcomment-10520372
[12:52:03] <nmatsakis> I see; so basically my plan was to delete them before 1.0
[12:52:13] <nmatsakis> but I agree that this does not hold for libs in general

[12:53:55] *** Quits: theme (theme@moz-i3mhhb.asianet.co.th) (Quit: Leaving)
[12:55:40] <pnkfelix> nmatsakis: they were already unstable
[12:55:46] <pnkfelix> nmatsakis: and you added deprecated
[12:55:51] <pnkfelix> nmatsakis: so I  was just musing
[12:56:14] <pnkfelix> nmatsakis: But really, this is more a question: Are library items allowed to transition from unstable -> deprecated -> unstable
[12:56:25] <pnkfelix> nmatsakis: and are only forced to remain deprecated if they were once stable
[12:57:04] <nmatsakis> Why should they ever be *forced* to remain deprecated?
[12:57:13] <nmatsakis> though it seems like a bad idea to undeprecate

[12:57:23] <nmatsakis> and unlikely to occur in practice
[12:57:26] <pnkfelix> nmatsakis: To avoid assigning them a semantics that they did not have when they were stable ?
[12:57:48] <pnkfelix> nmatsakis: Here, this is probably clearer with a little state diagram
[12:58:03] <nmatsakis> I'm not sure I follow, but I do agree that changing their semantics if they were already stable is clearly bad
[12:58:08] <nmatsakis> I'm imagining some fn that we try to deprecate
[12:58:11] <nmatsakis> but it's widely used
[12:58:20] <nmatsakis> and we can't make a better alternative
[12:58:28] <nmatsakis> and we give up and say "ok fine, just use it"
[12:58:33] <nmatsakis> though I don't imagine we would deprecate w/o an alternative

[13:02:34] <nmatsakis> yes I know
[13:02:37] <pnkfelix> nmatsakis: and over the course of this conversation, I realized
[13:02:58] <pnkfelix> nmatsakis: that #[unstable, deprecated] is a very different marking than #[deprecated] alone
[13:03:34] <pnkfelix> nmatsakis: because presumably we can freely toggle the #[deprecated] bit as long as it remains marked #[unstable].  I'll add an update to my comment.

[16:19:00] <acrichto> nmatsakis: pong
[16:19:08] <nmatsakis> acrichto: so I rebased the coherence stuff
[16:19:08] <acrichto> klutzy: right now I don't think we plan on making a new crate for it
[16:19:20] <nmatsakis> and I encounter a coherenceconflict
[16:19:22] <nmatsakis> between
[16:19:33] <nmatsakis> impl<'a, E: Error + Send + 'a> From<E> for Box<Error + Send + 'a>
[16:19:38] <nmatsakis> and
[16:19:38] <nmatsakis> impl<'a, 'b> From<&'b str> for Box<Error + Send + 'a>
[16:19:50] <nmatsakis> which is disallowed because it requires that
[16:19:50] <acrichto> oh grr that's unfortunate
[16:19:53] <nmatsakis> &str: !Error
[16:19:54] <mib_y7f0bo> Hey is @sfackler here?
[16:19:56] <nmatsakis> and neither of those are local
[16:19:59] <nmatsakis> to the boxed crate
[16:20:09] <nmatsakis> how imp't is this? :)
[16:20:22] <acrichto> nmatsakis: pretty important unfortunately, it allows io::Error::new(..., "foo")
[16:20:31] <nmatsakis> (this seems as an aside like (another) potential use case for explicit neg impls)
[16:20:43] <acrichto> nmatsakis: yeah, b/c we definitely never want an impl of Error for &str
[16:20:59] <nmatsakis> hmm 
[16:21:06] <acrichto> nmatsakis: does &str not count as &T though?
[16:21:11] <nmatsakis> well str is not local
[16:21:20] <nmatsakis> this is in the boxed crate
[16:21:27] <nmatsakis> and Error is defined in libcore
[16:21:37] <pnkfelix> (liballoc crate, right?)
[16:21:42] <nmatsakis> er, yes, liballoc
[16:21:42] <acrichto> I may be forgetting what kind of negative reasoning is allowed or not
[16:21:47] <nmatsakis> so basically coherence is trying to protect our ability
[16:21:51] <nmatsakis> to add impl Error for &str
[16:21:52] <nmatsakis> in the future
[16:21:54] <nmatsakis> from libcore
[16:21:54] <acrichto> I figured you could use the fact that &T doesn't have Error so you can infer it's not Error
[16:22:02] <nmatsakis> that's kind of the point

[16:23:13] * nmatsakis ponders
[16:23:25] <acrichto> nmatsakis: one possibility would be to move the error module to libcore
[16:23:26] <bcoopers> The latest push makes it so it only zeroes 64 k at a time at most at your recommendation
[16:23:28] <acrichto> er, liballoc
[16:23:41] <bcoopers> I'm not sure what the problem is but I'd be glad to address it

[16:29:02] <nmatsakis> acrichto: I'm torn; that's perhaps the safer, more stable thing to do. OTOH, I sort of like keeping the hierarchy as we would want it, and instead iterating on coherence so as to make it possible to write the code we want
[16:29:08] <nmatsakis> acrichto: er, iterating on the coherence/trait package
[16:29:27] <nmatsakis> acrichto: (as long as we can feature-gate so we don't accidentally get committed to things)
[16:29:59] <nmatsakis> I guess neg impls do commit us though
[16:30:06] <nmatsakis> because e.g. if we had 
[16:30:10] <nmatsakis> impl !Error for &str
[16:30:13] <acrichto> I do think it's pretty safe to commit to never impl'ing Error for &str
[16:30:14] <nmatsakis> then somebody else could write
[16:30:18] <acrichto> we *may* impl Error for String
[16:30:24] <acrichto> but definitely not borrowed strings
[16:30:30] <nmatsakis> well I'm more concerned about being committed
[16:30:35] <nmatsakis> to a mechanism that can support neg impls
[16:30:37] <nmatsakis> as part of coherence
[16:30:40] <acrichto> ah
[16:30:44] <nmatsakis> in particular I think
[16:30:48] <nmatsakis> others could write
[16:31:08] <nmatsakis> trait Foo { } impl<T:Error> Foo<T> for T { }
[16:31:14] <nmatsakis> impl Foo for &str
[16:31:20] <nmatsakis> though we could prob fature-gate that too
[16:31:25] <nmatsakis> nm
[16:31:31] <nmatsakis> just have to be careful when feature-gating :)
[16:31:37] <acrichto> true
[16:31:55] <nmatsakis> (that said, we're committed to OIBIT, which adds neg impls)
[16:32:02] <acrichto> nmatsakis: alternatively we could have two constructors for io::Error

[16:32:09] <nmatsakis> :)

[16:32:41] <acrichto> Error::new and Error::new_error or something like that

[20:48:17] <nmatsakis> that'd be interesting
[20:48:37] <acrichto> nmatsakis: hm ok, I'll try leaving it out
[20:48:43] <nmatsakis> yeah, seems likely to be that
[20:48:43] <aturon> acrichto: ok, i can hold off, but we will probably need to stabilize these before 1.0
[20:48:55] <acrichto> aturon: sounds good to me
[20:49:12] <nmatsakis> I wonder if that affects my opinion :)
[20:49:36] <nmatsakis> I guess perhaps we do make use of variance around lifetime parameters, specifically
[20:49:46] <acrichto> that's 2 for 2 in "breakage introduced in the last 24 hours" for otherwise innocuous changes :P

[22:07:57] <huon> aturon: there's a minor one in thread, but it appears to be a reimplementation of a channel
[22:08:08] <acrichto> nmatsakis: so I have a broken rustdoc test b/c something is rendering as "Self" instead of "Self::Output"

[22:08:24] <nmatsakis> which test?
[22:08:25] <acrichto> nmatsakis: but now that I look, https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/23924 is quite suspect

[22:38:50] <acrichto> aturon: e.g. it seems unnecessarily strict to only require Send/Sync to be put in an Arc
[22:39:02] <acrichto> aturon: it's requiring everyone to mention those bounds all over the place when it's normally implied
[22:39:10] <acrichto> and it only really matters when crossing a thread boundary
[22:39:41] <aturon> acrichto: i think this indicates a need for implied bounds ;-)
[22:39:46] <huon> aturon: what acrichto said: the send/sync-ness only only matters when the types cross a thread boundary
[22:39:53] <huon> s/only only/only/
[22:39:56] <aturon> but why are you using Arc if you're not?
[22:40:01] <huon> generic code
[22:40:14] <aturon> i argued this on the original PR :P
[22:40:18] <acrichto> yeah, in that sense we're requiring all geneirc users to repeat the same bounds
[22:40:19] <aturon> do you not buy my argument?
[22:40:42] <huon> oh, let me reread
[22:40:45] <aturon> but if the generic code actually uses the Arc for anything, it has to have the bounds anyway
[22:41:10] <acrichto> aturon: not always though
[22:41:11] <huon> yeah, I don't quite buy it, e.g. one might have PersistentTree<T> { ... Arc<T> ... }
[22:41:18] <nmatsakis> aturon: (while I agree it kind of argues for implied bounds, it's also an interesting example of why they worry me; if we had implied bounds, and we added Send+Sync, we couldn't ever take them away)

[23:39:21] <pnkfelix> brson: But on the plus side, since Stephanie will be gone, I can stay up until the middle of the night to video-in to the meetup.  :)

[23:44:12] <aturon> draft beta release notes: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/23959
[23:44:13] <pnkfelix> acrichto: okay now I have fixes up for compile-fail as well ....
[23:44:25] <aturon> acrichto: the above PR should be merged before beta,
[23:44:38] <aturon> but as late as possible to allow further items to trickle in
[23:44:39] <acrichto> aturon: sounds like a merge button!
[23:44:51] <aturon> though i did read over the full set of PRs so probably most things are on it
[23:45:49] <aturon> there were more language changes than i would've guessed

[23:48:12] <erickt> brson: when we're ready to announce the party, would you like me to send invites to graydon and the other rust alumi, or would you want to do it?
[23:48:35] <acrichto> pnkfelix: https://github.com/alexcrichton/rust/commit/6fe1233f618298c7a0594fb2971860ea1220fd1e put me all the way through make check
[23:48:40] <acrichto> on linux at least
[23:48:52] <pnkfelix> acrichto: my god it finished already for yoU?
[23:49:02] <pnkfelix> acrichto: What on *earth* is wrong with my computer ...
[23:49:05] <acrichto> pnkfelix: lol
[23:49:09] <acrichto> 8 cores and 32GB ram do help
[23:49:11] <pnkfelix> acrichto: wait, are you doing a --enable-debug build ?
[23:49:21] <acrichto> oh right, I do --disable-optimize-tests
[23:49:30] <pnkfelix> oh interesting
[23:49:31] <acrichto> but I do not have --enable-debug
[23:49:34] <acrichto> I also disable LLVM assertions
[23:49:37] <acrichto> not sure how much that helps
[23:49:42] <pnkfelix>  that might help a lot actually
[23:50:00] <pnkfelix> We should gather real data about this
[23:50:27] <pnkfelix> or at least list the common configure switches somewhere... (this is the sort of thing that I *would* have used the wiki for, but ... )
[23:50:46] <brson> erickt: you are welcome to. I think I better check with my manager though before we make definite plans

[23:50:58] <pnkfelix> acrichto: okay I'm going to r=nmatsakis it then
[23:51:00] <larsberg> acrichto: disabling LLVM assertions for the Servo snapshots was a double-digit percentage gain even for our debug builds
[23:51:31] <larsberg> Though of course since then I've regressed everything by testing in our CI with --release instead, which is ~2x slower :-(
[23:51:41] <acrichto> larsberg: lol you win some you lose some :P
[23:51:49] <acrichto> pnkfelix: ok! if the rollup bounces I will include it
[23:51:59] <pnkfelix> acrichto: (or rather, cherry pick your commit firs, or something...)
[23:52:24] <acrichto> pnkfelix: if you want to r+ that'll work best
[23:52:33] <acrichto> I'll revert back to where I was at, merge yours, then re-apply fixes
[23:52:43] <erickt> brson: I'll wait for your go-ahead
[23:52:46] <pnkfelix> acrichto: yeah I'll try to include your fix
[23:53:00] <pnkfelix> acrichto: its tough because obviously I cannot test it in time with my current work flow
[23:53:09] <acrichto> ah it's ok, no worries!
[23:53:19] <pnkfelix> acrichto: I guess I will at least try turning off llvm assertions etc
[23:53:34] <acrichto> pnkfelix: I'd recommend getting a tower from mozilla as well, it sped me up by like 2x
[23:53:40] <acrichto> (that's what I work on at least)
[23:53:57] <kimundi> Hm, do LLVM aborts count as I-ICE in the issue labeling system? :P
[23:54:36] <kmc> i count them as such
[23:54:40] <kmc> it's at least as bad
[23:54:48] <kmc> (if we disable LLVM asserts, they're UB)
[23:54:49] <pnkfelix> acrichto: yeah I've been thinking about asking for a dedicated desktop machine for a while

[23:55:21] <kmc> you can build a machine specifically optimized for building rust, like i did
[23:55:30] <kimundi> https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/23960 - fun error with nested closures across generics :P
[23:55:40] <kmc> i used my own money, which means I don't feel guilty overclocking it to an extreme
