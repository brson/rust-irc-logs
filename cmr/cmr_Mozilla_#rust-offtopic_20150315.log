[00:32:43] <FreeFull> Murarth: Arch Linux x86_64 and "thread '<main>' panicked at 'ExecutionEngine init input failed to compile'" with cargo run --release

[00:39:10] <FreeFull> Nope, still getting the same thing
[00:39:43] <FreeFull> Murarth: Can you reproduce?
[00:40:24] <Murarth> FreeFull: No, I haven't had any problems lately. I'm on 64-bit Ubuntu.

[01:11:25] <FreeFull> Murarth: The thing is, multirust puts in wrappers that call the actual rustc/cargo executables, so it can pick which ones to run 
[01:14:22] <Murarth> FreeFull: Ah, so /usr/local/bin/rustc is just a script?
[01:15:25] <FreeFull> Yep
[01:16:51] <brson> FreeFull: the issue is multirust and rusti are not compatible?
[01:16:51] <FreeFull> My actual rustc is in  ~/.multirust/toolchains/nightly/bin

[01:18:54] <brson> Murarth: how does rusti invoke rustc?
[01:20:00] <Murarth> brson: It links to the rustc crate.
[01:20:18] <brson> here's a multirust issue for it https://github.com/brson/multirust/issues/38
[01:20:27] <brson> Murarth: what's the error look like?
[01:20:27] <Murarth> And at runtime, it has to give rustc the sysroot, which it finds by looking for rustc in PATH.
[01:20:34] <brson> ah
[01:21:36] <brson> Murarth: you might instead call `rustc --print sysroot`
[01:23:44] <brson> either way is kinda brittle. sysroot is a pain
[01:23:54] <Murarth> brson: I was not aware of that. Making the change now.
[01:24:17] <Murarth> Yeah, a lot of rusti is pretty fragile right now.

[13:27:36] <Tobba> what classifies as spending?
[13:27:40] <Mutabah> And since big earners are often big spenders, you catch them with less  large loopholes
[13:28:00] <Tobba> I think we had problems here with companies making money here and transferring it outside of the country and spending it there
[13:28:00] <Mutabah> Tobba: In aus, everything covered by the GST for one
[13:29:07] <Mutabah> The problem is - Any overhaul of the taxation system will be met with HUGE oposition
[13:29:41] <Mutabah> Especially in Aus, where the states have their own taxes, and don't want to give that up to the commonwealth (even if they get it back as their GST slice)
[13:30:09] <Mutabah> And a large GST means higher prices for tourists (can be refunded at the border... but still discourages tourists)
[13:30:12] <Tobba> oh yeah, the commonwealth
[13:30:16] <Tobba> that ought to be a clusterfuck

[14:23:55] <Tobba> I forgot how incredibly fucking broken msys2 is
[14:24:12] <Tobba> mingw64 is absolutely fucked and passes the wrong file modes when opening files
[14:24:24] <Tobba> every file written by something compiled by it comes out as gibberish
[14:24:43] <Tobba> mingw32 passes the right flags but anything compiled by it instantly crashes under mingw64
[14:24:55] <Tobba> rustc needs mingw64 to work, but I need mingw32 built binutils to link anything
[14:24:57] <Tobba> fuck
[14:26:06] <Tobba> at some point I had this working but I have no idea what I did
[14:29:23] <Tobba> ah right, you need standard mingw as well, because it's the only thing that can compile binutils correctly for some fucking reason
[14:30:09] <bombless> http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2550 Can Rust properly handle Y10K problem? I have an impression that our timing library is relatively poor though.
[14:33:01] <Tobba> bombless: both Y2K and Y10K are caused by timer designers being retards
[14:33:09] <Tobba> it's not really a problem for rust
[14:38:43] <Tobba> no sane software represents dates like that anymore, and afaik the only reason anyone ever did was because the designer of some popular time-keeping circuits was a moron
[14:40:24] <Tobba> okay sure, calculating modulus on older computers was a bit of a pain, I guess thats why
[14:45:38] <Mutabah> *nod* nowdays we have the 2038 problem instead :)
[14:46:36] <Tobba> which is mostly solving itself right now, I think most systems have upgraded for 32 bit time
[14:48:13] <Tobba> from*
[14:49:33] <Yurume> bombless, Chrono has Y262K problem.
[14:49:57] <Tobba> I don't think we have to worry about that yet tbh
[14:50:25] <Yurume> but technically, well, it can be extended trivially that we only have to worry about Y1125T problem.
[14:50:28] <Tobba> (but making things generic over the integer to hold the time would be cool)
[14:50:50] <Yurume> I once tried that and concluded that it is not worth effort.
[14:51:17] <Tobba> fun fact: EFI has a Y3K problem
[14:51:31] <Yurume> i19 year number ought to be fine!
[14:52:01] <Tobba> oh wait actually, it's Y65K
[14:52:18] <Yurume> btw, anyone needs cargo-kcov?
[14:52:19] <Yurume> :)
[14:55:30] <Tobba> I should probably start using cargo-build

[21:42:27] <Tobba> speedrun comparsion is probably actually unfair due to that, theres a teleporting weapon thing in OF which is really, really broken and can end up putting you right at the end of certain chapters
[21:42:41] <Tobba> (if you save and reload at the right time)

[21:44:25] <Dr-Emann> I love glitch speedruns. It's so fascinating to see how little programming/level design issues can let people do crazy things
[21:44:49] <Tobba> the teleporting thing is interesting, for some reason each level usually has a shitload of spawn points, but it only uses one of them according to some flag
[21:45:22] <Tobba> it would save the location you used that teleport gun from, but it wouldn't save it into your savegames, if you saved and loaded that save at the appropriate spot it would forget your previous location and use the first spawn point that was placed

[21:47:08] <Tobba> also the difficulty setting in HL speedruns is interesting, because grenade knockback scales according to the damage it did, you can go way faster on hard

[23:13:02] <Astrum|Lap> but more work -_-
[23:14:05] <FreeFull> Is it me, or do things take a long time to compile with newest versions of rustc?
[23:14:21] <Astrum|Lap> also, any new RFCs for SIMD support in rust?

[23:19:15] <Astrum|Lap> I still think it'd be fun to implement ISPC in rustc
[23:19:25] <FreeFull> ISPC?
[23:19:46] <Astrum|Lap> https://ispc.github.io
[23:20:03] <Astrum|Lap> it's a way of abstracting over SIMD computations
[23:20:27] <Astrum|Lap> which supports variable width SIMD lanes and is pretty easy to grasp conceptually
[23:22:10] <Astrum|Lap> similar to GPU warps
[23:23:30] <FreeFull> Cool
[23:26:11] <zwarich> RFC: SPMD for Rust?
[23:26:12] <zwarich> lol
[23:26:58] <Astrum|Lap> it'd be a nice feature
[23:27:18] <Astrum|Lap> most languages just expose a thin wrapper over intrinsics if anything
[23:28:44] <tiffany> I want my language to abuse partial evaluation to be able to const fold AST builders, which would then emit SPMD code
[23:28:57] <tiffany> SIMD instructions, SPIR-V, etc

[23:30:01] <tiffany> with multiple dispatch, constructs like if and even functions themselves become things you can override with AST builders
[23:30:31] <fmtq> onto the speedrun topic of earlier today, Hitman Blood Money speedruns are insane.
[23:30:43] <Astrum|Lap> I support your goal, tiffany 
[23:30:50] <Astrum|Lap> get to it, heh
[23:31:39] <Astrum|Lap> glitch runs are where it's at
[23:32:11] <tiffany> it's all the things people attribute to lisp, but with python-esque syntax
[23:33:14] <fmtq> I am too stupid to grasp the concept of multiple dispatch
[23:33:50] <tiffany> fmtq: basically function overloading but more fine grained
[23:34:12] <tiffany> it's a prominent feature in julia
[23:34:28] <fmtq> I don't understand the fine graining
[23:34:29] <tiffany> I'm not sure whether I want actual multiple dispatch, or whether I just want to use namespacing that can override prelude
[23:34:30] <Astrum|Lap> I still need to look into julia
[23:35:37] <tiffany> the one thing I haven't worked out yet is fine grained scope control
[23:35:59] <tiffany> like, preferably things that resemble macros should be able to inject new definitions into the calling scope
[23:36:05] <tiffany> so that you can override `def`
[23:37:26] <tiffany> and it would also be nice to be able to choose the scope of quotations, but that requires either lazy name binding, which is ugly as hell, or weird rules
[23:38:56] <tiffany> I suppose I could have rebinding
[23:38:59] <tiffany> that's probably the best route
[23:41:25] <tiffany> name rebinding actually replaces the need to have special namespacing rules, and also allows function reuse
[23:41:26] <tiffany> I like this
[23:41:58] <tiffany> the only problem is that any prospective AST builder would need to override every intrinsic lest it cause type errors
[23:42:32] <tiffany> I suppose I could use multiple dispatch on intrinsics
[23:42:43] <tiffany> a fast path for native types, and a slow path which works in terms of other intrinsics
[23:42:53] <tiffany> with specialisations for AST builders which want to bother (fma comes to mind)
