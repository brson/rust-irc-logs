[00:02:22] <Ilari> And all are actually limited by bot hardware, not SNES hardware. SNES hardware could do 4 controllers at least 192 times per frame (~11500 times per second).
[00:04:21] <Ilari> I also saw a funny corrupted picture from trying to transfer data too fast (4x64).
[00:05:01] <Tiffany> link?
[00:05:06] <Ilari> Where parts of picture had gotten duplicated...
[00:05:16] <Ilari> Oh, it still apparently exists: http://acbit.net/static/tas/smw-txtest-64f2.jpg
[00:05:59] <Tiffany> what limits the SNES hardware to 192 times per frame?
[00:06:43] <Ilari> Tiffany: CPU time. And the limit is bit over 192, but I didn't test anything bigger.
[00:07:12] <Ilari> Tiffany: That picture was from tests on how fast one can reliably transfer data.
[00:08:34] <Tiffany> does it take a lot of cycles to poll the ports?
[00:08:52] <Ilari> A fair amount.
[00:09:27] <Ilari> Tiffany: And getting to 192/f uses tricks that utterly jumble the data (bits come in odd order and some bits get flipped). However, this happens deterministically, so one can jumble the transmitted data so that the errors cancel out.
[00:10:04] <Tiffany> that is pretty amazing
[00:10:43] <Tiffany> my naïve math says that it takes about 77 cycles to poll the port?
[00:11:38] <Ilari> IIRC, Full poll cycle takes bit over a scanline, which is 1364 master clocks (master clock was ~21.47MHz or so).
[00:24:57] <Tiffany> https://youtu.be/Ou_9ntYRzzw a video about the lorenz cipher
[00:25:27] <Elaine> Good ole Computerphile
[00:25:36] <Tiffany> yeah
[00:25:53] <Ilari> Heh, actually found an emulator input file that consists of first exploiting SMW, loading Super Mario Bros, followed by SMB tool-assisted speedrun (edited for longer load times).

[00:39:10] <Ilari> Warnings are nasty to implement, especially if the condition being warned about is rare.
[00:53:43] <Tiffany> I wonder what the lorenz keystream looks like under dieharder
[00:54:42] <Tiffany> I suppose the 5-bit characters is a problem for trying it
[00:55:42] <eternaleye> Tiffany: Not really; just pack them...
[00:56:00] <Tiffany> that won't unfairly improve its score, will it?
[00:56:19] <eternaleye> Tiffany: Would it? You pack both the keystream and the characters.
[00:56:21] <Ilari> Also, might very well have (no idea if it actually hash) the same nasty vulernability as Enigma had: Characters can't encrypt to self.
[00:56:37] <eternaleye> Tiffany: I don't think dieharder insists on byte-aligned patterns to fail its tests
[00:59:09] <Ilari> And also might not have the property that if e.g. x encrypts the same in two positions, that y would encrypt the same in the same positions.
[01:01:04] <eternaleye> Ilari: Isn't that the thing that makes breaking the Vignere cipher by hand a thing?
[01:01:40] <eternaleye> Ilari: Cyclic keystream + common text?

[13:37:15] <Tiffany> they seem like they are prone to timing attacks
[13:39:15] <Tiffany> is the lorenz cipher the first modern cipher?
[13:39:22] <Tiffany> modern cipher is obviously a shiftable goalpost
[13:39:39] *** Quits: erickt (erickt@moz-njt.vqi.14.76.IP) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[13:49:41] <Tiffany> feistel networks were first introduced in ~1974, apparently
[13:52:03] <Tiffany> hm
[13:52:13] <Tiffany> I can't really find much in the way on what was the first modern cipher
[13:52:33] <Tiffany> at the very latest, RSA was created in 1977
[13:52:55] <Tiffany> oh, DES in 1976
[13:53:16] <Tiffany> I suppose if you want to discount ciphers which have been broken, then RSA
[13:53:40] <Tiffany> lucifer was published in 1972
[13:53:43] <Tiffany> 1971*
[13:54:44] <Ilari> Diffie-Hellman was apparently published in 1976.
[13:55:55] <Tiffany> it looks like information theory wasn't really formalized until 1948
[13:56:56] <Tiffany> I think what makes lorenz look modern to me is that it operates on bits instead of on letters, and that it's structured as a stream cipher
[13:57:33] <Tiffany> even though the actual machine was electromechanical
[13:59:48] <Tiffany> I suppose there's also the vernam cipher, which is as well
[14:01:53] <Tiffany> oh
[14:02:20] <Tiffany> lucifer was the original algorithm selected to be DES, which got corrected to be safe against differential cryptanalysis
[14:02:58] <Ilari> ... And lots of key bits removed.
[14:03:09] <Tiffany> oh
[14:12:11] <Tiffany> 48, 64, or 128 bits for lucifer, apparently
[14:12:28] <Tiffany> so they just took the 64 bit version and shaved off a good 8 bits...
[15:13:29] <Tiffany> wait what
[15:13:44] <Tiffany> if you never reuse poly1305 keys, you get a provably secure MAC?
[15:15:32] <Tiffany> I'm watching a video on wegman-carter MACs on coursera because I couldn't find anything else
[15:15:35] <Ilari> If poly1305 keys get reused, those keys can be recovered.
[15:15:53] <Tiffany> oh
[15:16:03] <Tiffany> so poly1305 is a wegman-carter mac?
[15:16:18] <Tiffany> I don't really know
[15:17:18] <Ilari> "standard polynomial-evaluation-Wegman-Carter-MAC framework" ... About poly1305
[15:17:30] <Tiffany> okay
[15:18:08] <Tiffany> so a wegman-carter MAC is to a one time MAC as a stream cipher is to a one-time pad, right?
[15:18:32] <Tiffany> I had wegman-carter MACs confused with one-time MACs
[15:19:47] *** Joins: erickt (erickt@moz-njt.vqi.14.76.IP)
[15:27:35] <Ilari> Tiffany: Somewhat like that. Note that one does not need message length worth of random bits for security (but more bits gives more security).
[15:28:08] <Tiffany> ah, yeah
[15:35:29] <Ilari> Heh, apparently some guys want DSA removed for TLS 1.3 and RSA-PSS added.
[15:37:06] <Ilari> Hmmm... Compiling winapi v0.1.23  ... This isn't Windows.
[16:02:49] <bascule> Ilari: heh, just saw that, yes remove DSA!
[16:08:46] <Ilari> Also, modern TLS stack on serverside would require signature_algorithms (because without it one is limited to SHA-1 certs).
[16:13:01] <Ilari> And considering the way signatures work, adding RSA-PSS to v1.3 should also make it usable for v1.2

[23:35:52] <bascule> Ilari: https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/659.pdf
[23:36:59] <Ilari> The most difficult part about generating elliptic curve is picking a prime. :-)
[23:40:10] <Ilari> Unfortunately, curves for software use (Internet) are from very restricted class.
[23:49:05] <Ilari> That is because of performance reasons. Performance trumps security (not that we know any way the security is actually degraded).
[23:51:01] <Ilari> Progress of natural prime ECC cryptoanalysis in last 30 years: No progress. :-)
[23:51:33] <bascule> the whole performance/security tradeoff cracks me up about how people talk about it
[23:51:37] <bascule> especially Brian LaMacchia
[23:52:10] <bascule> like at the ECC Workshop
[23:52:31] <bascule> Brian LaMacchia sez: "Performance doesn't matter. Only security matters"
[23:52:34] <bascule> later
[23:52:53] <bascule> Brian LaMacchia sez: "We can't use the CFRG curves! They're only thinking about software! They'll be slow on hardware!"
[23:52:59] <bascule> 1) You just contradicted yourself
[23:53:04] <bascule> 2) You're wrong, and I have the hardware to prove it
[23:53:21] <bascule> I mean, I don't know about Goldilocks
[23:53:26] <bascule> but I can speak to Curve25519 in hardware
[23:53:56] <Ilari> Well, at least these smartcards don't need hardware RNG if they only implement raw RSA...
[23:54:38] <bascule> many of them support onboard key generation though
[23:54:50] <bascule> the ones I have deployed do
[23:55:16] <Ilari> Oh, and this is "qualifed signature" stuff... Not some toy cards.
[23:56:39] <Ilari> Well, the kind of prime Goldilocks is, I suppose one could optimize it in hardware.
