[20:01:33] <nmatsakis> aturon: so I was thinking about the interaction of WF and higher-ranked stuff; before I proposed that we defer enforcement of WF rules for stuff underneath a binder until e.g. the fn is called etc; but I've been thinking that we should perhaps do both. That is, we ALWAYS check when fn is called, but we will check eagerly so long as no higher-ranked regions
[20:01:33] <nmatsakis> are actually *used* in the type. We could do stronger enforcement, this is just very easy (and perhaps we leave the stronger enforcement as an open bug, to cover cases like for<'a> fn(HashMap<NotHash<'a>, ...>), where we can actually show for<'a> NotHash<'a>: !Hash

[22:23:48] <aturon> pnkfelix: heads up, you may be interested in some of the discussion around dropck+specialization in https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1210
