[05:02:30] <Peach> I have like 500MB of data and I need to get it to like 25MB
[05:02:48] <niconii> depends heavily on the data involved
[05:03:31] <niconii> also, i've got a hunch 500MB -> 25MB is gonna be impossible, what sort of data is it
[05:04:08] <niconii> it's gotta have a lot of redundancy for you to get that down to 1/20 of its original size
[05:04:08] <Mutabah> niconii: Text can get that ratio quite easily
[05:04:26] <Mutabah> niconii: I have a log file that went 600->12
[05:04:26] <niconii> Mutabah: yes, but somehow i doubt it's 500MB of text...
[05:04:35] <niconii> well, i guess logs, yeah
[05:10:59] <Peach> It's everything - png files and audio
[05:11:05] <Peach> and some text
[05:11:16] <Peach> and binrary files 
[05:11:25] *** Quits: RC9 (RCIX@moz-7omm6s.ph.cox.net) (Connection closed)
[05:11:34] <niconii> probably not gonna compress nicely then, png and audio are usually already compressed
[05:12:54] <Yurume> Peach: the best compression algorithm depends on the data type :)
[05:13:02] <Yurume> (best known or applicable, to be exact)
[05:13:13] <Mutabah> PNG already does zlib over the data internally
[05:13:23] <Peach> is there anything that can compress even further?
[05:13:24] <Mutabah> and does tricks like pre-filtering the data to ensure a high compression rate
[05:13:41] <Mutabah> (I think it does per-row filters, then zlibs the entire image)
[05:13:54] <Peach> I need to go futher compression with a bunch of audio files and zlib compressed files
[05:14:47] <Yurume> there are some involved (and novelty) compressors that actively detect the zlib parameters used and recompresses them
[05:14:54] <niconii> there's a theoretical limitation to how far you can compress something; eventually files end up getting *larger* instead of smaller
[05:15:32] <Mutabah> niconii: Well, you'd guess that there's a way of cycling algorithms to reduce the file size...
[05:15:40] <Mutabah> But yeah, there's a limit
[05:15:44] <ChrisMorgan> Peach: is lossy compression OK? rm is particularly good at that.
[05:15:49] <Peach> rm?
[05:15:55] <niconii> pfft
[05:15:58] <Yurume> http://cs.fit.edu/~mmahoney/compression/barf.html
[05:16:01] <Peach> I need an open source solution
[05:16:08] <ChrisMorgan> Yeah, rm is open source.
[05:16:44] <niconii> Peach: just a joke, ChrisMorgan is saying technically rm is lossy compression because it compresses files to 0 bytes, by losing *all* of the information
[05:17:08] <niconii> Mutabah: you can get more out of it with specialized algorithms, yeah
[05:17:48] <Peach> awwwwww it loses all the information :(
[05:18:07] <niconii> yeah, rm is the "delete file" command, so
[05:18:15] <Peach> surely there is a recursive compressor that is lossless that can do fancy things with the data
[05:18:39] <niconii> Peach: sure, but again, only to a point
[05:18:51] <Peach> well tell me where can I find them?
[05:19:36] <Peach> is there no program that say - has a large set of byte sequence combinations stored as a really large index and can compress data based on patterns?
[05:20:05] <Mutabah> niconii: But, the farther you go, the more of your data is "stored" in the algorithm choices
[05:20:21] <niconii> Peach: that sounds... kinda like a normal compression algorithm?
[05:20:27] <niconii> Mutabah: also true
[05:20:29] <Yurume> i.e. stored as is with a non-empty header
[05:20:45] <Peach> Oh well I don't know how compression works, but I intuitively guesses it yay
[05:20:46] <Yurume> niconii: self-describing compression format, I think.
[05:20:50] *** Joins: pcwalton (pcwalton@moz-6kjabm.ca.comcast.net)
[05:20:54] <Yurume> in fact there are some, e.g. ZPAQ
[05:21:54] <niconii> anyway, compressing every possible file to a smaller size than the original is physically impossible no matter what algorithm you use
[05:22:13] <Peach> Ooh I have a nice high level code question
[05:22:15] <niconii> the best you can do is make the worst case really *uncommon*
[05:22:25] <Yurume> loselessly compressing* (of course, lossy compression can lead to *cough* `rm` *cough*)
[05:22:28] <Peach> I need code that auto finds all repeated patterns in a string
[05:22:35] <niconii> Yurume: right, lossless
[05:22:53] <Peach> say the input is  "hi world hi cat hi world"
[05:22:58] <Peach> I want it to return:
[05:23:10] <Peach> [hi:3,world:2]
[05:23:37] <Peach> I totally think that would be so cool

[05:23:58] *** Quits: pcwalton (pcwalton@moz-6kjabm.ca.comcast.net) (Client exited)
[05:24:06] <Yurume> Peach: there are several well-known algorithms that incrementally(!) find such patterns.
[05:24:23] <Peach> Tell me stuff so I can google them Yurume please
[05:24:49] <Yurume> probably the best-known example would be LZW; this one is quite clever.
[05:25:22] <Yurume> in many other algorithms, finding repeated patterns is still important and many approaches to optimize it are available.
[05:26:57] <Yurume> Peach: if you are new to data compression and want to know as much as possible, I would suggest Matt Mahoney's _Data Compression Explained_, available at http://mattmahoney.net/dc/dce.html
[05:27:02] <Yurume> hope it helps
[05:29:50] <Peach> So many words
[05:30:01] <Peach> Ok, so here's a naive algorithm I just thought of
[05:30:14] <Peach> You start at the beginning of the file
[05:30:35] <Peach> and scan the entire file (well string)  until you find a matching character
[05:31:03] <Peach> and then at that match you go down as long as possible to see if the parts match
[05:31:59] <Peach> so say you have the string:   apple##apple
[05:32:12] <Peach> the algo would start with [0] 'a'
[05:32:43] <Peach> go down the line - p doesn't match [0], p doesn't match 0, etc......  'a' matches [0]
[05:32:58] <Peach> match found now extended check that the strings match
[05:33:53] <Peach> Yeah, I need someone to give me a fancy simple algorithm of how to do this fast "find patterns in string" algorithm
[05:37:34] <Peach> I'm gonna make my own ad hoc compression algorithm and I'm gonna call it "the stupid compression algorithm"
[05:38:23] <Peach> it's gonna be slow and it barely compresses anything because I can't understand all these computer science words they put in academic papers on file compression
[05:39:56] <Peach> "It should be evident that compressing transcripts like this requires the ability to compute a model of the form p(A|Q) = p(QA)/P(Q) where Q is the context up to the current question, and A is the response"
[05:40:25] <Peach> No, to me, it is not evident

[05:59:53] <Skyler> Peach: how large are the patterns?
[06:00:17] <Peach> any arbitrary size
[06:06:51] <Skyler> Peach: a naive pattern discovery algorithm would collect all possible patterns and search for them in the source string one by one
[06:07:10] <Skyler> so that's like O(mn) for any string n with longest pattern substring m
[06:08:18] <Skyler> so you run through all possible sizes of patterns, at least 2 characters and at most n-1 characters
[06:14:44] <Peach> Skyler: the max size pattern would be half the size of the string
[06:14:59] <Peach> cause a pattern repeats at least twice
[06:15:14] <Skyler> ahh non-overlapping patterns :P
[06:15:21] <Peach> aaaaaaaa no pattern found
[06:15:39] <Peach> aaaaaaabaaaaaaaa  1 pattern aaaaaaaa found, repeats twice
[06:15:58] <Skyler> oh
[06:16:13] <Skyler> well a good compression algo would certainly find patterns in aaaaaaaa

[15:56:23] <Quxxy> It would've been impressive 20 years ago
[15:56:25] <Astraea> didn't you use those?
[15:56:29] <dfockler> I haven't touched windows since 7
[15:56:50] <dfockler> and I've stayed away from the .NET jobs
[15:56:51] <CarlColglazier> They skipped Windows 9 reportedly because people would do stupid checks to see if the OS string contained "windows
[15:56:51] <Quxxy> Microsoft don't *gain* points for those: they merely stop *losing* them for *not* having them

[16:00:57] <Astraea> I think microsoft should snipe some UX experts from apple
[16:01:03] <WindowsBunny> the lock screen is so easy to get past

[16:01:52] <Quxxy> "Fixed" is giving Microsoft too much credit
[16:02:00] <CarlColglazier> I'm not a fan of the mixing of iOS and OS X. 
[16:02:08] <dfockler> Microsoft should realize they will always be the dorky uncle to apple
[16:02:17] <Astraea> I don't remember exactly what concepts from iOS they ported over, CarlColglazier 
[16:02:33] <Astraea> I mean launchpad was introduced several versions ago
[16:02:40] <Astraea> which I actually thing is good tbh

[16:04:54] <CarlColglazier> Is that their version of OpenGL?
[16:05:13] <Astraea> no
[16:05:17] <zofrex> CarlColglazier: I don't believe the "programs check for Windows 9.*" story for a second
[16:05:19] <Astraea> they still support opengl
[16:05:22] <Astraea> up to 4.2 or something
[16:05:34] <zofrex> Windows is already FULL of special cases like "when program Y is running, lie about which windows version I am"
[16:05:39] <Astraea> Quxxy: the thing with OS X is it doesn't matter as much
[16:05:45] <CarlColglazier> zofrex: Hey, 10 is a trendy number!
[16:05:47] <Astraea> they pump out an update once a year
[16:05:51] <zofrex> or even "when Simcity is running, make free() not actually free memory"
[16:06:00] <Astraea> unlike microsoft who pumps out an update... at some point
[16:06:05] <Astraea> that everyone either loves or hates
[16:06:13] <Astraea> in fact it's pretty much every other release that is liked
[16:06:17] <zofrex> literally the only reason I use Windows 8 instead of 7 is because Bootcamp dropped support for 7 :(
[16:06:27] <CarlColglazier> That's not good. 
[16:06:30] <zofrex> and 8 goes wrong so much... like, every other boot, something goes funky :(
[16:06:38] <Tiffany> whoa
[16:06:44] <Astraea> for the most part OS X doesn't do crazy updates
[16:06:45] <Tiffany> does sim city have bad memory problems?
[16:06:47] <zofrex> Astraea: yeah! Windows versions are like Star Trek movies, every other one is shit
[16:06:51] <CarlColglazier> Why would you drop 7? It's still used by a ton of people (for good reason). 
[16:07:00] <Quxxy> I just want to go back to the good old days where the most disruptive UI change would be the addition of more gradients
[16:07:15] <zofrex> Tiffany: there's a use-after-free in the original that wasn't a problem in a non multitasking OS (DOS) but caused a crash when run in Windows, so Windows 95 has a special case for memory management if you launch Sim City
[16:07:17] <Tiffany> zofrex: by that logic windows 10 will be awful
[16:07:20] <Astraea> zofrex: you just can't beat the space whales movies
[16:07:22] <WindowsBunny> I don't understand this definition of sem_t in bits/semaphore.h
[16:07:25] <Tiffany> and windows 8.1 was great
[16:07:34] <WindowsBunny> It is a union of char[SIZE] and long int
[16:07:40] <zofrex> Windows 8.1 makes me angrier than literally any other operating system ever
[16:07:43] <Astraea> Tiffany: 8.1 didn't really do anything
[16:07:44] <Tiffany> unless you consider 8.1 a service pack, I guess
[16:07:55] <WindowsBunny> oh wait, SIZE is bytes, not bits
[16:08:02] <CarlColglazier> It basically was. Except for bricking computers on RT. 
[16:08:04] <zofrex> I *paid* for Windows 8. Full ticket price. Non-upgrade version. That's £180.
[16:08:06] <WindowsBunny> but really, 32 bytes for a semaphore?
[16:08:14] <Astraea> and yeah, I'd consider it a service pack
[16:08:22] <Quxxy> I still can't get over that calc.exe now has a *loading screen* in Windows 10
[16:08:23] <WindowsBunny> Well 8.1 was a free upgrade
[16:08:29] <WindowsBunny> over 8 anyway
[16:08:32] <CarlColglazier> Really?
[16:08:37] <Quxxy> Yeah
[16:08:38] <Quxxy> Really
[16:08:40] <Astraea> seriously though, microsoft needs to figure out a versioning scheme
[16:08:40] <Quxxy> It's been Metro-fied
[16:08:42] <Astraea> apple has it down
[16:08:44] <CarlColglazier> Ewww
[16:08:46] <Quxxy> Oh, also, you can't have more than one instance any more
[16:08:49] <zofrex> Here's how I install Windows 8.1 on a new PC: 1) Download Windows 7 and install it 2) Run the Windows 8 .exe installer and put in my product key and install Windows 8 3) Windows update three times 4) Install the Windows 8.1 upgrade
[16:08:50] <Astraea> 10.1-10.10 (forget the code names)
[16:08:51] <zofrex> it takes ALL DAY
[16:09:03] <Astraea> microsoft... nfi
[16:09:06] <Astraea> all over the place
[16:09:15] <zofrex> I'm not allowed to jump straight to Windows 8.1, the Windows 8.1 installer rejects my (perfectly valid) Windows 8.0 CD key
[16:09:18] <zofrex> because /that makes sense/
[16:09:24] <CarlColglazier> My laptop has a button that does nothing other than open calc.exe. I doubt that will be very useful if you can only have one open. 
[16:09:33] <WindowsBunny> zofrex: Why can't you at least install windows 8 directly?
[16:09:42] <Tiffany> windows NT 4.0, 5.0, 5.1, 6.0, 6.1, 7.0, 8.0, 10.0?
[16:09:51] <zofrex> there's no direct ISO download for windows 8, the only way to get an ISO is to run an .exe you can download from microsoft
[16:09:53] <WindowsBunny> Tiffany: No, it is NT 6.2 and 6.3
[16:09:56] <Tiffany> oh
[16:10:00] <zofrex> and the easiest way for me to run that .exe is to install windows 7
[16:10:01] <Quxxy> Yeah, there's no 7 or 8
[16:10:02] <WindowsBunny> not 7.0 and not 8.0
[16:10:03] <Tiffany> weird
[16:10:10] <Astraea> Tiffany: well... nobody really goes with those version numbers
[16:10:11] <Tiffany> I mean it makes sense
[16:10:17] <Tiffany> but I assumed that windows 10 was 10 for a reason
[16:10:23] <WindowsBunny> zofrex: Is there something wrong with using a Microsoft program to download the .iso?
[16:10:29] <Astraea> to say they're at least as good as OS X?
[16:10:30] <Astraea> =P
[16:10:32] <zofrex> WindowsBunny: yeah, I can't do it from OS X or Linux
[16:10:36] <Tiffany> according to wikipedia
[16:10:38] <WindowsBunny> zofrex: orite
[16:10:45] <WindowsBunny> hue
[16:10:49] <Tiffany> 3.1, 3.5, 3.51, 4.0, 5.0, 5.1, 5.2, 6.0, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, and 10.0
[16:10:50] <zofrex> here's the experience of pirating Windows 8.1: 1) Download the ISO and install it
[16:11:01] <zofrex> so yeah, I paid £180 to have a worse experience than pirates. Thanks Microsoft!
[16:11:15] <CarlColglazier> Microsoft knows best.
[16:11:16] <Astraea> Tiffany: can you match up what consumers called each release with those version numbers?
[16:11:37] <Tiffany> they were called "Windows NT $x" up until windows 2000, which is NT 5.0
[16:11:46] <zofrex> AND I swore to the heavens that I would not pay for the next version of Windows, no-how no-way no-sirree, not happening. And what do they do? Make it free! So I can't even protest by not paying for it. :(
[16:12:02] <CarlColglazier> Sucks to be you!
[16:12:18] <WindowsBunny> zofrex: I wonder if you can use your 8 key to install 10 directly
[16:12:23] <Tiffany> 5.1 is XP, 5.2 is XP 64bit + server 2003, 6.0 is vista + server 2008, 6.1 is 7 + server 2008R2 + home server 2011, 6.2 is 8 + server 2012, 6.3 is 8.1 + server 2012R2, 10.0 is 10 + server 2016
[16:12:28] <Tiffany> the server version names are reasonable
[16:12:30] <Tiffany> they're just the year
[16:12:42] <zofrex> WindowsBunny: I really hope so, otherwise my install chain is gonna be even longer!
[16:12:55] <Quxxy> I think, at this point, I'm going to sit back and wait for MS's forced update policy to horrifically backfire
[16:13:07] <Quxxy> and hope that StarDock releases a decent program to just replace the hideous styling
[16:13:12] <WindowsBunny> zofrex: I also hope that the free upgrade within the year means that if you use it within the year, you'll be able to do a fresh install of windows 10 with the same key after the year is over
[16:13:22] <Quxxy> Maybe write a proper calculator myself in Rust that *doesn't* require a load screen
[16:13:28] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: do it
[16:13:30] <zofrex> yeah. but I wouldn't put it past them to make it only work in that period
[16:13:43] <zofrex> the calculator requires a load screen?
[16:13:45] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: You can use user32-sys and make a GUI :D
[16:13:47] <Quxxy> Yeah
[16:13:52] <Quxxy> It's a Metro app
[16:13:54] <Quxxy> It has to load shit
[16:14:01] <Quxxy> Probably XAMLs
[16:14:06] <zofrex> Windows 10: Slower than Windows 3.1.1 even though your PC is 1000x faster
[16:14:09] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: I'll even help you with your calculator if you want
[16:14:19] <Quxxy> And half a zillion DLLs with 500 character-long names
[16:14:24] <CarlColglazier> yum
[16:14:25] <Astraea> zofrex: 1000x?
[16:14:39] <Astraea> surely my computer is WAY faster than that
[16:14:54] <zofrex> I... actually don't know
[16:14:57] <Quxxy> WindowsBunny: Someone needs to finish binding the entire Win32 API first
[16:15:04] <Astraea> I mean just consider the improvements in hardware
[16:15:11] <zofrex> it's not like Tom's hardware put Intel DX1 benchmarks along i7
[16:15:14] <Astraea> we have more cache levels (my newest macbook has 128MB of L4)
[16:15:15] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: *cough your bindgen cough*
[16:15:20] <Astraea> SSDs
[16:15:22] <Quxxy> Oh!  And the new calc is also much larger on-screen
[16:15:26] <Quxxy> Because Metro
[16:15:44] <Quxxy> And if you make it smaller than it likes, it'll just resize itself to be bigger again
[16:15:54] <Quxxy> Because you're a user, and you clearly don't know what size you want the window to be
[16:16:01] <zofrex> Astraea: I'm actually really interested in figuring this out now
[16:16:33] <Quxxy> Oh!  Oh!  And, for all the shit they changed... Notepad is still entirely untouched
[16:16:45] <Astraea> zofrex: I'm not sure it's possible to really figure out
[16:16:50] <Astraea> I mean you can talk about just processor speed
[16:16:51] <Quxxy> Windows *still* does not ship with a text editor that can handle large files *or* UNIX newlines
[16:16:55] <zofrex> Good! There'd be riots in the streets if they changed notepad
[16:17:12] <zofrex> oh, ok, those would be useful improvements
[16:17:17] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: Most of user32 is there https://github.com/retep998/winapi-rs/blob/master/lib/user32-sys/src/lib.rs
[16:17:18] <Astraea> but you have weird stuff like FPU (did computers of the 3.1 era even have hardware impls of that?)
[16:17:33] <zofrex> Astraea: as it happens I still have my old 486 system so I could potentially run the same benchmark on that and my macbook
[16:17:41] <Astraea> now we have GPGPUs on the same die as a CPU for doing parallel tasks
[16:18:05] <Astraea> you'd have to test a lot of different things tbh
[16:18:49] <niconii> Astraea: typically it was a separate FPU in those days
[16:19:09] <CarlColglazier> Is notepad bad at opening large files?
[16:19:13] <zofrex> awful
[16:19:26] <niconii> yeah it's really bad
[16:19:27] <CarlColglazier> That's surprising. 
[16:19:42] <Astraea> is it as bad as my nodejs editor of the week?
[16:19:47] <niconii> for a file that's a few megabytes, it basically freezes for several seconds before loading
[16:20:38] <WindowsBunny> CarlColglazier: Use notepad++ instead
[16:20:50] <CarlColglazier> WindowsBunny: Or emacs. ;)
[16:20:54] <Astraea> or vim
[16:20:55] <Astraea> VIM
[16:21:13] <WindowsBunny> Or notepad++ if you're not a masochistic terminal lover

[16:50:01] <Lurkin> http://phatbollard.bandcamp.com/track/millionaires-2 That's their most "popular" single.
[16:50:06] <Lurkin> They're buskers from the UK.
[16:51:26] <CarlColglazier> And of course the song takes more time than the Rust compiler. :P
[16:52:41] <Lurkin> I dunno why it say's 18min, it's not 18min long.
[16:53:16] <CarlColglazier> Ends at 2:50 for me. 
[16:53:36] <CarlColglazier> There's something at the end of the file though. 
[16:53:39] <CarlColglazier> Another song it seems. 
[16:54:14] <CarlColglazier> But still not quite Sufjan Stevens long. 
[16:55:22] <Quxxy> I've been enjoying electro swing recently
[17:02:03] <Quxxy> Ok, wat; Pandora just gave me a track which is blues played with a Japanese shamisen
[17:03:57] <Peach> 日本語でしょう〜
[17:04:19] <Quxxy> No actual words for it to be in Japanese
[17:04:39] <Quxxy> Just... it's an instrumental blues track which inexplicably has a shamisen in it
[17:04:50] <Astraea> join the proper channel guys! =P
[17:05:04] <Quxxy> But this *is* offtopic
[17:05:13] <Astraea> yeah, but I made #rust-music
[17:05:14] <Astraea> lol
[17:05:22] <Quxxy> But this has nothing to do with Rust
[17:05:30] <Quxxy> That would be for things like music programs written in Rust
[17:05:34] <Quxxy> Or music generated with Rust
[17:05:35] <Quxxy> *Surely*
[17:05:43] <Lurkin> We're squating on the name for that purpose.
[17:05:51] <Astraea> actually
[17:05:58] <Astraea> so... what's that one game where you use a real guitar
[17:06:13] <Lurkin> Led Zepplin?
[17:06:23] <Astraea> Rocksmith
[17:06:31] <Lurkin> I don't like Aerosmith.
[17:06:32] <Quxxy> Frets on Fire?
[17:06:46] <Astraea> like Guitar Hero, but with a real guitar
[17:06:47] <Astraea> anyway
[17:07:07] <Astraea> my room mate at the time got it, he told me I should learn how to play guitar by playing the game
[17:07:14] <Astraea> I said screw that and made a program to cheat
[17:07:45] <Peach> is there any use of having language semantics where a variable is "write-only" ?
[17:08:00] <Astraea> just output a sound and fed it into the ADC that came with the game
[17:08:19] <niconii> Peach: the only thing i can think of is if that variable is some sort of output port or something
[17:08:31] <mbrubeck> Peach: Rust (and various other languages) use the "write-only" variable _ to explicitly discard a value...
[17:08:34] <Quxxy> Initialising something
[17:08:42] <niconii> like if we're talking bare-metal programming, and it's a memory-mapped I/O port
[17:08:47] <Quxxy> _ isn't a variable, though
[17:08:49] <niconii> or uh
[17:08:53] <niconii> O port... i guess.
[17:08:56] <niconii> if it's write-only
[17:09:00] <Quxxy> It's not even an identifier
[17:09:10] <Quxxy> It's it's own special thing
[17:09:35] <Quxxy> On a semi-related note: Rust's parser is a bloody rat's nest
[17:09:43] <Quxxy> No wonder no one's written a complete grammar reference :P
[17:09:55] <Manishearth> mbrubeck: that is not a variable
[17:09:56] <Astraea> at least it works
[17:09:59] <Manishearth> Quxxy: it's not its own special thing
[17:09:59] <Astraea> *cough* swift *cough*
[17:10:15] <Manishearth> Quxxy: mbrubeck the `let` syntax is `let PAT : TYPE = EXPR;`
[17:10:15] <Quxxy> Manishearth: It has its own token type!
[17:10:30] <Manishearth> Quxxy: mbrubeck so in this case you're just using a wildcard pattern
[17:10:32] <Manishearth> nothing special
[17:10:43] <Manishearth> Quxxy: sure, but it's not special, just the regular wildcard thingy
[17:10:44] <Quxxy> There are even some places in the grammar where you can pass an ident but *not* an _
[17:10:54] <Manishearth> _ is not an ideant
[17:10:58] <Manishearth> *ident
[17:11:01] <Manishearth> _ is a pat
[17:11:04] <Quxxy> Which is what I said
[17:11:09] <Manishearth> yep
[17:11:18] <Quxxy> So why are we arguing?
[17:11:30] <Manishearth> I'm just saying that _ ain't special
[17:11:34] <mbrubeck> Yeah, I know.  But it's the closest thing I could think of to a "write-only variable"
[17:11:34] <Manishearth> it's a regular pattern
[17:11:36] <Manishearth> just like let x = 1
[17:11:38] <Astraea> because we're on the internet, Quxxy 
[17:11:43] <Manishearth> :P
[17:11:56] <Quxxy> It's the only binding name that isn't an ident
[17:11:59] <Quxxy> It's spechul
[17:12:05] <Manishearth> it is not a binding name -_-
[17:12:14] <mbrubeck> Quxxy: There's a bison grammar in the tree, though it's not used by the compiler...
[17:12:35] <Quxxy> It's used in bindings where a name would otherwise go
[17:12:45] <Manishearth> Quxxy: you can use other patterns there too
[17:13:06] <Quxxy> In other languages, it would also be considered an ident
[17:13:07] <Manishearth> let Foo {x:x, y:y} = ...
[17:13:18] <Manishearth> not an ident, not a binding
[17:13:23] <Quxxy> And it also otherwise matches Rust's own definition of an identifier
[17:13:27] <Manishearth> it behaves like one
[17:13:45] <Manishearth> but let is not "assign the rhs to the lhs"
[17:14:09] <Manishearth> let is "match the rhs to the pattern in the lhs and assign to any bindings"
[17:15:00] <dfockler> I just learned about that pattern matching let syntax in elixir
[17:15:33] <Astraea> I really like elixir
[17:15:56] <Astraea> I should definitely do a project in it
[17:16:30] <dfockler> it's interesting that it does the same pattern matching to function arguments to find which functions to execute
[17:16:39] <Astraea> yes!
[17:16:47] <Astraea> I actually very much love that feature
[17:18:11] <niconii> i'm interested in elixir too; i just have no idea what i'd make with it
[17:18:35] *** Manishearth sets mode: +o niconii
[17:18:45] <niconii> i like state too much :(
[17:18:52] <dfockler> and function guards are pretty nice, it feels really lispy in the way that the function definitions are just code, coming from a functional programming newbie
[17:18:52] <Manishearth> muh mutability
[17:19:38] <Astraea> dfockler: yup
[17:19:43] <Astraea> niconii: I actually do have a project in mind
[17:19:55] <Astraea> makes me feel dirty, but I think it'd be fun
[17:20:09] <niconii> Astraea: oh?
[17:20:32] <Quxxy>  // borrowing prevents simply writing this as a closure
[17:20:35] <Quxxy> Oh, I know *that* feel

[17:20:51] <Peach> 500GB hdd, 9GB free
[17:21:03] <Astraea> a lot of interesting technical challenges
[17:21:26] <dfockler> Quxxy: I was just trying to spawn threads in an iterator loop in Rust, and it was challenging
[17:21:26] <niconii> Astraea: well i guess that explains why you'd feel dirty >_>
[17:22:19] <Astraea> plus I'd have to do most of my testing with like... videos of kittens playing or something

[17:38:08] <dfockler> women have that feeling too
[17:38:15] <Peach> stop
[17:38:40] <Peach> guys is gender neutral form of addressing you all in some english speaking countries
[17:39:30] <dfockler> fight the patriarchy!
[17:39:33] <Astraea> English is a mess from a semantic perspective
[17:39:39] <Astraea> let's abandon it
[17:39:46] <Astraea> I nominate ithkuil to replace it
[17:39:46] <Peach> In my country, a girl will address her group of all-girl friends as "you guys"
[17:40:04] <niconii> Peach: not everyone feels that way
[17:40:23] <Peach> I said that's how my country does it sometimes
[17:40:31] <Peach> it isn't a feeling, it's a statement of what is
[17:40:46] <Astraea> I wish I had taken some linguistic courses at uni
[17:40:54] <Astraea> I know there's denotation and connotation
[17:41:10] <Astraea> but what are the terms for how someone else interprets the meaning
[17:41:30] <niconii> Peach: and i'm saying, if someone asks you to use something more neutral, you don't have to complain about it
[17:41:32] <Astraea> they're not even guaranteed to agree on the denotative meaning
[17:41:59] <Peach> Well what should I say guys and girls - or y'all :P
[17:42:09] <Astraea> how humans communicate is baffling to me
[17:42:21] <dfockler> denotation is like a dictionary definition, connotation is all the culture and subtext around a word
[17:42:22] <niconii> i personally tend to go with "everyone"
[17:42:33] <dfockler> or people

[17:46:58] <Astraea> I actually enjoy discussing these topics

[17:47:21] <Peach> Girls in CS rock
[17:47:23] <niconii> Peach: but, a couple things: 1) i am also a girl, and prefer "everyone", 2) regarding the perception of "guys" as gender-neutral, a greater percentage of men see it that way than women
[17:47:50] <WindowsBunny> If I hear "those guys over there" I think male
[17:47:57] <WindowsBunny> If I hear "hey guys" I think gender-neutral
[17:48:00] <Peach> ^
[17:48:03] <Astraea> niconii: I think 2 needs data to support such a claim (to be fair)
[17:48:15] <dfockler> those girls over there
[17:48:19] <niconii> anyway, it's not a serious thing, but it can get a little grating at times
[17:48:34] <Astraea> in either case, it doesn't take much effort to try and respect other people
[17:48:35] <WindowsBunny> I think grates are pretty grating
[17:48:43] <dfockler> guys has an older connotation, while girls has a younger connotation

[17:52:01] <niconii> Peach: yes, yes, but language is subject to change and the dictionary is not law
[17:52:06] <eddyb> argh if I rotate it, half the pages are upside down
[17:52:09] <eddyb> I need a printer :(
[17:52:33] <WindowsBunny> lol, erlang guys are so male
[17:52:54] <WindowsBunny> while java guys are significantly more inclusive
[17:53:14] <Peach> I post that as a confirmation of the validity of my language style use being used by others
[17:53:22] <Peach> I also wonder if gender assumptions are being thrusted upon me
[17:53:26] <niconii> WindowsBunny: i guess part of it is "guy" vs. "guys", but that doesn't quite explain "Python guy"
[17:53:31] <Peach> None of y'all know what I am :P
[17:53:43] <WindowsBunny> niconii: I feel like we need to do a survey of all the different programming languages

[17:53:49] <dfockler> Peach: you are a talking fruit obviously
[17:53:56] <Peach> Thank you
[17:54:21] <Peach> I get where niconii comes from, lots of the CS people I've met are stupid guys that are overly macho
[17:54:49] <fkaa> good news everyone!
[17:54:55] <fkaa> TIS-100 is awesome!
[17:54:58] <WindowsBunny> In my experience with higher education, a significant portion of the CS students were not very good at it
[17:55:22] <WindowsBunny> where significant means the vast majority
[17:55:50] <WindowsBunny> and the classes were predominantly male
[17:56:19] <WindowsBunny> the number of good students was slightly more than the number of female students
[17:57:15] <dfockler> I'm worried about institutional sexism within CS programs and tech in general, if you have only male classmates and teachers, you are less likely to feel like you belong
[17:57:39] <fkaa> how do you solve that?
[17:57:53] <dfockler> no idea
[17:58:06] <dfockler> ask people how they would like to be included
[17:58:26] <dfockler> what made them decide to choose one path instead of doing CS for example
[17:58:55] <WindowsBunny> In my time tutoring CS at college, I had one female student
[18:00:02] <Peach> Well the root of the imbalance goes back to society and how media portrays technical savvy-ness with gender
[18:00:07] <niconii> the gender ratio's a bit better at my college, though not by a ton
[18:00:20] <Astraea> fkaa: so you're saying I should get it?
[18:00:24] <WindowsBunny> I would absolutely love for there to be more diversity in CS
[18:00:29] <fkaa> i am!
[18:00:38] <Astraea> I probably will then =)
[18:00:44] <niconii> maybe... 1 in 8?
[18:00:50] <Astraea> my CS courses had... not many women in it
[18:00:56] <Astraea> my math classes were WAY better
[18:01:05] <WindowsBunny> niconii: Wow, that's pretty good
[18:01:25] <niconii> yeah... it's pretty sad that that even counts as "pretty good" though
[18:01:25] <WindowsBunny> Astraea: Hah, my calculus courses were about as devoid of females
[18:01:33] <WindowsBunny> calculus III, 100% male
[18:01:40] <niconii> let alone warrants a "wow"
[18:01:40] <Astraea> WindowsBunny: mine were like 50:50...
[18:01:46] <Lurkin> Interesting my so's phd program is mostly women.
[18:02:10] <Astraea> topology was... 3 women out of 7
[18:02:25] <Astraea> abstract algebra was... I think 3 out of 8
[18:03:52] <Astraea> I dunno, I always encourage everyone to go into math, CS, etc...
[18:03:59] <Astraea> learning for learning sake
[18:04:46] <Astraea> I tried to get my niece interested in math at a young age
[18:05:07] <Astraea> I'd make pizza with her and make the dough into a geometric shape, heh
[18:05:30] <WindowsBunny> Astraea: Should've written calculus problems on the pizza with cheese
[18:05:39] <Astraea> well she was like... 4
[18:05:49] <Astraea> I mean I tried explaining homeomorphisms with clay
[18:05:51] <Astraea> but it didn't stick
[18:05:52] <Astraea> lol
[18:06:12] <WindowsBunny> I'm sure the clay stuck to something
[18:06:24] <Astraea> well the lesson didn't stick in her brain =P
[18:06:33] <Astraea> too young to understand still
[18:07:16] <Astraea> everyone says I should be a teacher... I'd love to do it if I could teach how I wanted to teach
[18:07:57] <Manishearth> niconii: WindowsBunny my college is like 5-10% female. The CS batch of my year is 75-odd males, zero females (other CS batches of similar size have around 5 female students)
[18:08:22] <Manishearth> but this being India there are lots of issues contributing to that
[18:08:25] <niconii> Manishearth: eesh
[18:09:01] <niconii> afaict the gender balance of my college as a whole is pretty equal
[18:09:18] <niconii> wanna say more females than males actually
[18:09:45] <niconii> apparently it's 61% female
[18:10:28] <Manishearth> (getting into this college is highly competitive. which is okay on its own, but young girls in this country are often discouraged from pursuing higher studies, *especially* if it involves living somewhere else. So female students who ace the entrance exam but are discouraged by family to stay back cause a lot of this -- the seat they could have gotten will more likely be acquired by a male)
[18:10:42] <Astraea> my alma mater is 49% male, 51% female
[18:11:33] <Astraea> and if males dominate one program then females must surely dominate a different one
[18:13:05] <Manishearth> Whenever I've gone to tech events I see an almost equal ratio, which is good
[18:13:10] <Manishearth> esp tech events at colleges
[18:13:33] <Manishearth> but it's just the IITs which have a really screwed up ratio

[18:14:14] <Astraea> gotcha
[18:14:33] <Manishearth> oh god my college has a twitter account
[18:14:37] <Manishearth> this cannot end well
[18:15:20] <Astraea> so for the younger US residents in here, is there a lot of anti-education sentiment with kids still?
[18:15:33] <Astraea> when I was in high school if you did well in school it was looked down upon
[18:15:54] <niconii> Astraea: don't believe so
[18:16:00] <Astraea> but "nerd" culture has become a lot more mainstream
[18:16:08] <niconii> at least, the kids who took AP classes in my high school were always very popular
[18:16:18] <niconii> except for me lmao
[18:16:35] <Astraea> well that's good I guess
[18:16:42] <Astraea> not that last part
[18:16:43] <Astraea> lol
[18:16:45] <dfockler> niconii: same in my high school
[18:17:28] <Astraea> I was kind of unique in high school, did sports, acted in theater, did well in class
[18:17:39] <Astraea> I was able to move between groups easily, heh
[18:18:30] <Manishearth> Astraea: when I was in school in MA there was a separate program for really good students -- within the program there was very less looking-down-on-studying, but outside of it there was a lot
[18:18:44] * Manishearth never went to an American high school
[18:18:52] <Manishearth> over here folks are quite into studying
[18:18:54] <Manishearth> too much
[18:19:12] <WindowsBunny> Astraea: Being smart isn't really looked down upon, it is being inept at social stuff which is
[18:19:17] <niconii> i might've just gone to a particularly nice high school, too
[18:19:28] <niconii> it was a public school, but i don't live in a big city or anything
[18:19:31] <Astraea> WindowsBunny: maybe I went to a weird place
[18:19:39] <Astraea> smart people were absolutely picked on where I was
[18:20:01] <dfockler> I think weird kids get picked on more than smart kids
[18:20:07] <niconii> i don't think i ever saw any bullying at my high school
[18:20:12] <dfockler> some smart kids tend to be weird
[18:20:13] <WindowsBunny> I was a weird smart kid in school
[18:20:20] <WindowsBunny> but I would typically only get picked on for being weird
[18:20:24] <Astraea> ehh... true
[18:20:25] <Manishearth> WindowsBunny: same
[18:20:28] <niconii> in elementary school, sure, because little kids are assholes
[18:20:36] <niconii> but not high school really
[18:20:53] <Astraea> niconii: I was bullied up until maybe mid way through high school
[18:21:07] <dfockler> I'm from a small town, so basically everyone went to middle school and high school together
[18:21:20] <dfockler> so bullying didn't really happen either
[18:21:23] <niconii> i was bullied in elementary school, people were still kinda mean in middle school
[18:21:33] <Astraea> dfockler: how small?
[18:21:35] <niconii> but high school was pretty decent
[18:21:42] <Astraea> I think we covered this before...
[18:21:49] <dfockler> like around 6000 people in the town
[18:21:53] <Astraea> ah

[20:12:02] <Astraea> well
[20:12:14] <Astraea> I need to figure out how I should lay out this data
[20:12:17] <Tiffany> uh
[20:12:22] <Tiffany> UX isn't about pretty visuals
[20:12:30] <Astraea> UI/UX inspiration
[20:12:33] <Astraea> I need both
[20:12:34] <Astraea> =P
[20:12:58] <Astraea> basically I have a bunch of sensors
[20:13:13] <Astraea> they all report back data that needs to be graphed
[20:13:21] <Astraea> you can turn the sensors on/off
[20:13:21] <fkaa> i get a feeling this is inefficient http://puu.sh/jbucb/e9283a21ce.png
[20:13:36] <Astraea> the sensors can be grouped
[20:13:50] <Astraea> so at the top level I need to be able to get aggregated data
[20:14:10] <Astraea> at the group level I need to be able to see aggregate data for the group plus be able to turn all of them on/off
[20:14:33] <Astraea> and then at the sensor level I need to be able to see data and be able to turn them on/off
[20:15:57] <Astraea> kind of thinking about just using a drawer on the side
[20:17:40] <Peach> UX != UI  ?

[20:22:24] <Elaine> it's not aero, it's modern.
[20:22:30] <Tiffany> I think the main reason for it was to show off that they were using a compositor
[20:22:36] <eddyb> lol
[20:22:36] <Tiffany> since iirc XP was still stacked
[20:22:47] <WindowsBunny> Windows 7 could disable the compositer still
[20:22:50] <Tiffany> yeah
[20:22:57] <Tiffany> and it would disable the transparency effects
[20:22:58] <WindowsBunny> as of windows 8, it is 100% enabled all the time

[21:16:28] <WindowsBunny> Tiffany: I wish we had profiling tools like that for Rust
[21:16:46] <Tiffany> I thought rust could do normal profiling just fine?
[21:16:54] <Tiffany> I mean, rust binaries have DWARF info and everything
[21:17:13] <WindowsBunny> Tiffany: But do any native profiling tools do flame graphs?
[21:17:20] <Tiffany> yes?
[21:17:30] <WindowsBunny> and work on Windows?
[21:17:35] <Tiffany> oh, probably not
[21:17:37] <Astraea> no one cares about windows
[21:17:39] <Astraea> =P
[21:17:45] * WindowsBunny slaps Astraea
[21:17:47] <HedgeMage> rofl
[21:17:57] <Tiffany> the flame graph software accepts traces in perf format and a couple others
[21:17:59] <Tiffany> it's a pile of perl
[21:18:08] <Tiffany> https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph
[21:18:19] <Astraea> a pile of perl in perf...
[21:18:23] <WindowsBunny> ew
[21:18:41] <WindowsBunny> Hmmm, if VS's profiler can dump profiling info
[21:18:51] <Tiffany> probably, but this tool won't accept it
[21:18:52] <WindowsBunny> then I could parse that from a Rust program to print out a flame graph
[21:19:03] <WindowsBunny> and I'd have a version that works great on Windows
[21:19:11] <Tiffany> it would be nice to have a less hacky implementation of flame graphs
[21:19:25] <Tiffany> something with pluggable formats and not written in perl
[21:19:37] <WindowsBunny> Something written in Rust
[21:20:35] <Tiffany> it emits SVG, so it should be pretty easy to replicate
[21:21:23] <Tiffany> <g class="func_g" onmouseover="s('unix`mutex_enter (195 samples, 0.34%)')" onmouseout="c()">

[21:21:24] <Tiffany> </g>
[21:22:02] <WindowsBunny> the JS letting you zoom in is pretty impressive
[21:25:51] <Tiffany> what JS letting you zoom in, windowsbunny?
[21:27:45] <WindowsBunny> Tiffany: in the .svg on the java in flames page
[21:28:00] <WindowsBunny> there was embedded javascript so you could click on anything in the graph, and it would zoom in to it

[21:34:04] <Tiffany> oh
[21:34:05] <Tiffany> huh
[21:42:45] <Peach> Am I the only one that loves the simplicity of C's ABI compatibility
[21:42:53] <Peach> Compare it to C++03 vs C++11
[21:43:08] <Tiffany> C++ doesn't specify an ABI
[21:43:19] <Peach> The ABI that gets used in practice
[21:43:27] <Tiffany> and neither does C, for that matter
[21:43:43] <Peach> well I never said that Tiffany 
[21:43:50] <Peach> I said I like C's ABI compatibility
[21:44:30] <Peach> C++ is a jumbled incompatible mess in practice, compared to C
[21:44:36] <Tiffany> https://mentorembedded.github.io/cxx-abi/abi.html
[21:45:24] <Tiffany> I don't think the itanium ABI is that complicated?
[21:46:47] <Tiffany> the chapter on exception handling is a bit large
[21:48:08] <Tiffany> the largest challenge to interfacing with C++ is dealing with templates
[21:48:27] <Tiffany> and there are pretty straightforward schemes for that, the only downside of which is that they require you communicate with a C++ compiler
[21:48:40] <Peach> I dislike C++'s virtual function table and exceptions
[21:49:13] <Tiffany> do you like the implementation of them, or do you have a philosophical thing against vtables and exceptions?

[22:12:13] <WindowsBunny> Tiffany: vtables are super useful
[22:12:20] <WindowsBunny> exceptions... I could live without
[22:12:23] <Elaine> Peach: Historically C didn't have a simple ABI story either.
[22:12:26] <Tiffany> rust still needs unwinding
[22:12:31] <Tiffany> and that's like 80% of exceptions
[22:12:41] <Elaine> And it still doesn't on many OS's, compilers, and situations.
[22:12:53] <Tiffany> and vtables are very convenient
[22:13:01] <Tiffany> more convenient than passing around structs of function pointers
[22:13:01] <Peach> Well it still  turned out nice
[22:13:10] <Elaine> and C++ is turning out nice too.
[22:13:11] <Peach> vtables?
[22:13:15] <Peach> dynamic dispatch
[22:13:20] <Elaine> clang supports every major ABI on every platform.
[22:13:45] <Peach> Elaine: C++'s spec is so huge now, design wise I wouldn't call it "lean"
[22:13:50] <Elaine> Of course it's not.
[22:13:52] <Tiffany> uh
[22:13:54] <Peach> to me nice is lean
[22:13:56] <Elaine> That's not the point.
[22:13:56] <Tiffany> C++'s spec is not that long
[22:14:01] <Tiffany> like, have you even seen it?
[22:14:08] <Peach> of course, even C++14
[22:14:22] <Peach> and C++17 with its modules idea
[22:14:29] <Tiffany> it's just under 1400 pages long, but most of that is specifying the standard library
[22:14:53] <Tiffany> there are just under 400 pages of actual language
[22:15:07] <Tiffany> for comparison
[22:15:11] <Tiffany> the C11 specification is 700 pages
[22:15:12] <fkaa> comparatively the opengl & glsl specs are ~900 pages in total
[22:15:26] <Tiffany> with 180 pages of actual language
[22:15:36] <Tiffany> by that metric, C++ is only about twice as complex as C
[22:15:54] <Tiffany> now let's compare this to ECMAscript
[22:15:59] <Peach> C++'s ideas and concepts are too huge
[22:16:02] <Peach> is what I mean
[22:16:08] <Tiffany> not to me
[22:16:10] <Peach> It does everything
[22:16:11] <Elaine> The Java language spec is 788 pages, all of which is language.
[22:16:13] <Tiffany> no it doesn't
[22:16:17] <Peach> no way you can use all of C++'s features
[22:16:20] <Tiffany> yes you can
[22:16:25] <Peach> in practice
[22:16:30] <Tiffany> maybe
[22:16:43] <Tiffany> but the point is that they're there when you need them
[22:16:47] <Tiffany> you don't have to use them all at once
[22:16:55] <Tiffany> so ECMAscript is 566 pages
[22:17:09] <Tiffany> still waiting for the ToC to load
[22:17:32] <Peach> Well if I want to use the standard library without exceptions, I can't really in practice turn it off because many compiled binaries will still have exception code in them
[22:17:58] <Elaine> Turning off exceptions is an ABI change, you need to recompile everything anyway.
[22:18:03] <Peach> even if I just use the standard lib, I don't think exceptions really can be turned off
[22:18:04] <Peach> and yeah
[22:18:17] <Peach> ABI changes for features me no like
[22:18:42] <Tiffany> it looks like there are about 300 pages of language in ECMAscript
[22:18:45] <Tiffany> and the rest is library
[22:20:02] <niconii> if you want lean, there's always forth :D
[22:20:07] <Peach> I wanna make a language with a really small amount of pages for the actual language spec
[22:20:17] <Tiffany> nock's specification fits on a tshirt
[22:20:17] <Havvy> Peach:  So Scheme?
[22:20:30] <Peach> Can't stand scheme's syntax Havvy 
[22:20:34] <Peach> I want a C like synta
[22:20:35] <Peach> x
[22:20:37] <Tiffany> https://github.com/urbit/urbit/blob/master/urb/zod/spec/nock/5.txt
[22:20:40] <niconii> Tiffany: yeah, but nock is... nock
[22:20:53] <Tiffany> yeah
[22:21:19] <niconii> i mean, it's cool from a thought experiment perspective
[22:21:27] <Elaine> I like J.
[22:21:32] <Elaine> Nice and tiny, super consistent.
[22:21:33] <Tiffany> I don't really care for C's syntax
[22:21:36] <niconii> still can't get over that whole decrement thing though
[22:21:47] <Tiffany> lol yeah, O(N) decrement
[22:21:55] <snow> Thank you so much Tiffany; I've been trying to remember that projects name for a couple days now
[22:22:11] <Havvy> Peach:  More complex syntax means a more complex language spec.
[22:22:40] <Tiffany> I like both rust and C++
[22:22:46] <Tiffany> they are both in a good place
[22:23:03] <Peach> I like C++ and Javascript (with many footnotes)
[22:23:17] <Tiffany> I can't deal with weak typing
[22:23:41] <Elaine> yeah, implicit conversions are the devil.
[22:24:35] <mbrubeck> heh, I wrote a Nock interpreter once
[22:24:36] <mbrubeck> https://github.com/mbrubeck/mynock
[22:24:47] <Elaine> excellent name.
[22:25:24] <mbrubeck> thanks :)
[22:25:50] <Peach> footnotes people
[22:25:57] <Tiffany> nock at least has the cute idea of having bignum as the only number type
[22:26:00] <Peach> I don't like weak typing either
[22:26:07] <Tiffany> that would be cool in a scripting language
[22:26:16] <Elaine> Scheme? :P
[22:26:27] <Elaine> what with its numeric tower
[22:26:32] <Elaine> a whole tower!
[22:26:40] <Elaine> some might dare call it ivory...
[22:26:46] <Tiffany> I've never actually used scheme
[22:26:48] <Peach> Ideally I'd like a language sorta like Javascript and C++ mixed together with a sprinkle of python
[22:26:57] <Tiffany> I poked at common lisp once, and I've been thinking of using racket as a scripting language
[22:27:04] <Peach> but subtract all the bad parts
[22:27:16] <Tiffany> that sounds like a nightmare
[22:27:23] <mbrubeck> Julia?
[22:27:24] <Elaine> chicken scheme is my favorite implementation, but racket is excellent.
[22:27:41] <niconii> it just sounds vague to me... what does that mean exactly
[22:27:49] <Peach> that's cause you're not imagining it right Tiffany, you're just thinking of the bad parts
[22:27:52] <Peach> Julia is cool
[22:27:57] <Peach> but it's only for math really
[22:28:08] <Peach> I can't make Cryengine 4 with it
[22:28:30] <Astraea> not with that attitude
[22:28:54] *** Joins: RC9 (RCIX@moz-3e6.dfa.8.198.IP)
[22:28:56] <Peach> Lol, so yeah I want an easy to use language that would let me make Cryengine 4
[22:29:10] <Astraea> well I have a solution
[22:29:25] <niconii> cryengine 4 is a rather... lofty goal
[22:29:31] <Astraea> cryogenically freeze yourself for 50 years
[22:29:47] <Astraea> then cry engine 4 will be the thing they build in intro CS classes in elementary school
[22:29:52] <Astraea> =P
[22:30:56] <Peach> I like lofty
[22:31:19] <Peach> and also Astraea , if we don't set foundations for the future, we can't advance things
[22:31:52] <Peach> so yeah, I want a language for high performance game engines that isn't verbose or syntax cluttered
[22:31:57] <Astraea> we're pretty good at building foundations out of sand
[22:33:59] <Peach> niconii: That's what I love doing - making complex things simpler to achieve, that's what tech is all about
[22:34:08] <Peach> imagine where we'd be if we ONLY had ASM
[22:34:36] <niconii> UIs would probably be a lot faster...
[22:34:41] <Astraea> lol
[22:34:58] <Astraea> nah, javascript for everything
[22:35:03] <Astraea> it's the new ASM
[22:35:06] <Astraea> let's build upon it!
[22:35:09] <Peach> I want to see the next language leap that is very performant but makes current programming languages look like ASM
[22:35:27] <Peach> make it so simple and so powerful it makes other languages look like ASM
[22:35:40] <Astraea> well...
[22:35:43] <Elaine> Array language enthusiasts tend to feel that way, especially K programmers ;)
[22:36:08] <Astraea> very performant and very high level aren't always compatible
[22:36:14] <Elaine> And some lisp users
[22:36:37] <Astraea> personally I think FRP and dependent types are interesting futures
[22:36:39] <Peach> Astraea: that's a common observation, I'd love specific examples so I can learn
[22:36:47] <Peach> FRP stands for?
[22:36:52] <Elaine> Peach: Here's a good example: BLAS.
[22:37:09] <Elaine> If your language can't implement a BLAS as fast as OpenBLAS, it's not high performance.
[22:37:35] <Astraea> Peach: functional reactive programming
[22:37:46] <Elaine> Consider also line-speed encryption.
[22:38:56] <Peach> The language def could implement BLAS
[22:39:07] <WindowsBunny> Roller Coaster Tycoon ran pretty damn fast
[22:39:08] <Elaine> Prove it :P
[22:39:15] <Peach> *DURN IT*
[22:39:18] <WindowsBunny> and that was mostly ASM
[22:39:46] <Elaine> See, there's lots you can do to talk about how simple and performant languages can be, but it just doesn't happen if you're going to have an imperative, easy-to-understand model.
[22:39:59] <Astraea> I think we need to extend FRP though
[22:40:08] <Elaine> You need to prototype and experiment
[22:40:38] <Elaine> If you don't have any fundamentally new ideas, you're not going to advance the state of the art
[22:40:48] <Peach> Elaine: I like your ideas, give me more constraints about what the language needs to implement in terms of performance
[22:40:52] <Peach> OpenBLAS is one
[22:40:56] <Astraea> multi-modal logic basis or go home, that's my motto!
[22:41:09] <Astraea> no wait... my motto is to add more dimensions to a problem until it solves itself...
[22:41:09] <Peach> I need a non trivial thing to benchmark vs C++
[22:41:26] <Peach> C/C++
[22:41:39] <Elaine> Peach: hashcat
[22:41:47] <Elaine> and bitcoin miner
[22:42:17] <Elaine> you could throw the usual benchmarks at it like dhrystone
[22:43:03] <Astraea> question expecting a biased answer, should I toy around with rust this weekend, or elixir? =)
[22:43:23] <Elaine> Perhaps a high-performance database like postgresql
[22:44:32] <WindowsBunny> Astraea: Rust
[22:44:34] <Peach> Anything more visual Elaine ?
[22:44:48] <Peach> graphics stuff, pretty demo benchmark stuff
[22:46:00] <Astraea> WindowsBunny: since you answered you get to tell me what I should do with rust =P
[22:46:14] <WindowsBunny> Astraea: Work with windows API :D
[22:46:17] <Astraea> I dunno why, but all of the things I'd like to do are big massive projects
[22:46:38] * Astraea slowly pushes windows work laptop under the rug
[22:46:42] <Astraea> I don't have a windows machine, sorry
[22:46:56] <WindowsBunny> Then I'm out of ideas
[22:46:59] <Astraea> lol
[22:47:04] <WindowsBunny> Astraea: oh wait, I know
[22:47:12] <Astraea> I can look back into objc integration
[22:47:14] <WindowsBunny> Astraea: Write a Rust library to do colorspace conversions
[22:47:26] <Astraea> surely someone has done that already... 
[22:47:49] <niconii> Peach: graphics isn't really the best choice for a language benchmark; that's probably going to be a lot more dependent on your GPU than anything to do with your language's speed
[22:47:54] <WindowsBunny> Astraea: I don't know of any rust libraries that are high quality with proper conversions between various colorspaces
[22:48:08] <Peach> No niconii , there's things like pathtraces that use all CPU
[22:48:10] <WindowsBunny> bjz's color library seems pretty dead in the water
[22:48:13] <Peach> *pathtracers
[22:48:20] <Astraea> I also wanted to make a QRNG library for rust at one point
[22:48:22] <Astraea> that'd be fun
[22:49:11] <Astraea> I'm terrible at API design though...
[22:49:14] <Astraea> eh, gotta learn sometime!

[22:54:41] <niconii> Peach: we did come up with new ideas! it's called rust!

[22:55:26] <Astraea> do you have some specific needs?
[22:55:38] <Astraea> tbh I don't know a ton about colorspaces
[22:55:47] <Astraea> pretty much everything I learned about it was when I was making a piet interpreter
[22:55:48] <niconii> rust would be better if every variable required spinning up an instance of chrome, so we can process it with javascript
[22:55:57] <Peach> ^ .....

[22:57:39] <WindowsBunny> Plan 9?
[22:57:51] <Tiffany> the original Sun one, or some still-maintained one?
[22:57:51] <niconii> ah hell, let's just nest them all inside each other
[22:57:55] <niconii> for maximum security
[22:58:03] <niconii> Tiffany: both! why not
[22:58:14] <niconii> and then let's write the VM in hoon
[22:58:33] <Peach> :((((
[22:58:37] <Tiffany> "In 1999, Sun and IBM announced the end of the JavaOS project.[5]"
[22:58:49] <Astraea> well that was silly
[22:58:52] <WindowsBunny> niconii: And then we should convert all the machine code to llvm IR, and run the entire several layers of VM madness through llvm's opt
[22:58:57] <Astraea> they could have been android before android
[22:59:07] <niconii> Peach: but nah, just kidding; the problem is that coming up with good ideas is *hard*
[22:59:33] <Tiffany> Java-based operating systems seem doomed to failure
[22:59:34] <WindowsBunny> niconii: Well, good ideas that aren't already being used somewhere
[22:59:37] <Peach> it's easier to come up with good ideas as you're solving a problem
[22:59:47] <Tiffany> the "See Also" references 4 others, all of which have failed
[22:59:50] <Peach> so, generic ideas are hard when there's no context
[23:00:01] <Tiffany> the most recent one I saw had its last release in 2012
[23:00:05] <Peach> but depending on what you want, we can come up with good ideas
[23:00:09] <WindowsBunny> Tiffany: Java isn't exactly the best language to write a kernel in
[23:00:23] <Tiffany> but the kernel isn't written in Java
[23:00:25] <Peach> How about we do the easiest category niconii  - Programmer friendliness
[23:00:28] <Tiffany> the kernel is the JVM
[23:00:47] <Peach> many APIs have poor naming and API design is barely an art
[23:01:01] <niconii> Peach: well, if we're talking maximum programmer friendliness, the optimum would probably be something like...
[23:01:03] <WindowsBunny> Good thing windows API has excellent naming
[23:01:09] <niconii> "computer, make the thing i want"
[23:01:17] <Tiffany> oh god
[23:01:26] <WindowsBunny> except for winsock, that's such a mishmash of BSD naming and WSAJunk
[23:01:36] <Tiffany> Do What I Want programming
[23:01:49] <WindowsBunny> inb4 computer builds me a rabbit harem
[23:02:12] <Peach> Well we can within reason,   
[23:02:12] <Tiffany> I'm trying to remember some of the gnarlier windows API names from my experience with it
[23:02:22] <Tiffany> they're pretty long, but that's not necessarily bad
[23:02:27] <Peach> like   openwindow(windowsize:fullscreen); or something
[23:02:27] <Astraea> niconii: I think maximum programmer friendliness is maximum user friendliness
[23:02:28] <Tiffany> MsgWaitForObjectsEx
[23:02:33] <Astraea> where you just think and stuff gets done
[23:03:07] <Astraea> in the vein of "Man, I wish I didn't have to get up to change the channel on my TV"
[23:03:13] <niconii> Astraea: why would you want to think, when the computer could just predict what you want before you even realize you want it
[23:03:20] <Astraea> and then a 3D printed and programmed controller pops into your lap from... somewhere
[23:03:21] <Astraea> =P
[23:03:24] <Tiffany> there is a tradeoff between ease of use and scalability
[23:03:29] <Astraea> oh...
[23:03:36] <Astraea> okay, yeah, yours is better, niconii 
[23:03:37] <Tiffany> there are dozens of languages which come with the ability to open a window and draw turtle graphics in 3 lines of code
[23:03:50] <Tiffany> but you wouldn't write a web browser in any of them
[23:03:53] <WindowsBunny> AddIntegrityLabelToBoundaryDescriptor
[23:04:08] <WindowsBunny> GetVolumePathNamesForVolumeName
[23:05:13] <Tiffany> only really C++ and Rust are designed for the kind of development scales required in building a web browser
[23:05:17] <WindowsBunny> For the most part the verbose naming of winapi is rather nice, you don't have to memorize obscure shorthand
[23:05:41] <Tiffany> that's really the basic difference between scripting languages and programming languages and imo trying to merge the two isn't really worth it
[23:05:42] <Peach> I want to make a simple user friendly language that scales
[23:06:22] <Tiffany> but that's the thing
[23:06:26] <Tiffany> user friendly doesn't really scale
[23:06:29] <WindowsBunny> Peach: Then do it, try stuff and see what works
[23:06:40] <Tiffany> dynamic typing is often considered user friendly, but it's a nightmare to maintain a codebase like that past a few thousand lines
[23:06:48] <Peach> I need example projects to test the scalability of it
[23:06:53] <Peach> or 
[23:07:03] <Peach> "goal projects to write in the language"
[23:07:10] <WindowsBunny> How about writing a compiler for the language in the language? :D
[23:07:15] <Peach> Tiffany: what about static type inference
[23:07:21] <Tiffany> being able to open a window with one line of code is cute, but what happens when you want to attach a GL context? or remove window decorations? or a dozen other things?
[23:07:24] <Peach> That's already on the list WindowsBunny 
[23:07:36] <WindowsBunny> Peach: static type inference, isn't that what haskell uses?
[23:07:47] <WindowsBunny> and I would never ever put haskell as user friendly
[23:07:49] <Tiffany> you can use basic type inference like Rust and C++
[23:08:04] <Tiffany> and you can do something like Haskell
[23:08:14] <Peach> GL context setup is nice, I want that built into the language library
[23:08:26] <Tiffany> you would need anonymous ADTs to really make that work
[23:08:31] <Havvy> I think Haskell can be user friendly - it just allows people to be too clever by half too easily.
[23:08:38] <Tiffany> and that would make code harder to understand in isolation
[23:08:57] <Tiffany> Haskell can supposedly be used for multi-million-line codebases
[23:09:09] <Tiffany> but not for a web browser
[23:09:52] <Peach> Haskell is evil for scalability
[23:09:53] <Tiffany> GL context setup built into the standard library is a liability
[23:10:00] <Tiffany> how do you compile applications on headless systems?
[23:10:04] <Peach> liability ?
[23:10:14] <Tiffany> or do you split up your standard library into individual modules which each link different libraries?
[23:10:24] <Peach> there would be,
[23:10:51] <Peach> standard lib - and media lib, media lib is for device driver related things like graphics sound etc.
[23:11:08] <Peach> so media lib wouldn't be available on a system that's just a plain CPU
[23:11:29] <Tiffany> would that media lib be made up of individual bits?
[23:11:42] <Tiffany> some servers have GPUs, but they won't have sound, or GUI environments
[23:11:50] <Tiffany> they're used for stuff like OpenCL and offline rendering
[23:12:10] <Peach> media lib and everything would be modular,
[23:12:23] <Astraea> WindowsBunny: will you be around tomorrow?
[23:12:53] <Astraea> I'm down with a color space library
[23:12:53] <Peach> so OpenGL, OpenAL, etc. are available, and GUI enviroments would be a separate thing that references other parts of the media lib when available
[23:12:55] <Tiffany> I was originally working on my own programming language
[23:12:57] <Astraea> but I'm going out tonight
[23:13:01] <Tiffany> but at this point, I will just use Rust instead
[23:13:14] <Astraea> openal is terrible
[23:13:21] <Peach> I wonder what Tiffany 's language was gonna be like
[23:13:33] <Astraea> concatenative
[23:13:43] <WindowsBunny> Astraea: I am always around
[23:13:46] <Tiffany> concatenative, linear typing, powerful abstractions over low-level primitives
[23:13:46] <WindowsBunny> except when I am not
[23:14:03] <Astraea> then I feel we can collaborate! =P
[23:14:19] <Peach> Astraea: elaborate on why OpenAL is bad?
[23:14:27] <Peach> I mean, for basic sound operations
[23:14:34] <Peach> and just getting audio to play
[23:14:41] <Peach> I know it's not FMOD
[23:14:46] <Peach> but elaborate please
[23:14:56] <Tiffany> there are two important things missing from rust that I will miss, but not terribly so
[23:15:20] <Astraea> Peach: it's controlled by Creative and it's dead
[23:15:23] <Tiffany> and those are linear typing, and the ability to run a persistent actor system on a JIT for platform portability
[23:15:33] <Tiffany> I like roamable computing
[23:15:49] <Tiffany> yeah, OpenAL is pretty much dead
[23:15:55] <WindowsBunny> openal isn't really open
[23:15:55] <Tiffany> there really needs to be a new sound standard
[23:15:59] <Tiffany> yeah, not open
[23:16:11] <niconii> yaaay misnomers
[23:16:18] <Tiffany> the best we have right now if you need basic audio playback is probably SDL
[23:16:25] <Astraea> well... I mean the standard released in a decade ago is open
[23:16:29] <Astraea> but that's where it will stay
[23:16:38] <Tiffany> yeah, the specification is open
[23:16:42] <Tiffany> but the only working implementation is not
[23:16:52] <Astraea> s/released in a/released a/
[23:17:09] <Astraea> anyway
[23:17:24] <Astraea> Creative destroyed the entire audio segment of the computing market
[23:17:34] <Astraea> and I don't think I will ever forgive them
[23:17:53] <Tiffany> Creative is still sitting on the shadow volume patent
[23:17:59] <Tiffany> and they patent trolled id over it
[23:18:07] <Tiffany> and for that I will never forgive them
[23:18:23] <Tiffany> I don't think they have ever once used that IP
[23:18:28] <Tiffany> they just sit on it to sue anyone who uses it
[23:18:51] <Tiffany> it doesn't expire until May 2019
[23:18:55] <Astraea> =/
[23:18:56] *** Joins: EduardoBautista (uid51042@moz-qf293j.tooting.irccloud.com)
[23:18:58] <Astraea> so depressing
[23:20:10] <Peach> SDL audio is bad too
[23:21:15] <Astraea> if I had the expertise, financial backing, and vision I'd definitely try to improve that area
[23:21:30] <Astraea> but I'm missing out on like... all three of those areas, so nope heh
[23:21:37] <Peach> SDL's audio system was really bad and couldn't loop audio without crackling
[23:21:48] <Peach> and it couldn't set sound speed
[23:22:27] <Astraea> audio rendering is still an interesting topic tbh
[23:22:59] <Astraea> and the next big thing, haptic rendering! woo!
[23:24:15] <WindowsBunny> I think I used portaudio in one of my projects
[23:24:30] <WindowsBunny> which worked well for the most part
[23:26:21] *** Quits: dfockler (dfockler@moz-etoj16.hfc.comcastbusiness.net) (Connection closed)
[23:28:06] <Tiffany> well, fmod already improved in that area
[23:28:11] <Tiffany> the only trouble is that it's a commercial product
[23:28:18] <Tiffany> there is a free version for indie games or something
[23:28:37] <Tiffany> "If you are developing an indie title and your total costs are less than $100k USD at time of shipping, you can now use FMOD for free!"
[23:28:51] <Tiffany> "If the application containing FMOD is not intended for commercial gain and does not include the FMOD library for resale, license or other commercial distribution, then use of FMOD is free. Yes that’s right, free from license fees!"
[23:29:03] <Tiffany> ah
[23:29:10] <Tiffany> but you can only make one game a year on the indie license
[23:29:39] <Tiffany> the cheapest license is $500
[23:29:56] <Tiffany> oh
[23:29:58] <Tiffany> it's $500/title
[23:31:14] <Tiffany> it looks like PortAudio is also a thing, if you want basic audio playback
[23:31:24] <Tiffany> you're kind of stuck with OpenAL or FMOD if you want 3D audio playback I think?
[23:33:42] <Peach> What's the point of FMOD for indie
[23:33:51] <Peach> how much better is FMOD than OpenAL
[23:34:08] <Tiffany> well, for one thing, FMOD has been updated since 2005
[23:35:00] <Tiffany> it has an editor, supports dozens of file formats
[23:35:04] <Tiffany> looking for a proper feature list
[23:35:35] <Peach> an EDITOR?
[23:35:40] <Peach> For an AUDIO system
[23:35:43] <Tiffany> it's separate
[23:35:48] <Tiffany> it comes with it when you buy a license, though
[23:36:11] <Tiffany> it looks like OpenAL doesn't support environment-based sounds
[23:36:36] <Tiffany> it does positional audio, it does doppler effect, it probably allows you to specify a convolution kernel
[23:36:46] <Tiffany> but it doesn't let you specify an environment model to simulate sounds in
[23:37:31] <Tiffany> it looks like FMOD has a bunch of fancy effects you can apply
[23:37:35] <Tiffany> and a plugin system
[23:39:22] <Tiffany> "Completely flexible DSP graph architecture that you can build yourself! Connect nodes into a custom graph and control the way you want the sound to behave. Matrix Panning."
[23:39:39] <Tiffany> that sounds pretty cool
[23:39:59] <Elaine> yeah, fmod is actually, like, good.
[23:40:03] <Elaine> openal is crap.
[23:41:01] <Tiffany> well
[23:41:13] <Tiffany> it wasn't that awful back in the early naughties when it was actually newish
[23:41:20] <Tiffany> it just hasn't changed since then...
[23:56:37] <Tiffany> for example
[23:57:10] <Tiffany> EAX 1.0, released in 2001, supported 8 simultaneous voices(!), 32 individual 32 voices(!), per-channel environmental convolution kernel presets (not custom kernels)
[23:58:02] <Tiffany> it wasn't until EAX 2.0 that occlusion effects were available
[23:58:49] <Tiffany> that's what OpenAL was designed to compete with
[23:58:55] <Tiffany> and Creative just hasn't cared enough to keep up
[23:59:30] <Tiffany> they did care enough to put the 1.1 spec under a proprietary license
