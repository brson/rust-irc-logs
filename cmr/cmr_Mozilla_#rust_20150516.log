[01:04:20] <doomrobo> DoubleAW|skewl, no, Handler is a trait, not a class. If you wanted to make a struct that implemented handler, you'd do something like: struct S { /* stuff here */}; impl Handler for S { fn handle_stuff(&self) { /* implementation here */} }

If the compiler sees that you're calling a method that is not implemented by the type, it calls deref() on it and gets another type that it then checks if it implements the required method.

[02:41:06] <cmr> It probably wouldn't be a plugin, wouldn't parse as "normal" Rust.

[02:41:59] <ChrisMorgan> Dependent types are really cool stuff and very useful, but at present they suffer from much the same issues as I have commented on in HKT: they’re scary. It’s a social problem rather than a technical problem.

[02:42:41] <Mutabah> They're conceptually complex
[02:42:43] <GBGamer> ChrisMorgan: The issue I have with them is they are pretty difficult to understand
[02:42:55] <creationix> I’m ready to add strings to my language vm, but I’m getting stuck on lifetime semantics https://github.com/creationix/jack.rs/blob/master/src/main.rs
[02:42:57] <GBGamer> at least for me
[02:43:06] <Mutabah> if rust gets them, stuff in std will use them, and now everyone needs to know them
[02:43:18] <GBGamer> exactly
[02:43:28] <GBGamer> And suddenly, I can't reason about my programs well
[02:43:31] <cmr> I don't personally expect Rust to get them in any future.
[02:43:34] <ChrisMorgan> GBGamer: the same is true of lifetimes.
[02:43:43] <seanmonstar> ChrisMorgan: good catch. Although, "future versions"... H2 didn't seem to do so
[02:43:45] <ChrisMorgan> cmr: I don’t either. I do except languages heavily inspired by Rust to get them.

[02:43:52] <GBGamer> but lifetimes don't change the semantics of programs
[02:44:01] <nrc> my opinion is there is a technical problem in dealing with the complexity. OO is a practical way to do existential types, but having real existentials in a language is a non-starter. When we find a way to do for HKT or dep types, what OO did for existentials, it will be revolutionart

[03:38:04] <GBGamer> tunnuz: it is quite similar, yes
[03:38:05] <XMPPwocky> tunnuz: this part of things is almost identical to idiomatic C++ with smart pointers, yes.
[03:38:06] <tunnuz> however, I read about new somewhere on the book, but I guess i'm referring to ::new()

[03:38:29] <tunnuz> is it a common pattern to implement a ::new factory method
[03:38:30] <XMPPwocky> i.e. Vec::new() is "fn() -> Vec<T>"
[03:38:32] <tunnuz> in Rust, right?
[03:38:33] <niconii> tunnuz: ::new() is just a normal method, basically
[03:38:42] <tunnuz> ok
[03:38:44] <doomrobo> If I have a x: RefCell<String> and I want to replace the contents with a new string (&str), is there a more elegant way than let y = x.borrow_mut().deref_mut().clear(); y.push_str(s)  ?
[03:38:50] *** Joins: bombless (_@moz-h37.piv.41.59.IP)
[03:38:54] <niconii> tunnuz: yes, it's customary to do something like `impl Struct { fn new() -> Struct { ... } }`
[03:39:10] <talchas> doomrobo: you probably don't need that deref_mut
[03:39:20] *** Quits: larhat (Adium@moz-64mvae.outplay.com) (Quit: Leaving.)
[03:39:21] <tunnuz> second question: on a previous version of the book, somewhere it said you can create directly a reference to something new, without going through the binding
[03:39:26] *** Joins: ruukasu (ruukasu@moz-obsv1c.res.rr.com)
[03:39:41] <doomrobo> talchas, so let mut y = &x.borrow_mut() ?

[03:39:46] *** Joins: larhat (Adium@moz-64mvae.outplay.com)
[03:39:47] <tunnuz> what is the use case of this?
[03:39:57] <tunnuz> yes, so in this case, is the whatever on the stack or the heap?
[03:39:58] <XMPPwocky> both will now automatically extend the lifetime of whatever, if it's a temporary
[03:40:04] <XMPPwocky> tunnuz: it could be anywhere
[03:40:04] <niconii> tunnuz: whatever would be on the stack
[03:40:26] <XMPPwocky> it could be in .data or even .rdata for all I care (if it's a static )
[03:40:33] <niconii> tunnuz: or what XMPPwocky said, yeah
[03:40:43] <tunnuz> so 'ref' reads pretty much like: take the reference to something
[03:40:49] <talchas> doomrobo: you're going to need either let bind the borrow_mut or call it twice either way

[04:14:52] <chowmeined> could there be an optimization for bounds checks for random array indexing by doing something like, if llvm sees it is array pointer + offset % array length, then you could skip bounds checks, if the programmer made a mistake it'd still be memory safe, just wrong lookups
[04:14:57] *** Quits: larhat (Adium@moz-64mvae.outplay.com) (Quit: Leaving.)
[04:15:06] <slimsag> so, is there a process defined for how std libs will transition from unstable to stable ? when do they become "stable" ? Is it just rust authors make the decision on their own as best they can?

[04:16:18] <posborne> Rust itself works fine with the target spec, but I need libcore for each target
[04:16:27] <chowmeined> XMPPwocky, yeah i guess im wondering how that sort of "safe" interface could be presented in rust, or can the programmer do it manually to avoid bounds checks?
[04:16:33] <doomrobo> slimsag, I don't think it's that formal. It seems that the authors and core developers just work on things until they're safe to use and named properly and structured as they please, and then stabilize it
[04:16:44] <huon> posborne: the easiest way would be to copy it into a cargo project and let cargo manage the cross compilation
[04:16:46] <chowmeined> I ask because I've seen a few of the posts comparing rust to C++ and this comes up in almost all of them

[05:26:38] <XMPPwocky> oh yeah, that's another thing
[05:26:39] <Maxxi> Manishearth: So please put all that extra compile time goodness behind a switch and let me iterate faster?
[05:26:39] <desophos> well, limitations (design decisions), not problems
[05:26:40] <zamabe> Maxxi: I disagree, I'll trade 10 extra minutes of compile time for not having to worry about memory management failures
[05:26:46] <XMPPwocky> if there's one group of people who are annoyed by compile times
[05:26:52] <XMPPwocky> it's probably compiler hackers
[05:27:00] <djrenren> Maxxi: Think of all the time you'll save when you aren't debugging race conditions and access violations :D
[05:27:00] <Havvy> rustc 1.1.0b1 has faster compilation times than rustc 1.0.0.  ;)
[05:27:04] <GBGamer> I'm happy about a thirty minute build
[05:27:06] <XMPPwocky> because rust takes *much* longer
[05:27:10] <GBGamer> that's kind of depressing
[05:27:22] <GBGamer> I've had to deal with >1hr builds before
[05:27:23] <Maxxi> right now im coding mostly in c# and im barely if ever debugging race conditions
[05:27:27] <XMPPwocky> i'm pretty sure rustc would improve much faster if it compiled faster

[05:27:40] <Havvy> What huon said.

[05:27:51] <desophos> usually i debug code by running it; can rust really debug my code before i write it? it sounds too good to be true...
[05:27:56] <XMPPwocky> if you want to, idk, write something in the kernel
[05:28:03] <Maxxi> eevee: because i use c on linux and c# on windows

[05:28:43] <XMPPwocky> stuff like ADTs catch a lot of logic errors
[05:28:46] <Maxxi> look guys, thanks for the discussion but as i said: if it doesnt compile as fast as c, it isnt suitable as a replacement. Thats my opinion, bye
[05:28:48] <GBGamer> kernels: C killed asm, and now, Rust shall kill C
[05:28:48] <Manishearth> Maxxi: putting compile time goodness behind a switch makes no sense whatsoever
[05:28:57] <Manishearth> that would fundamentally change the language
[05:29:01] *** Parts: Maxxi (Ivo@moz-pgi2ei.highway.telekom.at) ("Leaving")

[08:00:55] <leshow> quick question, i'm trying to initialize a vector using the range notation, but I can't get it right, what is the proper way to initialize a vector from say 0 to 9 (0,1,2,3...)
[08:00:57] <ChrisMorgan> Could a channel operator change the word “playpen” to “playground” in the topic? I changed it on the site as part of my redesigning it, mentioned the change, one person commented on it in approval, and it landed, so the site calls itself the Rust Playground now. Alternatively, start the bikeshed in the rust-playpen repository issue list ☺
[08:01:03] <leshow> I tried vec![0..9]
[08:01:10] <leshow> and that didnt seem to work
[08:01:25] *** Quits: larhat (Adium@moz-64mvae.outplay.com) (Quit: Leaving.)
[08:01:36] <ChrisMorgan> leshow: 0..9 is an expression, Range { start: 0, end: 9 }.
[08:01:44] <GBGamer> leshow: (0..9).collect()
[08:01:52] *** Joins: larhat (Adium@moz-64mvae.outplay.com)

[08:07:26] <leshow> based on the system it's running on
[08:07:27] <niconii> leshow: the idea behind isize and usize is that they're strictly meant for memory-related things, like lengths, indexes, offsets, etc.
[08:07:30] <ChrisMorgan> isize is intended *solely* for memory related things.

[12:37:05] <foodoo> But this might also be a deliberate feature-omission in Rust. I remember James Gosling saying that if he would have had the chance to re-design Java he would do without inheritance and do everything with interfaces
[12:37:47] <tilpner> frogmella - It's not that easy. Do you have a simple C-style enum?
[12:37:47] <doener> geri: what differs is that you map just 30000 bytes in the C code, using an offset with the mmap, but you map a little more than a GB in the rust code. Again, shouldn't make a difference, but that's the only thing I can spot right away
[12:37:47] <foodoo> I guess the way to go then would be to use generics to avoid duplicate code
[12:37:47] <geri> doener: http://ideone.com/i2nqFD
[12:38:03] <tilpner> frogmella - More complex enums, with variants that actually store data, are usually not equivalent to an integer.

[12:51:03] <Quxxy> creationix: You're unlikely to get Copy working; just use Clone instead

[12:51:24] <Quxxy> Copy is *only* allowed for things that are trivially bit-copyable; nothing with a destructor is likely to qualify

[15:07:21] <fredy> hello all, I can not understand this error http://is.gd/hFFkFR : I thought that returning a type that follows the trait constrains would work
[15:07:22] <hroi> kimundi: now I feel stupid :)
[15:07:42] <fredy> is there any way to implement this?
[15:07:48] <jmbto> hi, I am trying to launch some rust project, and the following error times 500 is spawned : "error: use of unstable library feature 'libc': use `libc` from crates.io"
[15:07:59] <jmbto> I looked into Cargo.toml
[15:08:17] <Quxxy> fredy: No, what that says is: "for any T that the *caller* chooses, I can return a value of that type"
[15:08:24] <Quxxy> You don't get to choose what T is, the *caller* does
[15:08:28] <jmbto> I changed the dependency bout to libc = "*"
[15:08:32] <mlafeldt> ogham: this works for me: https://gist.github.com/mlafeldt/7fa57c2bd9df4641b830#file-roxor-rs-L114

[15:08:51] <Quxxy> And it can only be *one particular* T; MyStruct1 and MyStruct2 are different types

[23:36:00] <huoy> mbrubeck, i wonder if that's good or bad haha
[23:36:11] <navaati> is there an equivalent of expect() for Result ? Currently i use .ok().expect() but i feel there must be a better way

[23:36:43] <Dabo> navaati, there isn't really afaik
[23:36:59] <zrneely> mbrubeck, that worked! sort_by is the solution, at least for now. Is there a canonical way to implement a trait for a trait, using default methods or something?
[23:37:06] <doomrobo> huoy, I keep a pretty clean vimrc if you're interested. Some basic defaults and minimalistic plugins to work with. You might want to ignore the Ctrl+T (I use it for C++) and the solarized theme for now. https://www.dropbox.com/s/mbvvgpajedxd4j1/vimrc?dl=0
[23:37:13] <mbrubeck> navaati: There's .unwrap() if you don't need a custom error message beyond what's in the Result's Err type.
[23:37:18] <Dabo> if you want to handle it manually you can always do `if let Err(e) = result {panic!("{}", e) }

[23:37:50] <mbrubeck> zrneely: Normally it's fine to do what you did, but the object safety rules get in the way of some things that would be nice to do, and I still haven't internalized them.
[23:38:02] <navaati> I don't really know what the Err() constructor contains actually. Thanks
[23:38:09] <mbrubeck> http://huonw.github.io/blog/2015/05/where-self-meets-sized-revisiting-object-safety/ is a good explanation of object safety though (thanks huon!)

[23:38:51] <SpaceManiac> Layl: you were asking about disabling the console on Windows earlier; it looks like `rustc -C link-args="-mwindows"` does the job, except it crashes if you try to write to stdout/stderr
[23:39:02] <mitsuhiko> i miss ternary operators still soooo much in rust :(
[23:39:07] <Layl> SpaceManiac, what about with cargo
