[00:06:41] <jack> before I went ot whistler.
[00:07:24] <jack> apparently I only turned off rust-mozjs even though buildbot now builds them both.
[00:07:25] <jack> fixed.
[00:07:58] <jdm> iiinteresting
[00:08:15] <jdm> I turned off -fno-exceptions and now a bunch of rust destructors don't appear to run
[00:08:22] <jdm> that is not the outcome I expected
[00:08:36] <mwu> njn: fwiw though, my comment in mozjs was just saying that we can use the existing memory reporting API if the APIs you're interested in don't use too many templates

[00:42:16] <pcwalton> is it OK if I change script to be able to spawn its own layout tasks in the iframe case?
[00:42:24] <pcwalton> (the same-domain iframe case)
[00:42:52] <pcwalton> right now, the constellation wants to spawn them, but that won't work if the constellation is in a separate process from the script since you can't inject a task into another process

[00:49:01] <larsberg> That pipeline division makes sense. Maybe we'll need some new terminology once this all lands (constellation and pipeline were always a bit wonky to explain, anyway).

[00:59:48] <larsberg> I think after I hup'd it (to pick up the two changes) it hit that.
[01:00:04] <larsberg> Maybe homu has to read all the stuff in order to figure out what "state" it should be in?
[01:03:37] <jack> it is supposed to serialize state to disk and never poll
[01:03:43] <jack> that was one of the things it got int he last upgrade
[01:03:50] <jack> did you just restart it?

[11:50:08] <nox> Node::insert() looks weird.
[11:50:39] <Ms2ger> Because it's static?
[11:50:54] <nox> Ms2ger: Oh no no sorry, I mean its implementation.
[11:50:59] <Ms2ger> Ah
[11:51:30] <Ms2ger> What about it?
[11:52:03] <Ms2ger> It's that way because we don't want to allocate a Vec for the not-DocumentFragment case
[11:52:20] <nox> Yes,
[11:52:25] <nox> but "step 8", there is no step 8.
[11:52:42] <nox> And Vec<Root<T>> looks nasty.

[11:57:34] <Ms2ger> I'm still not convinced it was ever a good idea to change the semantics
[11:57:54] <nox> Ms2ger: The duplication to avoid allocating a vector you mean?
[11:58:00] <nox> Ah no, node_inserted?
[11:58:10] <nox> Well, it was definitely not about mutation observers.
[11:58:11] <Ms2ger> Yeah
[11:58:50] <nox> Ms2ger: I'm writing code that actually makes use of the new semantics, maybe that will convince you, I'll request a r? from you. :)

[12:01:31] <larsberg> Ms2ger: sorry for the random OS failures due to the mac updates. Not sure if I should turn off auto-update, though, as it scares me (those machines are IP-accessible)
[12:01:44] <larsberg> Maybe we need more cloud.
[12:01:56] <Ms2ger> larsberg, there was nothing random :)
[12:02:32] <Ms2ger> But I generalized the conditions, so hopefully we won't hit this again
[12:02:45] <larsberg> Well, only one of the three machines updated correctly - another tried and failed to boot into a terminal and the third just failed to update, so depending on which (random) machine you get...
[12:03:03] <Ms2ger> Ugh
[12:03:53] <larsberg> Should be better next time (and I fixed the setup instructions). Unless apple changes their terms of service and I don't personally accept it on another machine first, as that *also* blocks security updates...
[12:06:09] <Manishearth> <@larsberg> Maybe we need more cloud

[12:21:09] <nox> Ms2ger: Why do you feel like the change in semantics is bad, btw?
[12:21:48] <Ms2ger> nox, I don't remember if I had a clear reason
[12:22:26] <Ms2ger> nox, but matching mutation observers means the spec already makes sure that we don't forget/double-notify
[12:23:01] <nox> Ms2ger: But they are not about mutation observers, they are about insertion and removing steps, IMO.
[12:25:47] <larsberg> Ms2ger: Yup! I appear to have neither seen the travis failure nor did I pick up the trailing whitespace in reviewable - double fail on my part.

[15:18:13] <jgraham> Nonono, don't add features to mach
[15:18:36] <jgraham> The general theory is that ~nothing should be implented at the mach layer

[16:15:09] <mrobinson> jack: I think the issue was that skia did not have linkhack.rs.
[16:15:33] <jdm> not enough hacks!
[16:15:59] <mrobinson> :D
[16:16:53] <larsberg> mrobinson: beware linkhack.rs! :-)
[16:17:16] * larsberg has the rustup building again on OSX and is testing on linux
[16:17:20] <mrobinson> larsberg: I'm guessing this can replaced with judicious use of the pkgconfig module in build.rs.
[16:17:20] <Manishearth> I prefer fake-ld.sh
[16:18:32] <larsberg> mrobinson: pkgconfig doesn't work well with cross-compilation yet, though (IIRC it's only used in modules that we don't compile on ARM linux or android)
[16:19:08] <larsberg> Otherwise, yeah, removing a bunch of library search paths and all the custom `#[link]` attributes scattered through source files would be nice :-)
[16:20:07] <mrobinson> larsberg: Hrm...you cannot detect the cross-compilation situation in build.rs.
[16:20:11] <Manishearth> my last week was full of link hacks. on android. link hacks to fix other link hacks that were inextricable from the build system
[16:20:36] <jdm> TIL that the purple/white thing in reviewable is a bunny
[16:20:39] <mrobinson> It seems like you just want to do conditional logic on target architecture.
[16:20:43] <jdm> I still don't see it
[16:21:19] <mrobinson> Aww. Too bad it isn't a bunny and a duck.
[16:21:40] <larsberg> mrobinson: Yeah, so I think we could use pkgconfig for the self-targeting builds, but I think we still need #[link] (or something similar) for all our cross targets.
[16:22:00] <larsberg> Manishearth: I'm taking a break from android packaging and link hacks to work on link hacks for the rustup :-)

[17:11:53] <crowbot1> Issue #6616: script: Make most of 2D canvas and WebGL run over IPC. - https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/6616
[17:12:18] <pcwalton> BTW, that one is only halfway done, but I wanted to split it up and land the restructuring in a followup
[17:12:40] <pcwalton> to become truly IPC-safe the script task is going to have to stop spawning the canvas/WebGL tasks and needs to ask the constellation to do it
[17:12:42] <mrobinson> The travis broken heart makes me so sad.
[17:13:01] <Ms2ger> pcwalton, wait, aren't the canvas tasks going to be in the content process?
[17:13:16] <pcwalton> no, they have to run in the chrome process, because they will access the GPU on some backends
[17:13:39] <Ms2ger> That sounds... interesting
[17:13:52] <pcwalton> I don't want to give content access to the GPU; Chromium doesn't (on desktop) and Project Zero has published zero-days in Safari that exploit the fact that it does

[17:14:24] <mrobinson> pcwalton: Also why Safari doesn't enable WebGL by default, IIRC.
[17:14:41] <pcwalton> IIRC it was a JSC type confusion exploit that they pivoted into an NVIDIA driver bug
[17:15:15] <pcwalton> which would be exactly applicable to Servo if we don't separate canvas/WebGL tasks from content :(

[17:15:55] <Ms2ger> Let's just hope that won't come back to bite us, then
[17:15:56] <mrobinson> pcwalton: Another option is to just fully proxy all GL calls, I think.
[17:16:11] <pcwalton> mrobinson: that's what we basically do already with the WebGL task
[17:16:39] <pcwalton> http://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2014/11/pwn4fun-spring-2014-safari-part-ii.html
[17:16:43] <pcwalton> this is what I was thinking of
[17:17:14] *** Quits: goyox86 (textual@moz-qfs.570.70.83.IP) (Connection closed)
[17:17:56] <pcwalton> an alternative would be a 3-process design like Chromium, where you put the GFX in a separate process entirely
[17:18:01] <pcwalton> Chromium desktop anyway
[17:18:10] <pcwalton> and sandbox the GFX process to basically be "content + GPU access"
[17:18:46] <mrobinson> mbrubeck: larsberg: Is it possible to run the android "version" of cargo with mach somehow?  
[17:18:47] <pcwalton> that also has the nice property that if you crash the GPU driver you can restart it… sorta (it's not clear to me that this actually works well in practice because lots of GPU "crashes" are actually black screens)
[17:19:29] <mrobinson> pcwalton: The three process design makes surface sharing a lot simpler.
[17:19:36] <pcwalton> how come?
[17:19:49] <mrobinson> pcwalton: You can use an approach like the Chromium mailbox.

[17:20:10] <mrobinson> pcwalton: https://chromium.googlesource.com/experimental/chromium/src/+/lkcr/gpu/GLES2/extensions/CHROMIUM/CHROMIUM_texture_mailbox.txt
[17:20:21] <pcwalton> I don't see how that's dependent on an extra process
[17:20:33] <pcwalton> seems to me that the salient point there is that there's only one thread that ever accesses the GPU
[17:20:49] <pcwalton> that doesn't necessarily mandate an extra process; you could do that in one process if you wanted
[17:21:02] <mrobinson> pcwalton: If I understand correctly different processes can refer to textures that exist in the GPU process.
[17:21:13] <pcwalton> sure, but you could do that in our single process design too
[17:21:28] <pcwalton> in a single process design, rather
[17:21:33] <pcwalton> just as long as you don't multithread
[17:21:55] <mrobinson> pcwalton: Oh sure, it just makes things simpler once you have already committed to having multiple processes.
[17:22:01] <pcwalton> what I'm trying to say is that moving to a separate GPU process isn't going to solve this problem
[17:22:15] <pcwalton> if we moved to a separate GPU process, we'd still have multiple paint/canvas/WebGL threads in that process
[17:22:26] <pcwalton> and we'd still have the same complexity around surface sharing
[17:22:54] <mrobinson> pcwalton: Yes, if you don't want to serialize all OpenGL commands.
[17:23:01] <pcwalton> right
[17:23:13] *** ahal|afk is now known as ahal
[17:23:16] <mrobinson> I guess I was assuming a GPU process would serialize GPU access.
[17:23:17] <pcwalton> if we wanted to serialize all OpenGL commands, though, we could just do that by proxying to a "GPU thread" in Servo as it is
[17:23:22] <pcwalton> ah
[17:23:30] <pcwalton> there's no reason why that has to be the case :)
[17:23:35] <mrobinson> pcwalton: That's true.
[17:23:42] <pcwalton> in Chromium's design (and in Gecko) all IPC *is* proxied to one thread, I believe
[17:23:51] <pcwalton> however, Servo is more of a CSP system
[17:24:02] <pcwalton> I think Servo's approach is generally better because it saves context switches
[17:24:28] <mrobinson> pcwalton: OS or OpenGL?
[17:24:32] <pcwalton> OS context switches
[17:24:47] <pcwalton> in Chromium a message in the worst case goes like: chrome worker thread -> kernel -> chrome IPC thread -> kernel -> content IPC thread -> kernel -> content worker thread
[17:24:56] <pcwalton> 6 content switches

[17:25:00] <mrobinson> pcwalton: OpenGL can be pretty brutal on embedded too. Sometimes 1 millisecond.
[17:25:06] <pcwalton> in Servo it'd be like chrome worker thread -> kernel -> content worker thread
[17:25:11] <pcwalton> 2 context switches
[17:25:29] <pcwalton> but, when working with the GPU serializing all commands really helps...
[17:25:30] <pcwalton> it's a tradeoff

[18:49:36] <larsberg> SimonSapin: I was thinking we could possibly more easily just add support in one of homu or buildbot for auto-pushing a cargo version bump and update whenever we land something in github. Or require the cargo version bump manually and only push if that happens, if we want to be all semver-y.

[18:50:27] <larsberg> SimonSapin: It certainly feels like an extra step to go to crates.io or do a `cargo publish` if you've already committed a change to the version in cargo.toml.
[18:50:32] <SimonSapin> larsberg: the hard part to automate is deciding if a given change is breaking (i.e. which version component to bump)

[18:51:25] <SimonSapin> but yeah, we should at least automate publish when the version is changed
[18:51:49] <larsberg> I think that would make our lives much easier, particularly during a rustup
[18:51:50] <SimonSapin> maybe only land if it is changed?

[18:53:38] <larsberg> Yeah, that seems great. We can just add the bors-servo GH account to all of our crates.io repos and things should (maybe?) just work. Though it might have to be a post-action rather than integrated with homu & buildbot stuff we have today.
[18:53:43] <mwu> larsberg: it does seem like more automation for publishing would help. had to file an issue last week when the num-macros crate wasn't published https://github.com/rust-lang/num/issues/105
[18:53:44] <crowbot1> Issue #105: num-macros 0.1.25 not on crates.io - https://github.com/rust-lang/num/issues/105
[18:54:12] <larsberg> e.g., a buildbot action that watches 'master' for new landings, sees if the Cargo.toml has change, and if so publishes it
[18:54:47] <SimonSapin> larsberg: so would homu or travis do the publish?
[18:55:02] <SimonSapin> (and holds an auth token)
[18:55:22] <SimonSapin> or buildbot
[18:55:47] <larsberg> SimonSapin: Off the top of my head, I'm assuming via buildbot would be the easiest way, since it's an extra task that would run after homu lands it.
[18:56:03] <SimonSapin> larsberg: or this could be a feature of https://github.com/huonw/travis-cargo
[18:56:28] <larsberg> SimonSapin: Though this might end up being something crates.io should be doing for repo owners. It knows the GH master source, can hook up to GH change events, and presumably could automate it just like we're planning to...
[18:59:21] <pcwalton> ok, I'm blocked on erickt reviewing some serde changes for a couple of these
[19:00:09] <larsberg> pcwalton: as soon as we land https://github.com/servo/rust-azure/pull/181, I will push the changes to the rustup branch and hopefully we can get it landed (assuming no test failures & I didn't stealth-break gonk or android with these linker changes...)

[19:10:50] <larsberg> Are these crashes generally places where there are holes in the test suite, or does nightly get released before a full run? Not judging; mainly just curious to see if there's anything we can learn & incorporate into the autolander, since it would be pretty fantastic if we can stick with just "servo nightly" for quite a while without making servo alpha
[19:10:51] <larsberg> adopters hate us.
[19:11:03] <pcwalton> is target_os="linux" not enabled for android?

[20:04:45] <jack> Firefox crash culprit found. I was accidentally running a self built one from May and didn't notice.
[20:05:02] <jack> (my self built on is called ~/bin/firefox and the real nightly is ~/bin/firefox.nightly)
[20:05:03] <FreeFull> Fun
[20:05:06] <SimonSapin> mbrubeck: Ok. Since some details are a matter of preference, could you make a new PR and I’ll review it?
[20:05:17] <jack> On a positive note, it's also *way* faster now :)

[20:08:13] <jgraham> heh
[20:08:47] <larsberg> Travis is not doing a good job of selling its usefulness on this PR. Maybe move our cargo builds onto the buildbot so that it has the same toolchain as we use for Servo? Hrm.
[20:08:51] <mbrubeck> SimonSapin: Okay!
[20:10:08] * larsberg wonders how this ever worked... maybe there's something else broken there
[20:16:32] <larsberg> Hrm, thanks to mrobinson we now know the problem with the rust-azure PR breaking building skia. Our submodules like rust-azure don't have Cargo.lock files, which means you can't really CI-test them because the versions of deps can change out from under them. Hrm.
[20:16:51] <mrobinson> larsberg: Oh yeah, the lock files are not checked in.
[20:17:49] <larsberg> mrobinson: yeah, we only have lock files for Servo/CEF/gonk. Everything else assumes whatever is building it has pinned the versions of their deps to something compatible.
[20:17:54] <mbrubeck> larsberg, mrobinson: We can always set stricter versions in the Cargo.toml files, and/or use semver more strictly in the upstream packages
[20:18:44] <mbrubeck> larsberg, mrobinson: But for tightly-coupled packages with dependencies that change a lot or that are git dependencies, we might want to go against convention and check in a Cargo.lock
[20:18:54] *** AutomatedTester|AFK is now known as AutomatedTester
[20:18:57] <mbrubeck> just for use in running automated tests
[20:19:23] <larsberg> mbrubeck: It makes the grumpy old build engineer in me really fidgety that we don't have tight control over what we're building against. Semver only saves us from what the package author thought were breaking changes.
[20:20:37] <mbrubeck> larsberg: Yeah, Cargo builds are only reproducible when building a package with a Cargo.lock provided.  So I think it makes sense to check in Cargo.lock for things where we want reproducible builds...
[20:20:54] <mbrubeck> Looks like rust-azure has all git dependencies, so semver won't save us anyway.

[20:59:26] * pcwalton wants to make scrolling smoother in servo
[20:59:47] <pcwalton> I'm embarrassed that a UX person came up to me in whistler to talk to me about scrolling performance problems
[20:59:48] <pcwalton> :)
[21:00:00] <pcwalton> it's just some dumb event handling issue, I know it
[21:00:06] <pcwalton> our compositor is running at a million FPS
[21:01:01] <tikue> :\
[21:01:16] <jack> Servo would probably already beat firefox if it could render the page.
[21:01:29] <pcwalton> feel free to file issues on stuff that's missing
[21:01:31] <tikue> once it's fixed add a regression test :P
[21:01:36] <jack> Since part of hte issue with IRC cloud is the chrome process js waiting on the content js
[21:01:52] <pcwalton> we still have jumpiness on HN
[21:01:54] <pcwalton> I want to fix that too
[21:02:00] <pcwalton> and the text-align:justify jumpiness issue

[21:06:13] <gw> pcwalton: merged those 2 PRs
[21:06:15] <_Y_> @SimonSapin, I've been trying to execute gcc on html5ever.h, but it complains that headers for string cache and tendril
[21:06:18] <pcwalton> gw: great, thanks
[21:06:21] <_Y_> are missing
[21:06:42] <SimonSapin> _Y_: Tendril is at https://github.com/servo/tendril (and does have a test for its C API)
[21:07:24] <SimonSapin> _Y_: anyway, html5ever’s C API only exposes the tokenizer yet, which I think is not that interesting
[21:08:02] <_Y_> @SimonSapin: Well, for now, I'm trying to just test it using gcc
[21:09:06] <_Y_> @SimonSapin: However, the linker complains that "tendril.h" is missing. I've forgotten most of C. Does that mean that I need to copy/paste tendril.h into html5ever/capi/include?

[23:37:18] <jack> So I'm not sure what you mean
[23:38:00] <jack> travis runs on the auto branch, which master is fast forwarded to. so no reason to rerun travis on a commit that it just cleared.
[23:38:03] <SimonSapin> jack: https://travis-ci.org/servo/rust-layers/requests says "branch not included or excluded"
[23:38:21] <jack> Is there a typo?
[23:38:32] <SimonSapin> I mean builds that normally run when a PR is submitted, before r+
[23:38:50] <SimonSapin> they are "excluded" here
[23:38:50] <jack> They still run afaik.
[23:39:10] <SimonSapin> well this one didn’t, at least
[23:39:44] <SimonSapin> I wonder if Travis excludes it because it’s a PR into master, which is excluded
[23:39:54] *** Joins: elemongw (textual@moz-9ppu2f.dynamic.cyta.gr)
[23:40:05] <SimonSapin> which doesn’t sound like a useful behavior, but I don’t see how else to explain this
[23:40:14] <jack> it says build not included or excluded, but is green, so travis must have built it.
[23:40:27] <jack> why do you think it wasn't built?
[23:40:57] <SimonSapin> https://travis-ci.org/servo/rust-layers/requests has an entry for #191 that says "branch not included or excluded", and has no build number
[23:40:57] <crowbot1> Issue #191: See if we can cache text measurements - https://github.com/servo/servo/issues/191
[23:41:16] <jack> build history doesn't show them. you're right.
[23:41:28] <jack> is this true in other repos? i have branches: excludes: master in most repos
[23:41:43] <SimonSapin> I’ve seen this once before, I don’t remember in what repo

[23:45:09] <mrobinson> SimonSapin: I think that would be ideal, in case it needs to be reverted for whatever reason.
[23:45:13] <njn> jdm: and when I tried removing my .cargo/config file in order to *stop* using my local mozjs/rust-mozjs, Servo stopped building

[23:58:26] <pcwalton> njn: your turn
[23:58:33] <pcwalton> you have trait objects in a cross-process signature blocking IPC
[23:58:45] <pcwalton> I'm going to try to convert them into IpcSenders; is that OK?
[23:58:50] <pcwalton> in particular, mem::Reporter
[23:59:05] <njn> pcwalton: I mentioned that in the email thread, you promised me it wouldn't be a problem! :P
[23:59:19] <pcwalton> oh yeah, I guess I did
[23:59:30] <njn> do we have one memory profiler per process, or one shared?
[23:59:34] <njn> s/have/want/
[23:59:36] <pcwalton> so, we can either restructure for IpcSender, or..yeah
[23:59:40] <pcwalton> we have to make the decision now
[23:59:53] <pcwalton> I'm inclined to try to keep the design we have now with global memory profilers, if it's not too much work to get rid of the trait object.
