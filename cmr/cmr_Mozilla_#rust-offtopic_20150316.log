[00:12:46] <Tobba> so T10 actually has standardized object storage devices operating over SCSI
[00:12:51] <Tobba> why does nothing implement this, I've wanted it for ages
[00:13:38] <Mutabah> You mean the SCSI block device protocol?
[00:13:40] <fmtq> burn SCSI to the ground
[00:15:16] <Tobba> I think so
[00:15:35] *** Quits: gsingh93 (uid22642@moz-aq0iah.charlton.irccloud.com) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[00:15:47] <Tobba> I can't be arsed to get a hold of the spec atm because T10 are a pain in the arse
[00:17:00] <Tobba> but object storage is strictly difference from block storage
[00:17:21] <Tobba> different*
[00:22:32] <Tobba> it *should* be an entirely separate SCSI protocol, actually
[00:22:54] <Tobba> fmtq: SCSI command set is pretty okay, at least most standard organizations have a boner for it
[00:23:22] <tiffany> what
[00:23:27] <tiffany> there's object storage in SCSI?
[00:23:44] <Tobba> tiffany: http://www.t10.org/drafts.htm#OSD_Family
[00:23:49] <Tobba> I doubt anything implements it though
[00:24:11] <tiffany> did they see the old object persistence systems from the 60s and decide to standardise it?
[00:24:36] <Tobba> dunno, but it has some good applications
[00:24:51] *** Joins: dougxxx (dougxxx@moz-0js00c.iinet.net.au)
[00:24:54] <Tobba> it maps nicely to SSDs, better than block storage
[00:25:06] <tiffany> it does?
[00:25:12] <tiffany> I thought SSDs were wired for block storage
[00:25:17] <tiffany> have to write entire blocks at a time
[00:25:33] *** Joins: new_one (new_one@moz-ksl.bmc.42.128.IP)
[00:25:34] <Tobba> well, they're block based, but the blocks software sees is nothing like whats going on behind the scenes
[00:25:49] <tiffany> well
[00:25:54] <tiffany> I don't trust the vendors to get it right
[00:25:55] <tiffany> not one bit
[00:26:02] <Tobba> it does some serious shit in the background to make all that flash look like a consistent volume
[00:26:09] <tiffany> I'd rather have the vendors expose low level stuff and have the high level be implemented in the OS
[00:26:14] <Tobba> moves things around constantly to prevent blocks from taking damage, etc
[00:26:36] <Tobba> tiffany: the things you have to do to keep these things in good health may be batch specific, it's not a good idea
[00:26:47] <tiffany> isn't where it is now a good place?
[00:27:30] <Tobba> eh
[00:28:00] <Tobba> you have a pretty massive controller and a lot of metadata per block, trying to spread out the wear evenly across the whole drive, finding cells as they fail, correcting errors
[00:28:27] <Tobba> and pretending it's a nice solid volume of data even though behind the scenes all kinds of madness is happening
[00:28:44] <Tobba> I'd rather not move that to software, each kind of flash chip needs different things
[00:29:12] <tiffany> well okay
[00:29:14] <Tobba> I'd say it's better to move more things into the controllers to give manufacturers more flexibility
[00:29:54] <tiffany> whenever you give manufacturers flexibility, you create more opportunity for them to fuck it up and end up having to add workarounds to linux
[00:30:01] <Tobba> well yeah, true
[00:30:14] <Tobba> but there isn't really any flexibility in that sense here
[00:30:21] <Tobba> it's more about implementation detail flexibility
[00:30:27] <tiffany> what good does object-based storage do?
[00:30:38] <Tobba> if you instead moved the tasks of the controller to the CPU a lot of implementation details would be set in stone
[00:32:31] <Tobba> it offers more flexibility to the controller, but it can also know what pieces of data belong together
[00:32:40] <Tobba> the task of allocating sectors is moved onto the controller
[00:32:50] <Tobba> which all SSDs are already doing, theres no need for the filesystems to be doing it
[00:33:36] <Tobba> every time you write to a sector that was TRIM'd the controller has to find an empty block to use
[00:33:58] <Tobba> it's completely and utterly pointless for the filesystem to have to allocate what is essentially an address for it
[00:34:35] <tiffany> do objects have to be aligned to the block size?
[00:34:45] <tiffany> or does the controller have the opportunity to fuck up and  cause fragmentation
[00:35:03] <Tobba> "aligned"?
[00:35:16] <tiffany> er, size modulo block size
[00:35:26] <Tobba> doubt it, but the controller should do that anyways
[00:36:57] <Tobba> there isn't really more opportunity for error than in current SSD controllers
[00:37:11] <tiffany> I was thinking of this the wrong way
[00:37:26] <tiffany> I guess it's fine
[00:37:30] <tiffany> I was thinking like, sub-block-size objects
[00:37:41] <tiffany> so that you essentially treat the storage device as malloc for disk space
[00:37:45] <tiffany> that would be horrible
[00:38:33] <Tobba> heh
[00:41:28] <Tobba> also it means you could be more flexible with how much stuff you allow to be stored on the drive
[00:41:54] <Tobba> a 120GB SSD today probably as 480GB of storage behind it
[00:42:09] <Tobba> or 240GB, more than advertised anyways
[00:42:23] <tiffany> I thought that was only for the high reliability ones
[00:42:44] <Tobba> I have no idea, but it's definitely more than it shows normally
[00:42:50] <Tobba> otherwise they'd wear out really fast
[00:43:02] <tiffany> aren't they usually good for 100K writes per block?
[00:43:39] <Tobba> hm
[00:45:09] <Tobba> but in either case, it lets you handle the drive "shrinking" more nicely
[00:46:15] <tiffany> more nicely how?
[00:46:28] <tiffany> priority for whether to overwrite things when you run out?
[00:47:08] <Tobba> that and you can just refuse to allocate more objects
[00:47:17] <Tobba> to "shrink" an SSD currently all kinds of shenanigans happen
[00:48:26] <Tobba> oh and; it has some pretty good advantages when it comes to partitioning
[00:48:41] <tiffany> when the drive is at that point it's probably already been furiously warning to replace it via SMART for weeks and the system probably can't boot if it can't write files
[00:49:30] <tiffany> when my old rotating disk hit 800K load cycles it was warning me to replace the drive within 24 hours
[00:49:41] <tiffany> it's too bad you have to go out of your way to check SMART
[00:50:07] <XMPPwocky> i've seen some BIOSes warni
[00:50:15] <Tobba> it's still a nicer approach than block-level
[00:50:17] <XMPPwocky> http://superuser.com/questions/311225/how-to-disable-s-m-a-r-t-warnings-at-computer-startup
[00:50:19] <Tobba> which is kind of a hack
[00:50:36] <Tobba> I wonder of modern HDDs do wear levelling
[00:52:19] <tiffany> that is a rather horrifying question, xmppwocky
[00:52:33] <Tobba> "how to disable RAID alarm"
[00:55:36] <Tobba> hm
[00:55:43] <Tobba> object storage might work well on HDDs as well
[00:55:49] <Tobba> they already do block remapping anyways

[01:14:25] <Astrum|Lap> ugh, I thought C++ had bad error messages
[01:14:54] <Astrum|Lap> some of these JS error messages may as well say, 'error, good luck'
[01:21:23] <tiffany> C++ has very useful error messages
[01:21:26] <tiffany> they're just very long
[01:21:55] <tiffany> and often dive into implementation details of STL templates
[01:22:34] <tiffany> you should try lpeg sometime astrum
[01:22:52] <tiffany> they wrote an entire parser combinator library, and it's been suggested for integration into lua's standard library, even
[01:22:58] <tiffany> it doesn't have any error checking, whatsoever
[01:23:05] <tiffany> if you failed to parse an entire document
[01:23:07] <tiffany> it just returns nil
[01:23:19] <tiffany> it doesn't tell you how far it got, or what pattern failed
[01:23:20] <tiffany> nothing
[01:23:21] <tiffany> just nil
[01:24:32] <Astrum|Lap> well... when I think of C++ error messages I still think of the stuff that got spit out by gcc in ~2005
[01:24:56] <tiffany> oh my
[01:25:14] <tiffany> I think of the stuff clang prints
[01:25:50] <Astrum|Lap> yeah, clang is way better
[01:25:53] <Astrum|Lap> it used to be much more painful
[01:26:21] <Astrum|Lap> but, I am about to rage and break something
[01:26:30] <Astrum|Lap> because this error message couldn't be less helpful
[01:26:44] <tiffany> I always feel that way with dynamic languages
[01:27:10] <Astrum|Lap> it's an RPC, I get the result and print it, then it crashes saying there's an exception delivering the result
[01:27:12] <tiffany> it's all fun and games until you make a typo which propagates a nil/undefined through 300 lines of code, and you have to spend 3 hours backtracking to find it
[01:27:15] <Astrum|Lap> and I am absolutely 100% baffled
[01:28:01] <Astrum|Lap> and of course, documentation doesn't exist
[01:30:28] <tiffany> that sounds like a situation where, if it was lua, I'd pull out good old debug.hook(function() print(debug.getinfo(2).name) end, 'c')
[01:30:37] <tiffany> sethook*
[01:30:47] <tiffany> it prints every single function call
[01:32:47] <Astrum|Lap> I don't have time to look through thousands of lines of not my code

[12:48:18] * ChrisMorgan wishes Chrome did a better job of rendering things
[12:50:17] <ChrisMorgan> I design and implement against Firefox, and when I test on IE it’s normally fine (though definitely not always) but I ALWAYS seem to need to compromise things (typically badly) for Chrome. Now it’s flexbox, where Chrome’s growing/shrinking policy is just silly, rather than being sensible like Firefox’s, and so I have to rejig that whole aspect of it—it can be done, but it’s
[12:50:19] <ChrisMorgan> more complicated.
[12:50:57] <ChrisMorgan> And as for Chrome’s text rendering… *ugh*
[12:55:14] <ChrisMorgan> WebKit/Blink still, after all these years, feels like a toy in its rendering, and that distresses me.
[12:55:37] <ChrisMorgan> Ah well, time to finally get round to building Servo so that I can see how a Real Browser makes a mess of it 😛
[12:55:39] *** Joins: psd_ (psd@moz-j32.pp1.202.116.IP)
[12:56:29] <fmtq> ChrisMorgan: you're a toy! : 
[12:56:30] <fmtq> :o* 
[12:57:06] <fmtq> but yes, I said Chrome was the new IE for two years at least now
[12:57:22] * ChrisMorgan has been complaining about it for several years too
[12:57:42] <fmtq> WebKit has different bugs depending on platform.
[12:57:54] <fmtq> so you could have a bug that only appeared on Windows, but also iOS Safari
[12:57:56] <FreeFull> And there are those websites that only work with webkit/blink
[12:58:00] <fmtq> but not OS X Chrome and not OS X Safari.
[12:58:08] <fmtq> this was before Blink.
[12:58:26] <fmtq> Chrome does not deal with changing something from display: block to display: table-cell and back very well.
[12:58:31] <fmtq> redrawing fails in many many cases
[12:58:46] <fmtq> you end up using requestAnimationFrame hacks to force it to be display:inline temporarily to force a redraw
[12:58:48] <FreeFull> And Chrome doesn't have the best RAM usage

[12:59:20] <fmtq> I'm not a big fan of the web
[12:59:23] <fmtq> we should burn it down
[13:00:38] <ChrisMorgan> I actually discovered a rather interesting race condition in Firefox this afternoon. I have a simple flexbox layout (sidebar + main content area) where the main content area is one element showing at a time, the :target (section { display: none } section:target { display: block }). Just a couple of times, going from one section to another has left the old section visible…

[13:02:09] <ChrisMorgan> Well, actually, because no reasons.
[13:02:33] <ChrisMorgan> (Or do you mean add a thread in Firefox to &c.?)
[13:02:41] <fmtq> I once wrote support for like 10% of CSS3 in JS for IE7.
[13:02:46] <fmtq> company was surprised when it was slow.
[13:03:01] <fmtq> I meant to a proper thread in Firefox
[13:03:07] <fmtq> I was proposing doing something awful.
[13:03:09] <ChrisMorgan> Ah, polyfills. They run fast where you don’t need ’em and kill the browsers that do need ’em.
[13:03:20] <fmtq> wasn't a polyfill
[13:03:26] <fmtq> you can't really polyfill css
[13:03:32] <ChrisMorgan> Meh, polyfills/similar things
[13:03:38] <fmtq> it was an amazing magical hack that manually laid out the entire webpage

[13:04:08] <ChrisMorgan> Why not just implement the whole thing on <canvas>? (It’s definitely been done.)
[13:04:18] <fmtq> it hadn't been done when I did this.
[13:04:21] <ChrisMorgan> No! I have it! Render to PDF, then show the PDF through PDF.js!
[13:04:22] <fmtq> as I said, IE7.
[13:04:28] <fmtq> yeah that joke appeared too
[13:04:31] <fmtq> it was a PDF company.
[13:04:36] <fmtq> pdf.js was at its first alpha

[13:06:28] <barosl> User Friendly had been one of my favorite cartoons, too...
[13:07:00] <fmtq> Chromebokos annoy me because they have enormous ctrl and alt keys 
[13:07:09] <fmtq> and also kill the super key -.-
[13:08:25] * ChrisMorgan has a Eee Pad Transformer that he rooted just so he could mount the system partition as rw and modify the keyboard bindings to make Caps Lock Backspace
[13:09:37] <fmtq> is that one of those android devices
[13:10:05] <ChrisMorgan> Yep.
[13:10:08] <fmtq> I would prefer caps lock were just removed. No key needs to be there at all.
[13:10:20] <ChrisMorgan> Leaving a blank space there?
[13:10:24] <fmtq> yes
[13:10:28] <fmtq> with a smiley face
[13:11:15] <fmtq> replace it with F13
[13:11:23] <ChrisMorgan> I would prefer to have a key or *maybe* even two (I’d need to try it) there (why is Shift so wide, anyway?). But I definitely wish Caps Lock was gone.
[13:11:26] <fmtq> function keys are especially relevant in 2015.
[13:11:43] <fmtq> Shift is wide because of your ethnocentric use of US standard keyboards.
[13:11:53] <fmtq> ISO standard keyboards have a short shift key with a fat enter
[13:12:39] <fmtq> http://deskthority.net/wiki/ANSI_vs_ISO
[13:12:53] <ChrisMorgan> I believe that usages of Caps Lock fall into three categories, all of which are undesirable: (a) accidental; (b) in stead of Shift for capitalising single letters; (c) for writing long stretches of text upper case, which you shouldn’t ever do.
[13:13:17] <fmtq> I FIND IT MORE FUN TO HOLD THE SHIFT KEY WHILE TYPING 
[13:13:24] <fmtq> honestly, you feel like you're yelling 
[13:13:26] <fmtq> it's nice

[13:14:27] <FreeFull> Not related to text capitalisation

[13:21:59] <eddyb> I had pulled the key out on some older keyboards
[13:22:08] <ChrisMorgan> Another Webkit/Blink complaint: selecting stuff is pretty much broken and always has been. Firefox’s, on the other hand, is excellent, even with bonuses like Ctrl+Click+drag to select blocks of cells in tables.
[13:22:25] <ChrisMorgan> Press Ctrl+A (select all) in Firefox: sensible. In Chrome: ARGH!

[19:39:31] <fmtq> that is not true.
[19:39:47] <fmtq> the only service started by default is CUPS
[19:39:50] <Tobba> well, these are
[19:40:00] <fmtq> someone manually enabled them
[19:40:03] <fmtq> because derps gonna derp 
[19:40:05] <Tobba> also I just found a shitload of routers/modems with the same SSH keys
[19:40:11] <Tobba> this doesn't seem sane
[19:40:12] <fmtq> well yeah
[19:40:13] <GaryOak_> They probably got turned on by apple support and didn't get turned back off
[19:40:14] <fmtq> some are hardcoded.
[19:40:20] <fmtq> mine is hardcoded root/root telnet
[19:40:24] <fmtq> telnet can't be turned off.
[19:40:27] <fmtq> password can't be changed.
[19:42:05] <Tobba> hm, looks like there isn't actually a default password for this thing
[19:42:13] <Tobba> but a router with SSH open by default means theres a backdoor account
[19:42:15] <Tobba> no exceptions.
[19:42:27] <Tobba> there's always a fucking backdoor root account if they're set up like this
[19:43:54] <Astrum|Lap> I've just got to say, it's 78F outside and I'm stuck inside programming
[19:43:58] <GaryOak_> Tobba: that's why we need open source firmware
[19:44:02] <Astrum|Lap> I might have to leave work early
[19:44:24] <Astrum|Lap> weather is so nice
[19:45:04] <Tobba> GaryOak_: I've come to realize that open source firmware is absolutely necessary; not because of freedoms but because of vendors
[19:45:07] <Tobba> fuck 'em
[19:46:10] <GaryOak_> Tobba: yeah, and so they can't cave to NSA being like "put a back door in RSA key generation for us"
[19:46:40] <Tobba> and that
[19:47:03] <GaryOak_> Like the average programmer, let alone person couldn't be able to test whether their RNG on their machine is working correctly
[19:48:04] <Tobba> well now that its integrated in hardware its pretty much impossible
[19:48:25] <tiffany> it would be nice if FPGAs were competitive with ASICs
[19:49:48] <Astrum|Lap> oh yeah... I still want to make an NES clone on an FPGA
[19:49:56] <Astrum|Lap> too many "I want to..." projects in my head -_-
[19:50:10] <GaryOak_> I want to learn Rust :P
[19:50:53] <tiffany> I used to have a lot of those but there's not enough of me to do everything
[19:50:59] <WindowsBunny> Astrum|Lap: I want to create a machine that gives me infinite time to pursue all the things I want to do
[19:51:30] <Tobba> clone yourself
[19:51:33] <GaryOak_> tiffany: are fpga's more expensive to produce?
[19:52:17] <tiffany> garyoak: they require a lot of transistors for each logic element so that they can be reprogrammed, and that leads to further issues like limited clock due to latency
[19:52:39] <Astrum|Lap> also you can only reprogram it so many times
[19:52:40] <tiffany> the way high-end FPGAs are moving these days seems to be integrating ASICs for common cases into the 'fabric', like an ARM CPU
[19:52:54] <Astrum|Lap> I was just about to say that ^
[19:53:09] <Astrum|Lap> yeah, in uni we had to compile a PPC core into our FPGA fabric
[19:53:16] <Astrum|Lap> and it took up like... 80% 
[19:53:32] <Astrum|Lap> of the available space
[19:53:33] <tiffany> I hope something comes along eventually that makes the size of each logic element dramatically smaller
[19:53:36] <GaryOak_> So for the actual logic they want to reprogram they put that on the FPGA, but most of the code can be burned onto an ASIC?
[19:53:38] <tiffany> I wonder if memristors will do that
[19:54:00] <GaryOak_> Am I understanding that correctly?
[19:54:11] <tiffany> garyoak: more like things that you really need to do in hw go on the fpga and everything else is done in software
[19:54:21] <GaryOak_> ohhh ok
[19:55:57] <Astrum|Lap> FPGAs are awesome and I highly recommend playing with one at some point
[19:56:08] <Astrum|Lap> you can get a cheap one pretty... cheaply
[19:56:11] <Astrum|Lap> especially if you're a student

[19:58:37] <tiffany> another alternative
[19:59:00] <tiffany> the trend in recent hardware, especially CPUs, has been to integrate lots of special-purpose hardware that is mostly not used
[19:59:09] <tiffany> since if you were using all of it at once, you'd generate way too much heat to get rid of
[19:59:42] <tiffany> well
[19:59:45] <tiffany> that's not really an alternative

[22:44:04] <lahwran> hehe yes
[22:44:09] <lahwran> and #reddit-poly
[22:45:28] <cmr> pft, feminism is for people who value equality

[22:47:53] <cmr> heh
[22:47:57] <WindowsBunny> cmr: Judging by the statements made by numerous modern feminists, I'm thinking they want to be more than equal

[23:09:39] <huon> cmr: (also, the repo link goes to https://github.com/cmr/openblas-blas-provider ?)
[23:09:41] <cmr> huon: thanks, nice catch
[23:09:49] <cmr> dammit copy-paste has foiled me yet again!
[23:10:19] <cmr> the crate name is even wrong /o\
[23:10:55] <cmr> huon: extra thanks, publishing a new version
[23:11:12] <huon> cmr: :)
[23:11:31] <cmr> huon: how's the fftw wrapper coming along?
[23:12:15] <huon> cmr: slowly
[23:12:42] <huon> I think I'm putting too much effort into exposing all the functionality perfectly safely
[23:12:50] <huon> rather than just a large subset
[23:12:53] * huon shrugs
[23:14:06] <cmr> heh
[23:14:11] <cmr> yeah...
[23:15:08] <huon> I suspect the library isn't quite hardened enough to truly catch everything
