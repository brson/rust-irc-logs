[02:21:06] <Gankro> acrichto: I'm actually writing the section on unwinding right now; are there any interesting problems/examples you'd like to highlight? As far as I can tell the only interesting problems are: exception safety (from the perspective of unsafe and safe), poisoning (not needed for `unsafe`-style safety, just a warning), FFI boundaries (catch it), and catching
[02:21:06] <Gankro> (which is basically "spawn a thread" today).
[02:22:08] <acrichto> Gankro: poisoning is kind a subset of exception safety (it's a strategy to help mitigate it), but otherwise I think that covers what I can think of at least
[02:23:07] <Gankro> acrichto: Any interesting exception-safety examples you know of? Right now it's basically "something that's using Ord to shuffle data around" (heap or sorting).
[02:23:28] <acrichto> lots of the vec stuff is a good example
[02:23:44] <acrichto> e.g. push_all() can't update the length and then do the pushes
[02:24:13] <Gankro> Can't it?
[02:24:34] <acrichto> oh it's the one that calls .clone()
[02:24:36] <acrichto> which can panic
[02:24:42] <acrichto> and e.g. leave an empty uninitialized hole
[02:25:03] <Gankro> Oh yeah, push_all isn't Copy only

[04:36:54] <Gankro> acrichto: what's catch_panic need to stabilize? 
[05:04:33] <acrichto> Gankro: it's not possible to write "correct" FFI code without it
[05:05:09] <Gankro> acrichto: uh, mostly agreed?
[05:05:25] <Gankro> I meant what's needed to stabilize catch_panic
[05:05:28] <sfackler> acrichto: I think the question is "what work needs to be done so we can stabilize catch_panic", not why would we want to
[05:05:29] <Gankro> as in what's wrong with it
[05:05:38] <acrichto> Gankro: oh, right
[05:05:45] <acrichto> wycats was going to write up a summary from the work week
[05:05:54] <acrichto> and we were gonna write an RFC to that effect
[05:06:02] <acrichto> and then move forward afterwards
[05:06:12] <Gankro> 1.2 possible?
[05:06:19] <sfackler> was there any discussion on Duration stabilization over the work week?
[05:06:39] <acrichto> Gankro: probably not
[05:06:42] <Gankro> sfackler: Yes! wycats is claiming he will actually implement libtime proper
[05:06:48] <acrichto> what Gankro said
[05:06:53] *** Joins: Tobba (Tobba@moz-o13d22.bredband.telia.com)
[05:07:01] <sfackler> aw snap
[05:07:21] <sfackler> but, like, can we stabilize duration before wycats writes all of libtime? :P
[05:07:27] <Gankro> sfackler: No calendar support, though. I'm sure you're worried about all your gregorian dates in Rust :P
[05:07:51] <sfackler> oh no, Calendar is my favorite class in Java! /s
[05:08:04] <Gankro> acrichto: :( The unwinding section basically starts with "eat shit spawn a thread"
[05:09:17] <acrichto> Gankro: yeah :(
[05:10:10] <Gankro> Although, well... honestly most of this book has to use unstable APIs anway
[05:10:19] <Gankro> "eat shit run nightly"
[05:16:23] <Gankro> Actually, I might just rename TURPL to that
[05:16:47] <Gankro> Eat Shit, Run Nightly; A Guide On Unsafe Rust
[05:41:36] <eternaleye> "Techniques in Unsafe Rust Development"
[05:49:56] <Gankro> hehe
[05:58:30] <eternaleye> Actually, even better

[15:14:03] <aturon> sfackler: we didn't specifically discuss Duration beyond: "We should stabilize that already!"
[15:18:54] <aturon> bluss: just saw your ping on that PR. note that the highfive assignments are just a guess, and protocol is generally that if someone else jumps in to review, they can give the r+; i am happy to let the experts review in this case
[15:19:29] <bluss> ok great to hear from you. I'm just hunting for someone to review it
[15:20:25] <aturon> bluss: it seems like gereeter took a pretty thorough look; do you feel like you need more eyes on it?
[15:21:06] <aturon> (i can potentially review as well, though i probably can't get to it till a while later today)
[15:23:02] <bluss> aturon: I am completely happy with it now after all revisions. Haven't heard from kimundi again though, but his wishes should have been adressed
[15:24:25] <kimundi> bluss: Unless you changed it again in the last few days, I'm totally fine with it :)
[15:24:53] <aturon> bluss: just one question -- this replaces existing search routines such that the existing unit tests apply?
[15:25:17] <bluss> yes, split, find etc unit tests should all touch this code -- if they search using a &str
[15:25:40] <bluss> kimundi: it ended up doing no changes to the Pattern API etc
[15:25:41] <aturon> ok great; between that and the two reviews you've already gotten, i'm going to r+ this along. thanks for taking this on!
[15:26:22] <aturon> we'll discuss the beta nomination soon
[15:26:38] <bluss> yeah that's maybe not in Rust's best interest
[15:26:45] <bluss> I was just sad that I missed the window :)
[15:28:17] <bluss> aturon: I'll be very happy if it gets merged since it turned out to be a lot more work than I first thought
[15:28:20] <bluss> but it was fun
[15:29:27] <aturon> it's all up to bors now :) but yeah, re: beta, it'd be a nice boost but is also a pile of new code

[15:42:10] <SimonSapin> Isn’t the point of releasing every 6 weeks that we shouldn’t worry too much about missing a window? :)

[15:43:35] <SimonSapin> Though I suppose this will come with time, 1.13 v.s. 1.12 won’t seem as big a deal as 1.3 vs 1.2
[15:44:09] <bluss> well it looked to be comfortable since it started on it more than a week before 1.2 branched
[15:44:19] <bluss> so it was just broken expectations
[15:44:46] *** Quits: annodomini (lambda@moz-qgii5v.ma.comcast.net) (Client exited)
[15:44:58] <SimonSapin> maybe we should release every 6 days :)
[15:45:03] <bluss> but yeah 6 weeks is a long time when stable rust is only 6 weeks old
