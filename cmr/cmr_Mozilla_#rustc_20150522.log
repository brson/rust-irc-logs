[10:05:51] <arielb1> when is liberate_late_bound_regions useful?
[10:10:37] <eddyb> arielb1: in a regional revolution
[10:11:03] <arielb1> I mean, if you have a for<'a> Foo<'a>
[10:11:24] <arielb1> of course it will give you a Foo<'f>
[10:11:41] <eddyb> (sorry, but the jargon gets pretty crazy in places :P. no idea what the actual answer is)
[10:11:45] <arielb1> but are you allowed to put bounds on the 'f?
[10:12:19] <arielb1> eddyb: I don't think that is standard jargon
[10:12:57] <eddyb> rustc has plenty of its own
[10:14:27] <arielb1> I mean, ∀I and ∃E require a "leak-check"

[10:23:17] <arielb1> I mean, it is for ∀I or ∀E
[10:27:41] <pnkfelix> arielb1: I don't understand your "∀I or ∀E" notation
[10:30:02] <pnkfelix> arielb1: The comment above `ty::Binder` might be useful, I'm not sure how much
[10:42:24] <arielb1> pnkfelix: ∀I and ∀E are standard logic rules

[10:42:39] <pnkfelix> sorry I just forgot what the I and E stood for
[10:42:47] <pnkfelix> okay, so yeah
[10:43:11] <pnkfelix> arielb1: I don't have a good intuition currently about when to employ it
[10:43:40] <arielb1> when you need to "prove" a universal, you use ∀I
[10:44:20] <pnkfelix> yes yes, I just misunderstood what you were saying at first
[10:44:45] <pnkfelix> (i thought the `I` and `E` were somehow the variables being introduced by the universal quantifier)
[10:47:42] <arielb1> so, what is it?
[10:48:42] <pnkfelix> arielb1: beyond what you've already said, about switching from a late-bound "for-all 'a" to a skolemized FreeRegion?
[10:49:15] <arielb1> I mean, there are 2 ways to "introduce" a universal quantifier
[10:49:33] <arielb1> ∀I introduces in a positive position, ∀E introduces in a negative position
[10:49:50] * pnkfelix goes over to review this again
[10:49:53] <arielb1> there are 2 functions that substitute late-bound regions

[10:58:06] <arielb1> according to higher-ranked/README.md it does ∀I
[10:58:23] <pnkfelix> arielb1: but reviewing the code for both skolemize_late_bound_regions and liberate_late_bound_regions, I am no longer confident about that understanding
[11:01:13] <arielb1> README.md
[11:01:32] <arielb1> claims that skolemize_late_bound_regions is for ∀E
[11:01:40] <arielb1> and liberate_late_bound_regions is for ∀I
[11:03:03] <pnkfelix> arielb1: well then you should probably trust the README, since niko wrote that.
[11:03:37] <pnkfelix> arielb1: (though I am having trouble finding such text in the README myself)
[11:03:49] <pnkfelix> arielb1: you say this is in higher_ranked/README.md ?
[11:04:11] <arielb1> it doesn't say that explicitly
[11:04:40] <arielb1> but the supertype is in ∀E mode and the subtype is in ∀I mode
[11:04:45] <arielb1> and you skolemize the supertype
[11:05:45] <pnkfelix> oh yes, 'A is the free region, and 'x is the skolemized, right okay
[11:06:12] <pnkfelix> i really should go re-read that SPJ paper

[12:41:33] <nmatsakis> arielb1: so
[12:41:42] <nmatsakis> liberate-late-bound-regions is kind of independent from what you are talking about here
[12:42:08] <nmatsakis> in particular, you're talking about the subtyping code, I take it?
[12:42:11] <arielb1> no
[12:42:21] <arielb1> I am not talking about the subtyping code

[12:46:13] <arielb1> I just used the subtyping code as documentation
[12:48:21] <arielb1> nmatsakis: anyway
[12:48:33] <arielb1> on a different subject
[12:48:42] <arielb1> should I check default type parameters on declaration or use site?
[12:52:30] <nmatsakis> arielb1: ah ok, so do you want me to clarify the role that liberate plays?
[12:52:37] <arielb1> yes
[12:52:38] <nmatsakis> I couldnt' tell if you felt you had reached understanding :)
[12:52:50] <nmatsakis> liberate is basically used when you are checking code that is "inside" the binder
[12:53:10] <arielb1> and you want to "use" ∀I later on?
[12:53:13] <nmatsakis> so for late-bound-regions appearing in fn headers, we liberate those regions when we check the body of the fn
[12:53:21] <nmatsakis> it's certainly realted to skolemization
[12:53:31] <nmatsakis> I don't understand the notation you are using :)
[12:53:33] <nmatsakis> forall "I"?
[12:53:38] <arielb1> forall introduction
[12:53:48] <nmatsakis> oh I see
[12:54:06] <arielb1> that's it, forall right-introduction
[12:54:47] <nmatsakis> then yes, I think that's right
[12:55:39] <nmatsakis> note that liberate does not do "leak checking"
[12:55:50] <arielb1> nmatsakis: that's because we do it backwards
[12:55:57] <nmatsakis> right
[12:56:34] <arielb1> instead, you have to leak-check when you introduce new free variabes
[12:56:37] <nmatsakis> if we want to (and I think we proibably do) generalization
[12:56:38] <arielb1> *variables
[12:56:43] <nmatsakis> we will presumably have to introduce some form of leak checking
[12:56:46] <nmatsakis> e.g. on closure boundaries
[12:56:49] <arielb1> generalization?
[12:57:15] <nmatsakis> don't look too closely at how closures are type-checked ;) it's a bit sketchy in some cases
[12:57:21] <arielb1> what is generalization?
[12:57:22] <nmatsakis> but I mean generalization in the "HM type inference" sense,
[12:57:29] <nmatsakis> where you go from an unbound type variable,
[12:57:35] <nmatsakis> to a forall type scheme

[22:17:42] <pnkfelix> here's a potentially silly question: In our LLVM output, can we see a store emitted from anything other than LLVMBuildStore (which I think ends up meaning "either store or store_volatile in trans/builder.rs ) ?
[22:18:14] <pnkfelix> I'm trying to track down where a store comes from
[22:18:33] <cmr> I don't think we have any other way to emit a store, but there might be something obscure.
[22:19:50] <pnkfelix> I must be doing something wrong with my RUST_LOG specification then...
[22:20:34] <pnkfelix> (because it seems like then every possible source of a store should have a corresponding "store {} -> {}" in the debug! log output...)
[22:21:03] <pnkfelix> but then ... if I'm seeing any of those, then I should be seeing all of them .. .argh!

[22:32:50] <nrc> after a week of effort making it all work, it is super satisfying seeing timing data slowly get measured and recorded: https://github.com/nrc/rustc-timing/commits/master

[22:35:47] <nrc> locally yes, but I'm still working on the front end - its pretty unstable and a bit too keen to crash the backend to make public
[22:36:00] <nrc> early next week hopefully
[22:36:34] <nrc> arielb1: I remember you landed a big perf improvement last month, do you remember the date?
[22:36:44] <arielb1> I landed it in 2 parts
[22:37:35] <arielb1> the second part landed May 1
[22:38:26] <arielb1> I have more improvements coming
[22:38:41] <arielb1> but I got tangled with a few annoying bugs
[22:39:42] <nrc> Oh, I don't have data for that yet. I see two big drops in compile time last month - around the 10th and around the 24th
[22:39:46] <arielb1> I mean, both the RFC401 bugs
[22:40:11] <arielb1> the first part of my improvement landed around 24th
[22:40:34] <nrc> cool, probably that
[22:40:58] <arielb1> what is the core team currently focusing on?
[22:41:11] <arielb1> I mean, I am the only one pushing bugfixes lately
[22:41:23] <nrc> I don't know
[22:41:55] <nrc> I like to imagine they're nursing a week-long hangover from the 1.0 launch :-p
[22:42:58] <arielb1> I mean, I even self-closed 2 issues
