[01:33:11] <canhtak> Jarrett: You made the issue on rust-sfml?
[01:33:37] <Jarrett> I responded to the issue on rust-sfml :)
[01:34:15] <Jarrett> someone else made it a month ago
[01:34:31] <canhtak> oh yes, i know.
[01:34:37] <canhtak> but i have a question
[01:34:41] <Jarrett> mhm?
[01:35:02] <Jarrett> (are you Jeremy?)
[01:35:09] <canhtak> yes
[01:35:21] <Jarrett> ok
[01:35:37] <canhtak> have you tried to eliminate the stuff on the pong example an let just the refresh loop + the clear window.
[01:36:16] <canhtak> you say that you think the clear function work because it fill the window with a dark red color.
[01:36:40] <canhtak> but i've just remember that the the window should be filled with a green color.
[01:36:53] <canhtak> so maybe the problem come from the clear function
[01:36:59] <canhtak> (or maybe not)
[01:37:08] <Jarrett> hmmmm
[01:37:38] <Jarrett> so what should I comment out?
[01:39:42] <Jarrett> everything except the window.clear?
[01:42:17] <canhtak> Jerrett: https://gist.github.com/JeremyLetang/7954601
[01:42:30] <canhtak> this should display a green window.
[01:42:50] <Jarrett> ah, yeah
[01:42:56] <Jarrett> been playing around with it
[01:42:58] <Jarrett> it's strange
[01:43:08] <Jarrett> the green and blue components of the window clear color are ignored \:I
[01:44:37] <o11c> Jarrett: ignored in what code?
[01:45:24] <Jarrett> so if I use new_RGB(255, 255, 255) for the clear color, I get a bright red screen, instead of white.. or if I do new_RGB(0, 255, 255), I get black, instead of cyan
[01:45:30] <Jarrett> in that code
[01:45:57] <Jarrett> I tried new_RGBA() with various values and it doesn't change anything. only the red is used, and nothing else changes the color
[01:46:13] <Jarrett> I thought it might be a pixel order issue (BGRA or something)
[01:46:57] <Jarrett> like window.clear(&Color::new_RGBA(255, 255, 64, 128)); still just shows a bright red screen
[01:47:05] <canhtak> really strange...
[01:47:07] <Jarrett> yeah
[01:47:24] <canhtak> which version of SFML do you use?
[01:47:34] <o11c> only thing I could imagine was somehow setting the OpenGL color mask
[01:47:35] <Jarrett> 2.1
[01:47:48] <Jarrett> maybe that's it?
[01:49:01] <canhtak> not the version should work...
[01:49:06] <Jarrett> hmm
[01:49:30] <canhtak> the same program in c++ SFML work on you windows?
[01:49:35] <canhtak> you can try this?
[01:50:43] <jhasse> hi! Has someone ported GLEW to rust yet? Couldn't find anything. How are you using OpenGL on windows without glew?

[02:02:12] <Jarrett> OH sorry
[02:02:25] <Jarrett> I keep missing the :: between the name and the <
[02:02:34] <Jarrett> it's 4 bytes
[02:02:40] <canhtak> okay... 
[02:02:52] <canhtak> everything seems normal...
[02:03:23] <canhtak> you can try the same thing with the ContextSettings struct please?
[02:04:27] <Jarrett> I printed out the members of the Color struct after creating it and they're right
[02:04:31] <Jarrett> sure
[02:04:35] <canhtak> ah and maybe try to remove the call to window.set_vertical_sync_enabled(true);
[02:04:50] <canhtak> i know that it's not supported by all graphics cards
[02:04:53] <Jarrett> 20
[02:04:56] <canhtak> maybe it come from this
[02:05:10] <canhtak> okay the ContextSettings is good too...
[02:05:13] <Jarrett> commenting out the vsync didn't change anything
[02:05:49] <Jarrett> :(
[02:06:16] <canhtak> arj
[02:06:41] <canhtak> just a last one, try the test of the sys_of with the RenderWindow type please
[02:06:55] <canhtak> if it's not this i really can't help you
[02:07:41] <Jarrett> :(
[02:07:43] <Jarrett> ok
[02:08:07] <Jarrett> 44
[02:10:28] <Jarrett> canhtak: ^
[02:10:35] <canhtak> yes sorry
[02:10:37] <canhtak> thanks
[02:10:42] <Jarrett> heheh
[02:10:46] <canhtak> i have not the same result
[02:10:49] <Jarrett> :o
[02:10:51] <canhtak> it's probably here
[02:11:09] <canhtak> but not really sure
[02:11:25] <Jarrett> let's see the sizes of DefaultView and CurrentView..
[02:11:57] <Jarrett> er, of sfView
[02:12:13] <Jarrett> oh woops
[02:12:19] <Jarrett> I was looking at sfRenderWIndow
[02:13:23] <canhtak> ok
[02:14:09] <canhtak> for you sfRenderWindow is 44?
[02:14:29] <Jarrett> yeah, but I think the size is only that because of pointer sizes
[02:14:36] <Jarrett> cause you're on 64-bit
[02:15:05] <Jarrett> I'm guessing yours iiiiiis about 60 bytes?
[02:15:39] <canhtak> nope
[02:15:50] <canhtak> 24 for me on 64 bit
[02:15:55] <Jarrett> oh :V that's very weird
[02:15:59] <canhtak> yes
[02:16:08] <canhtak> it's impossible...

[02:16:18] <Jarrett> haha
[02:16:24] <Jarrett> sfEvent alone should be 28 bytes
[02:17:30] <canhtak> for me sfEvent is 24.
[02:18:26] <Jarrett> oh, that's a c_float, not a float
[02:18:31] <Jarrett> yeah, it should be 24
[02:19:46] <Jarrett> yes it is for me too
[02:20:01] <canhtak> okay
[02:20:16] <Jarrett> so 20 bytes for the rest of RenderWindow makes sense, as it's 3 4-byte pointers and 1 uint
[02:20:25] <Jarrett> er
[02:20:41] <Jarrett> wait.
[02:21:33] <canhtak> ?
[02:23:53] <Jarrett> okay. RenderWindow has a *sfRenderWindow (4), a uint (4), two @mut Views (4 + 4), an sfEvent (24), and a uint (4)
[02:23:58] <Jarrett> er
[02:24:02] <Jarrett> I counted that uint twice :P
[02:24:15] <Jarrett> 4 + 4 + 4 +4 + 24 = 40
[02:24:16] <Jarrett> not 44
[02:24:21] <Jarrett> where are those extra 4 bytes coming from
[02:24:40] <Jarrett> Rust doesn't stick extra members in structs, does it?
[02:25:29] <canhtak> i don't know...
[02:25:33] <Jarrett> strange
[02:27:26] <canhtak> the problem probably don't come from RenderWindow, but from sfRenderWindow.
[02:27:51] <Jarrett> oh?
[02:28:51] <canhtak> just try to comment the current declaration of sfRenderWindow and replace it by an empty struct 
[02:28:55] <canhtak> like this     pub struct sfRenderWindow;

[04:09:50] <Jarrett> h3r3tic: the basic example on https://github.com/bjz/glfw-rs works fine
[04:10:00] <Jarrett> but if you try any of the other examples that come with it
[04:10:04] <Jarrett> it breaks.
[04:10:25] <Jarrett> like the window setup and context creation and buffer swapping and event polling all *work*
[04:10:31] <Jarrett> but everything else gives an error
[04:11:11] <Jarrett> so like if you try the callbacks.rs example, it pops up a window, and the window responds to the close event, but it spits out a dozen "the GLFW library has not been initialized" errors on the console and it doesn't respond to any of the other events

[07:08:44] <Jarrett> but at least h3r3tic is having the same problems as I am now that he upgraded
[07:08:46] <Jarrett> it's cooooooooool
[07:08:50] <Jarrett> there's get_key ;)
[07:09:09] * bjz feels like all his stuff is broked
[07:09:32] <Jarrett> but yeah all the openGL related stuff in both glfw-rs and gl-rs should use extern "system" (I think? that resolves to "C" on non-windows platforms, no?)
[07:09:33] * bjz is happy though, he has ideas from his gallery expeditions today
[07:09:37] <Jarrett> :)
[07:09:37] <bjz> yep
[07:09:44] <bjz> could you PR that?
[07:09:47] <bjz> sorry
[07:09:50] <Jarrett> yep
[07:10:18] <bjz> I was trying to get the windows folks to test it :P
[07:10:34] * bjz has a PR, but its old
[07:12:41] <Jarrett> heheh
[07:13:28] * bjz has been getting fed up with build systems lately
[07:14:03] <Jarrett> they really kind of suck don't they :P
[07:14:11] <bjz> kinda why my lib dev has been languishing. jack is helping move glfw-rs to cmake now :(
[07:14:25] <bjz> bye bye rustpkg
[07:14:31] <Jarrett> psh
[07:14:37] <Jarrett> I don't think there's even a necessity
[07:15:07] <Jarrett> rustc -o glfw --link-args "-lopengl32 -lgdi32" src/glfw/lib.rs works juuuuust fine
[07:15:22] <bjz> heh
[07:15:41] <bjz> I just don't want to do those link args all the time
[07:15:46] <bjz> remember them
[07:15:47] <Jarrett> just include a one-liner build.sh/build.bat ;D
[07:15:53] <bjz> HAH
[07:15:55] <bjz> .bat
[07:16:00] <Jarrett> flap flap flap
[07:16:04] <bjz> fking windowsers
[07:16:09] <Jarrett> whine whine whine
[07:16:20] <bjz> yay .sh
[07:16:25] <Jarrett> actually MinGW supports .sh so
[07:16:35] <Jarrett> just detect the platform (hahaha haaaaaaaaaaaaa)
[07:22:06] <Jarrett> huh.
[07:22:42] <Jarrett> OH I'm dumb
[07:23:07] <Jarrett> let's use & instead of *
[07:23:21] <Jarrett> bitwise and TOTALLY gives the same results as multiplication
[07:23:40] <dbaupp> it does for u1
[07:24:34] <Jarrett> ;D

[21:11:09] <Jarrett> so I'm new to VAOs in openGL, and I'm wondering: do they also store the element buffer bindings, or only the vertex buffer bindings?
[21:14:05] <jeaye> From memory, no.
[21:14:59] *** Quits: jensnockert (jensnocker@moz-7DC16A5F.afb.bredband2.com) (Input/output error)
[21:15:21] <Jarrett> okay. I'm reading through tutorials and docs and they never seem to clarify this :P
[21:15:26] *** Joins: jensnockert (jensnocker@moz-7DC16A5F.afb.bredband2.com)
[21:15:50] <Jarrett> sooooo many times I wish API docs would just have a bigass diagram of all the types and how they're related
[21:15:52] <jeaye> This says otherwise: https://www.opengl.org/wiki/Vertex_Specification#Index_buffers
[21:16:10] <jeaye> My suggestion: try it. ;)
[21:16:25] <Jarrett> well then! :P
[21:16:59] <jeaye> I see in q3, I have this: https://gist.github.com/jeaye/7fb36fa83df801308410

[21:17:26] <jeaye> Which is binding them separately, affirming my recollection.
[21:17:37] <jeaye> It could, however, be entirely superfluous.
[21:17:44] <Jarrett> right right
[21:18:01] <Jarrett> I'll try making twoooo and seeing if just binding the VAO and not the EBO works
[21:21:29] <Jarrett> works fine!
[21:21:37] <Jarrett> no EBO binding necessary
[21:25:57] <jeaye> IBO is the term
[21:28:40] *** Joins: jensnockert (jensnocker@moz-7DC16A5F.afb.bredband2.com)
[21:31:32] <Jarrett> well some people call them element buffers |<
