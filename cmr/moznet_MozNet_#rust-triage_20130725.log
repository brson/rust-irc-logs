[16:37:02] <cmr> pnkfelix: 12:36:06 graydon | Bridge?
[16:37:13] <graydon> I'm in bridge
[16:37:27] <graydon> not sure we have enough people for a quorum today

[17:06:40] <graydon> tjc: triage meeting was at 9:30. only felix and I showed up so we cancelled it.
[17:07:09] <tjc> graydon: Ok. Sorry, alarm didn't go off
[17:07:16] <graydon> brson and pcwalton not available due to OSCON, niko was babysitting
[17:07:22] <tjc> graydon: there's no research meeting either?
[17:08:04] <graydon> doubt it
[17:08:09] <graydon> maybe?
[17:09:27] <tjc> oh, it's not listed on the calendar
[17:09:43] <tjc> welp, that's what I get for manually syncing my calendar with Zimbra
[17:11:19] <graydon> yeah. you pretty much need to connect zimbra live to whatever else you use.
[17:11:25] <graydon> thunderbird + lightning works ok
[17:11:51] <tjc> I use Google Calendar
[17:14:01] <graydon> I believe google calendar can't pull calendar feeds from a private zimbra server
[17:14:15] <graydon> in any case doing so would involve giving google your ldap password here. probably not a wise move.
[17:36:05] <tjc> I'll just hold out until Mozilla switches to something less awful than Zimbra
[17:40:46] <graydon> that will happen shortly after the sun goes dark
[17:41:30] <graydon> I suggest figuring it out somehow
[17:41:33] <cmr> There are things less awful than Zimbra?
[17:41:35] <graydon> I'll msg you some links
[17:41:47] <cmr> I found it quite Ok during my (non-mozilla) internship last summer
[17:43:30] <tjc> cmr: Google Calendar, for one!
[17:44:12] <cmr> I just discovered that google even has a calendar the last two weeks when I accidentally clicked on a date in an email, so I don't have much experience with it yet.
[17:45:09] <tjc> I've been using it for… five years, maybe?
[17:45:10] <tjc> changed my life
