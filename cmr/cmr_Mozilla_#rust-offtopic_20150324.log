[00:00:03] <c74d> Also I wouldn't be able to get that website's JavaScript anyway because it's non-HTTPS.
[00:00:05] <eddyb> tiffany: are they now waiting for everyone to get off WINAPI?
[00:00:28] <tiffany> eddyb: and into what? javascript?
[00:00:35] <eddyb> riiight
[00:00:57] <tiffany> I think my favourite version of windows was windows 2000
[00:01:27] <eddyb> the first NT-based one?
[00:01:51] <eddyb> tiffany: did anyone figure out what ME was, btw?
[00:02:13] <eddyb> my bet is that it was an arms race within the company
[00:02:35] <tiffany> eddyb: it's the last windows 9x
[00:02:50] <eddyb> what?
[00:02:57] <tiffany> windows ME
[00:03:00] <eddyb> ah
[00:03:02] <tiffany> it's basically windows 98++
[00:03:06] <eddyb> well, yeah, but... why?
[00:03:11] <tiffany> windows 2000 was preceeded by windows NT 4.0
[00:03:17] <tiffany> which itself was preceeded by windows NT 3.51
[00:03:46] <eddyb> dat versioning
[00:03:58] <eddyb> reminds me of minecraft before it stabilized on something semver-ish
[00:03:59] <tiffany> apparently, windows NT 3.1 is the first release of NT, in 1993
[00:04:16] <scott> Windows 8: NT 6.2, Windows 8.1: NT 6.3, Windows 10: NT 10.0
[00:04:19] <tiffany> windows 95/98/ME are even less explainable now...
[00:04:27] <eddyb> so Windows 94 could have been the future
[00:04:32] <eddyb> scott: ... no?
[00:04:41] <scott> according to wikipedia
[00:04:44] <tiffany> eddyb: it's true
[00:04:46] <bstrie> eddyb: hilarious
[00:04:48] <eddyb> scott: windows 7 is NT 7, isn't it?
[00:04:58] <scott> no, 6.1
[00:05:00] <eddyb> my dreams are shattered
[00:05:03] <tiffany> XP: NT 5.0, vista: 6.0, 7: 6.1
[00:05:09] <eddyb> tiffany: that's just stupid
[00:05:28] <tiffany> eddyb: I think the reason they bumped the major version between XP and vista is because vista has a new driver model
[00:05:34] <tiffany> they just didn't do any major OS overhauls since
[00:05:36] <eddyb> I thought the versioning *made sense*
[00:05:44] <eddyb> 7 came after 6
[00:06:00] <tiffany> the NT versioning kind of makes sense, the product names are marketing
[00:06:05] <scott> I think the NT versioning mostly made sense until the jump to 10.0
[00:06:05] <tiffany> except windows 10
[00:06:07] <eddyb> but 7!
[00:06:15] <bstrie> eddyb: share this minecraft video series pls
[00:06:18] <tiffany> they skipped a bunch of versions because they're doing a new versioning scheme
[00:06:45] <eddyb> there will be no Windows 11
[00:06:53] <eddyb> just like there will be no Mac OS XI
[00:06:56] <eddyb> riiight?
[00:07:01] <tiffany> and no emacs 2.0.0
[00:07:05] <eddyb> lol
[00:07:06] <scott> Windows 2020!
[00:07:26] <tiffany> like, they decided that they are never going to break compatibility with previous versions of emacs
[00:07:31] <tiffany> so they just.. dropped the major version number
[00:07:32] <eddyb> scott: VS2025 will have partial C++21 support
[00:07:43] <tiffany> the current version of emacs is, technically, 1.24.4.1
[00:07:51] <eddyb> which will have primitive borrow checking
[00:08:04] <eddyb> according to pcwalton :P
[00:08:38] <scott> I like how the TeX version is supposed to be all cool and nerdy but is in essence just unary

[00:35:27] <scott> you can delete/clear your own search history, too, or use a private tab
[00:35:37] <eddyb> search queries don't even get there
[00:35:46] <c74d> 200%? an impossible figure, surely
[00:36:11] <eddyb> it would be a complete and utter waste of time to route search results just to display them on a nice dashboard

[00:37:40] <c74d> I've heard that Google runs a lot of Java internally, which seems like it would be a significant waste of money at their scale.
[00:37:46] <scott> even for a senior developer, unless they have a specific need to deal with that data, they can't access it, and it's probably encrypted in a user-specific even when they do

[11:35:26] <Tobba|Laptop> I actually wonder how proof of ownership is handled for bigger domains
[11:36:22] <fmtq> probably just send a passport photo of a chinese worker
[11:36:27] <fmtq> who is forced to work IT 
[11:38:33] <Tobba|Laptop> photos of random passports are really easy to get
[11:39:06] <Tobba|Laptop> there are plenty of reasons people scan that stuff in, though I haven't figured any of those reasons out yet
[11:39:45] <Tobba|Laptop> and then you find some strange russian company with an FTP server that allows anonymous access and has pictures of the passports, driver license and ID of all workers

[21:11:33] <lahwran> that's not how that works; the pipe is opened for all of them at the same time
[21:15:06] <flan3002> Binero - Piping is concurrent. cmda can write to stdout and cmdb can read from stdin without cmda having returned an exit code.
[21:15:56] <Binero> ah I see
[21:16:02] <Binero> but there should be some alternatives
[21:16:27] <flan3002> Binero - If you have to do this, either wait with writing to stdout or get a bash script that checks the exit code and then starts cmdb conditionally.
