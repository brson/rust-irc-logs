[06:36:03] <Khmar> I have an epub and a mobi version of the rust tutorial (built off 8a4f0fa6) at http://noufalibrahim.name/rust-tutorial-8a4f0fa6.epub and http://noufalibrahim.name/rust-tutorial-8a4f0fa6.mobi in case anyone is interested. It would be nice to automate this and make it available every time the docs are built.
[06:38:51] <bjz> I'm pretty sure pandoc would be able to output that
[06:39:30] *** Joins: idkfa (~idkfa@white-109-95-196-209.krasinfo.ru)
[06:39:53] <Khmar> That's what I used after some sanitisation.
[06:40:06] <Khmar> And then calibre to convert from epub to mobi.
[06:41:19] <Khmar> I can try to make a patch if the documentation build scripts are on a open repo somewhere.

[08:32:21] <Khmar> Do I have to set some variables or pass some command line options to specify where the compiler should look for the stdlib? I get "failed to resolve" errors when I try to "use std::num::atan;".
[08:37:49] <Khmar> Looks like I have 0.7 and the docs I'm looking at are for 0.8. I'll update.
