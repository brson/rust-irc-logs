[00:10:19] <Manishearth> but that was needed to make homu work..and we had a couple of successful merges too
[00:10:32] <larsberg> Manishearth: I'm having a little trouble getting the spidery web of hooks, web APIs, callbacks, and various services all untangled
[00:11:12] <Manishearth> I wasn't around when you were setting up the webhooks so I still don't have an idea what that web is like
[00:11:16] <Manishearth> though I'm figuring it out

[00:12:44] <Manishearth> aha
[00:12:47] <Manishearth> we fed it /

[00:13:09] <Manishearth> I don't get how homu was working till now

[00:13:54] <larsberg> Manishearth: because of this - https://github.com/servo/saltfs/blob/master/buildbot/master/master.cfg#L344 we also set the GitHub web status, which rust doesn't do
[00:14:03] <larsberg> (bors uses that)

[00:19:50] <jack> Manishearth: the diagram as I understand it is this:
[00:19:55] <jack> 1) comment posted on a PR
[00:20:16] <jack> 2) GitHub fires webhook to http://build.servo.org:54856/github (homu)
[00:20:28] <jack> 3) Homu comments on GH, merges to auto, etc
[00:20:50] <jack> 4) GitHub fires push notifications to http://build.servo.org:9010/ 
[00:21:09] <jack> 5) buildbot-github-listener receives those, and publishes changes over PB protocol to buildbot
[00:21:24] <jack> 6) buildbot detects new changes on branches it likes, and does builds.

[00:23:25] <jack> How does homu know the build is complete?
[00:23:34] <jack> bors got it from the status.
[00:23:37] <Manishearth> uh
[00:23:39] <larsberg> Yeah, I think that we want buildbot just pushing to homu, via the URL thing I just fixed up above
[00:23:47] <Manishearth> it does that^
[00:23:51] <jack> Or maybe it queried buildbot's API
[00:24:04] <Manishearth> larsberg: did you restart salt?
[00:24:04] <larsberg> buildbot is supposed to push it to homu via https://github.com/servo/saltfs/blob/master/buildbot/master/master.cfg#L325-L328
[00:24:21] <jack> ok
[00:24:34] <larsberg> I think the errors we were seeing in twistd are because homu was not correctly listening there and it would cause buildbot to shut down? I'm shooting in the dark a little.

[01:28:45] <larsberg> Manishearth: jack: So when I look at the web hook event thingies coming from github, they are sending them against the "auto" branch but the buildbot UI is reporting them as being in "tmp" and ignoring them.

[06:15:44] <gfxmonk> gw: thanks, I missed that. Strangely that script doesn't actually do anything, as nothing actually calls main()

[12:51:30] <nox> Manishearth: Nevermind, I force-pushed the previous commit.
[12:51:53] <larsberg> No, with it. But http://build.servo.org/homu/buildbot is an nginx redirect to http://build.servo.org:54856/buildbot, if that matters

[12:53:18] <barosl> larsberg, The primary concern with the URL with `/homu/buildbot` was that it produces invalid test result URLs

[13:04:08] <jgraham> Pretty sure I've seen that implemented before
[13:04:47] <larsberg> barosl: thanks, I'm just afraid to change it after we finally seem to have gotten the spiderweb hanging together :-)
[13:05:49] <Ms2ger> larsberg, you're going to make pretty graphs, aren't you? ;)
[13:06:51] <larsberg> Ms2ger: no way! If I show off the UML charts I threw together to figure out what the workflow was, I'd lost all my cred. "he's one of those lolololol enterprise architect types, eh?"
[13:07:12] <Ms2ger> larsberg, we already know you are: )
[13:08:07] <larsberg> True story: one of my directs was employee #8 and the former CTO of Rational (which made all the earliest UML tools). He could freehand basically perfect circles, squares, etc. at lightspeed on a whiteboard. It was like watching a human pen plotter (for those old enough to remember those).
[13:08:32] <Ms2ger> A what? ;)
[13:10:06] <SimonSapin> Checking out files: 100% (106958/106958), done.
[13:10:13] <SimonSapin> 10 seconds
[13:11:11] <larsberg> SimonSapin: http://build.servo.org/builders/mac1/builds/1534/steps/git/logs/stdio says 232 seconds, unless I'm misreading?
[13:11:29] <SimonSapin> larsberg: sorry, unrelated to the discussion
[13:11:36] <SimonSapin> 10 seconds is on my laptop
[13:11:50] <larsberg> aha
[13:12:20] <SimonSapin> doesn’t Linode have SSDs?
[13:12:35] <jgraham> It does
[13:13:41] <SimonSapin> then I wonder what makes such a difference
[13:13:44] <jgraham> Seems hard to believe that the same operation would be more than an order of magnitude slower on linode compared to your laptop. *Is* it the same operation?
[13:14:28] <SimonSapin> Mine was `git checkout master` from a branch before the huge PR
[13:14:53] <jgraham> git clone --branch auto https://github.com/servo/servo .
[13:16:04] <SimonSapin> ok, so maybe most of that 232 seconds is network?
[13:16:10] <SimonSapin> or other non-checkout things
[13:16:28] <larsberg> it's on one of the mac minis (macstadium). On linode it's http://build.servo.org/builders/linux1/builds/1321/steps/git/logs/stdio and 15s

[13:19:00] <jgraham> So IO on the macs is super-expensive
[13:19:07] <jgraham> in terms of time
[13:19:16] <SimonSapin> ok, HDD vs SSD probably explains 232 seconds vs 15 seconds
[13:19:25] <larsberg> I think we can move to SSDs and a 2.8GHz for $10/month more, with the new pricing since we last purchased

[13:24:35] <nox> SimonSapin: Probably.
[13:25:36] <nox> Ms2ger: I think that too.
[13:25:45] <nox> Anyway, seems like it's compiling.
[13:25:45] <SimonSapin> larsberg: #5300 is apparently pre CSS tests PR. Is this a problem?
[13:25:46] <crowbot> Issue #5300: layout: Implement most of `border-collapse` per CSS 2.1 § 17.6.2. - https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5300
[13:25:54] <jgraham> jdm: So, on another topic, I did a little bit of work to stand up very basic webdriver support (basically: able to start a session and get notified when a new global is created). Now I have a couple of questions:
[13:26:26] <nox> Is it unsafe to box a Temporary btw?
[13:26:42] <larsberg> SimonSapin: it looks like GitHub implemented the timeout (it now says "can't automatically merge") so it's not crucial to close or rebase it this second. I do expect that any other tools that look at it will hit the horrible git behavior, though.
[13:26:48] <jdm> nox: yes, since Temporary relies on being on the stack
[13:26:55] <nox> jdm: Mmmh,
[13:27:19] <nox> jdm: so we can't box Output in TNode. (Re: our selectors' discussion yesterday), can we?
[13:27:20] <jgraham> 1) How to identify the browsing that webdriver commands go to? The WD cpncept is that each tab/chrome window has a handle, one of which is selected at a time and that commands like Get() go to the window in that bc
[13:27:30] <SimonSapin> larsberg: Critic seems OK, but I’ll remember not to have it try to review a rebase

[13:28:03] <jgraham> So I think I want something like pipeline_id but that doesn't change on navigation
[13:28:09] <SimonSapin> (which would build an "equivalent merge" that includes CSS tests)
[13:28:31] <jdm> jgraham: so in #5556 I proposed a different model than my original "notify on global creation" design
[13:28:31] <crowbot> Issue #5556: Process the Get command - https://github.com/servo/servo/issues/5556
[13:29:03] <jgraham> 2) Is passing channels-over-channels verboten these days? i.e. should I implement commands like that or with one channel in each direction?
[13:29:05] <Ms2ger> jdm, Temporary doesn't, does it?
[13:29:07] *** Joins: acgtyrant (acgtyrant@moz-3kd.b79.160.124.IP)

[13:30:06] <jgraham> jdm: I see. Sounds like that would solve the first problem if there's a root pipeline that never changes?
[13:30:38] <jdm> jgraham: well, it's not that the root pipeline never changes, since navigation will change it
[13:30:39] <jgraham> Or maybe it doesn't even matter
[13:31:09] <jdm> but we can either provide the ability to fetch the current id, or we can add new commands for "do this to the root frame"
[13:31:25] <jgraham> OK
[13:31:43] <jgraham> So I guess my problem here might be one level higher (or lack of understanding)
[13:31:56] <jdm> if webdriver is not concerned with targetting specific iframes, I think dealing with the constellation is the best model
[13:32:11] *** Quits: mystor (mystor@moz-ldavpp.home3.cgocable.net) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[13:32:18] <jgraham> It can target specific iframes (e.g. for script injection)
[13:32:34] <jgraham> But e.g. Get runs against the top level browsing context
[13:32:34] <ted> jdm: how old is Servo's spidermonkey (OOC)?
[13:32:50] <jdm> ted: sept 2012, afair
[13:33:04] <ted> ouch
[13:33:15] <ted> is updating just painful because you have to munge the rust->C bindings?
[13:33:16] <jgraham> jdm: So one thing I'm not sure about still is what happens when there are multiple top level browsing contexts
[13:33:29] <jgraham> e.g. multiple tabs
[13:33:47] <jdm> ted: it's painful because we need to do the transition to exact rooting as well
[13:33:58] <ted> oh, that
[13:33:58] <jdm> ted: and spidermonkey soon after moved to full c++
[13:34:08] <ted> ...and doing C++ FFI is a PITA
[13:34:09] <jdm> so those bindings are twice as painful
[13:34:15] <nox> I'm starting to have the intuition of where to use this or that type.
[13:34:29] <ted> jdm: are the spidermonkey bindings all lovingly hand-crafted?
[13:34:35] <jgraham> The webdriver model is basically that webdriver is a singleton and each session (of which there is basically one) is tied to a tlbc
[13:34:35] <jdm> jgraham: so here's the thing - a regular servo instance doesn't have multiple top level browsing contexts
[13:34:56] <jdm> ted: historically it was a combination of machine-generated and artisanally adapted
[13:35:13] <jdm> ted: mwu now has significantly improved the bindings we can produce from c++ headers, though
[13:35:28] <ted> cool
[13:35:29] <jgraham> jdm: What happens with e.g. servo_shell for example? And what will happen in the future?
[13:36:22] <jdm> jgraham: unclear what that means for servo_shell, since there's still only one top-level context there
[13:36:49] <jdm> jgraham: I imagine browser.html + firefox would have this same issue
[13:37:31] <jdm> jgraham: the miniservo ports had multiple constellations
[13:37:37] <jgraham> I think with the browser-in-an-iframe thing you need a way to say "this iframe is actually like a top-level-browsing-context"
[13:37:57] * jdm wonders if you get webdriver support for free with a full CEF port
[13:38:03] <jgraham> You don't want to window.parent your way out of the iframe, for example
[13:38:27] <jdm> yeah, interesting point
[13:39:17] <jgraham> I think you would if you implement the chrome devtools protocol. I don't know if that's part of CEF though
[13:39:23] <Ms2ger> Speaking of upgrading SM
[13:39:26] <Ms2ger> mwu++
[13:39:40] <jgraham> AIUI the webdriver support in chrome is devtools + a proxy

[21:16:03] <jack> No problem. better it works than is maximally efficient at not working
[21:16:15] <larsberg> The problem with push notifications is here - http://logs.glob.uno/?c=mozilla%23servo#c197297
[21:16:45] *** Quits: psd (psd@moz-024.at3.215.180.IP) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[21:16:54] <larsberg> Basically, because homu pushes to tmp then to auto, the notifications for auto that we get do not have anything in the PushEvent "commits" area, which causes the git webhook handler to drop it
[21:17:04] <jack> barosl: Is this something you can fix in homu? It would be nice to have it all push based instead of polling.
[21:17:20] <jack> What is the current polling interval?
[21:17:34] <larsberg> Right here is where they drop it - https://github.com/servo/saltfs/blob/master/buildbot/github_buildbot.py#L156-L161
[21:17:41] <larsberg> It polls every 60 seconds :-)
[21:18:02] <mbrubeck> neojski: I have no idea what the problem might be... I'd try adding some logging or running in a debugger to make sure your new code is being run, and see what the value of `element.namespace` is
[21:18:04] <barosl> Oh
[21:18:10] <barosl> larsberg, Is that related to the `tmp` branch issue?
[21:18:16] <barosl> That you said yesterday?
[21:18:27] <larsberg> barosl: yeah, that's the issue we were running into yesterday
[21:18:34] <barosl> Hmm, I got it
[21:18:50] *** Quits: mib_tbkas2 (Mibbit@moz-juv.9o3.252.72.IP) (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
[21:18:55] <larsberg> jack: We could also try to fix the web hook not to drop it on the floor if there are no commits, but I don't know if that would break something else in the PBChangeSource stuff (I didn't look into it)
[21:19:14] <barosl> I think eliminating tmp entirely would be viable
[21:19:39] <jack> Bors resets auto to master, then pushes the new commits
[21:19:56] <jack> So it appears as if some are made to hte branch. homu seems to reset auto to tmp, which comes thorugh as no commits.
[21:20:03] <neojski> mbrubeck: The additional problem right now is that compilation takes almost 10 minutes so debugging is very annoying. Is this normal?
[21:20:15] <jack> neojski: what module are you hacking on?
[21:20:36] <neojski> Ok, that was more like 5 minutes. It is script stuff.
[21:20:37] <larsberg> jack: yeah, so that "dropping" was probably important for bors so that we didn't get a change event when auto was reset to master :-)
[21:20:59] <barosl> I did it because the Rust project's Buildbot was still using the poller, so I was afraid that the "intermediate" state of the auto branch would be seen by the Buildbot
[21:21:01] <jack> neojski: script is the slowest component to compile unfortunately. Rust has whole-crate compilation units, not individual files.
[21:21:15] <mbrubeck> neojski: Yes, unfortunately changes in `script` cause really long rebuilds. :(
[21:21:24] <barosl> e.g. There are multiple commits to be applied to auto
[21:21:36] <jack> larsberg: I don't think github_listener was written with bors in mind
[21:21:44] <mbrubeck> I wonder if there's a way to enable that parallel codegen feature in rustc...
[21:22:07] <Ms2ger> neojski, == ns!(HTML) should work, fwiw
[21:22:09] <larsberg> barosl: yeah, if you did the two pushes to auto, I think our use of the poller would certainly try to build it twice
[21:22:55] <jack> You basically want one push of all the commits. Alternatively you could interface homu with buildbot directly to announce the code changes.
[21:23:05] <barosl> However AFAIK the Buildbot poller has a feature that "waiting for the branch until it doesn't change for a certain amount time"
[21:23:21] <jack> Or trigger the bulid without listening to the repo
[21:23:27] <jack> after all, homu knows when the merge is done :)
[21:23:31] <jack> And what hte SHA is
[21:23:31] <barosl> I think it was enabled by default, but I don't remember the exact amount of time
[21:23:48] <jack> You could remove this whole changelistener interface
[21:24:17] <jack> (The buildbot internal API should have a build this SHA function, since the UI supports the feature as I recall)
[21:25:28] *** Quits: Nefzaoui (nefzaoui@moz-0d8.335.104.154.IP) (Quit: Ex-Chat)
[21:25:32] <barosl> jack, Hmm, the multiple pushes were primarily done due to the automatic rollup feature... But it was obsolete and nowadays Homu makes a rollup PR rather than trying to automatically push multiple commits, so I think we can be certain that Homu always pushes only once per merge
[21:25:37] <larsberg> Maybe there's another type of buildbot 'change_source' that is basically web requests from something like homu? That would interface nicely with our buildbot config and wouldn't require queueing on all the builders
[21:26:03] <barosl> I'll just elimiate the try branch in a few days
[21:26:08] <barosl> s/try/tmp
[21:26:13] <neojski> Ms2ger: It doesn't for some reason. Oh, `namespace::Namespace` doesn't implement `fmt::Display` :-(
[21:26:18] *** Quits: Ms2ger (Ms2ger@moz-15i.9ho.190.193.IP) (Quit: nn)
[21:26:36] <jack> What I mean is that buildbot has a changelistener to trigger builds from a well known event. But you could trigger builds manually.
[21:26:40] <larsberg> Yeah, looks like you could send a "change_hook" http://docs.buildbot.net/latest/manual/cfg-statustargets.html#change-hooks
[21:26:43] <barosl> Creating another trigger to Buildbot seems to be overly complex
[21:27:07] <jack> So it's not another trigger. You remove repository watching completely and just have homu tell it "Start a build on rev X now"
[21:27:29] <jack> That is a much more reliable trigger than trying to trick the repository watcher into thinking it has a code chnage to build
[21:28:05] <barosl> Yeah, I got the idea, but... I think it would be still better to have an option to manually push a certain commit to auto
[21:28:06] <jack> Maybe I'll try to add this. Is homu hard to test? :)
[21:28:11] <barosl> Just in case Homu doesn't work properly
[21:28:36] <jack> If homu isn't working, don't we have bigger problems? :)

[21:29:11] <barosl> Sorry for that :P

[21:32:47] <barosl> larsberg, Wait. How has the Buildbot been possible to be notified until you changed to GitPoller?
[21:33:10] <barosl> Does PBChangeSource work *sometimes* currently?
[21:33:54] <larsberg> barosl: I think it might have, but I was unable to figure out when it would do so. We were also doing all sorts of mad stuff during the bors->homu transition, so it's not clear it was really working until now :-)
[21:34:09] <barosl> Huh, I see
[21:34:15] <larsberg> jack: another issue with homu right now is that it runs in a screen session instead of as a daemon that actually logs sensibly and can be restarted :-)
[21:35:00] <barosl> I need to prioritize this. It will be fixed as soon as possible

[21:42:38] <kmc> yes
[21:42:45] <pcwalton> it appears what is happening here is something like: the Text node boundaries depend on some sort of input chunking
[21:42:48] <pcwalton> aha
[21:42:56] <pcwalton> this was a fun bug to figure out
[21:42:58] <jack> larsberg: to fix the former just look at the config for github_listener.py which also doesn't have this support. upstart does all that for you.
[21:43:00] <barosl> jack, It seems that `pyvenv-3.4` could be just substituted with `python3 -m venv`... It won't require any external scripts and/or packages
[21:43:02] <kmc> I think when I originally wrote it I was under the impression that the DOM combines adjacent text nodes anyway
[21:43:03] <jack> (so does systemd)
[21:43:05] <kmc> but this is not the case :(
[21:43:07] <kmc> what's to be done
[21:43:32] <pcwalton> I was wondering why <pre> and <pre x=x> was OK but <pre dir=ltr>, <pre xdir=xltr>, <pre abc=def> were not
[21:43:38] <barosl> So the first line should be `python3 -mvenv _venv --without-pip`
[21:43:41] <pcwalton> affected the html5ever chunking boundaries
[21:43:46] <barosl> Hmm, I need to update Homu's README

[22:28:42] <kmc> I suppose we could make a DOM call equivalent to the JS "document.normalize()" after parsing, and this would fix the spec compliance issue
[22:28:53] <kmc> it's probably faster to not create those text nodes in the first place... iirc DOM creating is slow

[22:35:29] <mbrubeck> Hmm, does not seem to be a style-sharing bug.
[22:37:26] <pcwalton> hmm
[22:37:28] <pcwalton> was worth a shot anyway
[22:38:54] <mbrubeck> I'm seeing another issue, possibly unrelated, but making debugging difficult.  When I click or hover over an element, :hover and :focus styles aren't applied immediately.
[22:39:20] <mbrubeck> But if I press a key to type into an <input>, for example, then the reflow happens (including :hover and :focus updates)
[22:40:07] <gw> mbrubeck: sounds like there is no call to reflow occurring when the click or hover occurs?
[22:40:10] <mbrubeck> We do call `window.r().reflow(ReflowGoal::ForDisplay, ...)` in `DocumentHelpers::handle_click_event` after committing the focus...
[22:40:46] <gw> mbrubeck: in that case, I wonder if those styles aren't dirtying a node? the reflow early exits if it thinks no nodes are dirty
