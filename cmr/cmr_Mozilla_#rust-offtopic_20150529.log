[00:22:25] <c74d> This new Google Photos app seems nice(r). I like how it has automatically categorized my pictures of Food, Cats, Sky, and Mountains, among other things, without my ever tagging them as such, and it feels more performant.
[00:22:49] <c74d> …and I'm still procrastinating on the Linux-from-scratch-ing.
[00:23:58] <c74d> …wow, how did it know to put the picture of a mummified rat in the Thanksgiving category?
[00:24:07] <huon> date?
[00:24:44] <c74d> It's from a road trip made for US Thanksgiving, but I don't think it was actually on the holiday.
[00:25:00] <c74d> …Not that I know when that is exactly.
[00:25:21] * c74d asks Google.
[00:25:52] <c74d> Oh, it's from the day before US Thanksgiving in 2012.
[00:26:34] <c74d> …but it also correctly classified pictures from earlier in the same trip.

[00:30:18] <c74d> It's not all accurate, though… it thinks that some fellow tourist who was in a picture I took while touristing around in Switzerland in 2014 was also in another picture I took elsewhere on that trip, at a dinner in 2012, and at a family reunion in 2015, which I'm pretty sure they weren't.

[00:40:07] <c74d> Its Concerts catagory has, in addition to pictures of a concert hall… my pictures from a tour of the University of California, Berkeley; from a tour of Exogen Biotechnology; from Vancouver International Airport; and from two tours of TRIUMF, a particle physics laboratory.
[00:40:13] <lahwran> I'm considering buying this http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/sys/5017854102.html and cannibalizing the cpu, because the price of that whole compy is actually less than that of an i7 3770
[00:42:15] <c74d> If I search for “cats”, it shows my pictures of cats… but if I search for “rabbits”, it shows… a picture of my cat.
[00:42:27] <lahwran> what about if you search for catsnake
[00:42:47] <cmr> lahwran: I don't know the performance characeteritics of machine learning algorithms, but I suspect that if you're not also running the program on the CPU (which some programs can) it won't matter.
[00:43:24] <lahwran> as far as running the actual optimization code on the cpu, it'll make maybe 2% of a difference whether it runs on cpu or not, even with an i7
[00:43:38] <cmr> Right.
[00:43:38] <lahwran> but I can imagine that perhaps it needs the cpu for data shuffling or something
[00:43:53] <cmr> Somewhat, but it won't be important.

[04:37:57] <cmr> c74d: I'm a fan of cargo-nightly-bin and rust-nightly-bin from the AUR.

[04:41:56] <c74d> Recommendations forwarded, thanks.
[04:44:11] <c74d> Okay, the asker (now on this network as ‘nogbit’) doesn't want to use multirust because it has too many open issues on GitHub.

[13:55:02] <WindowsBunny> it's foreign to America

[13:56:23] <WindowsBunny> Tobba: Well it's their first attempt with a brand new technology, so who knows :D
[13:56:55] <Quxxy> WindowsBunny: I'm *really* hoping AMD can gain some serious ground
[13:56:56] <Tobba> well, it'd hopefully get them back on their feet, considering intel got a monopoly on the desktop/server CPU market and nvidia and intel are butt buddies
[13:57:06] <Quxxy> nVidia are a pack of *waves hands about in frustration* pinwheels
[13:57:07] <Tobba> it'll*
[13:57:16] <WindowsBunny> if leaked benchmarks are any indication, it'll be the fastest single GPU
[13:57:48] <WindowsBunny> I prefer AMD mostly out of principle and due to their somewhat more ethical and open behavior with regards to software and standards
[13:58:48] <Tobba> I hope they get back in the CPU market (and actually make decent chips this time)
[13:58:58] <WindowsBunny> Tobba: It all depends on Zen
[13:59:08] <Quxxy> *All* is Zen
[13:59:21] <Tobba> bulldozer was really just trying to squeeze benchmarks

[13:59:52] <Tobba> if its as good as they say it should actually get them back in the game
[13:59:56] <WindowsBunny> They claim 40% more IPC compared to the last gen
[14:01:48] <WindowsBunny> the 7850k has a single thread rating of 1578
[14:02:39] <Tobba> I'm not quite sure what that number is referring to
[14:02:40] <WindowsBunny> a i5-4670k from intel though is 2206
[14:02:49] <WindowsBunny> Tobba: passmark's benchmarks
[14:03:09] <Tobba> but 40% better IPC is probably gonna be good, even if its just in specialized situations
[14:03:26] <WindowsBunny> so a 40% better IPC would give it exactly the same single thread rating
[14:03:49] <WindowsBunny> although it has a higher frequency still
[14:03:51] <Tobba> assuming the code you're running has enough ILP
[14:04:20] <Tobba> AMD solution: more cores
[14:04:25] <Tobba> intel solution: more vector units
[14:05:16] <WindowsBunny> that said
[14:05:28] <WindowsBunny> AMD bulldozer's cores were very much real cores
[14:05:37] <WindowsBunny> a multi thread to single thread ratio of 3.55
[14:05:44] <WindowsBunny> while intel is only at 3.45
[14:05:58] <WindowsBunny> that is, for an i5 without hyper-threading
[14:06:01] <Tobba> was it bulldozer or piledriver that had shared decode units
[14:06:12] <Tobba> i.e half the cores were completely useless unless they were running the exact same code
[14:06:13] <WindowsBunny> I'm actually comparing steamroller :P
[14:06:17] <Tobba> i.e prime95
[14:07:44] <WindowsBunny> an i7 with hyper-threading, so 4 cores and 8 threads, only gets a concurrency ratio of 4.5
[14:07:50] <WindowsBunny> thats.... terrible
[14:08:18] <WindowsBunny> I wonder how good AMD's SMT will be
[14:09:10] <Tobba> I can't remember how hyperthreading works exactly
[14:09:35] <WindowsBunny> terribly :P
[14:09:38] <Tobba> but iirc it mostly helps when one core blocks on DRAM
[14:09:53] <Tobba> or when one is just waiting for the vector units and the other one is using the ALU
[14:09:59] <Tobba> so it might actually perform better *outside* of benchmarks
[14:11:22] <WindowsBunny> I just want to get the fastest Zen APU when it comes out
[14:11:51] <Tobba> I just want some tight competition back
[14:12:06] <Tobba> especially if it makes intel stop their stupid clock locking racket

[16:05:20] <Tiffany> mounting a webdav server, ogham?

[16:05:41] <ogham> yeah
[16:05:45] <Tiffany> it's absolutely, dreadfully slow
[16:05:51] <ogham> that it is :(
[16:06:00] <Tiffany> you take the 16 millisecond disk latency and push it out to >150 millisecond network roundtrip
[16:06:22] <ogham> I'm assuming that the rsync program is checking to see if each file matches, which it can usually do well via the rsync protocol, but can't via any other protocol
[16:06:24] <Tiffany> it does a lot more roundtrips than necessary, because applications write bits and pieces at a time, and there doesn't seem to be much in the way of caching
[16:06:35] <Tiffany> does rsync not do webdav natively?

[16:10:08] <Tiffany> also, if it's not webdav over TLS, it's probably not worth using over ftp

[16:15:07] <ogham> so I copied the same flags and options that I use for that on to this, and... snail's pace
[16:17:49] <Tiffany> is there a way to make rsync behave as a continuous sync program?
[16:17:57] <Tiffany> in the same vein as dropbox or bittorrent sync

[18:04:21] <Astrum|Lap> Tobba: uhhh... no/
[18:04:35] <Tiffany> quxxy: what about all the feels about not having games and stuff support operating systems other than windows?
[18:04:40] <cmr> Astrum|Lap: sure you can, that's the central hypothesis of automated theorem proving.
[18:04:48] <Quxxy> Tiffany: I never said I was being reasonable :D
[18:05:01] <cmr> If you're working in a well-founded proof system, it should be straightforward to verify a proof.

[18:05:11] <Quxxy> Tiffany: *NOTHING*; that's the point :D

[18:05:25] <Astrum|Lap> cmr: I'm not too into those things
[18:05:35] <Astrum|Lap> however, they have to be ludicrously detailed from what I remember

[18:05:41] <dfockler> Are games supported on Windows because of DX?
[18:05:43] <Tiffany> I've written code against the windows API and it's not particularly enjoyable
[18:05:44] <Tobba> Astrum|Lap: it depends
[18:06:02] <Tiffany> uh huh
[18:06:03] <dfockler> or I guess because of marketshare as well
[18:06:24] <ytain> dfockler most because of the marketshare and marketing from MS
[18:06:41] <Quxxy> I was actually going to add a path for *nix, but then I noticed that Cargo is doing it wrong on Windows, so meh, stuff 'em :P
[18:06:47] <Tiffany> there's a number of reasons, I think
[18:07:11] <Tiffany> windows has a majority market share, existing codebases are already windows-only, a large section of the game industry has little experience with OSes other than windows
[18:07:24] <dfockler> Do you think Valve has a clout to change that?
[18:07:29] <Tiffany> microsoft tries to market direct X as being somehow better than opengl, and a lot of studios are unwilling to build two backends
[18:07:35] <Tiffany> valve is doing a pretty good job at it
[18:07:41] <dfockler> launching their own platform
[18:07:46] <Tiffany> there's over a thousand games on steam which support linux now
[18:07:50] <Tiffany> all of the major engines do
[18:07:58] <Astrum|Lap> I mean take a look at the Poincare Conjecture proof by Perelman
[18:08:00] <Tiffany> iirc, that's about a fourth of all of steam
[18:09:04] <dfockler> Can't OpenGL run on all platforms?
[18:09:15] <fkaa> OpenGL is just a standard
[18:09:21] <cmr> Only ones which have a driver for it.
[18:09:48] <dfockler> ahh so it's really up to the gfx card makers to implement support?
[18:09:52] <fkaa> yeah
[18:09:55] <Astrum|Lap> or the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem
[18:09:57] <WindowsBunny> bah
[18:09:59] <cmr> Not on the Xbox, for example, or the Playstation.
[18:10:01] <WindowsBunny> I may have to use psapi

[18:12:28] <cmr> stil gnm and gnmx.
[18:12:34] <ytain> there's also some kind of DX translation layer to OpenGL, that was made available by Valve

[18:16:22] <Tiffany> dfockler: all PC graphics vendors ship GL drivers, all mobile graphics vendors ship GL ES drivers, and the consoles occasionally support GL, but mainly the consoles are to be interfaced through their low level APIs
[18:16:25] <Tobba> that's some 10/10 programming right there
[18:16:49] <Tiffany> the PS4 has GL support, according to what I heard before it was released
[18:17:00] <Tiffany> I think it's mainly for ease of porting
[18:17:01] <dfockler> Tiffany: so basically it comes down to marketing and developer experience with the APIs?
[18:17:12] <Tiffany> I suppose so
[18:17:20] <fkaa> and politics
[18:17:32] <Tiffany> directX doesn't really have anything on opengl, they're feature parity with each other
[18:17:34] <fkaa> dx could be crossplatform right?
[18:17:35] <ytain> and licensing of a game engine like unity or crysis engine or unreal engine
[18:17:40] <Tiffany> it was a bit different in the early 2000s, and a lot of those attitudes linger today
[18:17:45] <dfockler> Why don't we have more games on Linux! \o/
[18:17:50] <fkaa> or is it too intertwined with the rest of the windows api
[18:17:57] <Tiffany> fkaa: it's COM-based, but afaik that's about it
[18:18:09] <Tiffany> there was an implementation of it built as part of gallium3D
[18:18:40] <Tiffany> dfockler: I think we're going to have a big shakeup in november when valve finally releases the steambox
[18:18:50] <fkaa> looking forward to that :=
[18:19:01] <Tiffany> I expect launch titles
[18:20:20] <dfockler> will we have a MS vs Valve VR battle after that?
[18:20:53] <ytain> there's also Nvidia Shield Android TV console that supports OpenGL 4.5 and OpenGL ES 3.1
[18:21:05] <fkaa> android + tv + console?
[18:21:19] <WindowsBunny> fkaa: I believe wine has a dx implementation
[18:21:21] <Tiffany> GL 4.5? on android?
[18:21:25] <cmr> Tiffany: yep.
[18:21:28] <Tiffany> windowsbunny: it does
[18:21:30] <cmr> They have their own hardware and driver.
[18:21:31] <Tiffany> it maps to GL
[18:21:37] <Tiffany> I mentioned gallium3D instead
[18:21:37] <WindowsBunny> fkaa: Really it's just a matter of nobody putting in the effort except Microsoft

[18:21:40] <cmr> Mesa also has one.

[18:22:08] <Tiffany> yeah, probably the dreamcast, not the saturn

[18:22:20] <fkaa> WindowsBunny: re: cross platform dx?
[18:22:29] <fmtq> Why the fuck would you outsource this
[18:22:36] <Tiffany> all versions of the xbox and also the dreamcast support directX

[18:22:50] <Tiffany> I think the PS4 is supposed to have a DX implementation too
[18:22:59] <fkaa> microsoft control the dx spec as well, while opengl is "open"

[18:23:56] <fmtq> It is similar to using http for random numbers
[18:24:04] <fmtq> It's called being a dumb.

[19:48:40] <ogham> I've seen that term loads but never really knew what it means
[19:48:48] <ogham> because I was too busy smiling at the mental image it produces
[19:48:57] <edunham> http://gitolite.com/detached-head.html has lots of information on it
[19:49:14] <edunham> basically you need to figure out what branch you wish to work on, and then check it out (creating it with -b if necessary)
[19:49:41] <zofrex> although it might also be worth going back over what you did to get it in this state
[19:50:21] <ogham> I checked out a github pull request locally
[19:50:31] <ogham> (and didn't give it a name)
[19:50:41] <zofrex> that'd do it
[19:52:59] <edunham> ah. you can add the PR author's fork of the repo as a remote and then check out the branch that they pr'd from, or just make your own branch with their changes
[19:53:14] *** Quits: det (chris@moz-6q2one.lv.cox.net) (Connection closed)
[19:54:00] <ogham> I have 'fetch = +refs/pull/*/head:refs/remotes/github/pr/*' in the gitconfig, but it's been one of those copy-and-paste things that I just got from somewhere on the internet that I don't really know what it does
[19:54:34] <edunham> are you checking it out just to test and examine, or are you going to want to push or propose changes to it later?
[19:54:44] <ogham> former
[19:55:09] <edunham> ok then the easiest way out of detached head right now for you will be `git checkout -b test-pr-1234`
[19:55:34] <edunham> this gives you your own branch by that name for HEAD to point to
[19:55:39] <ogham> I just stayed in detached head, tested, then checked master back out
[19:55:50] <edunham> yep that totally works too
[19:56:09] <edunham> iirc `git log` mightn't work right in detached head
[19:56:44] <ogham> then I merged via the web interface and git pulled it right back. *that* sounds like there's a better way to do things
[19:57:08] <ogham> git log worked
[19:57:19] <edunham> oh ok
[19:57:47] <edunham> so yeah, the workflow you probably want here is `git remote add username <url of their fork of the repo>`
[19:58:44] <edunham> then `git checkout username/<branchname from which they created the pr>` (i think)
[19:59:03] <edunham> then examine stuff, then if you wanna merge, checkout master and then `git merge branchname`
[19:59:09] <edunham> then push to master
[19:59:21] <edunham> and if github's smart, it'll realize you merged the pr's changes
[19:59:26] <edunham> i've never personally tried that though
[19:59:43] <ogham> cool
[20:00:00] <ogham> I imagine that's the workflow they used before pull requests came along and made me lazy

[20:54:23] <fmtq> it is far too late.
[20:54:37] <zofrex> yeah that seems to have solved it for a lot of people in that thread
[20:54:38] <fmtq> XMPPwocky: I suspect it is their handling for whether key combinations should be hijackable in JS 
[20:54:42] <fmtq> and somehow they are just fucknig it up
[20:54:48] <XMPPwocky> now i can finally find the "homu queue" instead of the "omu queue"
[20:55:06] <zofrex> it's really really easy to spot a modifier key going down and then miss it coming up
[20:55:14] <zofrex> if e.g. the user depresses it, alt tabs, and then releases
[20:55:30] <XMPPwocky> i've had it before, too
[20:55:38] <XMPPwocky> but then mashing on an external keyboard fixed it

[21:19:23] <dfockler> #¡ = hebang
[21:19:27] <fmtq> The unit is descended from the Roman libra (hence the abbreviation "lb"); the name pound is a Germanic adaptation of the Latin phrase libra pondo, "a pound by weight".[3]

[21:23:03] <Tiffany> it's actually the watt-hour
[21:23:09] <FreeFull> An inch in Polish is cal
[21:23:16] <Tiffany> it's literally 3600 joules
[21:23:19] <Tiffany> it has no reason to exist
[21:23:22] <Tiffany> it's round about
[21:23:33] <dfockler> it's not measuring time?
[21:23:35] <FreeFull> watt-second
[21:23:56] <zofrex> my favourite US/GB difference is that Americans 1-index floors and Brits 0-index them
[21:24:01] <Tiffany> actually no
[21:24:04] <Tiffany> it's not watt-hour
[21:24:07] <Tiffany> it's warr-hours per year
[21:24:10] <Tiffany> watt*
[21:24:23] <fmtq> zofrex: that's not entirely accurate
[21:24:30] <fmtq> in the sense that in the UK it's fucking random.
[21:24:32] <Tiffany> like
[21:24:33] <fmtq> same as Australia.
[21:24:41] <fmtq> some building have ground floor as 0 
[21:24:45] <fmtq> and -1 for the one below
[21:24:47] <FreeFull> Tiffany: "why not just use watts"?
[21:24:51] <Tiffany> exactly
[21:24:52] <zofrex> eh it's pretty much the rule that first floor = not the ground floor, in the UK
[21:25:05] <fmtq> I doubt this is true
[21:25:10] <fmtq> enter more buildings and have seizures
[21:25:16] <fmtq> G 2 3 4 5
[21:25:17] <Tiffany> KWh/year is equal to 0.11407955 watts
[21:25:19] <fmtq> G 1 2 3 4 
[21:25:25] <pingveno> I've seen basements in the US numbered as 0.
[21:25:29] <fmtq> I was in a building that did this 
[21:25:36] <fmtq> P2 P3 G 1 
[21:25:39] <fmtq> literally in that order.
[21:25:48] <zofrex> well.. I confess I do not closely examine the floor markings in ever building, but when people are speaking to each other, 1st floor unambiguously refers to the floor above the ground floor
[21:25:51] <Tiffany> it's been a long time since I've been in a building with a basement
[21:25:54] <dfockler> parking 2, parking 3
[21:26:00] <dfockler> ground, 1st floor
[21:26:03] <zofrex> fmtq: ah well shopping centres with car parks underneath don't count, they're weird
[21:26:04] <fmtq> yes.
[21:26:07] <fmtq> no parking 1.
[21:26:11] <fmtq> and the 2 and 3 are backwards.
[21:26:18] <dfockler> didn't dig deep enough lol
[21:26:20] <Havvy> So a tenth of a watt is approximately equal to 1 KWh per year. That's useful.
[21:26:31] <fmtq> electricity is boring
[21:26:43] <cmr> floor numbering is even more so.
[21:26:45] <Tiffany> the worst part about KWh/year is not that it's so fucked up and roundabout, but that it's used /everywhere/ in electricity
[21:27:10] <Tiffany> anyone can make a roundabout unit, but getting everyone to use it to describe things using it...
[21:27:25] <dfockler> takes an industry
[21:27:49] <Havvy> We're programmers. Almost everything we care about could be considered boring.

[21:30:22] <pingveno> The one downside of listening to music at work: I want to start singing along.
[21:30:34] <Tiffany> freefull: the decomposition of KWh/year into base units
[21:30:36] <fmtq> okay, I'm not getting into this music so much unfortunately

[21:37:43] <fmtq> and trip hop.
