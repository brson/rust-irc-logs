[02:15:53] <Elaine> can't use the stable build
[02:16:00] <ufdraco> because I've failed to build 1.0.0 with 1.0.0, 1.1.0 with 1.1.0, or 1.1.0 with 1.0.0

[02:16:31] <ufdraco> huh?
[02:17:13] <ufdraco> there's a difference between stable 1.0.0 and nightly 1.0.0?
[02:17:26] <Elaine> yes, with stable you can't use unstable #[feature]'s
[02:17:52] <ufdraco> and rustc still requires unstable #[feature]'s, I take it
[02:17:56] <Elaine> right
[02:18:45] <ufdraco> ok, that's not what I expected, but I'm no longer worried I'm not building things correctly
[02:19:13] <ufdraco> so, is there some --configure flag I should be using to build a rustc capable of of building itself?
[02:19:20] <ufdraco> s/--//
[02:20:07] <aatch> ufdraco, wait, what? When you build rustc from source, it *does* build itself.
[02:20:22] <ufdraco> from a snapshot, yes. and that works
[02:20:57] <ufdraco> when I take the result of that build and build the same source again, with --enable-local-rust, the build fails pretty early on

[02:39:24] <Gankro> Stable 1.1.0 has back ports from 1.2.0 nightly

[02:47:08] <ufdraco> obviously this is just a difference of expectations, but as a user, when you say that the language is stable and self-hosting, I interpret that to mean "the compiler can be built with the stable version of the language" ... & that that's something you're regularly testing.
[02:48:33] <ufdraco> my reading of Debian/Fedora packaging standards is that one should be able to stop bootstrapping after the first successful build, so not being able to do that is going to hurt being picked up by those distros
[02:48:55] <ufdraco> if that's not a goal yet, that's fine, but FYI

[04:23:34] <reem> Gankro: am looking at doing Box<[T]>: Clone with RawVec, I see from_box and into_box, but I don’t see any utilities for actually doing the clones
[04:23:47] <reem> my new approach will still need a custom type to catch panics, right?
[04:24:02] <Gankro> reem: Oh yes, you still need that. The allocation nonsense will be handled, though
[04:24:18] <Gankro> Which is imho the nasty part
[04:24:32] <reem> ya, it’s still cleaner
[04:28:30] <gus> In case ufdraco has a way to read the archives of this channel: you can't rebuild stage0 with the same rustc.  The breaking-change process assumes #[cfg(stage0)] is before the most recent change, and #[not(cfg(stage0))] is after that.
[04:29:08] <gus> .. so the only way to rebuild the same rustc with itself is to jump straight into the build process at stage1/stage2 somewhere.
[04:30:09] <gus> (and of course you also need to build with a "dev" rustc to have access to the "unstable" features, as pointed out above)
[04:35:29] <reem> Gankro: it would be neat to have a utility for making “canary” structs
[04:35:46] <Gankro> reem: Yes, I proposed a finally block
[04:35:47] <reem> though I think each case may just be too specific
[04:36:00] <reem> hmm, how would it work?
[04:36:16] <Gankro> reem: like finally in every language?
[04:36:38] <reem> right I just mean implementation wise
[04:36:48] <Gankro> Hmm, I suppose in your case it won't work
[04:36:58] <Gankro> Since you don't want to do the thing if you don't panic
[04:37:22] *** Parts: Feyn (aram@moz-tj1.ere.115.42.IP) ("Leaving")
[04:37:26] <reem> unfortunately you can’t just use a struct which holds a closure
[04:37:35] <reem> since ownership
[04:37:47] <Gankro> reem: Yeah that's the problem. That's why I figured you needed a first-class lang thing
[04:38:04] <Gankro> I haven't thought about it in a long time though, so it's out of cache
[04:38:06] <reem> a finally block that checks thread::panicking would do it maybe
[04:38:18] <reem> the thing is sometimes you need to know precisely when the panic happened
[04:38:46] <Gankro> reem: not necessarily, you just need to have appropriate state on the stack for the finally block to inspect
[04:39:16] <reem> there are also strange interactions since a lot of types assume that they won’t be accessed after a panic has occurred involving them
[04:39:34] <reem> so what would you be allowed to inspect?
[04:40:25] * reem needs to do rebuild LLVM :(
[04:42:16] <reem> actually maybe that last point doesn’t matter
[04:42:32] <reem> since it could just be the same as a Drop impl

[11:03:42] <eddyb> compile-fail didn't run last night because of it. I forgot to run stage2
[11:03:45] <doener> eddyb: looks like you'd just need to remove the check from try_intrinsic()
[11:03:51] <eddyb> wat
[11:04:09] <doener> eddyb: unless you build with LTO. the run() function for that marks everything as nounwind
[11:04:11] <eddyb> doener: but doesn't LLVM prune them? or do we remove them?
[11:04:49] <doener> with -Zno-landing-pads, we simply don't emit them, plus the nounwind thing for lto
[11:05:16] <doener> if the landing pad for try is marked correctly, LLVM should keep that even if empty

[21:25:32] <jroesch> steveklabnik: are you coming to SF today as well?
[21:26:32] <steveklabnik> tomorrow
[21:26:40] <steveklabnik> i have a conference during the week
[21:27:39] <jroesch> steveklabnik: cool, just wanted to talk to you about documenting type macros and default type parameters, no rush
[21:29:07] <steveklabnik> :)

[21:46:14] <doener> Zoxc: LLVM would "happen" to pass it in two registers if you pass the fat pointer as { i8*, i64 } (first class aggregate, not a pointer to it!), but using FCAs is generally not a great idea, and we cannot add attributes like nonnull to the contained pointers. Passing the pointers individually allows that
[21:46:58] <zwarich> doener: first-class aggregates are sadly second-class in LLVM
[21:47:04] <zwarich> sunfish: sorry bro ^
[21:47:21] <doener> Zoxc: also, SROA usually wants to split the aggregate into its scalar components, which is easier this way
[21:48:52] <sunfish> zwarich: et tu, brute

[22:02:31] <doener> Zoxc: what am I looking for?
[22:03:38] <Zoxc> Why are there push/pop instructions?
[22:03:39] <Elainemo> yeah, I'm not sure what you mean by "wrong"
[22:04:01] <doener> Zoxc: because the call to fail needs stack space
[22:04:35] <Zoxc> why does that need stack space?
[22:05:35] <doener> the return address is pushed on the stack which needs 8 bytes, and the 8 byte push ensures that the stack is 16 byte aligned (ABI / data-layout)
[22:07:31] <Zoxc> Hm.. can I get LLVM to not align it?
[22:08:00] <Elainemo> that seems like an awfully bad idea. why?
[22:08:32] <doener> Zoxc: change the data layout. http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#data-layout
[22:08:57] <Zoxc> The call is in a cold code, but the alignment is in the hot part
[22:08:57] <doener> Zoxc: you can try what happens if you change the datalayout line in nicer.ll to say S64 instead of S128 and then pass that through llc
[22:09:13] <Zoxc> That's not an option

[22:13:10] <Zoxc> coldcc should probably not require alignment
[22:13:12] <Elainemo> Zoxc: what happens if you add a call @llvm.expect.i1(i1 %tmp2, i1 1).
[22:13:22] * Zoxc tries that
