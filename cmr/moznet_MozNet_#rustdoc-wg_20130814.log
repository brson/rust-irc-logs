[00:19:24] <cmr> dbaupp: ughhhh I acidentally double-wrote to the history file
[00:20:14] <cmr> Alrighty, fixed.
[00:24:45] <cmr> dbaupp: so the history file is completely fixed, and everything listed in it has had a time bench done. Go wild
[00:24:58] <cmr> 322 benches!
[00:25:08] <cmr> out of 323, heh
[00:25:12] <cmr> almost done anyway

[05:50:55] <dbaupp> cmr: awesome! I'll get that going again <3
[07:34:57] <dbaupp> hm, it appears that the web interface has regressed? I no longer see traits or impls, and the text seems to have dropped it's spaces (e.g. http://seld.be/rustdoc/std/f64/fn.from_str_radix.html) :(
[08:10:14] <cmr> dbaupp: not a regression, you're just in an old section of the docs
[08:10:26] <cmr> dbaupp: everything is under seld.be/rustdoc/master now
[08:11:05] <dbaupp> cmr: oooh, magically fixed :)
[11:03:43] <bjz> Why aren't trait impls shown? Just haven't got around to it yet?
[11:03:58] <bjz> eg: http://seld.be/rustdoc/master/std/float/index.html
[11:04:20] <bjz> or: http://seld.be/rustdoc/master/std/i64/generated/index.html
[11:10:41] <dbaupp> bjz: that's only for built-in types
[11:11:03] <bjz> Often the impls have documentation with them as well
[11:11:14] <dbaupp> e.g. http://seld.be/rustdoc/master/std/vec/struct.ChunkIter.html
[11:12:41] <dbaupp> (it's because the built-in types don't have a declaration to attach documentation to)
[11:14:39] <bjz> have you thought of keeping the impls withing the modules where they are defined, and just having links from the types and traits?
[11:15:09] * dbaupp hasn't thought about anything
[11:15:46] <dbaupp> but the module in which they are defined isn't the important information
[11:15:55] <bjz> true
[11:16:01] <dbaupp> it's much more relevant associated with the trait and with the type
[11:16:14] <bjz> yeah, that's a good point
[11:16:26] <dbaupp> the former happens for all types (e.g. http://seld.be/rustdoc/master/std/num/trait.Algebraic.html), the latter only for non-built-in types
[11:16:34] <bjz> also, whould it be possible to have stubs right with the doc comment? like `fn clone(&self) -> ChunkIter<'self, T>` would have this right below: `Returns a copy of the value. The contents of owned pointers are...`
[11:17:08] <bjz> and have `impl<'self, T: std::clone::Clone> of std::clone::Clone for ChunkIter<'self, T>` at the beginning of the section
[11:17:32] <bjz> it's difficult having them divided up, you have to keep changing your focis
[11:17:36] <bjz> *focus
[11:17:36] <dbaupp> I believe there's a bug open about copying the documentation from the trait methods to undocumented ones ("default documentation"), is this what you mean?
[11:17:50] <bjz> http://seld.be/rustdoc/master/std/vec/struct.ChunkIter.html
[11:18:12] <bjz> see how the stub isn't with the doc comment?
[11:18:18] <dbaupp> right
[11:18:38] <dbaupp> the best way to get it to work is to collaborate with Seldaek :)
[11:18:55] <bjz> it's more noticble with the RandomAccessIterator impl
[11:19:02] <dbaupp> yup, I see it now
[11:19:37] * bjz is interested to see what haskell does
[11:20:06] <dbaupp> http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/base/latest/doc/html/Prelude.html#t:Num
[11:20:11] <dbaupp> http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/base/latest/doc/html/Prelude.html#t:Double
[11:20:20] <dbaupp> it just lists the instances, not the individual methods
[11:20:54] <bjz> yeah
[11:20:58] <bjz> interesting
[11:23:47] <bjz> It's just a shame to see that a heap of the numeric docs have been lost
[11:24:39] <dbaupp> fix it!
[11:24:47] <dbaupp> talk is cheap, etc etc ;)

[12:23:22] <bjz_> Seldaek: no worries!
[12:25:07] <bjz_> dbaupp: unfortunately I'm deep in xml land atm :(
[12:25:53] * dbaupp ties a rope around bjz to haul him back out if he gets trapped
[12:26:17] * bjz_ is drowning in tags
[12:26:25] <bjz_> *blaaagh*
[12:33:45] <Seldaek> bjz_: xml.. might you be writing java too?
[12:34:18] <bjz_> Seldaek: no, parsing the OpenGL registry
[12:34:53] <bjz_> it's a thousand times better than the old .spec files, but it's still a pain
[12:34:59] <Seldaek> I'll just assume I am glad I don't know what that is :p
