[08:12:23] <bvssvni> what I was saying
[08:12:27] <bollu> bvssvni: so, how does it relate to CG?
[08:12:36] <bvssvni> there is a spherical function associated with each vertex
[08:12:38] <bvssvni> just like normals
[08:12:49] <bvssvni> and then this is interpolated across the surface
[08:12:57] <bvssvni> to calculate the light
[08:13:11] <bvssvni> so it's a normal on steroids
[08:13:25] <bollu> hm, spherical function = function in spherical coordinates or spherical harmonic function?
[08:13:33] <bvssvni> yes
[08:13:42] <bvssvni> spherical harmonic function I think
[08:14:22] <bvssvni> if you have a complex number c, then c*c or cc* gives you the norm squares
[08:14:24] <bvssvni> *squared
[08:14:39] <bvssvni> this is the length of the complex number as a vector
[08:14:48] <bvssvni> the same is for quaternions etc
[08:15:09] <bvssvni> so I think the mathematics is similar to this
[08:15:29] *** Joins: bjz (bjz@B398BE78.F804C29E.D35A31DF.IP)
[08:15:40] <bollu> bvssvni: you get the length by expressing a complex number a +ib as r* e^i(theta) right? so r becomes the length
[08:15:50] <bvssvni> yes
[08:16:01] <bvssvni> it's a complex number in exponential form
[08:16:20] <bvssvni> quaternions also got an exponential form
[08:16:30] <bvssvni> and Euler equation like complex numbers
[08:16:42] <bvssvni> it's a bit different though
[08:18:34] <bollu> sorry, was afk
[08:18:40] <bvssvni> me too :)
[08:18:55] <bollu> bvssvni: what's the exponential form of quaternions? I've __never__ seen that
[08:18:55] <bvssvni> afk I mean
[08:19:49] <bollu> and also, do you understand quaternions intuitively? I don't at all. I've seen the math, accepted that it works and moved on >_<
[08:20:16] <bvssvni> I am trying to find it
[08:20:44] <bvssvni> cos(angle/2) scalar + i sin(angle/2) vec
[08:21:02] <bvssvni> it is common to split quaternions into a scalar and vector
[08:21:16] <bvssvni> x y z = vector, w = scalar
[08:21:36] <bollu> bvssvni: yeah, but that's not exponential
[08:21:39] <bvssvni> I don't understand them intuitively
[08:21:47] <bvssvni> it's the right side of the equation
[08:21:51] <bollu> bvssvni: that's the representation you use to derive quaternion multiplication
[08:22:03] <bollu> like, how q1 * q2 = rotate q2 by q1
[08:22:22] <bollu> bvssvni: I'd love to see the expo form
[08:22:37] <bollu> bvssvni: I think you'd need some more wacky constants like "e" though :)
[08:26:33] <bvssvni> I haven't noted it down either (aargghh!)
[08:28:16] <bvssvni> ok let me try from memory
[08:28:23] <bollu> bvssvni: this helps? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion#Exponential.2C_logarithm.2C_and_power
[08:28:57] <bvssvni> r*e^(w+i*x+j*y+k*z)
[08:29:04] <bollu> hm, but that feels wrong intuitively
[08:29:28] <bollu> like, we have no rule for e^j (even though j behaves like i as in j^2 = -1)
[08:29:40] <bvssvni> ok
[08:29:43] <bollu> I'm not sure. it /seems/ right but also somewhat wrong
[08:29:49] <bollu> idk :) I'm not expert >_<
[08:29:50] <bvssvni> r*e^(angle*i)
[08:29:54] <bvssvni> that's complex right?
[08:30:10] <bollu> bvssvni: yeah
[08:30:34] <bvssvni> should there be 3 angles?
[08:30:45] <bollu> no, I get that r * e^(angle * i + angle * j + angle * k) makes sense, but idk. bvssvni: yes
[08:30:52] <bollu> yeah, 3 angles for 3 dimensions
[08:31:06] <bollu> the fourth one is for reference to prevent gimbal lock <- 
[08:31:13] <bvssvni> r*e^(alpha*i+beta*j+theta*k)
[08:31:15] <bollu> my understanding of quaternions anyway
[08:31:21] <bollu> yep, that works
[08:31:27] <bollu> by it feels wrong :)
[08:31:46] <bvssvni> ah
[08:31:51] <bvssvni> it's rotation by axis
[08:32:01] <bollu> so if I multiply 2 quaternions, that will require to expand it
[08:32:06] <bollu> yeah, it checks out I think
[08:32:38] <bollu> cause ij will become -k
[08:32:43] <bvssvni> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternions_and_spatial_rotation
[08:32:45] <bvssvni> found it
[08:32:55] <bollu> so yeah, you should get back the same formula as the matrix multiplication
[08:32:58] <bollu> nice!
[08:34:02] <bvssvni> perhaps there is a way to work with complex numbers and then derive the equivalent for quaternions
[08:34:07] <bollu> I learnt quaternions from here I think (like, finally somewhat understood) <- http://twistedoakstudios.com/blog/Post144_quaternions-part-1
[08:34:25] <bollu> bvssvni: the e^i theta thing is derived by taking the taylor series
[08:34:32] <bollu> so since i, j, k all square to -1
[08:34:38] <bollu> the derivation should be identical
[08:35:06] <bvssvni> if you look down the axis of rotation
[08:35:12] <bvssvni> it should be like complex numbers
[08:35:18] <bvssvni> with angle around that axis
[08:36:02] <bvssvni> but I think it is encoded differently
[08:36:24] <bollu> bvssvni: not quite, you need to look down one axis, and /restrict/ the other axis to look like a complex number
[08:36:38] <bollu> otherwise it's some weird cylindrical coordinate system I think
[08:37:02] <bollu> cause I'm looking down the "axis" of the cylinder, but I can still move about __two__ axes
[08:37:15] <bollu> but complex numbers only have one degree of rotational freedon
[08:37:34] <bollu> the "quaternion down the axis" has /two/ degrees of rotational freedon
[08:37:36] <bollu> I think
[08:37:58] <bvssvni> one can use something called ...
[08:38:01] <bvssvni> what was it
[08:38:13] <bvssvni> there is a way to construct quaternion algebra
[08:38:57] <bollu> bvssvni: no idea :(
[08:39:07] <bvssvni> one uses e_x, e_y etc.
[08:39:29] <bvssvni> and then one shows that i, j, k, does not correspond to axis, but e_x*e_y etc
[08:40:06] <bvssvni> ah
[08:40:09] <bvssvni> Clifford algebra
[08:41:08] <bollu> bvssvni: will read. doubt I will understand
[08:41:40] <bvssvni> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_algebra#Quaternions
[08:41:57] <bvssvni> it isn't required to understand it
[08:41:59] <bjz> geometric algebra is pretty interesting... I didn't really undestand it all that much though
[08:42:14] <bvssvni> it's weird, but beautiful
[08:42:20] <bjz> it generalises lots of the linear algebra stuff
[08:42:34] <bollu> bjz: "linear" algebra = normal algebra?
[08:43:10] <bvssvni> it's isomorphic to Levi-Civita symbols on Einstein notation
[08:43:31] <bjz> http://geometricalgebra.net/
[08:43:56] <bollu>  Geometric Algebra For Computer Science, An Object Oriented Approach to Geometry <- epic title
[08:43:58] <bvssvni> oh nice
[08:44:07] <bjz> :D
[08:44:59] <bjz> the issue with it is that although it fits together really nicely, the data structures are more wasteful
[08:45:06] <bollu> okay, you guys are making me like math even more!
[08:45:17] <bjz> compared to linear algebra
[08:45:35] <bjz> yeah <3 maths!
[08:46:51] <bollu> bjz: is modulo arithmetic a field or a ring?
[08:46:54] <bollu> or neither?
[08:47:55] <bvssvni> it sounds like an extra property
[08:48:13] <bollu> bvssvni: an extra property of algebra?
[08:48:36] <bvssvni> with modulo I think it means like circles?
[08:48:44] <bvssvni> or a torus
[08:49:03] <bvssvni> it maps values outside the range back to itself
[08:49:16] <bollu> bvssvni: yep, n % k
[08:49:36] <bjz> clock arithmetic is more common example
[08:50:03] <bollu> random question: do you guys know reimann geometry?
[08:50:10] <bollu> I wanted to learn but it has so many terms
[08:50:17] <bvssvni> no
[08:50:26] <bvssvni> I have read, but I haven't mastered it
[08:50:41] <bollu> hmm. 
[08:51:09] <bvssvni> I know Einstein used Riemann geometry to derive general relativity
[08:52:16] <bollu> bvssvni: yep
[08:52:29] <bvssvni> it's amazing this was done so many years ago
[08:52:29] <bollu> bvssvni: and also ricci calculus (I have zero idea what that is, I just know the name)
[08:52:37] <bvssvni> yeah
[08:52:54] <bollu> bvssvni: yeah, I know right. I don't even understand tensors properly and they're using /manifolds/
[08:53:03] <bollu> it makes me feel kind of sad actuallt
[08:53:10] <bollu> like, happy-sad?
[08:53:19] <bvssvni> manifolds is another name for something common
[08:53:22] <bollu> I don't know, we're achieved so much but I know so little of it
[08:53:23] <bvssvni> shapes?
[08:53:49] <bollu> bvssvni: no, not really I think. they have more (interesting) properties. Like, manifolds are corellated to vector calculu
[08:53:54] <bollu> calclus*
[08:54:10] <bollu> we've learnt a little bit during electricity and magnetism
[08:54:48] <bollu> like, relationship between potentinal energy and force, and deriving gauss' law from cooloumb's law and stuff
[08:54:50] <bollu> I don't know much
[08:55:08] <bvssvni> once I tried to derive inverse square law for a cube
[08:55:48] <bollu> bvssvni: hm I think you'd need a different metric for direction in that case
[08:55:54] <bollu> distance, not direction
[08:56:00] <bollu> maybe manhattan distance would work
[08:56:04] <bollu> idk
[08:56:27] <bvssvni> if you can solve it, you can calculate gravity attraction to any arbitrary shape
[08:56:37] <bvssvni> by splitting it into cubes
[08:56:52] <bollu> bvssvni: like, a triple integral?
[08:56:58] <bvssvni> yeah
[08:57:10] <bollu> hmm, we can already do that for most shapes right?
[08:57:27] <bvssvni> I tried using wolframalpha, but it didn't worked for the last part
[08:57:38] <bvssvni> then I guessed the equation and tested it in Unity 3D
[08:57:44] <bvssvni> and it didn't worked
[08:57:49] <bollu> like, you can calculate electric fields for many shapes - I assume gravity would be the same. 
[08:58:01] <bvssvni> it's the same form for equation
[08:58:24] <bollu> yeah, Gm1m2/r^2
[08:58:37] <bvssvni> the cool thing, if you have an equation ...
[08:58:45] <bollu> is conceptually equivalent to 1/4pie0 * q1q1/r^2
[08:58:49] <bvssvni> you can put dual numbers into it and solve for the dual part
[08:58:57] <bvssvni> and get the dynamic behavior
[08:59:04] <bollu> bvssvni: you can do the same with complex numbers ;)
[08:59:12] <bollu> bvssvni: give me an example
[08:59:13] <bvssvni> how?
[08:59:49] <bvssvni> f(x+dot x %epsilon) = f(x) + dot x f'(x) %epsilon
[08:59:58] <bvssvni> that's for one variable
[09:00:35] <bollu> bvssvni: "dot x" ? 
[09:00:43] <bvssvni> if you have multiple variable, you can solve partial differentials by selecting one input and replacing it with a dual number
[09:00:52] <bvssvni> 'dot x' is the dual part
[09:01:01] <bvssvni> 2 + 1 %epsilon
[09:01:05] <bvssvni> that is a number 2
[09:01:10] <bvssvni> with 1 infinitesimal
[09:01:14] <bollu> ah
[09:01:17] <bvssvni> like "pointing up"
[09:01:37] <bvssvni> since (0.000000... 1) ^2 = 0
[09:01:50] <bvssvni> (assumption)
[09:01:59] <bvssvni> you can have ^3 = 0 etc.
[09:02:04] <bvssvni> which is called nilpotents
[09:02:14] <bvssvni> and the math blows ups
[09:02:19] <bollu> bvssvni: is it in any way related to a nilpotent matrix?
[09:02:36] <bvssvni> probably
[09:02:48] <bvssvni> dual matrices is a thing
[09:03:03] <bvssvni> basically every real number can be replaced with a nilpotent
[09:03:10] <bvssvni> and if you got enough time
[09:03:28] <bvssvni> you can derive the equation for the dual/nilpotent parts
[09:03:47] <bollu> hmm.
[09:03:53] <bvssvni> bit it only behaves like derivative for dual
[09:04:20] <bvssvni> nilpotents is an isomorphic representation to derivatives
[09:04:26] <bvssvni> but it is encoding the information differently
[09:04:55] <bvssvni> but for dual numbers, the derivative and the second part is mostly the same
[09:05:04] <bollu> bvssvni: information overload :)
[09:05:08] <bvssvni> yeah
[09:05:29] <bollu> bvssvni: I'll try and derive it on my own by using the relation epsilon squared = 0
[09:05:39] <bollu> I'll plug it to the taylor series and see what pops out
[09:05:49] <bollu> oh, wait, now your statement makes sense
[09:06:01] <bollu> cause e^(n>=2) = 0
[09:06:12] <bvssvni> yes
[09:06:12] <bollu> so the taylor series stops at e^1
[09:06:16] <bollu> hmm
[09:06:19] <bollu> that's nuts
[09:06:34] <bvssvni> and you get f(x)+dot x f'(x) %eps
[09:06:40] <bollu> yeah
[09:06:54] <bollu> I've learnt it as dx
[09:06:59] <bollu> not "dot x"
[09:07:05] <bollu> like, "delta x"
[09:07:22] <bollu> either way,same thing
[09:07:34] <bvssvni> or x_0 %eps^0 and x_1 %eps^1
[09:07:51] <bvssvni> %eps^0 = 1
[09:07:55] <bollu> but if I have a real numvber and write it as (a + 0.e)
[09:08:32] <bvssvni> the first part is always unaffected by the dual part
[09:08:42] <bollu> then f(a + 0.e) = f(a) + f`(a) (0.e) / 1! <- this is pointless I think
[09:08:59] <bollu> yeah I get f(a) = f(a)
[09:09:18] <bvssvni> let's take another example
[09:09:22] <bvssvni> Pythagoas
[09:09:29] <bvssvni> a^2 + b^2 = c^2
[09:09:38] <bvssvni> you put in dual numbers
[09:09:41] <bvssvni> you get 
[09:09:54] <bvssvni> a^2 + 2a_1.e etc.
[09:10:00] <bollu> a^2 + 2ae + b^2 + 2be = c^2 + 2ce right?
[09:10:06] <bvssvni> yeah
[09:10:15] <bvssvni> and then you separate the dual terms
[09:10:20] <bollu> or a^2 + b^2 = c^2 + 2e(c - b- a)
[09:10:38] <bvssvni> but it's a product I think
[09:10:51] <bvssvni> a_0 * a_1
[09:11:09] <bollu> e = a^2 + b^2 - c^2 / 2(c - b - a) <= this looks similar to the cosine rule.
[09:11:13] <bollu> hmm, this is weird
[09:11:18] <bollu> bvssvni: what?
[09:11:21] <bvssvni> no
[09:11:26] <bvssvni> you don't solve for epsilon
[09:11:34] <bollu> bvssvni: you solve for c?
[09:11:43] <bvssvni> for c_1
[09:11:53] <bvssvni> but you can separate the epsilon parts from the others
[09:12:12] <bvssvni> because they are infinitesimals
[09:12:19] <bvssvni> they belong to a different space
[09:12:24] <bollu> bvssvni: okay, wait. continue from this step -  or a^2 + b^2 = c^2 + 2e(c - b- a)
[09:12:35] <bvssvni> what you end up with
[09:12:37] <bollu> so, c_1 is the solution to this? 
[09:12:37] <bvssvni> is

[09:15:44] <bvssvni> the dual part of a and b
[09:15:48] <bollu> oh okay
[09:15:50] <bollu> go ahead :)
[09:15:53] <bvssvni> now
[09:16:02] <bvssvni> you can have a system
[09:16:06] <bvssvni> two points
[09:16:10] <bvssvni> which has a constraint
[09:16:17] <bvssvni> length = constant
[09:16:20] <bvssvni> between them
[09:16:28] <bollu> okay.
[09:16:32] <bvssvni> and the dual equation we got
[09:16:37] <bvssvni> tells you how to change velocities
[09:16:42] <bvssvni> in order to preserve the constraint
[09:16:53] <bollu> bvssvni: why>
[09:16:54] <bollu> ?
[09:16:58] <bvssvni> because
[09:17:05] <bvssvni> the equation for a constraint
[09:17:31] <bvssvni> (Ax-Bx)^2 + (Ay-By)^2 = C^2
[09:17:41] <bvssvni> A and B are the pointers
[09:17:44] <bvssvni> *points
[09:17:55] <bollu> bvssvni: that's the distance formula..
[09:18:00] <bvssvni> yeah
[09:18:03] <bvssvni> and C is constant
[09:18:10] <bollu> yeah 
[09:18:20] <bvssvni> if you put this into the equations
[09:18:28] <bollu> and by "this" you mean?
[09:18:47] <bvssvni> Ax-Bx as 'a'
[09:18:53] <bvssvni> Ay-By as 'b'
[09:19:11] <bollu> a^2 + b^2 = c^2 . hm
[09:19:11] <bvssvni> a^2 + b^2 = c^2
[09:19:20] <bvssvni> get it?
[09:19:28] <bollu> yeah.
[09:19:28] <bvssvni> it's an equation with a constant distance
[09:19:35] <bvssvni> but we think "let's move this shit"
[09:19:40] <bvssvni> and put in dual numbers
[09:19:45] <bvssvni> where dual part encodes velocity
[09:19:57] <bvssvni> and then we get relative velocity
[09:20:02] <bvssvni> which preserve the constraint
[09:20:23] <bvssvni> and this can be put into motor actuators
[09:20:34] <bvssvni> to do cool stuff in games
[09:20:36] <bollu> bvssvni: so a1 = relative b/w  a and b in the x axis and b1 = relative vel b/w a and b in the y axis
[09:20:47] <bvssvni> yeah
[09:21:01] <bvssvni> that's why dual numbers are so useful
[09:21:08] <bvssvni> you can model the problem statically
[09:21:15] <bvssvni> and get the dynamic solution
[09:21:28] <bollu> bvssvni: so you "move" your points (a and b) by a1 and b1
[09:21:35] <bvssvni> yes
[09:21:39] <bollu> after which you solve for a1 and b1
[09:21:50] <bollu> solve for c1*
[09:21:53] <bollu> using a1 and b1
[09:22:08] <bvssvni> you solve for the velocity you can control
[09:22:27] <bvssvni> it's the relative velocity though
[09:22:34] <bvssvni> so if you put in (Ax-Bx)
[09:22:40] <bvssvni> the positive direction is controlling A
[09:22:47] <bvssvni> the negative direction is controlling B
[09:23:08] <bollu> hm. 
[09:23:38] <bvssvni> it's like pattern matching
[09:23:45] <bvssvni> it reverses the semantics
[09:23:55] <bollu> so, I'm still confused -> for the eqn in c1, you have a1, b1 and c 
[09:24:02] <bollu> c is a constant so it's known
[09:24:15] <bollu> a1, b1 are the relative velocities
[09:24:15] <bvssvni> c can have a c1 or not
[09:24:22] <bollu> so you solve for c1
[09:24:23] <bollu> what then?
[09:24:46] <bvssvni> you get an equation for the relative velocities (which depends on the relative positions)
[09:25:01] <bvssvni> depending on what you want out of it, you solve the new equation
[09:25:19] <bvssvni> like what velocity should A have
[09:25:20] <bollu> bvssvni: let's assume I have the ability to move A. 
[09:25:28] <bvssvni> yeah
[09:25:30] <bollu> yeah, so I solve for a1 right?
[09:25:33] <bvssvni> B can move in any direction
[09:25:38] <bvssvni> yeah
[09:25:53] <bvssvni> then you use a1, subtract the velocity of B
[09:25:58] <bvssvni> and get the velocity of A
[09:26:02] <bollu> but look, in the equation, I'll have two unknowns then, a1 AND b1 
[09:26:07] <bollu> because a1 I need to find out
[09:26:09] <bollu> and b1 is "free"
[09:26:19] <bvssvni> ok, this is a bit confusing
[09:26:20] <bvssvni> let's say
[09:26:25] <bvssvni> x^2 + y^2 = c
[09:26:28] <bvssvni> x^2 + y^2 = c^2
[09:26:43] <bollu> sure
[09:26:50] <bvssvni> c1 = (x x1 + y y1) / c
[09:26:59] <bvssvni> or
[09:27:05] <bvssvni> c1 c1 = x x1 + y y1
[09:27:09] <bvssvni> c1 c = x x1 + y y1
[09:27:14] <bollu> let's name the to equation equation (1) and the c1 equation equation (2)
[09:27:16] <bollu> sure
[09:27:30] <bvssvni> we can call it "the dual equation"
[09:27:50] <bvssvni> we know intuitively
[09:28:03] <bvssvni> that x^2 + y^2 = c^2 represents a circle
[09:28:14] <bvssvni> and x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = c^2 represents a sphere
[09:28:26] <bvssvni> we can expand the dual equation
[09:28:27] <bollu> sure
[09:28:38] <bvssvni> c c1 = x x1 + y y1 + z z1
[09:29:02] <bvssvni> the dual equation is the relationship of velocity
[09:29:11] <bvssvni> it's in the tangent space of the sphere
[09:29:25] <bvssvni> you get a vector
[09:29:29] <bvssvni> a point on the sphere
[09:29:33] <bollu> bvssvni: yeah, I know that derivation
[09:29:36] <bvssvni> and there is another vector
[09:29:43] <bollu> x1, y1, z1 must be a point on the sphere
[09:29:46] <bvssvni> that follows the surface
[09:29:56] <bollu> then that relation gives you a tangent to the sphere at that point
[09:30:00] <bvssvni> yeah
[09:30:06] <bvssvni> so any surface you model
[09:30:11] <bollu> yeah, I've used that before without knowing all this :)
[09:30:16] <bollu> okay, continue
[09:30:16] <bvssvni> the dual equation gives you the tangent space
[09:30:20] <bollu> TIL how it works
[09:30:28] <bvssvni> it's pretty cool
[09:30:38] <bollu> hm, I've plotted that in 2d
[09:30:44] <bollu> and what I've noticed is
[09:30:49] <bollu> for points "inside" the circle
[09:31:00] <bollu> it maps (0, r ) to (r, infinity)
[09:31:13] <bollu> like, at x = r, the point and the line meet
[09:31:28] <bollu> at x = 0, the line shoots off to inifity asymptotically
[09:31:35] <bollu> I don't know what it represents though
[09:31:53] <bollu> bvssvni: any explaination
[09:31:54] <bollu> ?
[09:31:58] <bvssvni> is it divide by zero?
[09:32:23] <bollu> bvssvni: no, I mean, write the equation in tangent space right? xx1 + yy1 - c^2 = 0
[09:32:41] <bvssvni> oh
[09:32:47] <bollu> so if you go towards the edge of the circle from the inside  (x -> r-)
[09:33:11] <bollu> the line (which is perpendicular to the circle) approaches from x = infinity to x ->r+
[09:33:23] <bollu> it was super interesting, but I didn't have an explaination for it
[09:33:40] <bvssvni> you vary x and y, right?
[09:33:47] <bollu> yeah, with the mouse
[09:34:12] <bollu> so as I get closer to the edge of the circle from the inside, the line gets closer to the edge of the circle from the outside
[09:34:12] <bvssvni> well 
[09:34:25] <bollu> so it "maps" (0, r) to (r, infinity)
[09:34:34] <bvssvni> perhaps it is the displacement to get to the circle
[09:34:44] <bvssvni> and since it's an infinitesimal, it approaches infinity
[09:34:58] <bvssvni> because 1 = infinte infinitesimals
[09:35:06] <bollu> bvssvni: hm, maybe. I don't know though... 
[09:35:24] <bollu> at the exact edge of the circle, the mouse cursor and the line would meet
[09:35:25] <bvssvni> ok, but it may be not important
[09:35:30] <bollu> the line would be the tangent
[09:35:37] <bollu> true
[09:35:39] <bollu> but it was awesome
[09:35:43] <bvssvni> yeah
[09:35:49] <bvssvni> and you can do it for any function
[09:36:08] <bvssvni> in any dimension
[09:36:21] <bvssvni> the answer you get from the function
[09:36:32] <bvssvni> represents position + tangent of that function
[09:36:46] <bvssvni> so it's a linear approximation to that point
[09:36:52] <bollu> bvssvni: the way I understood it was, since you're replacing the points of the equation with a "point on the surface" so to speak
[09:36:59] <bollu> like, x^2 becomes xx1
[09:37:04] <bollu> where x1 is "your point"
[09:37:13] <bollu> you're partially satistying the curve
[09:37:14] <bvssvni> the direction where it points
[09:37:27] <bvssvni> on a 2D surface, you can point in any direction
[09:37:36] <bvssvni> not just 2 like in 1D
[09:37:44] <bollu> and it gets fully satisfied at only one point -> (x1, y1, z1) so it automatically becomes a tangent
[09:37:54] <bollu> bvssvni: yeah, I know
[09:38:01] <bollu> idk, that was my intuition of it
[09:38:11] <bollu> it's a cool property though
[09:38:26] <bvssvni> so, if you choose a dual part to look in one direction
[09:38:30] <bvssvni> and then choose another direction
[09:38:38] <bvssvni> you can find how the surface curves at that point
[09:39:17] <bvssvni> it's like having a 3D touch sensor
[09:39:17] <bollu> you can do that by partialy differentiating too right?
[09:39:28] <bvssvni> it's the same thing
[09:39:49] <bollu> bvssvni: according to the equivalence formula
[09:39:51] <bvssvni> even though I prefer dual numbers, because it's more intuitive
[09:40:01] <bollu> bvssvni: I'm finding that hard to believe :P
[09:40:05] <bollu> it seems to me like a trick
[09:40:14] <bollu> I mean, it's a neat trick
[09:40:16] <bollu> but a trick
[09:40:16] <bvssvni> you can emulate dual numbers
[09:40:24] <bvssvni> f(5.00001)
[09:40:31] <bvssvni> you just pick a small number
[09:40:39] <bvssvni> f(5.00001) - f(5)
[09:40:58] <bvssvni> is approximately f'(5) / 100000
[09:41:36] <bvssvni> and
[09:41:38] <bollu> bvssvni: that's cheating :) you're just ignoring higher powers of the taylor series because deltax is so small that deltax^2 can be written off as error
[09:41:38] <bvssvni> if you take
[09:41:52] <bvssvni> bollu: yeah, but it works in practice :)
[09:41:57] <bvssvni> ok
[09:42:00] <bvssvni> prepare to be blown
[09:42:06] <bvssvni> 1.00001
[09:42:12] <bvssvni> ^100000
[09:42:15] <bvssvni> gives you e
[09:42:22] <bvssvni> with the 6 first decimals
[09:42:42] <bvssvni> because e = lim (1+1/n)^n
[09:42:46] <bollu> bvssvni: obviosly
[09:42:47] <bollu> yeah
[09:42:50] <bvssvni> but
[09:42:52] <bollu> beronulli's definition
[09:43:00] <bollu> (1 + x) ^ (1/x)
[09:43:01] <bvssvni> 1.0001^2 = 1.00020001
[09:43:11] <bvssvni> 1.0001^3 = 1.000300030001
[09:43:15] <bvssvni> and if you continue
[09:43:24] <bvssvni> you recognize the numbers from Pascal's pyramid
[09:43:32] <bollu> what the HELL
[09:43:34] <bollu> no way
[09:43:37] <bollu> seriously?
[09:43:38] <bvssvni> yes
[09:43:42] <bvssvni> so 'e'
[09:43:44] <bvssvni> is the bottom
[09:43:47] <bollu> 1.001^5
[09:43:51] <bvssvni> of Pascal's pyramid
[09:43:54] <bollu> rusti: 1.001^5
[09:44:10] <bollu> hooly shit
[09:44:13] <bollu> what the hell that is NUTS
[09:44:20] <bvssvni> it doesn't stop there
[09:44:25] <bvssvni> you know
[09:44:35] <bvssvni> (a+b)^2 = (a^2 + 2ab + b^2)
[09:44:43] <bvssvni> so if you have
[09:44:47] <bvssvni> (a+b)^n
[09:44:47] <bollu> how does that WORK? how does raising 1.001 to a power give me binomail coefficients?
[09:44:50] <bollu> that makes no sense
[09:44:56] <bvssvni> you can use a calculator
[09:45:00] <bvssvni> plug in 1.0001
[09:45:00] <bollu> yeah yeah nC0 + nC1 + nC2 + ...
[09:45:13] <bollu> okay, continue
[09:45:21] <bvssvni> it's because of symmetric fractals
[09:45:33] <bvssvni> the number of zeroes
[09:45:39] <bvssvni> encodes another number
[09:45:43] <bollu> so what happens if I plug in 1.0001?
[09:45:49] <bvssvni> like a 'noise' attached to the other number
[09:45:55] <huon> bollu: it's because nCk = (n-1)Ck + (n-1)C(k-1)
[09:46:18] <bollu> huon: how does that relate to anything? 
[09:46:20] <huon> and multiplying by 1.0001 is basically doing that operation
[09:46:37] <bollu> my god this is crazy
[09:46:48] <bollu> hoooly shit this is the coolest thing I've learnt
[09:46:48] <bvssvni> if you had a channel
[09:46:53] <bvssvni> with real numbers
[09:46:54] <huon> 1.0001 * 1.0001 = 1.0001 + 0.00010001 == 1.00020001
[09:47:00] <bvssvni> with infinite accuracy
[09:47:06] <bvssvni> you could transmit infinite amount of information
[09:47:23] <huon> 1.00020001 * 1.0001 == 1.00020001 + 0.000100020001 == 1.000300030001
[09:47:26] <bvssvni> by encoding it into the infinitesimals
[09:47:47] <bollu> huon: ah, that makes it clearer. but it is still crazy that it works
[09:48:03] <bollu> I can't believe that the zeroes align perfectly
[09:48:05] <bollu> it's like magic
[09:48:12] <huon> (you can see the digits aligning there making the next number the sum of the adjacent ones in the previous number, i.e. exactly the pascals triangle)
[09:48:24] <bollu> yeah, that's brilliant
[09:48:24] <huon> it breaks down for sufficiently large powers though
[09:48:36] <bollu> huon: breaks down because of precision error?
[09:48:41] <huon> (i.e. when the entries of pascal's triangle are larger than 5 digits)
[09:48:41] <bvssvni> so at some point
[09:48:43] <bollu> or breaks down as in mathematically?
[09:48:48] <bollu> huon: ah
[09:48:55] <bvssvni> one says "we ignore the powers" of that infinitesimal
[09:48:59] <huon> it's still working, but the numbers are overflowing, so it's not as obvious
[09:49:03] <bvssvni> eps^2 = 0
[09:49:05] <huon> (overflowing into each other)
[09:49:13] <bvssvni> yeah
[09:49:19] <bvssvni> and even with infinite amount of zeroes
[09:49:19] <bollu> huon: what if we used something like 0.0000000001 ?
[09:49:24] <bvssvni> it stills end up with e
[09:49:29] <bollu> it would "leak" somehwere?
[09:49:33] <huon> bollu: that would last until they're 10 digits long
[09:49:41] <huon> (or however many zeros there are)
[09:49:43] <bollu> so e is the sum of all contributions 
[09:49:53] <bvssvni> e is "mathematically leak"
[09:49:54] <bollu> my god, that is so crazy that I belive it
[09:50:20] <bvssvni> you know that
[09:50:22] <bollu> like, the "definition of e" allows you to approach as close to zero as you want since it's a limit...
[09:50:40] <bvssvni> it's a perfect balance
[09:50:48] <bvssvni> between infinity and infinitesimals
[09:50:52] <bollu> bvssvni: you have single handedly convinced me that I shall be a math major
[09:51:00] <bvssvni> haha
[09:51:10] <bollu> holy crap.
[09:51:13] <bollu> I just... yeah
[09:51:24] <bollu> (1 + 0)^(infinity) = e
[09:51:28] <bollu> limit
[09:51:33] <bollu> but that's so awesome
[09:51:41] <huon> bollu: not always :P
[09:51:50] <huon> (1 + 1/n^2) ^ n doesn't tend to e :P
[09:51:57] <bvssvni> (1+1eps)^infinty = e
[09:52:05] <huon> (1 - 1/n)^n == 1/e
[09:52:23] <bvssvni> yeah
[09:52:31] <bvssvni> you can use that in random trials
[09:52:45] <bvssvni> to compute confidence that you have covered like 95% of the cases
[09:52:45] <bollu> huon: you can use the f(x)^g(x) = e^(f(x) - 1)*g(x) to evaluate that right?
[09:52:46] <huon> yeah, appears "randomly" in random testing
[09:52:49] <huon> ;P
[09:53:07] <bollu> assuming f -> 1 and g -> infinity
[09:53:21] * huon 's never seen that rule
[09:53:34] <bollu> I've used it a couple of times and it holds
[09:53:36] <huon> it's probably a consequence of L'Hopital's rule or something?
[09:53:58] <bollu> lm f(x) -> 1, g(x) -> infinity, f(x)^g(x) = e^[(f(x) -1)*g(x)]
[09:54:04] <bollu> I don't remember the derivation
[09:54:11] <huon> yeah, definitely seems L'Hopital's-ish
[09:54:17] <bollu> I think we used the definition of e and did some funky stuff
[09:54:18] * huon considers getting a piece of paper
[09:54:35] <bollu> huon: no, you can't approach it using l'hopital AFAIK
[09:54:42] <bollu> cause it's not 0/0 form
[09:54:48] <huon> take logs :P
[09:54:49] <huon> <3 logs
[09:55:05] <bollu> huon: nope, log(1) ->  0, log(infinity) -> infinity
[09:55:08] <bollu> won't work
[09:55:10] <huon> well, <3 continuous functions
[09:55:16] <huon> it does
[09:55:18] <bollu> yeah, that's true :)
[09:55:21] <bvssvni> haha
[09:55:26] <huon> g(x) / (1 / log(f(x)))
[09:55:37] <huon> infinity/infinity
[09:55:42] <huon> bam, l'hopital
[09:55:43] <huon> ;P
[09:55:57] <bollu> http://www.vitutor.com/calculus/limits/one_infinity.html
[09:56:00] <bollu> lol
[09:56:06] <bollu> looks like it's pretty well known
[09:56:19] <huon> seems like the derivatives will screw you up though
[09:56:23] * huon has a piece of paper
[09:56:59] <bollu> idk, I saw the rule in thomas' calculus
[09:57:05] <bollu> and I've been using it since :D
[09:57:43] <huon> yeah, l'hopital's doesn't work :P
[09:57:45] * huon checked
[09:58:14] <bvssvni> anyway
[09:58:27] <bvssvni> bollu: x^0.00...1 = ln(x)/infinity
[09:59:26] <bollu> bvssvni: continue
[09:59:30] <bvssvni> now you can hack a cheap calculator
[09:59:38] <bvssvni> to compute with logarithms
[09:59:49] <bvssvni> because you can compute e (up to n decimals)
[09:59:54] <bvssvni> and you can compute ln(x)
[10:00:14] <bvssvni> ok
[10:00:33] <bollu> bvssvni: isn't it easier to compute ln(x) by using the taylor series and staring with x = 1?
[10:00:47] <bollu> this gives you ln(x) = x - x^2 / 2 + x^3 / 3 + .. I think
[10:01:01] <bvssvni> bollu: probably, I am not that confortable with taylor
[10:01:03] <bollu> ln(1+x) sorry
[10:01:17] <bvssvni> yeah, it's pretty cool
[10:01:35] <huon> bollu: (by "starting with" you mean "taylor series around x = 1", right?)
[10:02:06] <huon> well, writing it as ln(1 + x) it's x = 0
[10:02:21] <bollu> no I mean use taylor series
[10:02:26] <bollu> f(x + dx) = whatever
[10:02:28] <bollu> put x = 1
[10:02:38] <bollu> you get an expression with ln(1 + x) = stuff
[10:02:41] <bollu> on the right hand side
[10:02:48] <bollu> but because d/dx ln(x) = 1/x
[10:02:49] <huon> yes, that's "taylor series around x"
[10:02:55] <bollu> ah okay
[10:03:03] <bollu> it becomes a simple power rule kind of thing
[10:03:15] <bollu> why "around" x?
[10:03:18] <bollu> why not "at x" ?
[10:03:23] <huon> that works too
[10:03:28] <huon> but "starting with" is just peculiar :P
[10:03:35] <bollu> xD
[10:03:46] <bvssvni> bollu: like dual numbers gives you a linear approximation
[10:03:54] <bvssvni> Taylor series is a generalization
[10:04:03] <bvssvni> but it only works for one variable
[10:04:23] <bvssvni> Taylor series gives you a polynomial
[10:04:23] <bollu> bvssvni: I've never tried applying it to multiple
[10:04:32] <bollu> but you should get it, just as a partial differential
[10:04:52] <bvssvni> bollu: yeah, if you know f'(x, y)
[10:04:54] <bollu> like, you derive from the maclaurin series right?
[10:04:57] <bollu> yeah 
[10:05:05] <bvssvni> and f''(x,y) and so on
[10:05:10] <huon> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series#Taylor_series_in_several_variables
[10:05:12] <bollu> f'(x,y) with respect to whatever you're exanding
[10:05:18] <bollu> yep
[10:05:51] <bvssvni> a polynomial is a way of encoding a function
[10:06:10] <bvssvni> and it has additon, subtraction, multiply and division
[10:06:16] <bollu> bvssvni: true
[10:06:19] <bvssvni> it is like a number
[10:06:24] <huon> "an approximation to a function" (unless the function is a polynomial itself)
[10:06:36] <bollu> huon: not if you go to inifnite terms
[10:06:45] <huon> then it's a series rather than a polynomial
[10:06:48] <bollu> that's how I was taught th derivatio of e^ix
[10:06:58] <bollu> ah, I didn't realize that was an important distinction
[10:07:00] <huon> "polynomial" implies finite
[10:07:11] <bvssvni> ah
[10:07:18] <bollu> didn't know that
[10:07:27] <bvssvni> but as you know
[10:07:33] <bvssvni> f´´´´´´´´´´´´´(x)
[10:07:37] <bollu> xD
[10:07:39] <bvssvni> is probably very small
[10:07:43] <bollu> lol
[10:07:52] <bvssvni> because if you think like this
[10:08:00] <bvssvni> "the change in change in change in change ... "
[10:08:08] <bollu> bvssvni: no, that's not why you ignore terms. you ignore terms because (dx)^10 or whatever becomes small
[10:08:18] <bvssvni> yeah
[10:08:22] <bvssvni> but for a short time interval
[10:08:30] <bollu> yeah for a short "step"
[10:08:38] <bvssvni> it becomes very small
[10:08:39] <huon> x^100 => f^(10)(x) is pretty large
[10:08:48] <huon> (fwiw)
[10:08:52] <bvssvni> yeah
[10:09:05] <bvssvni> but x^10 = 1000% growth
[10:09:15] <bvssvni> there are not many natural processes like this
[10:09:28] <bollu> bvssvni: 1st order kinetics ? 
[10:09:43] <bvssvni> x is usually the state
[10:09:59] <bvssvni> like x1 is the velocity
[10:10:15] <bvssvni> one has a function that operates on the state
[10:10:19] <bvssvni> returning a new state
[10:10:37] <bvssvni> and x + x1 eps is a linear function
[10:10:43] <bollu> bvssvni: I think you're describing a differential equation ;)
[10:10:46] <bvssvni> with unspecified time step
[10:11:02] <bvssvni> with mathematical formalism is not important for my point
[10:11:10] <bvssvni> if you have a game
[10:11:14] <bvssvni> with many objects
[10:11:27] <bvssvni> each with a well defined behavior at an instant of time
[10:11:48] <bvssvni> but their behavior changes as result of interaction between the objects
[10:12:00] <bvssvni> the well definition becomes exponentially more complex
[10:12:07] <bvssvni> because
[10:12:12] <bvssvni> two numbers
[10:12:18] <bvssvni> (a + b) * (c + d)
[10:12:24] <bvssvni> gives you 4 terms
[10:12:37] <bvssvni> and when you multiply 4 terms with 4 terms
[10:12:42] <bvssvni> you get 8 etc.
[10:12:43] <bollu> combinatorial explosion 
[10:12:45] <bollu> got it
[10:12:47] <bvssvni> yeah
[10:12:50] <bvssvni> so formulas
[10:13:02] <bvssvni> are good for compressing knowledge
[10:13:08] <bvssvni> but not for complex systems
[10:13:17] <bvssvni> and numbers
[10:13:23] <bvssvni> are just compressed formulas
[10:13:47] <bvssvni> we try to put the information in the most compressed form
[10:13:50] <bvssvni> that is still useful
[10:14:11] <bollu> bvssvni: that's a strange way of putting it
[10:14:18] <bvssvni> yeah, I know
[10:14:24] <bvssvni> but
[10:14:33] <bvssvni> take for example conservation of energy
[10:14:41] <bvssvni> what is the most general way of putting it?
[10:14:58] <bvssvni> no differential information gets in or out of the system
[10:15:06] <bvssvni> the information encoded in the dual part is preserved
[10:15:26] <bvssvni> so if you write algorithms
[10:15:36] <bvssvni> that always keep bookkeeping the dual parts
[10:15:43] <bvssvni> you preserve energy in the simulation
[10:16:00] <bollu> bvssvni: you seem obsessed with dual numbers O_O. no, you represnt the work enery conservation law by using F = -del * U
[10:16:20] <bollu> as far as I know at least
[10:16:23] <bvssvni> bollu: yeah, I like them very much
[10:16:38] <bvssvni> it doesn't matter *how* it behaves
[10:16:43] <bvssvni> only that the information is preserved
[10:16:59] <bvssvni> whether it's a spring, a clothing etc.
[10:17:37] <bollu> bvssvni: I mean, I don't get it - you have a crazy system where e^2 = 0. and just by plugging in a number a +eb, some terms cancel out. so where's the "conservation" ? the fact that you can back-transform ?
[10:17:52] <bollu> replace crazy with weird
[10:17:53] <bvssvni> if you have two objects
[10:17:56] <bvssvni> A and B
[10:18:07] <bvssvni> each has a position and velocity
[10:18:20] <bvssvni> you take some part of the velocity from A and adds it to B
[10:18:36] <bvssvni> you move a fraction of the dual part of A to the dual part of B
[10:18:55] <bvssvni> the total velocity is conserved
[10:19:03] <bvssvni> it's a vector with constant length
[10:19:14] <bvssvni> if you sum up the dual parts
[10:19:21] <bvssvni> it is the same
[10:19:24] <bvssvni> but
[10:19:29] <bvssvni> if you want different mass
[10:19:42] <bvssvni> then the product of the mass and velocity is conserved
[10:19:54] <bvssvni> so the dual part can encode mass*velocity
[10:19:54] <bollu> bvssvni: sometimes you want to conserve distance not vecolity - like a spring, it's 1/2kx^2
[10:20:02] <bvssvni> yes
[10:20:15] <bvssvni> so you can have multiple constraints
[10:20:58] <bvssvni> let's say we have A and B
[10:21:08] <bvssvni> and you suddenly move A, without changing anything else
[10:21:20] <bvssvni> if A and B are affected by gravity potential
[10:21:31] <bvssvni> then you implicitly add or subtract the dual part
[10:21:43] <bvssvni> because of the difference in gravity potential
[10:21:56] <bvssvni> in a flat space this does not matter
[10:22:04] <bvssvni> because the potential is the same everywhere
[10:22:15] <bvssvni> what I am implying
[10:22:15] <bollu> bvssvni: true
[10:22:26] <bvssvni> it is a connection between information and the symmetry
[10:22:49] <bvssvni> like we can reason about programs in terms of types
[10:22:56] <bvssvni> without actually running the program
[10:23:03] <bvssvni> you can reason about physics without motion
[10:23:20] <bvssvni> by looking at the symmetry
[10:23:29] <bollu> bvssvni: hm. I'll have to think about this
[10:23:40] <bollu> like, all of physics is based on DE's 
[10:23:54] <bollu> so you're saying you can predict stuff without actually "stepping"
[10:23:58] <bollu> which I find strange
[10:24:01] <bollu> anyway, I g2g
[10:24:04] <bvssvni> ok
[10:24:11] <bollu> thanks for the awesome food or thought :)
[10:24:12] <bollu> for*
[10:24:13] <bvssvni> nice to chat
[10:24:15] <bollu> huon too!
[10:24:21] <bollu> yep :) bye guys!
