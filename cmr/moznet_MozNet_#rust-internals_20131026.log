[00:23:56] <acrichto> brson: my conclusion is that I am not enthused by the Decorator trait
[00:24:14] <acrichto> what would your thoughts be on removing it? I would imagine that all the struct fields would become public, or you'd define accessors yourself
[00:26:35] <brson> acrichto: I'm fine with removing it. Do the accessors seem like they are used much?
[00:27:08] <acrichto> brson: not a whole lot, but I think that it is important that wrappers do allow access to their contained items
[00:27:15] <acrichto> I'm just not convinced it should be done with a trait
[00:27:24] <acrichto> the extra import makes me sad
[00:27:39] <dbaupp> can it be done with the struct inheritance?
[00:27:39] <acrichto> also I feel like it's a little odd because you can corrupt the state of the wrapper
[00:27:56] <acrichto> I don't think this is a struct inheritance thing, but I could be wrong
[00:27:59] <brson> that's not good
[00:28:03] <acrichto> b/c the field being wrapped is always of a different type
[00:28:24] <acrichto> brson: so it's weird that I can get mutable access to a writer on a BufferedWriter, and my writes will go through before the buffered writes
[00:28:38] <acrichto> or that on a MemWriter I can get mutable access to the underlying buffer and truncate it
[00:28:43] <acrichto> which would cause a failure on the next write
[00:29:01] <acrichto> things like that where I don't think that all wrappers want to allow (value, mut ref, ref) access to their contents
[00:29:13] <acrichto> often it's only that they want to provide inner access (they only want an unwrap() function)
[00:29:25] <acrichto> or immutable access
[00:32:57] <strcat> acrichto: so I think it would be hard to actually handle dtor failure ;\
[00:33:05] <strcat> I think there would need to be a bunch of landing pads
[00:33:25] <acrichto> right now it's just one failure, not two
[00:33:47] <strcat> you need to make landing pads for the landing pad, don't you? :s
[00:34:02] <acrichto> no, that's only necessary if we support nested failure
[00:34:07] <acrichto> which I think may be a separate issue
[00:34:21] <acrichto> right now it's the case that the *first* failure in a destructor will not destroy the struct's fields
[00:34:29] <acrichto> the first failure should successfully unwind everything
[00:34:30] <strcat> ah so you're just suggesting allowing dtors to fail when you aren't already failing
[00:34:40] <acrichto> or a dtor failing
[00:34:48] <acrichto> where the dtor was just running b/c something fell out of scope
[00:35:09] <acrichto> I think that it's unclear how second-failure will work and how it may be implemented
[00:35:23] <acrichto> it would mean that all code everywhere  needs landing pads for landing pads
[00:35:30] <acrichto> or just a different method of uwinding
[00:36:31] <brson> one of the proposed plans for double failure is to just terminate the task and leak everything
[00:36:35] <strcat> acrichto: and landing pads for landing pads need landing pads
[00:36:46] <acrichto> strcat: yeah I don't think that's gonna happen
[00:37:03] <brson> and set a runtime taint flag
[00:37:21] <acrichto> the whole runtime is tainted?
[00:37:30] <brson> yep
[00:37:52] <acrichto> couldn't you at least free all gc resources?
[00:37:59] <strcat> it could really mess up locks and you'd have to worry about exception safety
[00:38:01] <acrichto> I guess it doesn't matter that much
[00:38:20] <brson> you could free gc boxes, yes
[00:38:30] <brson> but yeah, things have gone to hell, so why bother

[00:39:16] <brson> strcat: it could mess up locks. i don't know what you mean about exception safety
[00:39:32] <strcat> brson: because atm we poison arcs in the dtor
[00:39:37] <strcat> and you can have mutable arcs
[00:40:19] <strcat> so calling a method on an arc + failing could leave the contained object in a semi-invalid state, which is usually fine
[00:40:30] * strcat shrugs
[00:40:42] <strcat> it's the same as try-catch safety issues
