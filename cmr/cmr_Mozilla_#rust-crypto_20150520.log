[07:14:22] <bascule> hahaha
[07:14:28] <eternaleye> Actually, it can probably be modeled as a knuth shuffle
[07:14:35] <bascule> the author does not seem to understand a one time pad
[07:14:40] <eternaleye> Which means its quality reduces directly to the quality of the RNG

"Mainly around provable security. The algorithm does not depend upon hard to solve mathematical problems, just the lack of information."
[07:16:47] <eternaleye> Ilari: The knuth shuffle gives an exactly random shuffle, and NOTing the source location on the swap means that the probabilities of getting a NOT an odd number of times are almost exactly 50%
[07:16:50] <bascule> provable security!
[07:18:10] <eternaleye> Ilari: So yeah, in the exact case where it doesn't matter (you have enough entropy to drive a Knuth shuffle, which is a constant factor larger than the size of the message), it might actually be secure.
[07:18:43] <adu> yeah, I noticed that "XOR with 1" thing too
[07:18:49] <bascule> heh
[07:19:16] <eternaleye> I do think it might be neat to examine "Knuth shuffle, negating source on swap"
[07:19:35] <eternaleye> Because I *think* it is secure if the PRNG it's driven by is secure

[14:16:03] <bascule> looks totally random!
[14:16:24] <bascule> "So, the patterns we observe as structure are generalising the variation that appears in the byte stream and wouldn't be noticeable unless ranges were used, which is essentially what the randomness tests are doing. This would seem to indicate that classical mathematical approaches to breaking the cipher would not be particularly useful, instead some form of approach based on wavelets may be better."

[15:28:07] <Tiffany> "Releases are never shipped until all these tools report zero defects."
[15:28:21] <Tiffany> I wonder how libsodium manages to silence all the false positives made by the static analysers they use
[15:36:10] <Tiffany> lol wow
[15:36:16] <Tiffany> this cipher
[15:36:28] <Tiffany> a waste of a decent cipher name is what it is
[15:43:46] <Tiffany> I have a feeling that if I did some reading about PRNG I could make a better cipher than this guy, and of course, if someone instantly demonstrated flaws in it, I would go and make something else, instead of brushing them off
[15:43:56] <Tiffany> I really have no idea why you would not just use a one-time pad instead of using this
[15:46:52] <bascule> Tiffany: at first I thought the creator simply wasn't familiar with one time pads
[15:47:05] <bascule> then I found a reference to one in his documentation
[15:49:44] <Tiffany> does he think his cipher is more secure than a one-time pad?
[15:49:52] <Tiffany> it can't be secure if it's only xor! you need more operations!
[15:50:25] <bascule> I can't tell
[15:50:43] <bascule> but according to the post that image is from, he doesn't see the problem with repeating patterns
[15:51:04] <Tiffany> I wonder if those repeating patterns are consistent based on the key
[15:51:15] <bascule> heh, dunno
[15:51:25] <Tiffany> this has a keystream separate from the text, right?
[15:51:32] <bascule> ...kind of?
[15:51:46] <Tiffany> hmm
[15:51:51] <Tiffany> salt is the size of the file right?
[15:52:00] <bascule> I think it's also 16kB
[15:52:09] <bascule> I'm not sure why there's a "salt"
[15:52:22] <bascule> it seems like it basically has two keys that are both at least 16kB
[15:52:28] <bascule> so you might as well just say it has a 32kB key
[15:52:30] <bascule> *shrug*
[15:52:30] <Tiffany> I thought the salt was more like an IV
[15:52:50] <bascule> if you actually read the forum posts, the author says the salt is just as secret as the key
[15:52:53] <bascule> heh
[15:52:59] <Tiffany> oh
[15:53:02] <Tiffany> so it is part of the key
[15:53:15] <bascule> yeah basically author is smoking crack
[15:53:19] <Tiffany> are you supposed to generate a new key for everything you encrypt?
[15:53:39] <Tiffany> I'm really baffled by how he thinks this is supposed to be used for anything
[15:55:15] <Tiffany> ... hahaha
[15:55:19] <Tiffany> oh, I misread
[15:55:32] <Tiffany> heh
[15:55:42] <Tiffany> he claims that the effective key strength is exactly the key length
[15:55:49] <Tiffany> which is pretty ridiculous
[15:56:01] <Tiffany> why would you need 16 KB keys?
[15:56:56] <Tiffany> man, this must be really slow
[15:56:59] <cmr> because the cipher sucks. it's true in this algorithm.
[15:57:00] <bascule> Snake Oil Warning Sign #5: Ridiculous key lengths.
[15:57:34] <Tiffany> I think the only snake oil warning sign that hasn't been violated is security by obscurity
[15:58:17] <Tiffany> another snake oil warning sign is probably specifying a recommended key length at all
[15:58:33] <Tiffany> you should wait until after it's had a good deal of cryptanalysis for that
[15:58:42] <Tiffany> of course, with this guy's ego, he probably thinks it doesn't need any
[16:00:52] <Tiffany> is there any algorithm which has actually managed to maintain a WF of 100% the key length?
[16:01:59] <Tiffany> "4. Swap the bit with the bit identified in step 2 whilst alternating the direction of that swap"
[16:02:03] <Tiffany> alternating the direction?

[16:02:41] <Tiffany> hm
[16:04:21] <Tiffany> this mailing list post doesn't actually specify a decompression routine?
[16:04:27] <Tiffany> also, it looks like there's no proper keystream
[16:04:41] <Tiffany> so it's not a stream cipher, I guess
[16:05:08] <Tiffany> I think
[16:05:37] <Tiffany> it's somewhat like a block cipher in ECB mode?
[16:06:14] <Tiffany> .. heh
[16:06:26] <Tiffany> so it calculates which bytes to switch based on multiplying byte values together without wrapping
[16:06:34] <Tiffany> which means that the values are biased towards 0, and cap out at 65536
[16:06:53] <Tiffany> so the bytes at the beginning of a block are the ones that get swapped the most
[16:07:44] <Tiffany> "2. Calculate the location of the bits to switch based on the formula 'key*salt' (where both the key and salt are represented as integer values of a byte in the range 0-255) "
[16:07:49] <Tiffany> I'm not sure exactly what this means
[16:07:55] <Tiffany> is that an absolute offset, from the beginning of the file?
[16:08:46] <Tiffany> it looks like the step documented in the mailing list is copied and pasted from the documentation page
[16:08:49] <Tiffany> to the source code, I suppose
[16:10:04] <Tiffany> "Information loss places this cipher in the same category as a one-time pad."
[16:11:10] <Tiffany> what the hell?
[16:11:16] <Tiffany> it wraps a try {} around integer math
[16:11:20] <Tiffany> but never divides by a non-constant
[16:11:35] <Tiffany>                 a = ((keyByteValue1 / 10) + (keyByteValue2 / 10) + (keyByteValue3 / 10) + (keyByteValue4 / 10)) / 4;
[16:11:41] <Tiffany> if this code has an exception, the round function returns '27'
[16:12:17] <Tiffany> apparently the number of rounds to perform is determined by the round computation function
[16:12:22] <Tiffany> oh
[16:12:26] <Tiffany> that's not the round function itself
[16:12:33] <Tiffany> it's a function to determine the number of rounds to run
[16:12:34] <Tiffany> lovely
[16:13:31] <Tiffany> okay
[16:13:34] <Tiffany> so the documentation is wrong
[16:13:45] <Tiffany> it doesn't multiply bytes from the key and salt together
[16:13:52] <Tiffany> it shifts the key byte by the salt byte
[16:13:58] <Tiffany> oh
[16:13:58] <Tiffany> no
[16:14:01] <Tiffany> it uses a function called "Shift"
[16:14:04] <Tiffany> which actually multiplies
[16:14:09] <Tiffany> this code is driving me mad
[16:14:26] <Tiffany> I think that's the intention
[16:14:36] <Tiffany> to get anyone trying to perform cryptanalysis to give up
[16:14:43] <Tiffany> security by lack of analysis!
[16:14:47] <Tiffany> a flawless plan
[16:16:05] <Tiffany> oh, so that's why it's split into two steps
[16:16:12] <Tiffany> the first step it does by-bit swaps
[16:16:17] <Tiffany> and the second step does by-byte
[16:16:40] <Tiffany> I'll be damned if this is even remotely secure

[16:18:44] <Tiffany> okay
[16:18:53] <Tiffany> so step 2 is actually relative to the current index
[16:19:08] <Tiffany> so it's not actually start-of-plaintext biased
[16:19:37] <Tiffany> however, it will never swap values which are separated by numbers without integer factors
[16:19:47] <Tiffany> that are larger than 255

[16:22:55] <Tiffany> maybe that's where the repeating pattern when encrypting zeros comes from
[16:23:52] <Tiffany>                     isUp = isUp == false ? true : false;
[16:24:09] <Tiffany> what an interesting way of writing isUp = !isUp
[16:28:11] <Tiffany> alright, enough of that
[16:28:28] <Tiffany> I feel like swapping values is a popular snake oil crypto tactic
[16:28:46] <Tiffany> oh, also
[16:28:59] <Tiffany> I'm extremely certain that the keys used do not have a working factor of 16 kilobytes
[16:29:29] <Tiffany> the bit swap pattern repeats every key length
[16:29:45] <Tiffany> I think you could derive the key using a known plaintext attack
[16:30:29] <Tiffany> also, there is actually something resembling an IV
[16:30:45] <Tiffany> it's a signed integer, and it's used as part of the function which determines how many rounds to run
[16:31:23] <Tiffany> those repeating patterns could be mitigated slightly by using key and salt lengths of prime numbers of differing lengths
[16:32:05] <Tiffany> that wouldn't fix the potential known plaintext attack though, it would just make a PNG of encrypted zeros look slightly more random
[16:34:20] <Tiffany> hm
[16:34:39] <Tiffany> also
[16:34:52] <Tiffany> this whole algorithm is, in almost every degree, prone to timing attacks
[16:36:00] <Tiffany> oh, I meant to say chosen plaintext, not known plaintext
[16:36:10] <Tiffany> a known plaintext attack might be possible, but it'd probably be harder
[16:38:08] <cmr> " A zeroed file is a bit of a junk test in the context of Crystalline. That test is good when the output depends upon a hard to solve formula, not movement of bits/bytes based upon random noise."

[17:08:52] <Tiffany> yeah cmr
[17:08:58] <Tiffany> so bascule
[17:09:01] <Tiffany> the key of this is basically
[17:09:10] <Tiffany> if the key and salt are the same length
[17:09:21] <Tiffany> for each byte of both, multiplying them together, leaving a 16-bit integer
[17:09:37] <Tiffany> that's the real key
[17:10:42] <Tiffany> then for each round, for each bit of plaintext you take one word from the key and shuffle bits around, and then you do the same with bytes
[17:10:50] <Tiffany> negating one of the swapped values each time
[17:10:59] <Tiffany> and then it does the round a pseudorandom number of times
[17:11:49] <Tiffany> the keystream is literally just copying the derived key over and over again, and the function for combining the key and the plaintext is a knuth shuffle with a bitwise negation each time
[17:16:03] <Tiffany> the key has no need to be random, it only needs to be long, to prevent repetitions in the bit swapping pattern
