[00:02:55] <sfackler> I'd assume the Idx bound is a holdover from when the index was passed by reference
[00:03:06] <sfackler> so you could impl Index<str> for Foo or whatever
[00:03:13] <GBGamer> Can we change that?
[00:03:22] <GBGamer> It just seems... kinda dumb now
[00:03:36] <sfackler> the ?sized bound on Output makes sense to me though
[00:03:41] <sfackler> since you're returning a &Output
[00:03:50] <GBGamer> Oh yeah, sorry
[00:03:54] <GBGamer> That's right
[00:04:05] <GBGamer> however, Idx should be Sized
[00:04:23] <GBGamer> We should probably change that before 1.0

[00:34:05] <GBGamer> That makes sense

[01:41:18] <nrc> repeating a question from earlier:
[01:41:28] <nrc> if a value which is Copy is mutably borrowed, we used to be able to still use, now it is forbidden, does anyone know if this is deliberate? It seems like a regression to me.
[01:41:36] <nrc> E.g., http://is.gd/nhHGmb
[01:41:41] <nrc> The comments describe the old behviour
[01:41:52] <nrc> Anyone know?
[01:43:38] <reem> blaenk: back from dinner. on the typemap thing - the entire scheme may actually be busted
[01:43:46] <Mutabah> nrc: I don't think Copy should change borrowing rules
[01:43:55] <reem> the impl block currently only applies to TypeMap with the default A param
[01:44:00] <blaenk> reem: :((
[01:44:11] <reem> blaenk: I am struggling to think how to generalize it - it may be possible, but tricky.
[01:44:11] <blaenk> that's what I was starting to wonder, what magic you did to make it work with the other bounds lol
[01:44:19] *** Joins: munksgaard (munksgaard@moz-478pev.u.parknet.dk)
[01:44:35] <blaenk> hey man even if in the worst case you have to use macros, that'd still be a good solution I think. being able to use the different kinds of maps
[01:44:44] <blaenk> in the same package
[01:46:01] <nrc> Mutabah: the point is that you don't need to borrow because you can copy
[01:46:09] <nrc> not that Copy changes the rules
[01:46:32] <reem> blaenk: the easiest thing is to add a macro that generates the appropriate impl block
[01:46:46] <reem> blaenk: but imo that’s admitting defeat here :P

[01:47:43] <reem> ya, it’s not so bad
[01:47:52] <reem> I’d just like it to work without macros, if at all possible
[01:47:54] <blaenk> yeah
[01:48:14] <blaenk> maybe that aspect of the language can be improved in the future (idk how)
[01:49:13] <reem> You want to be able to take a trait as a generic parameter, and bound other parameters by it
[01:49:19] <reem> e.g. A: Trait, X: A
[01:49:30] <reem> with entirely strawman syntax
[01:49:37] <reem> that would make this easy
[01:49:50] <reem> I am basically trying to abuse DSTs to mimic that
[01:49:53] <reem> but it is quite tricky
[01:50:23] <reem> *especially* since there is no trait for raw trait objects only
[01:52:51] <blaenk> yeah that would be awesome
[01:53:04] <blaenk> to be able to specify the bound parameters separately, and maybe even parameterize by them
[01:53:53] <blaenk> like what you were doing, except to be able to just do TypeMap<Sync + Send> or something, but idk if that's a generally useful thing or just for this specific thing
[01:57:09] <reem> I basically hacked “parametrize by bounds” by accepting an unsized trait object param

[06:52:14] <blaenk> well I mean something that can be used as a package, not just the types of the structs and functions
[06:52:18] <blaenk> like this https://github.com/hannobraun/inotify-rs
[06:52:35] <blaenk> a thin wrapper for rust
[06:52:40] <blaenk> e.g. to work with Path's directly etc
[06:52:49] <blaenk> a very thin wrapper even

[09:40:40] <SimonSapin> That’s… interesting. error: type `&&core::cell::Cell<core::option::Option<dom::bindings::js::RootCollectionPtr>>` does not implement any method in scope named `get`
[09:41:06] <SimonSapin> auto-deref is recursive, right? I should be able to call T methods on &&T
[09:41:48] <cmr> yeah, that should be fine...
[09:42:14] <cmr> Ah, but is RootCollectionPtr Copy?
[09:42:25] <cmr> that method only exists on Cell<T> when T: Copy
[09:42:49] <SimonSapin> oh, good point
[09:44:08] <SimonSapin> I changed an explicit `impl Copy` to derive, but that doesn’t seem to cause an error
[09:44:17] <SimonSapin> I’ll try to change it back
[09:54:03] <ChrisMorgan> “help: Cell<T> does implement a method named `get`, but only where T implements Copy, which Option<RootCollectionPtr> does not”
[09:54:21] <ChrisMorgan> That’s the sort of thing we need.
[09:54:34] <cmr> Making `struct Cell<T: Copy>` would already do that.
[09:54:48] <cmr> but yes, that would also be helpful in different cases.
[09:54:49] <ChrisMorgan> Yeah, for cases like this that’s what should be done.

[13:43:37] <Mutabah> I pass -o .obj/amd64/kernel.rlib --emit link,dep-info, and it warns and then creates kernel.rlib and kernel.d
[13:43:46] <Mutabah> will --out-dir have the same effect (without the warning?
[13:43:52] <cmr> I believe so, yes.
[13:44:10] <cmr> Although there have traditionally been quite a few bugs with -o, --emit, and --out-dir.
[13:45:01] <Mutabah> Welp, guess I should just test it

[16:28:40] <steveklabnik> so, with Windows, what kind of stuff is helpful for troubleshooting errors? trying to figure out what's up with http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/33qd8g/rust_once_run_anywhere/cqobsbg?context=5
[16:28:50] <steveklabnik> WindowsBunny: around? ^
[16:29:32] <WindowsBunny> Of course I'm around
[16:30:35] <WindowsBunny> steveklabnik: Either r1.exe has segfaulted, or it cannot find a dll it depends on
[16:30:40] <klutzy> oh ConEmu
[16:30:58] <klutzy> I've heard it causes issues with rust, but it was nearly 1~2 yeard around.. hmm
[16:30:59] <steveklabnik> hmm
[16:31:05] <klutzy> not sure if it still does
[16:31:08] <WindowsBunny> Should I get ConEmu to see if it works?
[16:31:19] <steveklabnik> what's ConEmu?
[16:31:21] *** Quits: jdm (jdm@moz-ilbt2e.cable.teksavvy.com) (Quit: )
[16:31:29] <steveklabnik> oh, the console?

[16:31:42] <cmr> I've previously used ConEmu with Rust successfully...
[16:32:13] <klutzy> yep, with lots of low-level hacks
[16:32:32] <klutzy> so it could cause issues with another os level hacks
[16:33:20] <WindowsBunny> Is he using the 32-bit or 64-bit rustc though?
[16:34:02] *** Quits: Rym (y@moz-rmaga4.range86-187.btcentralplus.com) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[16:34:10] <steveklabnik> he claimed 64
[16:34:32] <klutzy> it's os version, so strictly we don't know :)
[16:34:44] <WindowsBunny> If he was using a 32bit OS we'd know for sure
[16:34:53] <steveklabnik> oh right, he claimed OS, not rust version
[16:35:00] <klutzy> I guess 64-bit though (it's downloadable from index.html)
[16:35:35] <klutzy> so we should ask him to 1) provide rust package info and 2) run in cmd, not in conemu
[16:36:07] <WindowsBunny> rustc -vV
[16:36:23] <WindowsBunny> and yeah, figure out if its maybe ConEmu's fault
[16:37:11] <steveklabnik> cool, asked both
[16:38:19] <steveklabnik> thanks :)
[16:42:07] <WindowsBunny> Ah, this gem from that reddit post
[16:42:08] <WindowsBunny> >There are more Windows XP users than desktop Linux users. It would make  more sense for Chrome and Firefox to drop Linux support before dropping  XP support.
[16:42:19] <steveklabnik> yup
[16:42:27] <steveklabnik> so good
[16:42:49] <WindowsBunny> and yet here we are supporting linux first with windows XP not working at all
[16:44:40] <steveklabnik> well, linux is easier to support than XP
[16:45:14] <cmr> linux is more relevant than XP because servers
[16:45:15] <steveklabnik> reddit OP says they'll post info after lunch
[16:45:22] <steveklabnik> yeah, also that too
[16:45:34] <WindowsBunny> okay, this is weird
[16:45:41] <cmr> it shouldn't be hard to add XP support though, just need to stub out the slim RW locks.
[16:45:51] <cmr> and add a #[cfg] for pre-7

[17:05:00] <klutzy> interesting
[17:05:34] <klutzy> since I thought the issue may be solved after no green threads
[17:06:59] <proc> steveklabnik: the rename function is missing the description, that you can also move files with it, when they're on the same file system
[17:07:20] <cmr> you can't use rename when they aren't on the same filesystem.
[17:07:24] <steveklabnik> proc: sorry, what are you talking about?
[17:07:54] <proc> steveklabnik: had a talk earlier with cmr about http://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/fs/fn.rename.html
[17:07:56] <steveklabnik> oh!
[17:07:58] <steveklabnik> i didn't see that
[17:08:25] <proc> and a simple "you can move a file, when it's on the same filesystem" would've helped me ;)
[17:08:58] <steveklabnik> sorry, i'm also not parsing what you're saying
[17:09:08] <steveklabnik> what's the difference between 'moving' and 'renaming' a file here?
[17:09:38] <steveklabnik> mv/unix may have corrupted my brain
[17:10:09] <proc> renaming: file stays in the same location, I would've assume or rather: wasn't sure if it's possible to also move a file into another dir with this
[17:10:17] <steveklabnik> ahhhhhhh
[17:10:20] <proc> could be that I'm the only one not directly getting that
[17:10:36] <steveklabnik> sure, can you file a bug? i'd just fix it right now but i'm in the middle of a build
[17:10:43] <steveklabnik> in unix land, we don't have renames, only moves
[17:10:59] <cmr> I honestly have never heard of a "rename" doing a copy.
[17:11:06] <proc> steveklabnik: np, sorry for my bad english
[17:11:06] <steveklabnik> or at least, that's the way it's usually explained, i think coreutils have _something_
[17:11:17] <steveklabnik> no, i don't think it's your english at all :)
[17:11:29] <proc> cmr: well renaming a file or moving it to another folder *can* be something different
[17:11:33] <steveklabnik> it's just the perspective you tackle this problem from

[17:13:32] <geofft> oh yeah, I remember this from DOS forever ago, "rename" is strictly staying within the directory and "move" is anything more general than that 
[17:14:02] <geofft> probably because "rename" is literally renaming the directory entry and "move" involves deleting it and adding a new directory entry elsewhere 
[17:14:45] <steveklabnik> yup
[17:14:47] <geofft> so I'm not too surprised if DOS/Windows people think in terms of that distinction. 
[17:15:28] <cmr> the win32 functions act the same way as unix rename by default, but I didn't know that tidbit about DOS>
[17:15:41] <proc> geofft: never had to move much files in linux in own programs ^^

[19:15:15] <Eridius> huh, print!() and println!() explicitly panic if they got an error (such as EPIPE). I always assumed they ignored the error. This does not seem particularly good

[19:19:19] <Eridius> bstrie: yeah, if I want to handle errors I won't. But if I don't want to handle errors, I'd assume they'd be ignored
[19:19:48] <simukis> and then people complain that nothing gets printed
[19:19:55] <Eridius> nothing gets printed either way
[19:20:09] <simukis> but your program explodes loudly
[19:20:11] <Eridius> actually, they can't complain nothing gets printed, because we're talking about what happens if it's impossible to print :P
[19:20:26] <simukis> which at least points out that someting failed behind the scene
[19:20:35] <Eridius> most programs do not have "print something to stdout" as their sole purpose. A failure to print to stdout should not typically cause the entire program to explode
[19:20:56] <simukis> use write!(stdout(), …) then
[19:21:03] <simukis> not that much harder
[19:21:15] *** Joins: mgottschlag (quassel@moz-8uvcc8.hsi15.kabel-badenwuerttemberg.de)
[19:21:40] <Eridius> simukis: given that "this print is important, explode if it failed" should be the exceptional case, not the common case, then that's where you should have to write the more awkward writeln!(&mut io::stdout(), ...).unwrap()

[19:22:16] <Eridius> meanwhile all the code that uses println!() for normal informative texts will stop exploding
[19:22:20] <simukis> its not like things such as SIGPIPE happen often

[19:22:40] <Eridius> simukis: I feel like you're arguing for the status quo simply because it's the status quo, and not because it's the correct behavior
[19:22:57] <simukis> Eridius: I believe that it should either explode loudly or return Result
[19:23:53] <cmr> EPIPE is not exceptional.
[19:23:54] <Eridius> why should a normal println!() to stdout explode if stdout has been closed? That seems extremely surprising. println!() is the "I don't want to care about errors" convenience. Not the "This is important, please abort if I can't print"
[19:24:04] <bstrie> Eridius: mitsuhiko also hates that println! panics, I'm curious how he would feel about it silently ignoring errors instead...
[19:24:22] <Eridius> is there any precedent in other languages for the convenient "print to stdout" functionality aborting the process if it fails?
[19:24:42] <simukis> I remember that we actually ignore some signal
[19:25:15] <simukis> but only because some OSes emit signal *and* return an error code, when only result should be returned.
[19:25:26] *** Joins: erz (erz@moz-n2p94l.broadband.corbina.ru)
[19:25:44] <Eridius> that would probably be SIGPIPE

[19:27:16] <Eridius> FWIW, a test shows that Swift silently ignores errors from its println() function
[19:27:20] <Eridius> and I'm guessing all of the scripting langauges do too
[19:28:15] <bstrie> aturon: would it be a breaking change to make `println!` swallow all errors instead of panicking? this is a long-standing papercut, and swallowing errors here might have wide precedent
[19:28:41] <Eridius> it's undocumented, and it's surprising to me who's been writing Rust for a (relatively) long time. I'm guessing most people don't realize this
[19:29:04] <cmr> (surprise) strcat complained about it for a long time.
[19:29:24] <steveklabnik> iirc, we _do_ ignore certain errors
[19:30:16] * steveklabnik can't find the PR
[19:30:31] <steveklabnik> but some sort of change was at least suposed to be made here
[19:30:34] <steveklabnik> i think acrichto made it?
[19:32:35] <Eridius> huh, Swift actually ends up exiting with code 141 when a println() failed, but it doesn't abort the program
[19:32:53] <Eridius> i.e. it runs the rest of the program, but just changes the exit code from 0 to 141
[19:33:00] <Eridius> that's.. kind of weird

[21:29:42] <bstrie> wondering if there's a convenience function for reading from stdin that returns a string instead of taking a &mut String parameter
[21:30:24] <reem> nope
[21:30:42] <bstrie> wondering if we should add one, then :P
[21:30:45] <blaenk> man that is pretty annoying imo, that pattern of having to pass a parameter
[21:30:52] <blaenk> that's what it used to be bstrie, remember
[21:30:55] <blaenk> read_to_string()
[21:31:05] <blaenk> the benefit of passing a parameter is that you can read into an existing string
[21:31:12] <blaenk> instead of allocating only to pipe it to the existing string
[21:31:19] <bstrie> blaenk: I'm happy that the option is there, but sometimes it's just completely overkill
[21:31:27] <reem> io::Read is basically the only interface in rust std that uses “out params”
[21:31:40] <blaenk> in std

[22:26:53] <SimonSapin> Is there a replacement for std::old_io::timer::Timer?
[22:27:02] <SimonSapin> I mean oneshot and periodic timers, not just sleep()
[22:27:28] <XMPPwocky> SimonSapin: spawn a thread that spins on sleep()? :P
[22:27:50] <XMPPwocky> iirc that's what timer::Timer was doing internally, either that or using like channel timeouts
[22:28:12] <SimonSapin> that could kinda work, but seems way inferior to a single helper threads handling many timers with select()
[22:28:26] <SimonSapin> (it’s what Timer did)
[22:29:22] <XMPPwocky> mm
[22:31:06] <SimonSapin> "This module implements timers with a worker thread, select(), and a lot of witchcraft that turns out to be horribly inaccurate timers."
[22:31:15] <XMPPwocky> lol
[22:31:19] <XMPPwocky> that matches my experience
[22:31:23] <SimonSapin> great
[22:31:50] <XMPPwocky> the accuracy was worse than like 1ms, but it wasn't actually aligned to 1ms
