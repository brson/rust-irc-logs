[03:54:27] <Gankro> rude
[03:55:26] <huon> Gankro: yep, I've got this bot set up that will ping me when an r=Gankro PR is merged so I can go and find some nitpick
[03:55:28] <huon> just for you :P
[03:56:01] <Gankro> super rude
[03:56:35] <huon> it's what you get for being in SF before me
[03:56:51] <Gankro> I'm definitely stealing your chair now
[04:01:48] <huon> Gankro: that's a serious felony
[04:02:26] <Gankro> huon: I'm already an illegal immigrant here
[04:02:33] <Gankro> I think that's a federal offense
[04:02:50] <huon> did you accidentally forget to get a visa? :P
[04:04:40] <Gankro> More like I left all the docs I need for it at home and apparently my good looks made the border guard not seem to want them
[04:06:01] <huon> srsly?
[04:06:51] <Gankro> Yep
[04:06:52] <aatch> Yeah, you're not that good looking :P
[04:08:07] <huon> are you, like, getting them sent to you?
[04:11:48] <Gankro> huon: dunno yet
[04:11:56] <Gankro> crime lyfe
[04:12:34] <Gankro> There's a non-trivial chance I literally threw them away, because I am litterally the worst at reading official instructions?
[04:13:44] <huon> so you don't have a DS-2019 or DS-7002 or I-901?
[04:14:19] <Gankro> I think I have that last one
[04:15:28] <Gankro> I haven't gotten this far in life caring about things like "paper work" and "laws"
[04:19:52] <huon> it'd be hilarious if you were deported :P
[04:25:45] <Gankro> eh, got my free laptop. My work here is done ;)
[04:30:01] <huon> you get that laptop in exchange for 3 months of work :P

[17:37:51] <aturon> lib subteam: any thoughts on this Copy implementation? https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/21846#issuecomment-103609165 -- was left unresolved in the discussion on Pod/Copy
[17:39:10] <sfackler> Seems to me like "chainable" APIs like Iterator or builders that take self by value shouldn't be Copy
[17:39:28] <sfackler> seems like it'd be too easy to accidentally not apply changes where the should be
[17:41:20] <aturon> sfackler: yeah, so that's been our general policy,
[17:41:29] <aturon> which is why Copy was removed here in the first place
[17:41:38] <aturon> i guess the question here is, we may eventually get a lint to help with this,
[17:41:46] <aturon> but until that time, should we apply Copy?
[17:41:48] <cmr> Having them Clone but not Copy seems like a good balance to me for now.
[17:41:52] <sfackler> yeah
[17:41:54] <aturon> i guess i lean toward "no"
[17:42:08] <sfackler> not clear to me that the benefits of not having to write .clone() are worth it
[17:42:25] <cmr> I've flip-flopped on this issue a few times though.
[17:42:27] <aturon> sfackler: i think the concern is more that this prevents Copy applying when you embed in another struct
[17:42:41] <aturon> but still, seems like not a big thing
[17:42:47] <cmr> another concern that was raised is losing Cell.
[17:43:02] <cmr> Seems fine though, just an optimization.
[17:43:50] <aturon> yeah, and in the long run we *can* add Copy with the lint
[17:48:41] <sfackler> acrichto: what do you want to do about debug builder stability now? should we let it bake another release or so after the changes or stabilize now?
[17:52:40] <Gankro> huon: Ha! I win! Canada -> America's system is "we stamp your passport; you is to be legit ok"
[17:53:48] <acrichto> sfackler: I don't have too many thoughts, I think that we may want to stabilize in this cycle, slating them to be stable for 1.2, aturon do you feel any differently here?

[23:09:13] <bluss> vim is helping me
[23:09:29] <bluss> yeah I'm done with slices.rs now
[23:10:09] <Gankro> bluss: Surely some kind of general facility for "order hinting" or something would be better longterm?
[23:10:26] <Gankro> (also would clobber the git history less, though it's certainly pretty clobbered already)
[23:10:58] <cmr> Gankro: some sort of "method sections" feature would be neat.
[23:11:09] <bluss> maybe. I'm not going to derail this by developing a tool to do it though :)

[23:19:02] <Gankro> bluss: Before I blindly accept this PR without reviewing the actual code change, do you have an opinion on "x, x_mut, y, y_mut" vs "x, y, x_mut, y_mut"?
[23:19:35] <bluss> hehe the diff is pretty much unreviewable. This is the order used: https://etherpad.mozilla.org/7Do38wW2iz
[23:20:28] <bluss> Opinion.. I don't know. I prefer this, so x, x_mut
[23:23:23] <Gankro> bluss: Should each collection of methods be in an impl block with a comment labelling it?
[23:24:06] <Gankro> The individual impls will be actually seperated in rustdoc, and the comments at least clarify why that was done
[23:26:05] <bluss> I don't know, they are rough groups anyway
[23:28:57] <bluss> it's an inherent impl, so not sure if we can split it
[23:29:43] <Gankro> Yeah you can have as many inherent impls as you want...?
[23:29:47] <Gankro> Oh wait slice....
[23:30:03] <bluss> this is a special lang="slice" one
[23:30:22] <sfackler> we could update the compiler to coalesce multiple lang=slice impls in the same crate
