[07:19:35] <Yurume> about minecraft: I'm actually like to build things *within* constraints, i.e. survival. I have not much experience with circuitry building.
[07:19:45] <Yurume> I actually*
[07:22:10] <Yurume> I have a vanilla survival server shared with friends (nowadays I rarely join, though) which is wired with the 0MQ-backed sockets for the use in admin scripts, backup scripts and IRC bots.
[07:22:47] <Yurume> that really is crazy, given that mod servers give that sort of facility fairly easily
[07:23:16] <Yurume> but friends do not like the server mods for various reasons (for me, it hinders the update) so who cares.

[07:38:55] <bvssvni> when you get past 30 there is only one important decision left: beard or not beard

[07:39:15] <eddyb> "hacker"
[07:39:23] <bollu> lol. bread of course :) "no facial hair" 
[07:39:44] <bollu> I wish I could grow a beard...
[07:40:21] <eddyb> it's more trouble than it's worth
[07:40:31] <ecr> most of the moz rust devs are clean shaven. this may have impact on rust's chances for success
[07:41:14] <huon> there is at least one with a beard, so we're not completely doomed
[07:41:21] <bollu> ecr: lol. eddyb: I want to try it though. beards seem cool. I had less facial hair than my gf >_>

[07:42:22] <eddyb> but I'm not moz so I cba
[07:43:07] <ecr> mine grows in full, but i shave it once it gets itchy so i'm just perpetually scruffy.

[07:47:21] <bollu> how do I switch b/w rust and rust-offtopic?
[07:48:03] <bvssvni> bollu: I use mibbit, where I get tabs
[07:48:04] <ecr> most IRC clients have different tabs or something similar
[07:48:32] <bollu> ah, I'm using irssi for the heck of it.
[07:48:39] <bollu> will probably switch to pidgin
[07:48:55] <Yurume> bollu: Ctrl-N and Ctrl-P switches around the tabs.
[07:49:07] <Yurume> maybe Alt-1 thru Alt-0 will also work
[07:49:19] <Yurume> but that doesn't work well for lots of tabs (I have 30 of them...)
[07:49:35] <bollu> Yurume: Alt-1 -> Alt-0 switches terminal tabs, not irssi connections
[07:49:46] <cmr> yuck! evil!
[07:49:50] <Yurume> aww, then you should use Ctrl-N/P instead.
[07:49:52] <cmr> terminals that intercept keypresses are gross.
[07:50:17] <Yurume> Ctrl/Shift-Insert *is* sometimes useful

[09:19:50] <bollu_> anyone here?
[09:19:55] <cmr> bollu_: yes
[09:19:58] <huon> nope
[09:20:11] <bollu_> :)
[09:20:43] <bollu_> this is a weird question, but I've been wondering whether to major in math or in computer science. any advice ?
[09:21:24] <cmr> I did CS because then I can take all the math classes I want without having to take nasty things like real analysis.
[09:21:41] * huon <3 real analysis
[09:21:44] <huon> (slightly)
[09:22:17] <bollu_> it looks nice actually
[09:22:36] <bollu_> hm, so... if I like math, take math? xD
[09:23:08] <huon> yes
[09:23:23] <bollu_> but I love programming too! which is why I'm confused
[09:23:29] <huon> IME, CS is much easier to learn in your own time
[09:23:37] * huon did that
[09:24:56] <bollu_> hm. I see. dad says much the same thing, but I'm kind of undecided :/ like, there's so much in CS I don't know properly - compilers, OS (like, /build/ an OS), semantics...
[09:25:09] <bollu_> is it really possible to learn w/o help?
[09:25:13] <huon> just do CS courses while doing maths
[09:25:24] <huon> well, "own time" != "without help"
[09:25:26] <cmr> bollu_: all the resources are available without a degree.
[09:25:52] <huon> e.g. just hanging around #rust IRC and hacking on rustc you'll pick up a pile of knowledge
[09:25:59] <cmr> I'm actually thinking of switching majors from CS, to electrical engineering, or computer engineering...
[09:26:20] <bollu_> huon: xD perhaps. but the education system here isn't that flexible - you can't change majors for one.
[09:26:25] <bollu_> which is why I'm a little hesitant
[09:26:34] <bollu_> what if it turns out I don't like math all that much?
[09:26:39] <huon> bollu_: oh, may I ask where you are?
[09:26:44] <bollu_> India
[09:26:51] <huon> ah, I see
[09:27:34] <bollu_> I've liked whatever math I've learnt, but I'm not sure if i'll continue to like it 
[09:27:40] <bollu_> AFAIK, it gets brutal 
[09:28:04] <huon> yeah, parts of it are mind-bending
[09:28:16] * huon just finished a maths major
[09:28:31] <bollu_> xD
[09:28:38] <huon> what's the furthest/most interesting things you've learn?
[09:28:40] <huon> *learnt
[09:30:01] <bollu_> hm, well, bohr theory and beyond in chem, stuff like lorentz contraction and electricity in physics, and in math - complex numbers, analytical geometry, binomial dirstributions, and multivariable calculus
[09:30:21] <cmr> wow
[09:30:22] <bollu_> and a little of vector calculus 'cause of physics
[09:30:39] <cmr> the high school curriculum in the US is shit compared to that
[09:30:39] <bollu_> cmr: ?
[09:30:45] <bollu_> ah
[09:31:02] <bollu_> yeah. SAT is really easy. we studied that stuff in 10th grade
[09:31:04] <huon> well, if you've gone that deep and still like it, you'll probably enjoy at least some subset of any further maths you do
[09:31:04] <cmr> the school system thinks things like calculus and physics are "too hard" for kids.
[09:31:21] <bollu_> other than calc and electricity AFAIK
[09:31:23] <huon> (non-empty subset)
[09:31:28] <bollu_> huon: yeah, but I'm not sure :)
[09:31:29] <eddyb> SAT? depends
[09:31:44] <bollu_> eddyb: yeah. I've solved some of the papers
[09:31:46] <huon> bollu_: it'll be fine :)
[09:31:47] <eddyb> try breaking crypto with it
[09:32:00] <eddyb> coincidentally, I was in 10th grade as well =))
[09:32:07] <eddyb> (but completely unrelated to school)
[09:32:10] <bollu_> xD
[09:33:01] <bollu_> math is huge though which is what I like - so I have some confidence that there /will/ be some part of it I'll enjot I suppose. but I don't want to miss out on CS
[09:33:13] <huon> CS is "easy" :P
[09:33:16] <cmr> all the interesting bits of CS are just math anyway
[09:33:21] <huon> cmr++
[09:33:54] <bollu_> cmr: kind of I suppose :)
[09:34:31] <bollu_> cmr: I don't think they cover logic that much in math. do they?
[09:34:41] <bollu_> like, lambda calculus, godel's theorem,...
[09:34:42] <huon> sure they do
[09:34:43] <cmr> bollu_: sure do.
[09:34:43] <bollu_> that whole branch
[09:34:48] <cmr> all of it, math!
[09:35:09] <bollu_> cmr: no, I mean, do they teach that as part of an undergraduate course?
[09:35:13] <cmr> oh
[09:35:20] <cmr> dunno
[09:35:27] <bollu_> also, some of the more interesting uses of computers - FFT and the like?
[09:36:09] <huon> bollu_: there used to be an undergraduate course in logic and computing (i.e. turing machines) at my uni (until last year)
[09:36:26] <bollu_> huon: that's reassuring.
[09:36:31] <huon> and I spent my summer doing a numerical analysis research project about FFTs
[09:36:50] <bollu_> nice! I've read just a teensy bit of DSP. I really liked it.
[09:36:52] <huon> I kind-of-<3 floating point
[09:37:01] <huon> (it was under the guise of statistics, fwiw.)
[09:37:16] <bollu_> floating point is brilliant. and lol at that
[09:37:24] <huon> although very much the mathematical statistics end of stats
[09:37:34] <bollu_> huon: what's the other end?
[09:38:03] <huon> bollu_: getting real world data and analysing it
[09:38:07] * huon hates that
[09:38:19] <bollu_> huon: oh. but in the end, the principles are the same yes?
[09:38:49] <huon> well, one is "consider theoretical stuff" and the other is "open R and type some commands"
[09:38:53] <huon> in broad strokes :P
[09:38:58] <bollu_> xD
[09:39:02] * huon exaggerates
[09:39:44] <bollu_> of course :) I know a few of my dad's friends who are into semantics and stuff - it's always fun to talk to them
[09:40:04] <bollu_> math majors are super interesting because they know nuniversal thruths
[09:40:06] <bollu_> truths*
[09:40:12] <bollu_> *my opinion*
[09:40:37] <huon> "universal when you assume certain axioms" :P
[09:40:47] <bollu_> :) that's a given though
[09:40:55] <bollu_> you have to start *somewhere*
[09:40:58] <huon> the truths don't necessarily correspond to a model of the real world
[09:41:09] * huon hates when people mix up "maths" and "models of the real world"
[09:41:22] <huon> the former is sometimes, but not always, the latter
[09:41:45] <bollu_> huon: well, yeah. not everything in math maps to real real world. but our hope is that all of the real world does map back to math.
[09:41:52] <bollu_> is my understanding of it
[09:41:59] <cmr> screw the real world, I say.
[09:42:07] <huon> rm -rf /earth
[09:42:07] <cmr> I much prefer the integers.
[09:42:10] <bollu_> xD
[09:42:34] <cmr> nice and cozy, countably infinite... 
[09:42:34] <bollu_> only part of math I hated was hyperbolic geometry
[09:42:42] <bollu_> that stuff is against all intuition
[09:43:05] <bollu_> cmr: that's mind blowing too isn't it? different "kinds" of infinities
[09:43:12] <bollu_> my infinity is better than your infinity
[09:43:36] <huon> <3 cardinals
[09:44:19] * huon likes that there is no infinity that expresses the number of infinities there are
[09:44:22] <cmr> My mind was too busy being blown by special relativity, semiconductors, topology, and computability theory to even blink twice at the idea of a heirarchy of inifities.
[09:45:07] <bollu_> cmr: special relativity as in time dilation and all that jazz?
[09:45:10] <cmr> yes
[09:45:18] <bollu_> that actually made sense
[09:45:26] <bollu_> like, the derivations were fun to do
[09:45:34] <bollu_> the bouncing lights b/w 2 sources
[09:45:41] <bollu_> it was nice :D
[09:46:00] <cmr> this was before I even knew trig. It was mindblowing :P
[09:46:04] <bollu_> semiconductors though... my god, I still don't understand how the hell it behaves as an amplifier >_<
[09:46:14] <huon> can we swerve away from all this icky real-world physics please? #rust-offtopic-offtopic :P
[09:46:19] <bollu_> a switch makes /sense/ but a bloody amplifier? 
[09:46:22] * huon renames this to #rust-math
[09:46:24] <bollu_> xD
[09:46:38] <cmr> hey now
[09:46:38] <bollu_> cmr: how did you learn relativity before trig? -_^
[09:46:40] <cmr> I own this channel
[09:46:44] <bollu_> we had trig in eighth grade...
[09:46:52] <cmr> so did we
[09:46:57] <cmr> but I did not understand it in the slightest
[09:47:01] <bollu_> lol
[09:47:08] <cmr> I didn't grok trig until this past year ;(
[09:47:24] <bollu_> I went home and asked dad. he told me the unit circle definition of sin and cos
[09:47:29] <bollu_> that made so much sense
[09:47:35] <bollu_> and yeah, they didn't teach it well :(
[09:47:49] <cmr> I would argue that the unit circle definition does not make sense
[09:47:50] <huon> just look at the series of e^x, and then it's all obvious
[09:47:53] <cmr> sure you know what they *are*
[09:47:54] <huon> :P
[09:47:59] <bollu_> but once you learn vectors and stuff trig makes sense
[09:48:00] * huon lies
[09:48:02] <cmr> but not where they come from.....
[09:48:04] <cmr> I dunno
[09:48:07] <cmr> I'm weird about that
[09:48:09] <bollu_> huon: that is a terrible way to teach it
[09:48:13] <bollu_> e^ix
[09:48:24] <bollu_> that derivation based on taylor series left me sleepless
[09:48:30] <huon> bollu_: no need for sin and cos... just use exp everywhere
[09:48:53] <bollu_> ? sin x = e^x - e ^(-x) / 2? :P
[09:48:58] <bollu_> whole by 2
[09:49:00] <huon> something like that
[09:49:10] * huon isn't actually serious :P
[09:49:11] <bollu_> isn't that how sinhx is defined?
[09:49:11] * huon gtg
[09:49:16] <bollu_> bye!
[09:49:20] <bollu_> sinh(ix) = sinx
[09:49:22] <huon> well, the sin one would have i's in it
[09:49:23] <huon> yeah
[09:49:34] <huon> closely linked, etc.
[09:49:42] <bollu_> yep. I still hate those
[09:49:49] <bollu_> can never remember their derivatives
[09:50:01] <bollu_> and their inverses are worse :(
[09:50:10] <bollu_> anyway, bye!
[09:51:39] <bollu_> cmr: you still here?
[09:51:47] <cmr> yes
[09:52:01] <bollu_> your opinion? CS or math?
[09:56:54] <bollu_> <no opinion> ? :)
[09:57:06] <cmr> sorry
[09:57:08] <cmr> working on something
[09:57:09] <cmr> I mean
[09:57:18] <cmr> personally I think math is more engaging and challening
[09:57:40] <cmr> CS is "boring" and I can learn it on my own, as exemplified by the first 18 years of my life.
[10:00:45] <bollu_> hmm. you think I know enough CS to teach myself the rest of it?
[10:00:52] <bollu_> with help?
[10:01:24] <eddyb> bollu_: everyone does
[10:01:30] <eddyb> >:D<
[10:02:16] <bollu_> xD
[10:02:44] <bollu_> wait, you mean "everyone knows enough CS to teach themselves" right?
[10:02:54] <bollu_> that sentence was a tad ambiguous

[16:07:40] <bollu|away> ah okay
[16:07:54] <bollu|away> just wanted to let you know that two steps from hell is awesome
[16:08:10] <bollu|away> and also - many of their songs have Hindi in them which is a nice thing I suppose :)
[16:08:55] <eddyb> is it hindi?
[16:09:07] <eddyb> there was a language nobody could understand
[16:09:12] <eddyb> and the internet was saying it's made up
