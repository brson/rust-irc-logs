[00:06:20] <reem> The closure based APIs are much less convenient, since they aren’t ownership based
[00:06:40] <reem> e.g. you have to pass in a closure
[00:06:56] <reem> (and if you wrap an API taking a closure *you also* have to take a closure)
[00:07:09] <FreeFull> huon: I can imagine some sort of compile-time reference count, that counts the depth of Rc trees/dags in terms of types
[00:07:23] <FreeFull> Where a loop would be disallowed, because it'd cause an infinite count
[00:07:47] <huon> FreeFull: I'm unsure if that's feasible, unfortunately
[00:07:57] <FreeFull> That'd be very complicated to introduce, definitely
[00:07:59] <huon> e.g. trait objects
[00:09:52] <FreeFull> Speaking of trait objects, how do they conserve Drop?
[00:10:07] <huon> the destructor is in the vtable
[00:10:09] <reem> The most unfortunate thing imo is that thread::spawn used to be just a special case of thread::scoped, but now they have to have entirely different APIs just because one is specialized to ‘static.

[01:53:14] <lahwran> it might have been here
[01:53:15] <lahwran> but it was good
[01:54:34] <Eridius> bstrie: I don't really have any firsthand experience with the pre-NES consoles (a tiny bit of poking at an Atari years after it was irrelevant). I've heard of references to what I guess is the great videogame crash but never heard it described as the great videogame crash until today, or realized quite how much of an impact it had
[01:58:33] <Havvy> Is there a chance we can get `http://this-week-in-rust.org/latest` as a working endpoint?

[02:03:57] <scott> indie gaming is currently in a bubble, or the tail end of one
[02:04:05] <lahwran> you think so?
[02:04:13] <scott> yeah
[02:04:15] <bstrie> I don't know if indie gaming can be a bubble, by definition
[02:04:26] <lahwran> yeah I'm not sure how that could be in a bubble
[02:04:31] <scott> why?
[02:04:32] <bstrie> if you're indie, you don't make any money
[02:04:34] <lahwran> seems like there are a lot of holes in that bubble
[02:04:46] <lahwran> it'd just leak out
[02:04:50] <lahwran> because nobody pays attention to it
[02:05:01] <scott> that's not true, there was a huge influx of indie games a few years ago and a bunch of people making a lot of money
[02:05:14] <scott> now it's an extremely flooded market
[02:05:15] <lahwran> well I mean
[02:05:17] <lahwran> oh
[02:05:23] <lahwran> that doesn't seem like a bubble to me
[02:05:37] <lahwran> a bubble is where it's only valuable because everyone thinks it's going to become more valuable
[02:05:48] <lahwran> but there isn't actually a reason for it
[02:06:06] <lahwran> if there actually is a reason for it, and that reason goes away, that's just a gold rush
[02:06:19] <lahwran> that often leads to a bubble
[02:06:22] <lahwran> but is not the same as one
[02:06:24] <scott> perhaps that's all it is then, a gold rush
[02:06:37] <scott> which has dried up for indie gaming
[02:06:38] <lahwran> and yeah I haven't seen any indie games I liked in a while
[02:06:44] <bstrie> the reason why I say that indie gaming can't be a bubble by my definition is because indie developers make games because they want to make games
[02:06:53] <lahwran> right, that too
[02:06:53] <bstrie> if you're out to make millions, you are a professional developer
[02:07:04] <lahwran> well
[02:07:05] <lahwran> not exactly
[02:07:06] <lahwran> no
[02:07:12] <scott> I don't think that's true about indie developers
[02:07:17] <cmr> bstrie: indie != hobbiest
[02:07:18] <lahwran> indie games are definitely startups for games
[02:07:48] <cmr> "independently funded", ie, sans publisher.
[02:07:51] <tiffany> havvy: no, ads are currently in declining revenue
[02:08:02] <bstrie> we must have drastically different definitions of indie
[02:08:03] <tiffany> "the cloud" is probably a bubble
[02:08:17] <tiffany> this crazy fanaticism over mobile apps is probably a bubble too, and it's closely tied to "the cloud"
[02:08:19] <scott> bstrie: the meaning of the word has shifted
[02:08:20] <lahwran> heh I actually work at a company that is attempting to pop that bubble
[02:08:27] <lahwran> the cloud one, that is
[02:08:53] <cmr> depends on what you mean by "cloud". if you use the only sane definition, ie http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2009/EECS-2009-28.pdf, no.
[02:09:04] <scott> bstrie: cf. the music industry for another area where the meaning has shifted, and to an even more ridiculous extent
[02:09:21] <lahwran> I had indian food for lunch
[02:09:23] <lahwran> I want more indian food
[02:09:39] <tiffany> cmr: not that definition
[02:09:45] <tiffany> that is far too general for what I am referring to
[02:09:56] <huon> a collect of water vapour?
[02:09:58] <tiffany> that includes services like AWS, and in fact, any kind of VPS hosting provider
[02:09:59] <huon> *collection
[02:10:08] <tiffany> I'm thinking of centralised websites which poorly integrate
[02:10:18] <tiffany> social networking services and such
[02:10:20] <cmr> yes, of course it does, that's exactly what cloud computing actually is.
[02:10:47] <bstrie> lahwran: your description of "indie games as startups for games" makes me want to lie face down in a ditch and die
[02:10:55] <tiffany> well, what would you have me use to refer to the things I'm thinking of?
[02:11:01] <lahwran> bstrie: I know a great therapist
[02:11:13] <bstrie> lahwran: I hope they are willing to make house calls (ditch calls)
[02:11:15] <tiffany> they are centralised web services, and what most people usually think of when you say "cloud"
[02:11:21] <tiffany> specifically: web
[02:11:27] <lahwran> bstrie: why does that make you want to die though
[02:11:33] <cmr> "web apps"?
[02:11:38] <lahwran> I think you have weird ideas about something if that makes you want to die
[02:11:40] <tiffany> I guess?
[02:11:43] <tiffany> web apps are a bubble, then
[02:11:47] <cmr> what you're describing sounds more like SaaS or one of the aaS's
[02:11:55] <lahwran> software as an ass
[02:12:03] <scott> bstrie: mostly people view it as a continuum from indie to AAA. those are just the names of the endpoints for whatever reason
[02:12:10] <Havvy> lahwran:  ass[istant]?
[02:12:14] <lahwran> lol
[02:12:25] <scott> bstrie: and both terms are ill-defined
[02:12:29] <lahwran> software assistant services
[02:12:35] <bstrie> lahwran: I have strong enough opinions about video games and the video game industry that I had to extricate myself from the entire scene a few years back. I just couldn't go on
[02:12:36] <lahwran> or for short, soft ass served
[02:12:42] <cmr> lol
[02:12:59] <scott> lahwran: reminds me of the course at my university that shows up in the catalogue as Math Anal Bus Econ
[02:13:25] <tiffany> twitter versus statusnet, dropbox vs (insert preferred p2p file hosting solution), facebook vs diaspora, gmail vs your own mail server, imgur vs your own webserver, and so on
[02:13:33] <scott> it's something like 'mathematical analysis for business economics'
[02:13:40] <tiffany> I am actually having a hard time drawing examples because I try to avoid these things
[02:13:56] <tiffany> trello vs org-mode
[02:14:06] <cmr> So just centralized everything instead of federated or otherwise decentralized protocols?
[02:14:07] <lahwran> tiffany: what
[02:14:09] <scott> bstrie: it's a pretty awful industry, unfortunately
[02:14:18] <tiffany> every single app that 10 years ago was a desktop application you bought for $19.95, is now a web app that you buy for $4.99/month
[02:14:35] <tiffany> cmr: or just straight running stuff locally
[02:14:37] <lahwran> oh man I sure hope it never goes back to buy-once
[02:14:50] <lahwran> even if it becomes decentralized, I like having actually active devs working on things I use
[02:14:58] <tiffany> unless you install google drive as a chrome app, you can't edit documents while offline if that is your only application for that purpose
[02:15:40] <tiffany> lahwran: I would rather have each software package be sufficiently small and everything have standardised protocols that each one can be maintained by a single individual and easily replaced
[02:15:52] <lahwran> so?
[02:15:57] <tiffany> even if you're paying a monthly fee, there's no guarantee the devs are still going to be running the service in 10 years
[02:16:05] <lahwran> oh for sure
[02:16:07] <tiffany> better to minimize dependencies on things which are transient
[02:16:10] <lahwran> but it's going to be closed source anyway
[02:16:22] <lahwran> expect anything you pay for to be transient
[02:16:23] <tiffany> uhh
[02:16:30] <tiffany> well okay
[02:16:33] <tiffany> I don't have a good answer to that
[02:16:37] <lahwran> realistically, even buy-once packages are like that

[02:27:25] <tiffany> I have tried freenet
[02:27:27] <tiffany> it's not very good
[02:27:29] <Havvy> Plus apparently Reika doing other "syncing" on world load.
[02:27:34] <LinuxBunny> freenet is very slow
[02:27:46] <tiffany> it also does not address the problem of content becoming inaccessible
[02:28:00] <tiffany> iirc it eventually deletes documents
[02:28:19] <LinuxBunny> if nobody accesses something in forever, eventually it vanishes
[02:28:20] <scott> digital media become inaccessible really quickly compared to physical media
[02:28:25] <lahwran> part of the problem here is that the underlying physical reality, well, has limits
[02:28:38] <scott> games from 10 or 20 years ago can be difficult to play at all, for example
[02:28:41] <tiffany> the way everyone tries to closely guard their source is problematic for trying to save data
[02:28:48] <scott> whereas ancient paintings are still mostly fine
[02:28:53] <tiffany> and there's no easy way to fix it
[02:29:01] <bstrie> scott: that's a hardware problem, though
[02:29:02] <tiffany> besides instituting richard stallman as the dictator of the world
[02:29:06] <lahwran> ugh
[02:29:11] <lahwran> no, someone shoot him
[02:29:14] <LinuxBunny> tiffany, You can only save old data that nobody really wants by having significant storage hardware dedicated to storing that data
[02:29:21] <lahwran> ^
[02:29:23] <tiffany> linuxbunny: we can manage it
[02:29:29] <tiffany> it's just that nobody is incentivised to do so
[02:29:29] <lahwran> donate to the internet archive
[02:29:36] <scott> archive.org is great
[02:29:39] <tiffany> the internet archive cannot archive web apps
[02:29:52] <LinuxBunny> I hate web apps
[02:29:55] <scott> they have some old DOS games you can play in-browser
[02:30:03] <scott> maybe they need a web emulator for web apps
[02:30:09] <lahwran> a web emulator
[02:30:12] <scott> ;)
[02:30:13] <lahwran> you mean like a web browser?
[02:30:17] <bstrie> who needs the internet archive when you've got http://www2.warnerbros.com/spacejam/movie/jam.htm
[02:30:41] <LinuxBunny> lahwran, with a web server implemented in JS running in your browser
[02:30:48] <tiffany> I like sandstorm.io
[02:30:57] <tiffany> it has the promise of making a dent into those web apps I still use
[02:30:58] <LinuxBunny> lahwran, and that JS server is running PHP
[02:31:00] <scott> node.js in the browser
[02:31:05] <scott> it's the future
[02:31:18] <LinuxBunny> lahwran, imagine running PHP on top of JS :P
[02:31:28] <scott> anyone remember Phuby on Phails?
[02:33:02] <tiffany> sandstorm.io already has two mail clients
[02:33:25] <tiffany> and it also has a trello clone which got DMCA'd for perfectly replicating trello's theme

[03:07:56] <barosl> Why? Isn't that an advantage?

[03:09:36] <whipsch> wow
[03:09:40] <whipsch> thats kind of impressive
[03:10:44] <barosl> I've always hated the current performance of CPython, so improving the "official" implementation sounds very wonderful to me
[03:11:26] <barosl> Like... I'm gonna try to return to PHP if PHP 7 is good enough...
[03:12:02] <barosl> Damn, this sounds like a sacrilege!

[03:12:21] <whipsch> :)
[03:12:36] <whipsch> i kid, i may end up working at a php shop soon...
[03:12:51] <scott> I have such a myopic view of tech
[03:12:56] <scott> I learned programming on PHP years ago
[03:13:00] <scott> then quickly moved on
[03:13:16] <scott> the idea of people using it today feel like they're sticking to ancient history from my perspective
[03:13:20] <whipsch> i think thats the story for a lot of people
[03:13:32] <whipsch> those who still use it are likely just stuck with it for any number of reasons
[03:13:35] <whipsch> or they are just stupid
[03:14:05] <scott> I never did web development with PHP, just IRC bots.....
[03:14:13] <whipsch> at least facebook tried to make it better with HHVM and then Hack
[03:14:39] <barosl> You know what? Google's trying to reduce the warts of JS by introducing "strong mode"
[03:14:51] <whipsch> isnt that what use strict is for
[03:14:52] <scott> strict mode JS is already a thing
[03:15:05] <barosl> strong mode guarantees more
[03:15:18] <scott> sounds good then
[03:15:21] <barosl> e.g. Accessing nonexistent fields is an exception, not an undefined
[03:15:22] <scott> JS is pretty wild
[03:15:27] <whipsch> does it introduce strong typing :D
[03:16:13] <barosl> https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1v38H64XQBNT1p2XzFGWWhCR1k/view
[03:16:20] <Havvy> whipsch:  It does not.
[03:16:21] <barosl> And it also limits == coersions
[03:16:41] <barosl> It was originally called "sane mode"
[03:16:49] <lahwran> why'd they change it
[03:17:00] <barosl> But you know what? PHP 7 also adds this!
[03:17:04] * Havvy would love to have seen `==` disallowed in strict mode.
[03:17:13] <barosl> While Google's "strong mode" is still experimental, PHP 7's coming really soon
[03:17:17] <barosl> This fall
[03:17:35] <barosl> So I'm really confused
[03:17:45] <barosl> Is PHP really becoming a language that is bearable?
[03:18:08] <lahwran> I'm sure it will eventually
[03:18:35] <lahwran> the thing about forcing actual programmers to use things is that those actual programmers actually want to work in a good language, and eventually push hard enough to make it become that way
[03:18:37] <lahwran> see also java
[03:19:11] <barosl> It also makes the language complex, though
[03:19:18] <lahwran> this is true
[03:19:20] <barosl> But I'm sure that PHP is already fairly complex
[03:19:24] <lahwran> oh man
[03:20:07] <scott> I love that PHP used \ for namespacing
[03:20:13] <scott> only in PHP could this become a reality
[03:20:19] <barosl> I thought it was an awful idea
[03:20:22] <lahwran> well and windows
[03:20:31] <barosl> But... hey, it reduces some key strokes
[03:20:41] <scott> it's a lot less jarring in paths than a programming language
[03:20:45] <whipsch> is php 7 going to use a real parser
[03:20:48] <barosl> I'm not a fan or the :: operator
[03:20:53] <whipsch> or did they already do that
[03:21:01] <barosl> whipsch, Yes, they've introduced AST in PHP 7
[03:21:02] <lahwran> a real parser would probably break backwards cmopat
[03:21:14] <barosl> Which means... they hadn't used AST until PHP 7
[03:21:19] <whipsch> haha
[03:21:22] <whipsch> oh man
[03:22:06] <barosl> I had wondered why things like `get_array()['abc']` is not allowed in PHP
[03:22:13] <barosl> That may be the reason
[03:23:06] <whipsch> pretty much

[12:12:43] <Havvy> Well, just think of all the default configuration you aren't changing.

[12:13:43] <mrmonday> Havvy: I think I explicitly set most of the default configuration stuff - my config works in a ton of different environments which mess around with the defaults, so I explicitly set them so I know what's going on

[12:14:17] <Havvy> Does that include key configs?  ;)
[12:14:30] <mrmonday> key configs?
[12:14:45] <Havvy> E.g. that `d` means delete.

[15:35:27] <libfud> hey Dr-Emann 
[15:35:56] <libfud> I'm looking for some feedback on how I parse and translate tokens
[15:37:27] <libfud> big picture is pretty similar to how rcalc's worked, if you remember that
[15:37:28] <bombless> In C if I want to jump forward I sometimes use `do { /* ... */ } while(0)`, so if I really need similar thing in Rust I guess I will build a macro for it.
[15:37:43] <libfud> what
[15:38:21] <libfud> why not loop { thing(); if condition { break } }?
[15:39:04] <bombless> hmm if you wrap it with macro sometimes you feel some fresh air
[15:39:09] <bombless> but it depends
[15:39:31] <mrmonday> libfud: or, the more obscure while { thing(); false } {} :>
[15:39:59] <libfud> I'm
[15:40:00] <libfud> what
[15:40:15] <bombless> translate tokens? you mean like `>>` to `>` + `>` in rustc
[15:40:16] <bombless> ?
[15:40:24] <libfud> no
[15:40:29] <libfud> parsing S Expressions
[15:40:36] <bombless> oh `while { thing(); false } {}` looks funny
[15:40:49] <libfud> I make a struct that implements iterator
[15:40:50] <mrmonday> libfud: so a while loop in Rust is while <expr> <block>
[15:41:02] <libfud> I haven't really used while in a while
[15:41:06] <mrmonday> so you can use a block expression as the expression, and evaluate to false at the end
[15:41:09] <libfud> and I thought its use was generally discouraged?
[15:41:11] <mrmonday> then have an empty block
[15:41:15] <mrmonday> and it will be run once
[15:41:28] <mrmonday> I use while when I need a while loop
[15:41:32] <mrmonday> I don't use it like the above
[15:41:41] <bombless> why do you translate tokens for S-expr? because you don't use lexer?
[15:41:59] <libfud> it's just a hand rolled thing
[15:42:04] <bombless> hmm wait.. :(
[15:42:05] <libfud> I translate them into a recursive data structure
[15:42:55] <lahwran> why the hell would you do `while { ...; false } {}`instead of just `{ ...; }`
[15:43:31] <bombless> I made a simple enum for S-expr, then the compiler complains about "overflow evaluating the requirement `_ : core::marker::Sized`"
[15:43:46] <lahwran> is it an ICE?
[15:43:48] <bombless> so I went back and started with simpler things
[15:44:21] <libfud> (sched \"foo\" (program (local \"/home/libfud/Videos/bar.mp4\") (instrs (play 00:00:00 00:15:00) (program (local ... ) (instr (play ))) (play 00:15:00 ))) (program (network \"http://baz.qux/abc\") ...))
[15:44:26] <libfud> that's pretty long winded
[15:44:40] <libfud> but it'd be a schedule struct with a vector of programs
[15:44:44] <lahwran> what is that
[15:44:48] <libfud> which have a location, tags (which are all optional)
[15:44:53] <libfud> and a vector of instructions
[15:44:58] <lahwran> that looks suspiciously like nyquist api
[15:45:02] <libfud> like play from the beginning for fifteen minutes
[15:45:04] <libfud> what's nyquist
[15:45:12] <libfud> then play another program
[15:45:23] <libfud> then play from fifteen minutes to the end of it
[15:45:24] <bombless> lahwran: no it's not, I'll try if I can reproduce that.
[15:45:57] <bombless> https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/4287#issuecomment-93708048
[15:46:03] <lahwran> nyquist is a lisp api for audio manipulation
[15:46:12] <bombless> lahwran: a little bit similar as this funny thing ^
[15:46:14] <libfud> oh neat
[15:46:33] <sillesta> anyone seen euclideans "unlimited detail" demo :p?
[15:46:47] <lahwran> it doesn't actually work
[15:46:49] <lahwran> I mean
[15:46:54] <lahwran> it works for exactly what they showed
[15:46:55] <lahwran> and nothing else
[15:47:08] <libfud> sillesta: I vaguely recall something like that
[15:47:11] <libfud> I call shenanigans
[15:47:12] <lahwran> huge amounts of *repetitive* detail, *without any animation*
[15:47:16] <sillesta> http://udserver.euclideon.com/demo/
[15:47:43] <libfud> so, the overall design of the struct that implements Iterator
[15:47:45] <sillesta> uses emscripten from what i can see
[15:47:56] <libfud> is that it takes an input string, and has a mutable index
[15:48:09] <libfud> and takes a vector of functions to see if a part of the string is a token
[15:48:15] <sillesta> quality is not that impressive, looks worse than voxlap in most cases
[15:48:38] <libfud> since something might be illegal, it returns Result<T, U> as its item instead of just T
[15:48:42] *** Quits: Binero (jeroen@moz-rp278g.access.telenet.be) (Client exited)
[15:49:16] <libfud> and also since something might not look like it has anything wrong with it, but just isn't a valid token, that also returns an Error if you go through all the functions in the vector
[15:49:32] <lahwran> sillesta: whoa
[15:49:37] <lahwran> for allegedly unlimited detail
[15:49:40] <lahwran> that's not very high detail
[15:50:08] <sillesta> note that it's streaming the data
[15:50:27] <sillesta> and the scenes are apparently in the 10-100 gigabyte range

[15:51:01] <sillesta> either way i don't find it meets the promises they said a few years ago
[15:51:07] <lahwran> yeah
[15:51:15] <lahwran> it has exactly the limitations one would have expected
[15:51:15] <lahwran> :p
[15:51:26] <libfud> outside of pretty looking fractals
[15:51:42] <sillesta> yup, despite their claims that "oh we have a solution for that, we just can't tell you"
[15:51:43] <libfud> do you think you could guarantee something good looking that was procedurally generated
[15:52:09] <libfud> I don't trust anything that's closed source
[15:52:50] <lahwran> absolutely I could generate something good looking that was procedurally generated
[15:52:53] * lahwran loves procedural gen
[15:52:58] <libfud> and I won't *use* anything that's closed source unless it's from a huge, big-name company that stands to lose a lot for doing something malicious (outside of, you know, stripping your liberties from you and watching you for 3 letter agencies)

[15:55:27] <bombless> Hmm rustc from master branch doesn't complains about overflow now... instead it just block there and eat CPU cycles.
[15:55:51] <libfud> oh
[15:56:02] <libfud> maybe I shouldn't update til the next nightly then
[15:56:13] <libfud> not that I have anything like that (I think...)
[15:56:25] <lahwran> sillesta: yeah they fail
[15:56:26] <libfud> anyway
[15:56:28] <lahwran> this was new in the 90s
[15:56:40] <libfud> do you guys see anything about that that could be made better/simpler?
[15:56:42] <sillesta> the article or euclidean?
[15:57:07] <lahwran> euclidean
[15:57:13] <lahwran> though also
[15:57:23] <lahwran> this could be really cool for use on bumpy things like ground
[15:57:48] <lahwran> because honestly bumpmapping looks awful
[15:58:02] <bombless> I just add a `debug!` to every `parse_*` function inside libsyntax::parse::parser.rs, and it compiles like 3 times slower now.
[15:58:04] <sillesta> only if you're close :)
[15:58:13] <lahwran> :|
[15:58:28] <sillesta> lahwran: maybe LOD scheme going from bumpmapping to tessellation?
[15:58:39] <lahwran> that would be cool
[15:58:49] <lahwran> the problem I always have with LOD is that it doesn't stay ahead of you
[15:59:13] <libfud> so nyquist looks really cool
[15:59:17] <sillesta> also bumpmapping et. al can be used for really cool stuff ( http://simonschreibt.de/gat/windows-ac-row-ininite/ )

[16:01:38] <tiffany> imgur autoconverts gif to webm now

[16:09:23] <Astrum|Lap> so ridiculous
[16:09:29] <tiffany> I almost instantly noticed that the parallax effect was really off in that saints row gif
[16:09:59] <sillesta> i was more thinking of the one in bioshock
[16:10:01] <tiffany> and I noticed it's because it is a perspective texture, and it has to be, since the merch on the shelves would only be 1 pixel wide if it was an orthogonal projection
[16:10:06] <bombless> firefox-S
[16:10:46] <tiffany> but an orthogonal projection would be how you get the perspective correct
[16:10:52] <libfud> I also want to see Crow
[16:10:55] <tiffany> it is a neat trick though
[16:10:55] <libfud> it's a perfect analogy too
[16:11:27] <libfud> browser engine called Servo and an email client called Crow
[16:12:14] <sillesta> what does servo mean?
[16:12:29] <libfud> you probably never watched MST3K
[16:13:15] <libfud> Crow and Servo were robots on board the Satellite of Love who had to watch terrible movies with Joel, their creator

[16:26:08] <libfud> still mad about that
[16:26:18] <libfud> how is it?
[16:27:03] <tiffany> I've only played the tutorial
[16:27:24] <tiffany> it looks interesting, units aren't disposable like they are in most rts games
[16:27:42] <tiffany> you have to be careful to make sure not to get them in a situation where they get killed, since they level up and get much more powerful
[16:28:02] <tiffany> a level 2 unit is almost twice as strong
[16:28:07] <libfud> also, I'm thinking that it would be a lot easier to parse (tags (director "John Woo") (cast (list "Foo" "Bar" "Baz"))) than (tags director="John Woo" cast="Foo, Bar, Baz")

[16:29:52] <lahwran> it's quite an experience
[16:29:53] <scott> {:foo 1 :bar 2}
[16:30:01] <scott> you can include commas since commas are whitespace in Clojure
[16:30:03] <tiffany> lahwran: I hope to get a new one this year
[16:30:26] <sillesta> the europa universalis series is also quite entertaining
[16:30:43] <libfud> I wonder why parens put everyone off
[16:30:50] <tiffany> I think this one is around 4 years old
[16:30:59] <scott> I haven't played europa universalis, but crusader kings 2 from the same developers has eaten a ridiculous amount of my time
[16:31:07] <libfud> I mean, I get that it's kind of hard to keep track of it sometimes, but that's the nature of deeply nested code
[16:31:21] <sillesta> they are putting out a new one (the ww2 series) soon
[16:31:29] <libfud> it's still much more readable (and more importantly  *parseable* by computers) than XML
[16:31:47] <tiffany> S-exprs are pretty okay
[16:31:48] <scott> libfud: I think it's just a knee-jerk reaction seeing )))))) for the first time
[16:32:02] <libfud> I don't buy the argument that XML is good for human consumption
[16:32:03] <tiffany> I prefer concatenative languages, even though parsing those means you have to know how many arguments each thing takes
[16:32:12] <tiffany> lol xml is awful for human consumption
[16:32:13] <scott> once you learn that you read the indentation in Lisp, it's a lot easier

[16:35:40] <libfud> check this out
[16:35:48] <tiffany> it would be easier to parse, and nobody would try to correct errors like html does..
[16:35:56] <tiffany> it is such a horrible thing that html tries to correct invalid input
[16:35:57] <scott> I like formats with equivalent binary and human-readable formats
[16:36:01] <scott> LLVM IR is an example
[16:36:04] <libfud> ah, trying to find the link
[16:37:07] <niconii> i can't really stand html's syntax, but there is stuff like haml which makes it a lot more bearable

[16:37:35] <tiffany> if I had to write blog posts in html that would not be fun
[16:39:02] <bombless> You can "write" HTML in Clojure I think.
[16:39:19] <scott> there's a lot of ways to write HTML without writing it
[16:39:42] <libfud> it's much easier to convert something to html than from it

[16:44:15] <tiffany> css scales so poorly
[16:44:27] <tiffany> every feature you add has chaotic interactions with every other feature..
[16:44:50] <bombless> xhtml is extensible anyway
[16:44:54] <tiffany> the way floats work is just insane, too

[17:13:04] <Gliptic> have they solved the reusability problems of railguns yet
[17:13:18] <libfud> idk
[17:13:42] <libfud> but I do remember they had issues with the EMP generated from testing the magnetic launcher system of the Ford

[17:14:26] <libfud> whoa
[17:14:27] <Gliptic> they'll just be supplanted by digital railguns
[17:14:30] <libfud> Sweden has guns?
[17:14:34] <fmtq> uh
[17:14:35] <WindowsBunny> fmtq: wut
[17:14:39] <fmtq> 30 per 100 people mate.
[17:14:50] <GaryOak_> If you go to Idaho you can encounter untrained high schoolers with guns
[17:14:55] <Astrum|Lap> I used to work next to the CDC
[17:14:57] <libfud> I bet the US has like 100 per 30

[17:15:01] <fmtq> yes, but I won't go to Idaho, GaryOak_.

[17:16:43] <libfud> guns per capita is directly proportional to Freedom (TM)
[17:16:50] <fmtq> there is a correlation between gun deaths and gun cultures, not gun numbers.
[17:16:57] <fmtq> the numbers contribute to the deaths in the idiot cultures.
[17:17:00] <niconii> oh, someone deleted serbia, which was #2
[17:17:05] <niconii> hang on, i'll revert it
[17:17:12] <fmtq> SERBIA STRONK
[17:17:20] <Astrum|Lap> although if I could I'd definitely get an an-94

[17:19:09] <fmtq> the unhealthy obsession with death and killing but show a tit on TV and you're going to be ostracised for all eternity buddy 
[17:19:16] <libfud> the .38s is a snub nose revolver

[17:19:23] <libfud> I don't think everyone should have a gun
[17:19:40] <libfud> once I was out on the porch smoking a cigarette late at night
[17:19:54] <fmtq> you shouldn't have a gun unless you have a purpose for it.
[17:20:03] <libfud> a few minutes later, my little sister came up to my room and asked me if I would lend her my revolver
[17:20:09] <libfud> because she heard someone outside and got scared
[17:20:13] <libfud> ...obviously I said no.

[17:21:54] <libfud> I found that he had shot my laptop

[17:23:49] <Gliptic> libfud, don't they say that.. if only the other guys had a gun, they could shoot the crazy guy with the gun
[17:23:51] <fmtq> Very few. Because of the broad interpretation of the constitution.
[17:23:57] <fmtq> and ownership isn't even the whole issue
[17:24:00] <fmtq> where you're allowed to take it is an issue.
[17:24:01] <Gliptic> the solution to every problem is obviously guns
[17:24:02] <Astrum|Lap> 'lots' is relative I suppose =P

[17:24:17] <fmtq> Astrum|Lap: dude, in absolute terms the US has the most guns in the world.

[19:43:13] <GaryOak_> Is it Rye-man, or Ree-man
[19:43:20] <Astrum|Lap> ree
[19:43:30] <scott> people here would probably catch on to Galois _if_ they realized it was a French name. otherwise, totally wrong

[19:44:18] <Astrum|Lap> well if you tell them the guys first name... Éveriste
[19:44:22] <cmr> I did it Eww-ler before I knew.

[19:45:08] <lahwran> just less badly so
[19:45:27] <cmr> I never had problems with Galois, probably because I recognized it as obviously french.
[19:45:30] <scott> Frank Pfenning is a fun one for people unaccustomed to the German pf, but they probably wouldn't get it wrong
[19:45:34] <Astrum|Lap> it's close enough, lahwran

[21:58:04] <fmtq> look the blender consented to the vivisection
[22:00:03] <niconii> fmtq: and i'm not talking about the rust st-- actually that'd be pretty hard too

[23:36:50] <bluss> it was distracting
[23:37:10] <bluss> and we now are without the stability colors in third party docs too which is great
[23:40:02] <scott> that's subjective, of course. I found it easy to scan with my eyes and see what was or wasn't stable
[23:40:16] <scott> makes sense not to have a bunch of grey bars for 3rd party docs
