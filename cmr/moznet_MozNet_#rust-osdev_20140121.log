[00:49:57] <Tobba> oh hey, nickalerts from when I was sleeping
[01:04:26] <yuriks> 16:32 < cmr> so Tobba is currently porting a real multitasking kernel to rust, and is having a net positive experience as of last status update.
[01:04:35] <yuriks> Tobba: and now I want to know where I can see those updates :)
[01:04:50] <Tobba> heh
[01:04:58] <Tobba> I have multitasking sorta working, syscalls work
[01:04:59] <Tobba> (sorta)
[01:05:13] <Tobba> I just need to write a scheduler
[01:08:43] <yuriks> cool. At that point you start having to write asm. Can you do something like bare functions in rust?
[01:09:20] <mcpherrin> Tobba: mm yeah gotta multilevel feedback queue that sucker
[01:09:21] <Tobba> not really right now afaik
[01:09:37] <Tobba> I just wrote it all in a special asm file with some NASM macro madness

[02:01:27] <mcpherrin> Has anybody tried writing a Coreboot payload in Rust yet?
[02:01:35] <mcpherrin> possibly using libpayload
[02:01:38] <Tobba> oh shit
[02:01:41] <Tobba> I wanna do that now
[02:02:32] <mcpherrin> I am going to go home, eat some ham, and see if I can get it working
[02:04:34] <yuriks> we gotta go lower
[02:04:44] <yuriks> Rust bios when?
[02:05:17] <mcpherrin> Well you could implement a Bios on top of Coreboot :-)
[02:05:38] <mcpherrin> I don't have any hardware that has coreboot installed though (well, devices at work but they're expensive :P)
[02:05:39] <Tobba> that would own
[02:05:52] <mcpherrin> So I'll have to Qemu
[02:05:56] <yuriks> well, I meant BIOS in the sense of "hardware initialization firmware", not the BIOS API
[02:06:33] <yuriks> "2.3.3 Using L2 Cache as General Storage During Boot" < these AMD manuals are hightly interesting
[02:06:44] <Tobba> hah yeah
[02:06:54] <Tobba> thats what coreboot has to do before the DRAM is up basicaly
[02:07:26] <mcpherrin> I think everybody does that these days on x86
[02:07:40] <yuriks> there isn't even a "dumb L2" mode, it's just "be very careful not to evict data from the cache"
[02:07:44] <mcpherrin> since it reduces your mainboard-specific code path
[02:07:58] <Tobba> thats hilarious
[02:08:04] <Tobba> why would they not just add a dumb L2 mode
[02:08:33] <Tobba> I guess because effort
[02:08:49] <mcpherrin> Tobba: You don't need it and that's an area where silicon is going to be tight
[02:09:00] <Tobba> yeah I realized that
[02:09:02] <Tobba> so, effort
[02:09:29] <mcpherrin> Some of the new Haswells have a crapton of L4 cache
[02:09:33] <yuriks> https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1990844/2014-01/l2wmem.png
[02:09:35] <mcpherrin> who even needs DRAM at that point
[02:09:49] <yuriks> that must be awesome for an embedded system
[02:10:04] <yuriks> if you just need to crunch streaming data
[02:10:27] <mcpherrin> Intel stuffs is still pretty PC/server centric though
[02:10:38] <Tobba> sadly coreboot doesnt support many chipsets
[02:10:41] <mcpherrin> I don't think L4 is enough to make it "awesome" for embedded :P
[02:11:03] <mcpherrin> Google is pushing Intel to work on coreboot for chromebooks
[02:11:13] <yuriks> mcpherrin: yeah, the point was "if your requirements are specific enough that you want the power of a haswell but don't need ram"
[02:11:29] <Tobba> cant they just implement it themselves
[02:11:35] <Tobba> most of the trickyness is just mobo specifics
[02:11:56] <Tobba> (afaik)
[02:12:08] <mcpherrin> Intel doesn't have nearly as nice guides as that AMD one I linked before :/
[02:12:08] <cmr> yuriks: is... that actually a usecase that exists?
[02:12:10] <yuriks> is coreboot still related to linux in any way?
[02:12:18] <mcpherrin> Easier to just yell at Intel to do it ;)
[02:12:19] <cmr> yuriks: not particularly.
[02:12:19] <yuriks> cmr: who knows... :)
[02:14:33] <Tobba> coreboot rust payload would own tho
[02:14:46] <Tobba> specially if it supported EFI and rudamentary BIOS stuff
[02:14:58] <mcpherrin> Like a rust implementation of EFI?
[02:15:02] <Tobba> yeah
[02:15:14] <mcpherrin> hmm
[02:15:47] <mcpherrin> well I'll get hello world working and we'll see what people do after that ;)
[02:15:53] <Tobba> hahahaha
[02:15:59] <Tobba> BIOS support shouldent be that hard
[02:16:08] <Tobba> you could generate some real mode code at run time
[02:16:15] <Tobba> to just bridge over to pmode
[02:18:25] <mcpherrin> Random poll:  Intel or AT&T syntax?
[02:18:46] <yuriks> 'tel!
[02:18:46] <Tobba> intel for the love of god
[02:19:38] <mcpherrin> mmmkay.  I agree.
[02:21:47] <mcpherrin> I'm not really comfortable with non-ARM assembly
[02:22:26] * yuriks has done a decent amount of reading of real mode x86 asm

[02:23:01] <Tobba> I wonder how complex a super minimal EFI implementation would be
[02:23:47] <mcpherrin> I wonder how much "normal" rust code you could get working on a libpayload/coreboot based runtime
[02:23:59] <Tobba> it'd be fun
[02:24:11] <Tobba> I want a system consisting of only rust and asm
[02:24:17] <Tobba> eradicate C!
[02:24:31] <mcpherrin> I'll allow coreboot for now ;)
[02:24:45] <mcpherrin> You could use an old pure-assembly BIOS to achieve the same goal :)
[02:25:01] <mcpherrin> Or something easy to get running, like an ARM Cortex-M3
[02:26:58] <Tobba> coreboot and llvm are exceptions
[02:30:14] <Tobba> then again
[02:30:19] <Tobba> rewriting coreboot wouldent be that hard would it

[02:51:34] <yuriks> what was the attribute to define enum size? I can't find it documented anywhere
[02:59:52] <Tobba> rust is the wheres waldo of documentatiomn

[06:35:23] <Tobba> round robin scheduler works
[06:35:26] <Tobba> its a gigantic hack for now though
[06:37:33] <mcpherrin> sweet
[06:38:21] <Tobba> one part involves comparing the pointers of Rc's, which I had to make non-private
[06:38:32] <Tobba> maybe I should just implement operator overloading in my std stuff already
[06:40:30] <mcpherrin> that sounds pretty wonky
[06:42:22] <Tobba> yeah I fixed some of it
[06:42:31] <Tobba> I just need to implement some funky Eq's on certain types
[06:43:01] <mcpherrin> I just grabbed coreboot 
[06:43:10] <mcpherrin> currently trying to get a "c" hello world running
[06:43:36] <Tobba> neat
[06:43:49] <Tobba> it should be easy in rust too
[06:43:53] <Tobba> since you get pmode it should just be
[06:44:07] <mcpherrin> yeah, I'm just figuring out the coreboot compilation environment right now
[06:44:11] <Tobba> *(0xB800 as *mut 16) = 0x1234
[06:44:19] <Tobba> and then shit should appear, theoretically
[06:44:21] <mcpherrin> I probably ought to just go read some documentation :)
[06:44:26] <Tobba> in practice you manage to typo the address
[06:44:27] <Tobba> like I just did
[06:44:48] <Tobba> goddamn 0xB8000
[06:45:12] <mcpherrin> I'm going to link to libpayload which has a printf
[06:45:56] <mcpherrin> to the serial device
[06:46:30] <mcpherrin> though yeah, if that doesn't work I can 0xb8000 it
[06:46:52] <yuriks> meanwhile, I (think) I'm getting the memory map from UEFI. Just need a print function to check it <_<
[06:47:02] <Tobba> though 0xb8000 probably wont work on real hw
[06:47:10] <Tobba> since the bios rom code wont have ran
[06:47:19] <Tobba> and the video card is in an undefined state
[06:47:33] <mcpherrin> well I'm just using qemu
[06:48:01] <mcpherrin> I don't really plan to get graphics stuff working; serial consoles are nicer
[06:48:37] <Tobba> also yuriks remind me to make an EFI bootloader later
[06:48:40] <Tobba> I had a PXE one working at some point
[06:48:42] <Tobba> (it was horrible)
[06:48:58] <Tobba> I was also working on one that chainloaded from FreeDOS but I dont think I ever had it working right
[06:48:58] <yuriks> I spent more time making it link than making it actually boot
[06:49:03] <Tobba> hahahaha, how
[06:49:28] <mcpherrin> eugh coreboot uses a cc wrapper
[06:49:37] <mcpherrin> I should probably read the docs on how to make this work
[06:50:03] <yuriks> native ld couldn't output PE+ properly (even though it claimed to). Installed mingw ld and it dumped core when linking :|
[06:50:51] <Tobba> ah right
[06:50:55] <Tobba> PE+?
[06:51:05] <Tobba> outputting PE via GNU toolchains is madness though, yeah
[06:51:06] <yuriks> it's just 64-bit PE I think
[06:51:29] <Tobba> p sure you can have 32 bit EFI loaders too
[06:51:35] <Tobba> but they wont run on 64 bit EFI BIOSes
[06:51:40] <yuriks> native library could output a PE, but didn't let me set the subsystem, and after changing it manually by hexing/objcopy it still didn't work
[06:51:44] <mcpherrin> tempted to just stick uboot between me and coreboot so I can deal with something I know
[06:52:14] <yuriks> didn't want to build ld so in the end using LTO made mingw ld no crash :P
[06:52:19] <yuriks> not*

[21:31:50] <nszceta> oh baby. this is what I'm talking about
[21:32:39] <NiccosSystem> hehe
[21:32:40] <arrdem> lol
[21:34:05] <Tobba> why is the UEFI foundation or w/e full retard
[21:34:08] <Tobba> to download the specs
[21:34:27] <Tobba> you need to fill out an agreement that you will file out their adopters agreement
[21:34:30] <mcpherrin> Tobba: because they hate freedom :
[21:34:36] <mcpherrin> :P
[21:34:47] <Tobba> which if you ever make an implementation and release it in anyone, you need to fax that over and have it signed
[21:34:54] <Tobba> how about they go suck a bag of dicks
[21:35:15] <mcpherrin> Tobba: surely you can just find a copy of it on the internet somewher e:P
[21:35:35] <Tobba> probably
[21:35:59] <mcpherrin> Or just boycott UEFI ;)
[21:36:19] <Tobba> uefi is kinda cool tho
[21:36:57] <mcpherrin> eugh because everybody wants a crappy OS that runs before your real OS? :P
[21:37:08] <Tobba> hah yeah
[21:37:30] <Tobba> the idea is there though
[21:38:34] <tiffany> that isn't much of a downside if you actually take advantage of UEFI wrangling setting up protected mode for you
[21:39:20] <Tobba> pmode setup isnt that bad
[21:39:31] <Tobba> + getting it set up by someone else can be disasterous depending on how it is
[21:39:43] <Tobba> right now my code relies on cs being 8 and ds being 16
[21:40:02] <Tobba> the only way I know to change them at the same time as the GDT is to do a roll through real mode
[21:40:04] <Tobba> which is a fucking mess
[21:40:23] <mcpherrin> tiffany: coreboot sets up protected mode for you too :p
[21:41:10] <tiffany> I don't really know how coreboot works
[21:41:21] <tiffany> I thought it was a BIOS replacement, not a boot enironment?
[21:41:22] <nszceta> I keep hearing about coreboot
[21:41:35] <nszceta> I'm doomed to EFISTUB though because of Macbook
[21:42:49] <mcpherrin> tiffany: yeah, it's a bios replacement that can directly load grub or a linux kernel
[21:43:39] <mcpherrin> The embedded hardware I work on uses it; we load a linux kernel that then acts as a bootloader and gets the real one running via a kexec
[21:45:16] <tiffany> I wonder if coreboot will ever gain adoption by PC OEMs
[21:45:34] <mcpherrin> tiffany: Chromebooks are using it :P
[21:45:52] <mcpherrin> also my employer uses it :P
[21:46:16] <mcpherrin> (we don't make PCs though)
[21:46:26] <tiffany> well I mean coreboot isn't really a uefi replacement
[21:46:41] <mcpherrin> Well I also think you don't need UEFI ;)

[21:56:52] <Tobba> if you use coreboot you still need to be able to load EFI option ROMs
[21:56:59] <Tobba> dunno how that works but its probably a mess
[22:00:34] <Tobba> ughh this scheduler sucks
[22:00:37] <Tobba> I need to write a proper queue class
