[00:01:22] <rAad> I'm making a tileset where I want to be able to define the character ("@"), foreground color, and background color. I've seen white on magenta tilesets of this nature.
[00:01:54] <rAad> is there somehow a way to have magenta be transparent?
[00:02:09] *** Quits: lenstr (lenstr@moz-47m6f2.broadband.corbina.ru) (A TLS packet with unexpected length was received.)
[00:02:16] <rAad> or... something?
[00:02:54] <niconii> rAad: what are you using?
[00:02:59] <niconii> rAad: librarywise
[00:03:05] <rAad> gfx-rs
[00:03:14] <rAad> basically only opengl shaders
[00:03:39] <rAad> I have a tileset going, but it is a fixed color
[00:04:40] <jpernst> probably the easiest way is to just convert the image to rgba when you load it and set the alpha channel to 0 for all magenta pixels
[00:04:49] <rAad> yeah, cool
[00:04:55] <jpernst> could even just do that ahead of time
[00:04:55] <rAad> that's what I was sorta thinking
[00:05:02] <rAad> a 32-bit png?
[00:05:16] <rAad>   vec4 texColor = texture2D(textures, texCoords);
[00:05:16] <rAad>   gl_FragColor = mix(backColor, frontColor * texColor, texColor.a);
[00:05:29] <jpernst> yeah
[00:05:29] <rAad> that's from another game that uses white on magenta
[00:05:42] <jpernst> by the time it gets to the shader it should be rgba
[00:05:49] <rAad> yeah, ok
[00:05:53] <rAad> I think that's enough to go on
[00:05:54] <jpernst> trying to do color-keying shenanigans in a shader will cause problems
[00:06:02] <rAad> thanks!

[00:43:22] <RCIX> yeah
[00:43:35] <RCIX> https://github.com/RCIX/rustlike
[00:43:54] <RCIX> what are you thinking as far as mechanics go
[00:44:20] <RCIX> because... 2 developers on 1 game probably > 2 on 2
[00:44:30] <RCIX> just on no reduplication of engine functionality
[00:44:31] <rAad> i read a great article on behavior trees
[00:44:40] <rAad> and there is a piston library for them
[00:44:51] <rAad> so i'd like to play around with that
[00:44:51] <RCIX> i like that idea
[00:45:07] <RCIX> im gonna go clone your repo and see how hard it is to integrate some of my code :P
[00:45:15] <rAad> I feel a base roguelike toolkit would be neat
[00:45:31] <rAad> there is libtcod but that comes with baggage
[00:45:53] <rAad> so people like us wouldn't have to start from scratch
[00:46:05] <RCIX> thats a good idea too
[00:46:28] <rAad> so I'm not sure if I'm ever going to make a "game", mostly just messing around
[00:46:36] <RCIX> i mean
[00:46:38] <RCIX> even if you just do that
[00:46:50] <RCIX> that gives me incentive to help
[00:46:56] <RCIX> if only to have something to base my roguelike off of
[00:47:00] <RCIX> also gives you a tester :P
[00:47:09] <rAad> haha nice!

[00:47:59] <rAad> obviously this won't do, haha
[00:49:46] <RCIX> rAad, yeah that feels a bit messy
[00:49:57] <RCIX> what do you think of https://github.com/RCIX/rustlike/blob/master/src/app.rs
[00:50:04] <RCIX> like, just as a generic starting point
[00:50:57] <RCIX> i still have no idea how to clean up draw calls
[00:50:59] <RCIX> so they arent so messy
[00:51:22] <rAad> How are you planning on storing the "entities"?
[00:52:02] <RCIX> havent thought quite that far ahead, actually
[00:52:09] <RCIX> i do like your idea of updateable and renderable
[00:52:57] <rAad> yeah, that's the messy part I was alluding to
[00:53:02] <RCIX> hm
[00:53:09] <rAad> I see ECS is popular in rust-land
[00:54:05] <RCIX> ecs?
[00:54:12] <rAad> entity component system
[00:54:19] <rAad> there are like 3 or 4 libraries :P
[00:54:23] <RCIX> ohh
[00:54:31] <RCIX> i kind of come from smaller projects but...
[00:54:42] <RCIX> i feel like id kind of like something more straightforward
[00:54:43] <niconii> rAad: even more than that, i think :P
[00:54:50] <RCIX> hm
[00:54:54] <RCIX> but youre going to have a library here
[00:55:03] <RCIX> so its gotta have some flexibility
[00:55:20] <rAad> niconii: all claiming to be "simple" :P
[00:55:33] <niconii> yep :)
[00:55:39] <RCIX> "but its just 7 different kinds of components! so easy!"
[00:55:45] <RCIX> hum
[00:55:48] <RCIX> i probably should go update my nightly
[00:55:49] <RCIX> lol
[00:55:54] <rAad> I come from ruby/python so I'm really having a hard time with the type system
[00:56:13] <rAad> it might run on your nightlies
[00:56:19] <RCIX> rAad, do you already have some sort of scope set as far as what you want the library to do
[00:56:20] <rAad> if that's what you're alluding to
[00:57:12] <rAad> foreground, background, and character tile based rendering
[00:57:24] <rAad> pathfinding, vision
[00:57:37] <rAad> camera
[00:57:44] <RCIX> ok so a library and not a roguelike kit :P
[00:58:03] <rAad> I'm not sure I understand what a roguelike kit is?
[00:58:09] <rAad> to me, it is libtcode
[00:58:11] <RCIX> by kit i mean focused on description of content over mechanics
[00:58:13] <rAad> *libtcod
[00:58:43] <rAad> I guess I'm still not following
[00:58:46] <rAad> (sorry)
[00:59:15] <RCIX> i mean consumers of your library will actually have to do alot of coding in rust to make their game
[00:59:25] <RCIX> and less in scripting languages or xml or whatever
[00:59:30] <RCIX> unless they put that in their game

[04:11:33] <rAad> JustAPerson: did you see https://github.com/PistonDevelopers/piston_window/blob/master/examples/hello_piston.rs
[04:11:55] <benbergman> brandonson: okay, just confirmed with a fresh --release build that it is still pretty slow
[04:13:03] <benbergman> I have a sneaking suspicion that maybe I've following too many pointers and that is causing the slowness, but I'm not really sure
[04:13:04] <JustAPerson> rAad: no I hadn't. I guess instead of the Event being an enum, but I think I get how the traits work from that example
[04:13:42] <RC9> i have no idea where i got this .a file but im so thankful rust uninstaller didnt get rid of it
[04:15:18] <RC9> JustAPerson, you want to catch press, release, and mouse_args for input
[04:15:22] <RC9> update_args for update

[04:25:27] <RC9> its working
[04:25:28] <RC9> so in the end
[04:25:40] <RC9> thats better than many of us have :P or well, me at least
[04:25:43] <jechochamber> Big thanks to anybody here who has published any of their projects, as I've likely gone through it looking for example!
[04:25:57] <jechochamber> Haha, thanks RC9!
[04:26:55] <RC9> jechochamber, if you want a project thats a bit cleaner to have fun with, https://github.com/RCIX/rustlike
[04:27:04] <RC9> im going to push an update to the latest nightly with some cleanup
[04:27:10] <RC9> its really just a dummy template right now
[04:28:08] <jechochamber> RC9: What is it exactly? I don't know what roguelike is.
[04:28:37] <RC9> like nethack
[04:28:37] <jechochamber> And I'm not quite fluent enough at rust yet to glean that from the source hah.
[04:28:43] <RC9> however there is no actual game there

[04:50:12] <jechochamber> NO relevant comments, but I know how to have a discussion... I think.
[04:50:51] <RC9> i think the bigger question i actually have is, well
[04:50:56] <RC9> i wanted to also do a small grid roguelike
[04:51:06] <RC9> and have the player take up multiple squares
[04:51:20] <RC9> but that gets messy with the inclusion of height
[04:51:43] <RC9> maybe im thinking of this too much from the graphics end, i need to know if a elevation based roguelike would be fun in the first place
[04:51:58] <RC9> and theres this fancy thing called ascii art that alot of roguelikes use for precisely this kind of reason :D

[04:54:15] <jechochamber> Yeah, that's way outside my realm of knowledge haha. What would the purpose of elevantion be? Going over barriers? In that case woulnd't elevation just be a binary (grounded or floating)?
[04:54:26] <jechochamber> boolean*
[04:56:05] <RC9> can do range mechanics

[04:56:59] <jechochamber> Ah, but the when two spaces have different slopes and you have a multispace character on both, things get a little messy, was that the pain point RC9?

[04:57:16] <RC9> yep
[04:57:31] <RC9> i could just say "is on highest elevation square" and call it a day
[04:57:38] <sp3d> you could model feet
[04:57:40] <RC9> but then theres the general headache of programming a multisquare player
[04:57:45] <RC9> oh nothing that big
[04:57:52] <RC9> just the player maybe being a 2x2
[04:57:54] <RC9> isntead of 1x1
[04:57:56] <jechochamber> I think we need a foot model! Anybody know a foot model?
[04:58:11] <sp3d> octopus characters would do something different to integrate inputs from their various squares than bipedal characters
[04:58:19] <sp3d> and ghosts would take a maximum

[05:02:06] <brandonson> RC9: wrt the question about 'fun', depends what you do with it!
[05:02:30] <brandonson> RC9: people play DF in adventure mode, so complexity works at least for some people
[05:02:33] <RC9> jechochamber, you should make a foot game

[16:48:36] <bvssvni> neikos: let’s say you have a Button, the object Button is not the same as the widget
[16:49:00] <neikos> I am not sure I understand, isn't a button a widget?

[17:38:31] <Oflor> Is it possible to use Conrod without Piston?
[17:38:52] <bvssvni> my computer crashed because I tried to run the sandbox game http://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/3b7d0h/pistonadventures_3_falling_sand_game_prototype/ :)

[17:39:55] <fkaa> even glut supports it ´_`
[17:42:45] <fkaa> ytain: not entirely sure what needs to change in glutin
[17:43:47] <bvssvni> Oflor: you can use it with piston-graphics and pistoncore-event
[17:44:18] <bvssvni> Oflor: you still need the same dependencies, though
[17:46:48] <JustAPerson> bvssvni: works, thank you ❤

[17:51:24] <fkaa> so many bugtrackers!
[17:52:33] <JustAPerson> if only a downstream libraries could change a structs default type parameter
[17:53:19] * fkaa hunts for method calls
[17:53:22] <ytain> fkaa read the last one I pasted, it explains how to get the proper values for the screen
[17:53:34] <JustAPerson> bvssvni: do I really need to change PistonWindow -> PistonWindow<Sdl2Window> everywhere now or is there a more convenient / general way in case I ever switch back to glutin?
[17:54:28] <bvssvni> JustAPerson: you can change back when the bug is fixed, but until then you need to use another window back-end
[17:54:52] <bvssvni> JustAPerson: would be nice if you opened up an issue here https://github.com/tomaka/glutin/issues

[17:55:18] <fkaa> ytain: i think it might be a glium bug actually

[17:56:04] <tomaka> well, JustAPerson isn't using glium
[17:56:12] <ytain> isn't supposed to be width/2?
[17:56:31] <tomaka> >_>
[17:56:34] <fkaa> tomaka: #501 mentioned `--example teapot`
[17:57:08] <fkaa> hmm
[17:57:17] <tomaka> fkaa: but JustAPerson has this issue with glutin + piston
[17:57:32] <tomaka> until it's both in glium and glutin_window
[17:57:52] <tomaka> personnally I thought this was settled
[17:57:59] <tomaka> I know it was buggy a long time ago and everything was fixed
[17:58:10] <tomaka> then suddenly two bug reports in two days
