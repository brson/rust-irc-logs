[02:59:58] <kmcguire_> saltasalta, if you know opengl, then you can get started easier
[03:00:34] <kmcguire_> saltasalta, https://github.com/tomaka/glutin/
[03:00:52] <kmcguire_> id figure just get that booted.. and start trying to make something
[03:01:08] <kmcguire_> you bound to run into plenty of challenges learning rust to keep you busy
[03:01:42] <kmcguire_> WindowsBunny, you could have given him that link lol
[03:01:43] <saltasalta> kmcguire_: Is glutin an alternative to SDL2 library?
[03:01:52] <saltasalta> What do you think?
[03:02:33] <kmcguire_> i think there is a crate for SDL
[03:02:52] <kmcguire_> if some of these guys in here were awake they would point you to a few different things
[03:03:05] *** zz_kimundi is now known as kimundi
[03:03:50] <saltasalta> There is a Crater for SDL but seems like not SDL2 already, anyway thanks for the link kmcguire
[03:04:48] <kmcguire_> i think you can likely find some bindings for SDL2.. but bindings are low level unsafe direct calls to the "C" functions
[03:05:00] <kmcguire_> glutin is a wrapper that makes things safe
[03:05:11] <kmcguire_> and theres another one
[03:05:18] <kmcguire_> that is kind of in competition to glutin
[03:05:25] <kmcguire_> ok later
[03:06:42] <saltasalta> thanks
[03:08:40] *** Quits: kmcguire_ (kmcguire@moz-pg1gb9.biz.rr.com) (Connection closed)
[03:09:08] <WindowsBunny> saltasalta: SDL and GLFW are libraries implemented in C, whereas glutin is implemented in pure Rust
[03:09:21] <WindowsBunny> saltasalta: so glutin has the advantage of being safer and more idiomatic
[03:10:29] <saltasalta> I'll take a look to glutin. Thanks WindowsBunny
[03:11:47] <WindowsBunny> saltasalta: and of course you'll need to actually draw something, so you'll need https://github.com/tomaka/glium for opengl
[03:12:33] <WindowsBunny> saltasalta: And there's a plethora of game related libraries here https://github.com/PistonDevelopers
[03:13:08] <saltasalta> Men I'm really new to this, so now I'm confused. Should I use both libraries you first mentioned?
[03:13:33] <saltasalta> anayway thank for your help, I'll better practice elementary algebra  first lol
[03:13:38] <saltasalta> bye for now!
[03:13:47] <WindowsBunny> saltasalta: glutin and glium are used together
[03:14:05] <WindowsBunny> glutin provides the windows + events, and glium provides the high level opengl stuff to draw

[12:42:14] <Amaranth> It's funny, we always talk about how we can't do real time raytracing but real time global illumination with dynamic lights is basically raytracing :D
[12:43:03] <Amaranth> Just a limited approximation of it to blend with the existing scene
[12:44:20] <Tobba> well, real time raytracing has been done
[12:44:27] <OmniMancer> I think these days we could actually do realtime limited ray tracing at game speeds

[12:44:33] <Tobba> the state of the art of GI is voxel cone tracing I believe
[12:44:46] <Tobba> which is slow as fuck and produces results that are well... intentionally blurry
[12:45:44] <Amaranth> Right, we could do real time ray tracing at 1080p 60fps but the scenes will be really simple
[12:45:48] <Tobba> I've been meaning to write a mixed raytracing / rasterization renderer
[12:46:15] <Amaranth> Which is always the problem, we've got clever approximations of all of this that are faster and usually close enough so why waste the power on the brute force method
[12:46:25] <Tobba> use a standard deferred renderer for the scenes, take the normals and positions and use them construct rays for a raytracer

[12:47:56] <Tobba> it does something crazy like voxelizing the entire scene I think
[12:48:03] <Tobba> so it's not very memory efficient
[12:48:03] <Amaranth> I mean, does more complex geometry or more lights make it take longer
[12:48:07] <OmniMancer> Montecarlo ones are independent of representaiton
[12:48:23] <OmniMancer> as long as you can query the first thing a give nray hits
[12:48:34] <Amaranth> If not it's just a matter of waiting a couple GPU generations and we'll just be able to slap it in to the toolbox without thinking much about it
[12:49:04] <Tobba> voxelization pass isn't scene dependant, I think the tracing part partially is
[12:49:31] <OmniMancer> Tobba: what does voxel cone tracing do that other methods don't?
[12:49:52] <Amaranth> Also it's annoying that nvidia has muddied the waters here with VXGI claiming it's hardware dependent and something special when really it's just voxel cone tracing tuned to their hardware
[12:50:20] <Tobba> VXGI is just cone tracing?
[12:50:54] <Tobba> lol
[12:50:58] <Amaranth> As far as I've been able to tell, yes
[12:51:17] <OmniMancer> Monte Carlo methods work well they just take many samples to get an unnoisy image
[12:51:22] <Amaranth> They don't even really hide it: "NVIDIA VXGI is an implementation of a global illumination algorithm known as Voxel Cone Tracing"
[12:51:37] <Tobba> hmm, monte-carlo methods could be fun for computing GI
[12:51:39] <Amaranth> But they still try to make it seem like it's something special in Maxwell that makes it possible
[12:51:46] <Tobba> don't need many samples at all if you're gonna blur it

[12:52:18] <OmniMancer> Tobba: no you need many samples because of the way the integral is determined
[12:52:36] <OmniMancer> if you don't take enough samples there is very noticable noise and it won't go away if you blur it
[12:52:38] *** Joins: Gabriel_7 (Gabriel@moz-0e13rm.mtgr.92aj.0e35.2a01.IP)
[12:53:11] <Tobba> but you don't need as many samples as normally
[12:53:16] <Tobba> so a hybrid method could work pretty well
[12:53:40] <OmniMancer> about 400 samples per pixel makes reasonable images in absence of caustics
[12:54:04] <OmniMancer> caustics cause noise due to low probability of finding the caustic paths
[12:54:48] <OmniMancer> MLT helps with this by allowing you to explore paths near ones already found
[12:55:05] <Amaranth> btw you might find http://www.iquilezles.org/www/articles/multiresaocc/multiresaocc.htm interesting
[12:55:37] <Tobba> hm
[12:56:12] <OmniMancer> I would like to see a game that uses one of these methods implemented on the GPU, but is an exploration game and since it takes some time for the image to clear up, moving degrades your view of the world and you have to sit and look at it for a while to see detail
[12:56:51] <Tobba> someone was makinga spiritual successor to Myst
[12:56:56] <Tobba> point and click while you wait for the scene to render

[13:01:55] <cyndis> I wonder if MLT would be best for such a game since the error function is not monotonic.. hard to say
[13:02:24] <cyndis> I started doing something very simple based on https://mediatech.aalto.fi/~timo/publications/laine2013hpg_paper.pdf a year or so ago but that project kind of went nowhere :)
[13:02:38] <cyndis> one of those "should take a look at it again" things..
[13:03:05] <OmniMancer> I think one issues with MLT is that you need a good estimate of the average received flux

[20:04:35] <bvssvni> *whether
[20:05:02] <Codenator> Compiling sdl2-sys v0.0.33
[20:05:05] <Codenator> hm
[20:05:17] <bvssvni> Codenator: it’s probably pointing to the crates.io version
[20:05:39] <Codenator> i use   [dependencies]     sdl2 = "0.0.35"

[20:07:10] <brson> bvssvni: setting the unstable_features lint to forbid for your project and its dependencies is equivalent to running on a nightly build
[20:07:21] <brson> how to actually flip that flag in a cargo project i am not sure
[20:07:25] *** Quits: dmac (dmac@moz-2ig65r.ca.comcast.net) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[20:07:28] <Codenator> seems like sdl2-sys v0.0.34 not there
[20:07:35] <XMPPwocky> s/nightly/beta
[20:07:43] <bvssvni> Codenator: sdl2-sys is 0.0.34 while rust-sdl2 is 0.0.35
[20:08:47] <brson> bvssvni: one way to do it for a cargo project is to replace rustc with a rustc wrapper that passes -F unstable_features
[20:08:51] <brson> ugly hack though
[20:09:04] <bvssvni> brson: thanks
[20:09:11] *** Quits: eerie (eerie@moz-cf2l00.red.bezeqint.net) (Connection closed)
[20:09:35] <brson> seems like there's room for a project that tricks cargo into allowing arbitrary flags by wrapping rustc
[20:09:46] <bvssvni> so `#![forbid(unstable_features)]` also affects dependencies?
[20:09:47] <brson> lots of use cases for passing arbitrary flags to rustc
[20:09:54] <brson> bvssvni: no!
[20:10:10] <sinistersnare> how hard would it be to get Piston onto beta? just randomly curious

[20:10:51] <bvssvni> sinistersnare: glutin_window is on beta, was blocked by a bug on osx but is now fixed
[20:10:58] <bvssvni> sinistersnare: quack is dead and gone
[20:11:09] <sinistersnare> oh and thanks for removing those lifetime annotations in sprite/scene bvssvni
[20:11:32] <sinistersnare> if Uuid is able to be Copy, then it could be easier
[20:11:48] <bvssvni> sinistersnare: yeah, why isn’t it Copy?
[20:12:17] <sinistersnare> idk, but it explicitly opts out
[20:12:26] <sinistersnare> with the #[no_copy_impl] or sometihng annotation
[20:12:57] <Codenator> bvssvni: https://crates.io/crates/sdl2-sys there last one 0.0.33
