[00:01:15] <Jesse> should i make a debug build to get crash stacks?
[00:01:22] <pcwalton> that would make it easier, yeah
[00:01:45] <pcwalton> a crash *could* be relatively benign if it's a stack overflow or double-panic
[00:01:52] <pcwalton> it could also be bad
[00:01:56] <Jesse> would it tell me if it's one of those things?
[00:02:06] <pcwalton> the call stack and process output will tell you, yeah

[00:04:41] <larsberg> I don't know if you were on then, pcwalton, but I proposed splitting I-Crash into I-crash and I-panic so that we can treat I-crash specially
[00:04:54] <pcwalton> SimonSapin: sometimes the Skia one is the result of Skia and Azure not being compiled with the same -D preprocessor flags

[00:07:35] <pcwalton> interesting
[00:08:37] <pcwalton> "no layout root" usually indicates that flow construction got so confused by the document style that it didn't create any nodes at all
[00:08:42] <pcwalton> this causes layout to abort

[00:09:21] <pcwalton> gdb --args servo
[00:09:36] <pcwalton> you could also just turn on core dumps "ulimit -c unlimited"

[02:26:24] <dlight> pcwalton, how does this work? by serializing/deserializing?
[02:26:27] <pcwalton> yes
[02:26:48] <dlight> but how can trait object be serialized with its type information?
[02:26:53] <pcwalton> it can't
[02:26:58] <pcwalton> that's why Servo needs to stop doing it.
[02:27:13] <dlight> but if it's doing now, it's because it works
[02:27:14] <pcwalton> it's quite unfortunate that Servo started doing it so much
[02:27:27] <pcwalton> it's insecure
[02:27:41] <dlight> oh, deserializing the wrong type doesn't panic?
[02:27:46] <pcwalton> no
[02:27:53] <pcwalton> Servo is insecure because it is a single-process browser
[02:28:01] <pcwalton> in order to make it secure, we need to make it a multiprocess browser
[02:28:12] <pcwalton> that means we have to undo the single-process assumptions that have crept in over the last two years
[02:28:49] <dlight> what do you mean by secure? you mean to contain security bugs by sandboxing each tab or sandboxing javascript and rendering etc?
[02:29:03] *** Joins: cyndis (cyndis@moz-bmdn13.kapsi.fi)
[02:29:12] <pcwalton> it needs to be the case that a JIT exploit does not trivially yield access to the entire system, yes.
[02:30:54] <dlight> the compiler "forget" the type of a trait object, but perhaps there's some magic to serialize / deserialize them by tagging with a type? is that what std::any does?
[02:31:29] <pcwalton> you don't want attackers to have the ability to instantiate arbitrary objects in your address space
[02:32:38] <dlight> yes, if there's a security bug in the first place (and almost certainly there is) then separating the address space might limit the damage of some bugs

[04:19:56] <jack> dlight: the sandboxing is the main benefit
[04:20:08] <jack> most of the rest of the benefit we already have achieved in servo
[04:20:56] <dlight> but does servo wants to sandbox one tab from another?
[04:21:51] <jack> if overhead wasn't a factor, we'd sandbox every iframe :)
[04:22:11] <jack> not just tabs, but also we sandbox gpu access from each tab
[04:25:06] <dlight> is it possible to have an architecture that optionally have very fine grained sandboxing, but also can compile a version with less processes?
[04:25:36] <dlight> I'm thinking that by the time Servo is ready (and generally speaking, the next decade), this overhead may not be that relevant
[04:25:37] <jack> i suspect htere will be some setting to control the amount of content processes just like gecko e10s
[04:25:46] <jack> so settings that low would trade security for some speed
[04:25:57] <jack> although it's not clear yet how much overhead the ipc has
