[08:01:41] <cmr> I'm making good progress on a PDP-11 LLVM backend so far.
[08:05:05] <huon> o_O
[08:05:44] <cmr> One of my friends was digging through my uni's electronic waste and found a PDP-11 buried inside a discared electron microscope controller.
[08:06:05] <cmr> so we've been having a lot of fun trying to get it running and learning about the architecture. I, of course, want to run rust on the thing.
[08:06:17] <cmr> people always say rust is perfect for embedded systems ;)
[08:07:03] <simukis> is PDP-11 that huge thing I see in the wikipedia picture?
[08:07:35] <cmr> that's one of the older ones, yeah.
[08:07:57] <cmr> in it you'd have a bunch of different modules slotted into the backplane (which in that model would be a unibus)
[08:08:10] <cmr> which is its equivalent of PCIe on modern computers.
[08:09:24] <cmr> we have a http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11/73, which is considerably smaller.
[08:10:58] * simukis partially glad he was born recently enough to be subjected to Pentium 3 and better only
[08:12:07] <cmr> it's a lot of fun toying around with these much older parts (and seeing how similar they are to modern computers!), but I'm glad I don't have to actually use them
[08:14:28] <huon> cmr: doesn't the PDP-11 have not-8-bit words
[08:14:29] <huon> ?
[08:14:58] <cmr> huon: nah that was the PDP-10
[08:15:12] <cmr> the PDP-11 is 8-bit-byte 16-bit-word.
[08:20:17] <huon> oh, cool

[10:57:06] <eddyb> I mean, I know I do, I just don't know whether I'll ever be able to boot it
