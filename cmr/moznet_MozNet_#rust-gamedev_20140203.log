[04:56:40] <o11c> skrylar: what TERM, etc?
[04:57:10] <dmillerw> and only with his make script
[04:57:57] <skrylar> o11c: 'xterm' on a regular tab, 'screen' on the tmux tab; apparently its an issue specific to Konsole's idea of what "solarized" is
[04:58:16] <skrylar> I looked it up and there's a KDE ticket for it; and it works in the official theme file for Putty
[04:58:29] <phil> any good opengl people in here?
[04:58:46] <skrylar> i have a passing familiarity with opengl \o/ what do you need

[05:00:13] <phil> and change all of the requisite sizes from 3 to 4
[05:00:18] <phil> it doesnt draw anything
[05:00:23] <skrylar> bjz: all of my code is moved over to my SDL2 stuff :(
[05:00:27] <cmr> phil: post your code?
[05:00:31] <phil> one sec
[05:00:34] <o11c> phil: what primitive are you drawing with?
[05:00:34] <yuriks> phil: what primitives are you trying to draw?
[05:00:36] <skrylar> which i admittedly should test against 0.10-pre
[05:00:50] <dmillerw> bjz, I've kind of gotten working? I'm pulling your repo down, building everything except the examples, and pointing my compile line to those files
[05:00:50] <yuriks> if it's GL_TRIANGLE then you need a mod 3 number of vertices
[05:00:59] <yuriks> try GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP instead
[05:01:03] <o11c> though the last one would be ignored
[05:01:09] <o11c> phil: do you have culling enabled?
[05:01:19] <bjz> dmillerw: weird
[05:01:24] <dmillerw> it worked though
[05:01:29] <bjz> dmillerw: what platform?
[05:01:34] <dmillerw> linux, fedora
[05:01:39] <skrylar> Triangle strip will likely give him heartache in the future though, because you usually can't draw a model that way without special preprocessing
[05:02:21] <o11c> I did triangle strip when I was hand-writing my drawing code, but switched to just triangles right+ after, when I started loading models from files
[05:02:37] <skrylar> yeah, but when you're hand-writing code you're optimizing the model for it :)
[05:02:39] <o11c> that said, converting a set of triangles into a triangle strip isn't *that* complicated
[05:02:41] <bjz> dmillerw: so its not spewing out that insane error anymore?
[05:02:44] <phil> o11c: i havent enabled it
[05:02:59] <phil> primitive is triangles i think
[05:03:01] <phil> http://pastebin.com/jJKzYHRE
[05:03:05] <dmillerw> bjz, nope, and it compiles just fine now
[05:03:13] <bjz> dmillerw: oh phew
[05:03:24] <dmillerw> still a really weird issue though
[05:03:31] <phil> i even checked for an opengl error
[05:03:34] <skrylar> o11c: i wouldn't know, i don't knows the geometries :) though with preprocessing (as i mentioned) sure, you could add a 'triangle strip' flag to your engine model format for that purpose
[05:03:35] <phil> but it was always 0
[05:04:07] <dmillerw> but if you're curious, this is what works https://gist.github.com/dmillerw/aa848155d569310f4f15
[05:04:20] <phil> okay
[05:04:23] <phil> so triangle strip
[05:04:24] <phil> let me test
[05:04:25] <yuriks> triangle strips are useful for a lot of special-case models
[05:04:39] <yuriks> quads, actual strips, circles, convex polygons, etc.
[05:05:01] <cmr> I imagine with careful modeling you can represent everything as triangle strips
[05:05:04] <phil> welp, that certainly did something odd
[05:05:12] <yuriks> cmr: there are optimizers that do that
[05:05:33] <cmr> yuriks: do they accept arbitrary meshes?
[05:05:37] <cmr> and do they derform it?
[05:05:42] <yuriks> cmr: yes, and no
[05:05:47] <cmr> ohh
[05:05:49] <cmr> link to one?
[05:05:53] <yuriks> it's best effort. They also optimize for vertex cache usually
[05:05:55] <cmr> I'm really interested in how that works
[05:06:12] <phil> so how is this usually done?
[05:06:15] <cmr> I feel like a certain configuration of poles could really screw it up... maybe not though
[05:06:19] <phil> do you break the square into 2 triangles?
[05:06:26] <o11c> skrylar: the algorithm is pretty simple: add the first triangle then: look for a triangle with matching vertices, else jump to a random triangle
[05:06:27] <phil> and just draw both?
[05:06:47] <o11c> skrylar: it might not be *optimal*, but for a lot of meshes you'll get a decent memory saving
[05:07:10] <yuriks> cmr: http://fgiesen.wordpress.com/2013/12/14/simple-lossless-index-buffer-compression/
[05:07:48] <cmr> yuriks: thanks
[05:08:22] <yuriks> and also http://fgiesen.wordpress.com/2013/12/17/index-compression-follow-up/
[05:09:45] <yuriks> cmr: wait, I think I gave you the wrong articles
[05:10:06] <cmr> they look relevant?
[05:10:32] <yuriks> they are, but they're not about triangle strips :)
[05:11:44] <yuriks> in that case I don't remember which I was thinking about, you can probably find something is you google
[05:12:17] <yuriks> creating triangle strips used to be all the rage, but fell out of vogue since GPUs gained the ability to use vertex indices without any penalty
[05:12:34] <phil> hmm
[05:12:44] <phil> this code doesnt draw anything with GL_LINES either
[05:12:53] <cmr> even with element buffers aren't you still going to get benefit out of using strips?
[05:13:34] <cmr> (in that you're still sending less data)
[05:14:03] <cmr> I still don't have a model of the performance characteristics of GPUs, so I could be entirely off.
[05:14:05] <yuriks> cmr: yeah, but it's pretty insignificant, specially since (as mentioned in the article) vertex cache optimization is an overriding concern
[05:17:29] <cmr> ahh this vertex cache clears up a lot of things in my head
[05:18:20] <skrylar> cmr: AAA devs seem to mostly care about draw calls now, more than individual polygons
[05:18:52] <skrylar> unless the card is swapping, using GL3+ VBOs means you're only transferring the model once
[05:23:22] <yuriks> does AMD have an equivalent to nvidia's bindless texture in OpenGL yet?
[05:23:45] <yuriks> I assume that's how Mantle works already (but I haven't looked at any technical talks about it yet)

[05:27:29] <cmr> found that
[05:28:50] <yuriks> cmr: cute, but it does things like subdiving triangles, etc. it seems, so not usable
[05:28:55] <cmr> yeah.
[05:28:59] <csherratt> Mantle sounds pretty neat based on the lectures. but the lack of public api makes it kinda pointless.
[05:29:33] <csherratt> err useless I should say.
[05:29:50] <yuriks> cmr: the forsyth article linked in the blog earlier mentions stripping briefly at the end
[05:30:05] *** Joins: dmac (Adium@moz-94F55C3.hfc.comcastbusiness.net)
[05:30:42] <yuriks> since you don't want to touch the vertex cache optimized order it boils down to simply scanning it sequentially and hoping you end up with less indices (due to restarts) than you would have with just triangles
[05:31:12] <cmr> what is a restart, exactly?
[05:31:49] *** Quits: dmac (Adium@moz-94F55C3.hfc.comcastbusiness.net) (Ping timeout)
[05:31:52] <yuriks> a special index that "restarts the triangle strip"
[05:32:21] <yuriks> basically, for an index buffer {0, 1, 2, -1, 3, 4, 5}; with -1 as a restart index that's two triangles
[05:32:30] <cmr> oh ok
[05:32:35] <yuriks> it obliviates the need for degenerate triangles
[05:32:51] <cmr> is that an extension or built-in or does it need special handling?
[05:33:23] <yuriks> it's an additional feature. It's only supported without a speed penality in new architecture GPUs, iirc
[05:34:12] <yuriks> http://www.opengl.org/sdk/docs/man3/xhtml/glPrimitiveRestartIndex.xml
[05:34:57] <yuriks> what do they call GL 3+ gpus? general shader architecture? common shader architecture? I don't remember
[05:35:18] <cmr> ohh a 3.1 feature
[05:35:22] * cmr adds it to hgl
[05:36:23] <csherratt> unified shader architecture?
[05:36:32] <yuriks> csherratt: ahhh, that's it
[05:36:32] <cmr> that term sounds familiar
[05:37:41] <cmr> How did y'all learn these things? Is there good resources or is the usual knowledge accretion I've grown accustomed to?
[05:38:07] <yuriks> cmr: pre GL3 the vertex and fragment shaders were executed in different parts of hardware and had different capabilities
[05:38:22] <yuriks> cmr: knowledge accretion. And I still haven't been able to write an impressive 3d engine <_<
[05:38:30] <cmr> heh
[05:38:41] <cmr> \o/ computing
[05:38:49] <yuriks> no time for coding, gotta read all these things :P
[05:39:12] <yuriks> I also follow a lot of game developers on twitter
[05:39:14] <csherratt> yuriks: even Carmack had a team.
[05:39:32] <yuriks> csherratt: he still did Doom by himself though ;)
[05:39:52] <cmr> "Even Carmack had a team"
[05:40:00] <cmr> That's probably the most inspirational phrase I've heard
[05:40:08] <yuriks> cmr: haha, indeed
[05:40:18] <skrylar> and then zenimax took over :(
[05:40:25] <csherratt> yuriks: http://gaming.wikia.com/wiki/Doom/credits
[05:40:28] <csherratt> 4 developers
[05:40:34] <yuriks> skrylar: now the team doesn't have carmack anymore :)
[05:40:50] <cmr> hm, I don't recognize Dave Tayler
[05:40:52] * cmr looks up
[05:40:55] <skrylar> yuriks: well i wouldn't want to work for zenimax either :P
[05:41:01] <yuriks> I believe romero only did gameplay stuff. I didn't know Abrash worked on doom
[05:41:01] <skrylar> they're bloodsucking fiends
[05:41:05] <yuriks> don't recognize Dave Tayler either
[05:41:35] <cmr> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_D._Taylor
[05:41:39] <skrylar> if you saw the bag of sad they pulled over on Arkane (telling them "oh sorry this isn't good enough, change it" "no we don't like the change we told you to do, here we're going to use our lawyers to take over your company now") ... -_-
[05:41:43] * skrylar goes back to code
[05:42:07] <yuriks> csherratt: it's funny, I saw somewhere Carmack commenting on how clueless he was back then, and how ass backwards all his algorithms are because he was making them all up based only on his high school math knowledge
[05:42:36] <csherratt> is that why we couldn't look up?
[05:42:39] <yuriks> csherratt: so I probably have more total raw knowledge than he did back then, but not the motivation or work ethic to follow up
[05:43:02] <skrylar> csherratt: nah, there was a math issue with that
[05:43:12] <yuriks> csherratt: iirc it was something like "doom uses angles and trigonometry to do wall clipping" or something of the sort
[05:43:16] <skrylar> they used a raytracer that was faster because it didn't have to deal with that kind of transform, IIRC
[05:43:46] <yuriks> yup, doom engine raycast relies on wall being vertically parallel
[05:44:15] <yuriks> (it only traces one ray per colum, then uses the distance and floor height to determine the height of the wall span to draw on that column)
[05:44:21] <csherratt> also doom ran on a computer with 8MB
[05:44:25] <skrylar> It's funny seeing FPS players on the PC complain about how stupid mac users are, when one of the first full 3D mouselook games was made by mac devs (Bungie)
[05:44:27] <csherratt> gl-rs compiles to 12MB

[05:45:16] <skrylar> cmr: eh, there was a time that mac game devs rivaled PC devs pretty closely :(
[05:45:23] <skrylar> though Apple hardware has always been heinously overpriced
[05:45:32] <Yurume> csherratt: even after linked to the executable? (assuming --rlib)
[05:45:41] <yuriks> "You know what's pretty hardcore?  Thinking that  going to the bathroom is essentially the same as fucking off."
[05:45:44] <yuriks> favourite quote ^
[05:45:56] *** Quits: jeaye (jeaye@moz-34FEF2BB.hsd1.ca.comcast.net) (Quit: brb)
[05:46:52] <cmr> yeah once I saw that quote I recognized this article
[05:47:06] <csherratt> Yurume: it's not that bad after you link to an executable. Just wanted to point out how resource constrained doom was.
[05:47:42] *** Joins: jeaye (jeaye@moz-34FEF2BB.hsd1.ca.comcast.net)
[05:48:06] <csherratt> I'm sitting at about 6MB since rust moved to static linking.
[05:48:33] <Yurume> I'm at about 5MB (but I'm not using gl-rs).
[05:48:50] <cmr> we need to get binary size under control :(
[05:49:07] <yuriks> my very simple command line util, with -Z lto and symbols strippes, is a few kb shy of 1mb (iirc)
[05:49:21] <yuriks> and it only runs a single function on stdin and outputs to stdout :P
[05:49:49] <skrylar> cmr: unfortunately I don't see that ever happening
[05:49:51] <cmr> yeah but in that meg is an entire runtime
[05:49:58] <cmr> dynamic linking gets things much smaller
[05:50:20] <cmr> skrylar: ever? why not?
[05:50:27] <Yurume> sonorous (~1.5M before static linkage era) + libstd + libextra + rust-sdl/sdl_image/sdl_mixer + rust-opengles-angle + rust-encoding (estimated 1M) + rustsqlite = ~5.5M total
[05:50:29] <yuriks> another related JC anecdote: original wolfenstein had a parametrized routine to draw pixels for every possible apparent on-screen height of a column of wall
[05:50:35] <skrylar> 1) modern devs seem to care zero about resource control (e.g. "lets throw it up on a 30mb VM!" java syndrome) and 2) rust generics are basically like C++ templates, that is, not shared
[05:50:46] <skrylar> Non-shared generics + Liberal use = Huge bins
[05:50:57] <Yurume> which is actually quite good compared to the past
[05:51:13] <yuriks> that used a lot of memory and he was running out, so he chopped off the functions for when the wall was taller than the screen, which produced non-objectionable artifacts
[05:51:25] <yuriks> (he simply clamped their height to the maximum supported one)
[05:51:27] * skrylar points at Boost which is templates upon templates, and have several megabytes in binary form just to do things like threading IIRC
[05:51:39] <cmr> skrylar: it's a bit disingenuous to toss rust developers (who for the most part actually do care about resource usage) with java developers.
[05:51:41] <skrylar> which when done in C99, takes up 50k :|
[05:52:00] <Yurume> skrylar: demonomorphization is always useful both in C++ and Rust
[05:52:03] <skrylar> cmr: that was more of an example than saying they are (rust isn't on a VM)
[05:52:43] <yuriks> cmr: shouldn't LTO strip out most of the runtime?
[05:52:52] <cmr> yuriks: no
[05:52:59] <cmr> yuriks: because it uses trait objects and inlines poorly...
[05:53:29] <skrylar> I remember looking at RenPy which has a distribution footprint of about 20mb due to Python+Runtimes+Libs, and the same simple tasks could be done with GLFW and the stb_* libs with a tiny salting of Lua in.. 900k
[05:53:30] <cmr> skrylar: but I agree, you can't really get better than C with just simpe static calls and indirection
[05:54:02] <csherratt> with LTO I drop to 2.7MB from 6
[05:54:20] <skrylar> cmr: doesn't have to be better than C, just needs to be 'as good as.'
[05:54:27] <bjz> cmr: how big is gl-rs for you?
[05:54:56] <cmr> 8.8M libgl-dbe7b0eb-0.1.rlib
[05:54:58] <cmr> 1.7M libgl-dbe7b0eb-0.1.so
[05:55:11] <cmr> keep in mind both of those are including full metadata, and metadata is huge.
[05:55:49] <skrylar> cmr: I remember reading about Ada's generics; where in C you might do a linked list as void*, Ada would basically do that as well but type-check at the syntax level (every use of 'my-linked-list' would be the same C-like implementation); whereas Rust/C++ will make a whole new MyLinkedList_MangledSadness+Overhead.
[05:56:07] <skrylar> So it had very low-cost generics
[05:56:10] <cmr> skrylar: thing is, we don't have to do that.
[05:56:20] <cmr> Using the linked list example, you're only ever using the type behind a pointer.
[05:56:30] <cmr> So it doesn't actually need to be monomorphized for every instance
[05:57:17] <cmr> Ada is such a cool language
[05:57:33] <skrylar> it's not really a matter of "does it need to", but "does it *actually* do it"
[05:57:45] <cmr> well yes, we *need* to stop doing it.
[05:57:50] <cmr> (monomorphising evertything)
[05:57:52] <cmr> it's bloaty
[05:57:59] <skrylar> my one primary unease with rust is the sheer massive amount of problems that rust devs seem to answer with the sufficiently smart compiler answer
[05:58:23] <skrylar> IMO a lot of things are filed under 1) well we'd have to touch the AST or 2) well some magic cycle of LLVM ought to fix that
[05:58:38] <cmr> opinion or experience? :p
[05:58:52] <skrylar> its not unlike Lispers saying that a sufficiently smart JIT will remove all the slow :)

[06:00:24] <skrylar> meeh, i would rather have a lisp than a forth 
[06:00:34] <yuriks> me too :)
[06:01:01] <skrylar> i was working on a project like that pre-rust; there's no reason you can't do what Naughty Dog did for the PS1
[06:01:22] <skrylar> made a DSL in lisp which represented the C-ish compilable parts, and then use your lisp environment *as* the compiler
[06:01:38] <skrylar> which gives you CTFE, whichever generics format you want and such for basically zero effort
[06:02:04] <skrylar> Terra does that with Clang+Lua
[06:06:50] <yuriks> the thing with Rust being so complex is that you're unlikely to ever see another compiler for it

[06:07:37] *** Quits: summerlight (summerligh@327FC32B.2C956A45.501EFF44.IP) (Ping timeout)
[06:07:42] <cmr> yuriks: if rust doesn't continue on its current trajectory I'm ditching it in a year or two.
[06:07:53] <cmr> and I'm not ashamed to say it!
[06:08:01] <yuriks> what do you mean by that?
[06:08:08] <cmr> no matter how good or bad a language is, its ecosystem is what defines it.
[06:08:34] <yuriks> (could very well continue on a ballistic trajectory ;)
[06:09:04] <cmr> what I mean is if its popularity doesn't continue growing like it has been, the language + tools continue to get better, etc I won't care about Rust
[06:09:04] <skrylar> i'm maintaining interest in it at the moment (currently working on that GUI model I talked about), though i'm curiously poking nimrod when i can get their compiler to work

[06:10:13] <cmr> I'd rather use C++ than a dying, unpopular language.
[06:10:18] <yuriks> well, I think it has had amazing use so far, considering what it is right now
[06:10:21] <yuriks> cmr: true that
[06:10:29] <cmr> but my current bet is on it not dying :)
[06:10:39] <yuriks> I get the impression that a lot of interested parties are holding out for stability
[06:10:48] <skrylar> It's not dying, but there's still chance for another Andrei to come in and ruin it
[06:10:50] <skrylar> lol
[06:11:02] <yuriks> alas, poor D
[06:11:02] <Yurume> cmr: in my opinion, if Rust does not take off purely because of low popularity, then we have no hope :X
[06:11:05] <csherratt> nimrod looks pretty neat.
[06:11:34] <skrylar> yuriks: yeah :( it was gaining ground under walter, and then when he gave it to andrei it basically fell off the map
[06:12:24] <skrylar> Yurume: Morphic-based; display tree of generic objects, probably a fixed set of messages you can send to widgets
[06:13:17] <skrylar> Yurume: its one of the least painful ways of doing a user-extensible GUI in rust that I can envision right now
[06:13:28] <yuriks> gc all the things!
[06:14:29] <skrylar> i have child adding/removal working, though it involves a little bit of oddness
[06:14:31] <Yurume> skrylar: interesting. I personally need a similar system to provide a user-customizable GUI, and I desparately need some DSL to get that right
[06:14:54] * yuriks still thinks Qt is the only worthy GUI toolkit
[06:15:01] <skrylar> Yurume: front-end it with lua :)
[06:15:05] <cmr> heh
[06:15:07] <Yurume> skrylar: awwwww
[06:15:19] <yuriks> it's hindered by it's metacompilation oddness
[06:15:26] <yuriks> but that's better than being hindered by C like GTK :P
[06:15:26] <cmr> if I found myself needing a gui toolkit in Rust I too was going to use Lua
[06:15:36] <skrylar> yuriks: its metacompilation oddness is most of its success :)
[06:15:43] <Yurume> to be exact, I don't want much extensibility (like WoW for example) so it is much like HTML <template>
[06:15:50] <Yurume> it would be much like*
[06:15:57] <skrylar> you could use json or xml then
[06:16:22] <skrylar> i was planning on eventually supporting an equivalent of XML nibs (how Cocoa does it; just de-pickle from a GUI designer which saves to xml) if i kept the project
[06:17:28] <skrylar> though there is some hariness in my model right now; widgets get boxed up as trait pointers and then have to store weak refs to themselves; which allows .add_child to maintain the proper parent/child pointer tree
[06:17:50] <skrylar> fortunately storing a weak ref to yourself doesn't cause too much badness, since Rcs will free the refcell which frees the weak ref and prevents leaking
[06:18:34] <yuriks> just use the eventually fully featured Servo and interface with your application using JS :)
[06:18:41] <cmr> eugh
[06:18:55] <cmr> not only is the web platform huge, it's nasty.
[06:19:14] <yuriks> indeed
[06:19:38] <skrylar> it also probably doesn't support what i need right now :)
[06:19:48] <cmr> yeah most likely not
[06:19:53] * skrylar wants to make a 'proper' outliner
[06:20:16] <Yurume> skrylar: yeah, I wanted use JSON (or my little CSON if I can make a Rust implementation for that on time...)
[06:20:19] <Yurume> wanted to use*
[06:20:42] <cmr> Yurume: if you finish the spec I might find the time to implement it.
[06:21:18] <dmillerw> So, 'nother question. :D Trying to init a window struct with various values assigned, then create a glfw window from that. Is there a way to do that statically? Because trying to make a window from a struct instance just errors out with "error: cannot capture variable of type `&window::Window`, which does not fulfill `Send`, in a bounded closure
[06:21:18] <dmillerw> "
[06:21:31] <Yurume> cmr: the spec is mostly fixed, but I should implement it at least once to get the spec right (it has been known that there is at least one missing rule).
[06:21:53] <Yurume> I have been seriously unproductive for recent months
[06:21:59] <cmr> me too ;\
[06:22:06] <cmr> well that's not strictly true
[06:22:14] <cmr> I've just been productive in different places (ie, school)
[06:22:19] <skrylar> i think nimrod is meant to be a pythonish C with metaprogrramming though; it probably doesn't have rust's "if i compile i will not crash" nature
[06:22:29] <cmr> dmillerw: What are you doing exactly?
[06:22:44] <cmr> dmillerw: It seems like you should be using Window as a value.
[06:23:12] <dmillerw> ohh, I could do that... function that creates a glfw window using data from the passed in struct
[06:23:28] <dmillerw> yes?
[06:23:32] <yuriks> I would love something like a less complex XML
[06:23:38] <yuriks> I don't think json reads very well, tbh
[06:23:41] <cmr> yuriks: XML is pretty simple?
[06:23:57] <cmr> trees where nodes have arbitrary metadata...

[06:24:21] <cmr> dmillerw: sounds about right?
[06:24:27] <cmr> are namespaces part of core xml?
[06:24:34] <yuriks> I think so?
[06:24:36] <dmillerw> Indeed it works! :) thanks
[06:24:42] <Yurume> cmr: different specs
[06:24:44] <cmr> I thought it was just other tools around it that treated them specially.
[06:24:59] <cmr> I'm ignoring xpath, xslt, etc etc
[06:25:00] <Yurume> core XML only reserves identifiers starting with xml: but do not attach any specific meanings
[06:25:03] <yuriks> getting rid of implicit text nodes would go a long way to make xml better I think
[06:25:09] <cmr> I agree.
[06:25:13] <skrylar> namespaces are sorta optional though, if you don't want them
[06:25:19] <Yurume> xml:lang, xml:id and xmlns etc. are in separate (but official) specs
[06:25:54] <Yurume> but xmlns is widely used so many XML processors would implement it anyway
[06:26:31] <yuriks> I think the recent "kill all xml and replace it json" trend is a pity, since xml is better suited to some kinds of documents
[06:26:38] <yuriks> (as is json)
[06:26:45] <skrylar> thats mostly from the rubyists
[06:27:04] <skrylar> and some of that is because you can parse json by calling eval()
[06:27:09] <csherratt> Oculus rift is working \o/ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tycptiRXxM
[06:27:29] <Yurume> XML is mostly useful for i) loosely typed objects and ii) (P)CDATA-inline markups
[06:27:33] <yuriks> csherratt: oh, ther vertigo! do want though :)
[06:27:57] <skrylar> cdata seems derpy to me
[06:28:10] <skrylar> it is not recursive, which means you need to base64 your data to remain safe
[06:28:11] <Yurume> JSON is mostly useful for i) untyped objects and ii) representing sequences and mappings (that would be very verbose in XML)
[06:28:19] <skrylar> if you base64 your data, you don't need the cdata...
[06:28:25] <yuriks> I'm dying to get a Rift, but I'm trying to save myself for the final version...
[06:29:01] <Yurume> aaaand if you want strictly typed objects then you need an additional verification over XML or use ASN.1/EBML/whatever.
[06:29:11] <csherratt> yuriks: That's probably a good call, there is very little to do on the current one. Also the image quality is ... pretty poor
[06:29:14] <yuriks> Yurume: schemas? :) hehe
[06:29:19] <skrylar> Yurume: i still think the primary drive from/for json is just because it lets you be lazier on the browser-end, where extensive frameworks is more costly than on the server
[06:29:31] <skrylar> and IIRC parsing xml on browsers is ... a crapshoot
[06:29:35] <yuriks> csherratt: I know, I tried one for an hour or so last month
[06:29:44] <o11c> json is pretty

[06:36:48] <Yurume> I think YAML's dependency on whitespace is much worse than Python's one
[06:36:59] <yuriks> python dependency is simple
[06:37:08] <Yurume> since Python can preprocess whitespaces into INDENT and DEDENT tokens
[06:37:09] <yuriks> YAML is fuzzy hell with human looking lists and stuff
[06:37:28] <Yurume> but in YAML you need to count the whitespaces in every context

[06:54:10] <Yurume> possible. that's the major source of ambiguity that has to be resolved manually in the current spec.
[06:54:46] <yuriks> skrylar: I have no idea what the difficulties in doing such a thing would be. I  probably need to write more rust, quick! :P
[06:54:57] <Yurume> I have a pending draft of the spec to allow the "forward comma" (i.e. `* 42\n* 54`) to solve that problem
[06:54:58] <o11c> hm, actually, I guess a dumb approach would just be to treat *any*   <object> <object> as with an implicit comma
[06:55:10] <o11c> in other words, to unconditionally treat comma the same as whitespace
[06:55:36] <o11c> yurume: next thing you know, you'll be specifying YAML. Less specification is better.

[06:58:04] <skrylar> yuriks: well morphic is based on Self/Smalltalk which are built on objects and message passing, rust is more of a haskelly algebra system with memory safety
[06:58:10] <o11c> because that counts as two newlines, so it splits verbatim strings
[06:58:21] <Yurume> o11c: that's also a concern

[06:58:32] <skrylar> yuriks: so there's a bit of work bending around rustisms to get the tree to work
[06:58:36] <o11c> I say, just remove that rule
[06:58:42] <o11c> and ONLY allow omitting the comma in objects
[06:58:44] <sp3d> conciseness is great, but being vague or permissive leads to monsters like html
[06:58:48] <Yurume> technically speaking though, both JSON and CSON work on the Unicode string (which is different from the file anyway)
[06:58:57] <o11c> the key part of the object is not expected to be a verbatim string, so the problem just goes away
[06:59:10] <skrylar> sp3d: and that's why we have source-to-source like haml and slim \o/
[06:59:16] <Yurume> and it already have to deal with the invalid UTF-8 sequence etc. out of the box
[06:59:29] <Yurume> they*
[06:59:41] <skrylar> actually i don't mind the idea of source-to-source or "source code in database"
[07:00:06] <skrylar> its not that hard to have a msgpack dataset, and then if someone wants to write weird pythonic or INI syntax have that person just text filter it
[07:01:16] <skrylar> SCID probably disagrees with version control a little, i guess

[07:04:58] <yuriks> skrylar: into the trash it goes!
[07:05:32] <yuriks> I've heard people describe nimrod as "Pascal with metaprogramming"
[07:05:43] <skrylar> yeah. i can see that
[07:05:51] <skrylar> Pascal as told by a Python scripter
[07:05:55] <cmr> heh
[07:06:19] <cmr> Bahahah, the hilarious languages that would come from "X as told by a Y programmer"
[07:06:20] <skrylar> actually the pascalness i find endearing, the 1990s-era "you have to do this stupid thing because of compiler efficiency" is unendearing
[07:06:49] <cmr> my interactions with pascal have been largely positive, though few in number.
[07:06:57] <cmr> and knuth liked it, so, like, it can't be that bad?
[07:07:06] <Yurume> WEB? :)
[07:07:14] <skrylar> heh, pascal is nice
[07:07:29] <skrylar> and, nimrod even uses high/low for array bounds. it seems to be exactly pascal-as-python o_o
[07:07:30] <cmr> I haven't actually looked at web, though I read most the literate programming paper.
[07:07:34] <onelson> pascal was what they taught us in high school
[07:07:41] <yuriks> my interaction with pascal was rewriting a DOS game written in turbo pascal in C
[07:07:50] <yuriks> wasn't very pleasant
[07:08:08] <skrylar> well, there's a big issue with turbo pascal v. wirth pascal v. modern day delphi/freepascal
[07:08:09] <cmr> I was following some things written in the 80s..
[07:08:35] <skrylar> modern day freepascal is basically just as good as C, but their class model is really weird
[07:08:58] <skrylar> its supposedly faster than C++'s due to the way some of the vtabling/rtti is done, at the cost of basically not being able to have DLLs
[07:09:05] <Yurume> as a co-specification of both the source code and documentation, literate programming makes sense. as an out-of-order placement of the source code, I doubt.
[07:09:27] <cmr> I couldn't understand any of the web examples I looked at at the time.
[07:09:52] <cmr> This was also something like 4 years ago? I didn't have a very concrete mental model of anything then.
[07:09:54] <skrylar> i found literate programming to be a pain
[07:10:26] <skrylar> IDEs don't support it very well, neither does Vim. Emacs "kind of" does through org-mode's idea of literate programming, you at least get syntax highlighting in focus blocks
[07:10:46] <skrylar> its a pain to trace line numbers between noweb's tangle/weave manglings of source
[07:11:31] <skrylar> My guess is it would be amazing if you had an outlining IDE, e.g. GrandView for DOS with code support or a non-derpy Leo
[07:11:34] <Yurume> cmr: how about this: https://www.tug.org/texlive//devsrc/Master/texmf-dist/doc/generic/knuth/tex/tex.pdf
[07:11:59] <cmr> Yurume: Is this the tex specification?
[07:12:15] <Yurume> TeX software itself with the documentation!
[07:12:32] <cmr> ... oh
[07:12:32] <Yurume> (to be exact, TeX version 3.1415926)
[07:12:54] <skrylar> (before anyone asks, my issue with Leo is that while it supports clones and thus is good at keeping your source file and documentation together in the tree view, it actually *loses* clone status to nodes when asked to do a read-back from source, instead of updating all the clones >:|)
[07:13:03] <Yurume> actually that *is* much readable than many other similar documents, but I think it is bad for casual skimming.
[07:14:11] <yuriks> I have a raytracing book that is a literate (part of a) program
[07:14:14] <Yurume> ...is it just my feeling that this channel is becoming en route to #rust-anydev? XD
[07:14:17] <yuriks> pretty nice, as far as I'm concerned
[07:14:20] <Yurume> s/becoming//
[07:14:31] <cmr> Yurume: I feel like that's true of most gamedev communities I"ve seen...
[07:14:35] <yuriks> but then, it's more of a "book with code examples" thing rather than "explained source code"
[07:14:42] <cmr> the kind of people they attract are a hodgepodge of interests.
[07:15:10] <skrylar> eh, gamedevs are weird people :)
[07:15:25] <yuriks> (I need to port my raytracer to rust...)
[07:19:32] <jeaye> There aren't really enough people to fill this channel with active gamedev chatter yet.
[07:19:41] <jeaye> So other topics find their way in.

[07:21:32] <Yurume> \o
[07:21:36] <skrylar> i don't think we have much in the way of ongoing games, jeaye, heh
[07:22:43] <jeaye> Yet!
[07:23:09] <csherratt> bjz, Window ownership in glfw is going to be a problem.
[07:23:20] <bjz> yeah? :[
[07:24:18] <cmr> I find it impossible to start a game project because I either can't come up with a good idea that I could reasonably implement, or I think it's just a trashier version of something I've already played.
[07:24:19] <csherratt> I commented on your pull request. But in short, the render task and the task that handles input both need access to the Window context.
[07:24:38] <skrylar> cmr: well, there are a lot of reinterpretations in games
[07:24:59] <skrylar> quite a few designs based on "this is a game i really liked minus something really stupid"
[07:25:43] <skrylar> cmr: another fun thought experiment is to take an established genre and then try to remove something that every AAA title has decided is an obvious requirement, e.g. "how would I design an RPG without dedicated tank builds"
[07:25:58] <cmr> hey that does sound fun.
[07:26:11] <cmr> I have a confession, and that's I prefer real games to video games ;p
[07:26:37] <skrylar> i guess there's always VASSAL for prototyping board games
[07:27:19] <Yurume> I have a confession: I actually don't play any video game except for music video games ;p
[07:27:37] <jeaye> I don't play any video games. :|
[07:27:42] <Yurume> lol
[07:27:54] <jeaye> But I'm a gamedev!
[07:28:07] <cmr> One of the gamedevs I know IRL is in the same situation :p
[07:29:02] <jeaye> Most people I know are gamedevs because they like playing games and know how to code. I'm a gamedev because I love programming and just fell into the games industry.
[07:29:44] <skrylar> i would be a gamedev but i'm on a bit of a detour at the moment :<

[08:18:48] <Yurume> I haven't tried zsh yet
[08:45:18] <skrylar> hm not bad; simple Rust bin is 1.6m 
[08:45:44] <skrylar> I know keeping the unicode database on hand guarantees a minimum of 1-3mb, for full UTF support
[08:46:43] <Yurume> UTF-8 doesn't need the database, Unicode-aware collation and case folding does.
[08:47:03] <Yurume> rust-encoding weighs (as far as I can recall) at 1 meg
[08:47:06] <skrylar> "full UTF support" :)
[08:47:13] <Yurume> full "Unicode" support then :)
[08:47:32] <skrylar> i think i have my old C code for unicode around but i would like to put off touching it again as long as i can
[08:47:38] <Yurume> though Unicode is a set of lots of unrelated specs
[08:47:49] <skrylar> Writing ANSI C for UTF-8 + BiDi + Normalization is the sad bag. 
[08:47:54] <Yurume> and there is no such thing as "the full Unicode conformance" to be sure
[08:48:02] <Yurume> skrylar: awww
[08:48:18] <Yurume> at least I've written the normalization, but it was in D
[08:48:33] <Yurume> and I think I had a bug
[08:50:03] <Yurume> by the way, the database can be compressed with an appropriate use of tries and some optimizations
[08:51:03] <skrylar> this was after the use of tries
[08:51:06] <Yurume> for the simple case folding, I guess a table-mapped delta value would work greatly
[08:51:09] <skrylar> well, multi-buckets
[08:51:43] <Yurume> I actually considered a perfect hashing for rust-encoding and it was much harder than expected
[08:52:15] <Yurume> minimal perfect hashing, to be exact (since I wanted to optimize for space)
[08:52:54] <skrylar> I had the unicode database in one folder, a ruby script to read it and extract only fields which were useful for unicode casing/normalization; then it loaded those in to structures and calculated hash codes for each one
[08:53:14] <skrylar> and a two-stage table of indices that pointed at unique datablocks
[08:53:25] <skrylar> it took about 1.6mb IIRC
[08:53:33] <Yurume> the whole UCD?
[08:53:40] <skrylar> yeah, the relevant parts of the UCD
[08:53:58] <Yurume> what was relevant for you?
[08:54:12] <Yurume> (since, for example, the lowercase/uppercase conversation cannot be implemented with the UCD alone)

[09:06:00] <Yurume> that... would be like ALGOL?
[09:06:02] <skrylar> i also like the hard typing (e.g. variant types, built-in set types)
[09:06:39] <Yurume> the lack of built-in set/map types is what I miss from the current Rust
[09:06:54] <Yurume> while I understand why they are not there
[09:07:01] <skrylar> Yeah I'm not a fan with how all of the 'good' new languages seem to converge on C++ syntax
[09:07:26] <skrylar> e.g. start off with scriptish types like ~[T] and shortly become Map<Blah,Womble>() everywhere
[09:07:38] <Yurume> the current HashMap interface is quite annoying to use

[09:10:25] <skrylar> begin/end don't require the shift key, and i don't mind verbose smalltalkish syntax
[09:10:41] <Yurume> and it does the right thing that C++ should have been done
[09:10:43] <skrylar> all though there's a bit more to pascal syntax than that
[09:10:57] <Yurume> except for ! which replaces an unary ~ :)
[09:11:20] <Yurume> (I think Go's choice of ^ for this purpose is much better)
[09:11:23] <skrylar> I never really minded having to put var's at the start of a block; keeps the variables you use there in order
[09:11:29] <skrylar> as opposed to having let's all over the place
[09:11:51] <Yurume> shadowing lets are useful though
[09:12:15] <Yurume> greatly reduces the occurences of mutable bindings
[09:12:28] <skrylar> i use mutable bindings :<
[09:13:14] <Yurume> skrylar: "makes the code use mutable bindings only when they are required"

[09:13:46] <skrylar> well, at least since i have a smalltalk background
[09:14:02] <skrylar> you *can* Haskell it, but that entails loads of copying structs for no real benefit

[09:16:32] <Yurume> in my opinion the pure function programming is how to do things in entirely different ways. it is not inherently bad, but you have to be accustomed to the new way
[09:17:07] <skrylar> I view it like math; useful, but a nightmare.
[09:17:07] <Yurume> that's why I don't feel attached to the pure function programming even after having done some programming in Haskell
[09:17:26] <Yurume> (it is... at least useful for making compilers. :p)
[09:17:44] <skrylar> well pattern matching sure is nice
[09:18:41] <skrylar> I still find it funny that a lot of functional languages have an excess of strictness rules and compile-time information, yet they still produce generally slow and bad machine code
[09:18:57] <skrylar> I mean, imperative compilers claim that they have difficulties because they can't make very many assumptions
[09:19:21] <skrylar> But high-yield functional compilers are few and far between, research projects like Stalin for Scheme are rarely talked about
[09:19:29] <skrylar> and those languages can make way more assumptions
[09:20:39] <skrylar> I think in Haskell's particular case, they have too much syntactic sugar between what most people write and what GHC actually sees. Monads for instance cover up some very horrifying looking code after processing.

[19:11:34] <Hildar> Are there bindings for sdl-mixer2.0 (and/or the other sdl libraries) being worked on yet does anyone know? Or have I just found myself a project?
[19:27:55] <Amaranth> Hildar: Guess you just found yourself a project :)
[19:28:14] <Amaranth> Although for those I think they're mostly the same as the SDL 1.x versions, right?
[19:29:27] <Amaranth> https://github.com/brson/rust-sdl/blob/master/src/sdl/mixer.rs
[19:30:19] <Hildar> Amaranth: Not sure if they are completely compatible, but yeah, I think (mixer at least) was just a version bump to match sdl 'core'.
[19:30:56] <o11c> the audio subsystem only slightly changed between SDL1 and SDL2
[19:33:42] <Hildar> So the question is, can I just copypaste the rust-sdl code, or will it break horribly. :D
[19:35:30] <Amaranth> Hildar: Review the ll module part to ensure it still matches the C header
[19:35:37] <Amaranth> If that matches the rest of it should be fine

[22:10:11] <dmillerw> is there any good way to do what I'm trying to do here? http://i.imgur.com/x1Roehi.png (in CallbackMouse). Because I obviously can't borrow an immutable field and modify it... at least, that's what the compiler tells me

[22:18:12] <cmr> dmillerw: use a static mut (a global), or Cell.
[22:25:58] <dmillerw> I haven't messed with those yet. There an example or bit in the manual on them?
