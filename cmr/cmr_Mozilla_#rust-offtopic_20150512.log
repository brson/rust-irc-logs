[00:00:54] <Gankro> Nanobots is basically the logical conclusion of this premise: make an assload of super generic robots that work together to solve tasks effeciently

[00:04:35] <Tiffany> yeah but there's a serious efficiency tradeoff gankro
[00:05:08] <Tiffany> like, you need a hundred humanoid robots, and several hours, and also a huge ramp, to elevate a large block, as depicted in the movie
[00:05:13] <Tiffany> whereas a crane could do it in minutes, once setup
[00:05:21] <Tiffany> and crane rentals are a thing
[00:05:22] <Gankro> Tiffany: depends on where the bottleneck is
[00:05:42] <Gankro> If the blocks takes that long to produce it doesn't matter
[00:06:11] <Gankro> Tiffany: You're assuming anyone even *makes* cranes anymore
[00:06:14] <Tiffany> I find it extremely unlikely that humanoid robots will ever reach the economy of scale to be effectively free
[00:06:26] <Tiffany> and even if something does achieve that, I doubt it will be humanoid robots
[00:06:30] <Tiffany> the humanoid shape is not exactly optimal
[00:06:39] <Tiffany> like if it has to be roughly human-sized, then you might as well give it tentacle arms
[00:06:41] <Tiffany> they're more flexible
[00:06:56] <Tiffany> or at least more joints, to prevent singularities
[00:07:26] <Tiffany> the movie also clearly depicts there being more than one type of robot
[00:07:53] <Tiffany> this is also assuming current rules about manufacturing are in place too
[00:08:06] <Tiffany> if you have on the spot 3D printing, economy of scale doesn't apply so much
[00:08:35] <ytain> cmr you can use install_name_tool

[00:10:02] <Tiffany> there's a lot of variables
[00:10:04] <Gankro> cmr: noooo
[00:10:24] <Gankro> You were about to start an illustrious career of programming in pure binary!
[00:10:37] <cmr> please die.

[00:13:26] <cmr> ytain: that's a lot easier to automate than this binary diff, thanks a lot!

[05:12:22] <Havvy> https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/development/compilers/rustc/1.0.0-beta.nix
[05:12:46] <eddyb_> oh I haven't used those
[05:13:01] <eddyb_> ... grsec?
[05:13:23] <Havvy> I don't know anything about grsec w.r.t nixpkgs.
[05:13:24] <eddyb_> just one test?
[05:13:35] <eddyb_> that's odd
[05:14:52] <eddyb_> it would be nice if nixpkgs supported building from a git repo, with as much automation as possible, but maybe requiring a flag somewhere to enable "unathenticated git-based nightlies"
[05:15:24] <Havvy> Yeah. But it's fully deterministic right now.
[05:15:34] <eddyb_> it's also useless for me
[05:15:48] <eddyb_> which is why I use the nightlies. but I haven't written a proper derivation for them yet
[05:18:12] <eddyb_> Havvy: like, the deterministic stuff is useful for "production", but not development

[07:51:03] <Tobba> oh, joy
[07:51:16] <Tobba> most cargo libs don't build under cygwin due to native dependencies
[07:51:29] <Tobba> and end up shoving in MinGW-style paths when trying to build things
[07:57:09] <Tobba> so now I need to install the 1.2GB (uselessly dodgy) MinGW toolchain to have cargo... build cargo... so that I can use cargo-build to specify a single option to rustc

[16:07:03] <XMPPwocky> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9531822 woo, the silly rust FUD begins
[16:09:54] <GaryOak_> I think having the backing of Mozilla will keep Rust going regardless of what the outside world thinks of it
[16:13:00] <GaryOak_> and just having alternatives to C/C++ will move a whole bunch of people 
[16:13:44] <nerdopoly> I think Rust has a good enough following now to keep it going nonetheless.
[16:14:06] <GaryOak_> yeah, everyone talks about Go, but they are so different
[16:15:02] <niconii> "C++ is a subset of C, not the other way around."
[16:15:04] <niconii> ???
[16:16:29] <nerdopoly> That should be "C is a subset of C++, C++ is not a superset of C"
[16:17:00] <lahwran> um
[16:17:51] <lahwran> if C is a strict subset of C++, then C++ is a strict superset of C
[16:17:59] <lahwran> they are equal statements
[16:18:03] <fmtq> sure are 
[16:18:15] <fmtq> "B is a subclass of A, but A is not a superclass of B" 
[16:18:23] <lahwran> that's not the same thing
[16:18:28] <fmtq> isn't it?
[16:18:29] <fmtq> discuss
[16:18:32] <lahwran> oh, yes it is
[16:18:39] <nerdopoly> C++ is not a *strict* superset of C.
[16:18:41] <lahwran> sorry, I read you wrong, I thought you said subclass twice
[16:18:49] <fmtq> suber
[16:18:52] <fmtq> sup
[16:19:05] <fmtq> suÞer
[16:19:07] <lahwran> the difference between strict superset and non-strict superset is just whether equality is allowed
[16:19:13] <lahwran> and they are not equal
[16:19:15] <lahwran> so it's not really relevant
[16:19:22] <lahwran> it isn't a strict superset of C
[16:19:30] <lahwran> and it isn't equal
[16:19:33] <lahwran> so it's not a superset of C
[16:19:44] <lahwran> and therefore, C is not a subset of C++
[16:20:12] *** Joins: Binero (jeroen@moz-91joat.69vi.s4ge.1810.2a02.IP)
[16:20:29] <lahwran> the only thing that you can reasonably say is that it's *nearly* a superset of C
[16:20:32] <lahwran> it's pretty close
[16:20:35] <barosl> It is interesting to see that the author did post a link to the Russian Rust meetup before writing the post
[16:20:38] <lahwran> but there are things changed or missing, iirc
[16:20:39] <barosl> 6 days ago
[16:20:45] <niconii> right, because as has been previously established, C++ is clearly a subset of C
[16:20:58] <barosl> So it seems that the author decided to learn Rust about 6 days ago, tried, failed, and got anger?
[16:21:01] <niconii> i can't believe people still use C++ instead of the rich abstractions that C has to offer
[16:21:16] <niconii> like segfaults
[16:21:37] <nerdopoly> I'm only a C programmer but I was told that C{{
[16:21:44] <barosl> Let's not forget about #define macros
[16:22:02] <nerdopoly> I'm only a C programmer but I was told that not every C program is a valid C++ program.
[16:22:07] <barosl> They're of course superior to Rust's creepy macros!
[16:22:13] <barosl> A simple but powerful one
[16:22:20] <lahwran> barosl: C++/C has some really huge advantages over rust
[16:22:33] <lahwran> I don't know what they are, since I don't use them, but people who use them and not rust tell me so
[16:23:20] <nerdopoly> While it is true that there are some advantages to C(++), I find the pain of manual memory management is enough that I prefer Rust.
[16:24:05] <lahwran> s/ to / for /
[16:24:31] <FreeFull> C++ does have a lot of features that Rust doesn't
[16:24:40] <niconii> well yeah, rust doesn't have any of the nice features C offers, like buffer overflows, double-freeing pointers, null-terminated strings, strings that aren't terminated *at all*...
[16:24:41] <FreeFull> But then, Rust has things C++ doesn't do well
[16:24:55] <lahwran> C++ has features rust can never HOPE to have
[16:24:58] <lahwran> like, um
[16:25:02] <lahwran> um
[16:25:11] <FreeFull> lahwran: a very complicated template system
[16:25:12] <lahwran> I have no idea, I don't actually use the language I'm arguing for!
[16:25:13] <niconii> writing a program entirely in templates?
[16:25:15] <GaryOak_> Rust very much so requires the programmer to change their mindset to thinking about borrows and lifetimes, which could be hard for people
[16:25:15] <nerdopoly> C is faster but that's because you have *no* builton safety net.  You do it all yourself.
[16:25:22] <nerdopoly> *builtin
[16:25:24] <lahwran> oh come now, niconii, rust does have *that* feature
[16:25:55] <GaryOak_> Especially because those are basically new concepts
[16:25:57] <lahwran> I think rust's biggest problem right now is being insufficiently documented
[16:26:03] <lahwran> exactly
[16:26:06] <FreeFull> C isn't strictly the fastest language. You can do better writing FORTRAN or hand-writing ASM
[16:26:19] <lahwran> you can't talk about how fast a language is, anyway
[16:26:32] <barosl> Regarding the null-terminated strings, I was frightened when I realized that std::string does not permit interm nulls
[16:26:34] <lahwran> only how fast an implementation of it is
[16:27:00] <nerdopoly> It's basically the fastest high-level systems language that I know of.
[16:27:03] <FreeFull> Although the latter can probably be completely replaced by https://github.com/StanfordPL/stoke-release
[16:27:09] <FreeFull> Or almost completely
[16:27:16] <GaryOak_> And you can't compare the speed of a concept of a closure in Rust to something in C
[16:27:40] <nerdopoly> I can't say for C++ however as I really don't like it.  It;'
[16:27:44] <FreeFull> We might need more steveklabniks
[16:27:51] <nerdopoly> It's almost as unreadable as Perl.
[16:28:29] <FreeFull> I have trouble reading Perl due to the implicitness

[16:30:16] <FreeFull> barosl: Now I'm curious too
[16:30:28] <barosl> They all must have been creepy at the beginning, right?
[16:30:50] <nerdopoly> By Java 1 do you mean Java 1.0 or 1.1?  Both can answer to that name.
[16:30:56] <barosl> lol
[16:31:11] <nerdopoly> Python 1 was basically Python 2 with less features.
[16:31:17] <barosl> That's right, they were one of the first entities that adopted Chrome-style version schemes
[16:31:29] <lahwran> which?
[16:31:32] <lahwran> python?
[16:31:36] <barosl> Java
[16:31:38] <lahwran> ah

[16:31:48] <lahwran> oic
[16:32:03] <FreeFull> Java 230
[16:32:19] <nerdopoly> With MAJOR holding the same meaning as MINOR.
[16:32:42] *** eddyb_ is now known as eddyb
[16:33:12] <barosl> Hmm... At the same time, it seems that by using only MAJOR Java may have claimed they will never make breaking changes
[16:33:23] <barosl> Because it's actually MINOR
[16:33:31] <barosl> ?! I'm confused...
[16:34:05] <niconii> sounds more like "java updates will break your shit when they feel like it"

[16:35:51] <nerdopoly> IMHO Python 3 is better.  It's more consistent and seems more Pythonic to me.
[16:36:15] <lahwran> "pythonic" is just a weird way of saying "what I like"
[16:36:25] <GaryOak_> haha
[16:36:29] <barosl> I was actually surprised that Python 3's market share was about ~10%, because I use Python 3 exclusively myself
[16:36:40] <lahwran> companies see no reason to update
[16:36:58] <GaryOak_> I think it's because most libs were written in 2.7 and never changed
[16:37:15] <lahwran> I use 2.7 exclusively for personal stuff
[16:37:25] <lahwran> I've actually tried to install 3, but it's just too hairy

[16:37:44] <GaryOak_> me too, it's pre-installed on mac and ubuntu
[16:37:44] <barosl> async/await in Python 3.5 might finally make some incentives for the transition to Python 3

[17:35:49] <Tiffany> well, it's from brazil, fmtq
[17:35:56] <Tiffany> and also the 90s
[17:36:15] <niconii> incrementing a variable ends up turning into "some_long_variable = some_long_variable + 1"
[17:36:15] <Tiffany> I think it's actually older than javascript
[17:36:38] <nerdopoly> It's supposed to be embedded into other programmes, such as games, to allow the average user to script.  I assume the consequence of that is a shaky, but easy to understand, syntax.
[17:36:48] <Tiffany> lua is 22 years old, javascript is 20 yars old
[17:37:05] <niconii> so javascript is the soviet clone
[17:37:09] <Tiffany> don't ask me what a yar is

[17:56:32] <nerdopoly> Yes.
[17:57:12] <taryn> Tobba: wait what?
[17:57:15] <Tobba> more accurately; if you time it correctly the driver fills the RAM and you either get a freeze or a BSOD
[17:57:52] <nerdopoly> I would've expected at least a few high profile ADoS attacks by now and at least one DADoS attack.
[17:57:56] <Tobba> taryn: I'm pretty sure that still works at least, basically requesting something big and setting the TCP window size to 0 a whole lot of times used to just kill the entire system
[17:58:29] <Tobba> trying to find something on that
[17:58:34] <taryn> Tobba: all the more reason for me to have a machine scrubing things
[17:58:42] <lahwran> scrubing
[18:00:18] <nerdopoly> Scrub-a-dub-dub those packets!
[18:00:25] <Tobba> taryn: http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2009-1926
[18:00:36] <Tobba> this was known for bloody ages, but at least it looks like it has a CVE number
[18:00:40] <Tobba> so I guess they did fix it at some point
[18:00:52] <barosl> Is there anyone here who prefers writing Cargo.toml directly rather than using `cargo init`?
[18:01:06] <nerdopoly> barosl: Yep
[18:01:11] <lahwran> I always forget how to write it initially
[18:02:06] <barosl> nerdopoly, Do you use Haskell? If you do, do you also find project.cabal easy to write manually?
[18:02:50] <barosl> I'm failing to memorize it several times, so I'm preparing to consider either myself or Cabal to be dumb
[18:03:02] <nerdopoly> No.  I've been meaning to learn Haskell.  But I've never gotten round to it and I don't know what a project.cabal is.
[18:03:24] <barosl> It's just an equivalent to Cargo.toml, a bit more complex
[18:03:48] *** Joins: eerie (eerie@moz-9ml73n.red.bezeqint.net)
[18:04:39] <ytain> easiest way to not require to memorize is for cargo init to generate a full template with most of the features not needed initially to be commented out and you have the option to uncomment and add/edit whenever is convenient for you
[18:05:37] <barosl> That's... a nice method, but I just don't like the concept of autogenerated configuration files
[18:05:48] <barosl> Don't ask me why :P
[18:05:57] <fmtq> so is there a clean way to organise Lua code
[18:05:58] <fmtq> >_>
[18:06:13] <Gankro> barosl: Never even heard of cargo init. I just use `new` and work my way up as demands are realized
[18:06:29] <fmtq> oh I can do disturbing shit like Foo = {} 
[18:06:33] *** Quits: eerie (eerie@moz-9ml73n.red.bezeqint.net) (Connection closed)
[18:06:33] <fmtq> function Foo.lolol() 
[18:06:39] <fmtq> MY WOD
[18:06:41] <fmtq> WORD* 
[18:06:45] <barosl> Gankro, Oops, sorry, I meant `cargo new`
[18:06:56] <barosl> I even don't know the name of the subcommand!
[18:07:05] <barosl> Fairly non-cargoic person
[18:07:09] <fmtq> no lua no, please stop
[18:07:25] <GaryOak_> fmtq: did you get to tables yet lolz
[18:07:27] <Gankro> barosl: Ah. Well `new` barely does anything but set up "hello world" which is quite handy
[18:07:32] <fmtq> GaryOak_: I am not going to 
[18:07:37] <Tobba> fmtq: fun fact: lua lets you do shit like loadstring "print('foo')" ()
[18:07:45] <fmtq> oh I know the loadstring shit
[18:07:46] <Gankro> Pretty light weight as far as project generation goes
[18:07:54] <Tobba> somefunction { a = 5 }
[18:07:55] <fmtq> loadfile('hahaha')()
[18:07:56] <fmtq> in it goes
[18:08:05] <Tobba> I meant the paren-dropping
[18:08:09] <fmtq> oh no
[18:08:17] <fmtq> OH NO
[18:08:25] <fmtq> what the fuck is a metatable
[18:08:33] <Tobba> for k, v in pairs{ a = 10, b = 20 } do
[18:08:34] <Tobba> MAGIC
[18:08:38] <nerdopoly> I don't use `cargo new` because I prefer to initialize my git repo myself when I'm ready and I can't be bothered to use the --cvs flag
[18:08:38] <XMPPwocky> i believe that's a pokemon
[18:08:46] <fmtq> XMPPwocky: trubbish
[18:09:03] <fmtq> lua documentation is horrible
[18:09:07] <fmtq> formatting wise
[18:09:09] <fmtq> and content wise
[18:09:10] <Tobba> fmtq: setmetatable({}, {__index = function() return "fart" end})
[18:09:17] <Tobba> this returns a table where all accesses return "fart"
[18:09:19] <fmtq> so I pull out my gun
[18:09:20] <Tobba> no matter what
[18:09:43] <barosl> I like Lua solely because LuaJIT is awesomely fast, no idea what's going on in its syntax
[18:09:46] <Tobba> fun fact: the debug library lets you do vividly unsafe things in lua (especially in luajit, I think)
[18:09:55] <XMPPwocky> TIL rust used to have classes
[18:09:56] <Tobba> like setting upvalues of C functions
[18:10:05] <taryn> XMPPwocky: oh?
[18:10:06] <XMPPwocky> are there any features rust *hasn't* had
[18:10:09] <XMPPwocky> https://pcwalton.github.io/blog/2012/06/03/maximally-minimal-classes-for-rust/
[18:10:41] <fmtq> classes will return
[18:10:43] <barosl> XMPPwocky, Rust also had record-level mutability, IIRC
[18:10:46] <fmtq> mark my words.
[18:10:57] <Tobba> hm
[18:11:05] <Tobba> I wonder if LLVM can optimize repeated locks of an RwLock
[18:11:07] <Tobba> probably not.
[18:11:10] <barosl> http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2012/07/24/generalizing-inherited-mutability/
[18:11:12] <barosl> Yeah, here it is
[18:11:31] <barosl> "inherited mutability" sounds scary
[18:11:43] <fmtq> ret err("Trademark violation");
[18:12:02] <barosl> Yeah, it used to be `ret`
[18:12:15] <barosl> Frankly I wanted it to remain :P
[18:12:19] <fmtq> I don't care about ret
[18:12:21] <Tobba> that swapping operator though
[18:12:22] <fmtq> I'm talking about the rest
[18:12:42] <barosl> Oh right, we also had the <-> operator
[18:13:04] <barosl> How bad Rust eventually got unbelievably verbose!
[18:13:16] <barosl> We should reintroduce the ~ pointer!
[18:13:36] <Tobba> we clearly need to introduce APL operators
[18:13:59] <barosl> Luckily we have many Unicode glyphs to assign meanings
[18:14:06] <taryn> barosl: emojirust
[18:14:10] <nerdopoly> XMPPwocky: A sane integer system (https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1027)
[18:14:52] <XMPPwocky> let ௵ = 42u8;
[18:15:34] <GaryOak_> the type system has the most confusing syntax
[18:15:46] <nerdopoly> I think Rust is missing out by not having undefined behaviours. /s
[18:15:56] <barosl> XMPPwocky, What the hell is the character!
[18:16:01] <barosl> Wait, is it a character?
[18:16:05] <XMPPwocky> yes
[18:16:13] <barosl> What is it called?
[18:16:26] <barosl> Google doesn't have answers :(
[18:16:28] <XMPPwocky> let ﷽ =ஔ௵  
[18:16:29] <Tobba> is that a single code point?
[18:16:30] <XMPPwocky> oh good god
[18:16:33] <XMPPwocky> that's three codepoints there
[18:16:44] <Tobba> what the fuck
[18:16:57] <XMPPwocky> ஔ
[18:17:07] <nerdopoly> I can't see these characters.  My terminal doesn't support anything outside extended ascii.
[18:17:18] <XMPPwocky> ﷽
[18:17:23] <XMPPwocky> that's one codepoint too
[18:17:30] <XMPPwocky> but if you append other things to it it blows up for some reason
[18:17:31] <barosl> Oh my gosh...
[18:17:35] <XMPPwocky> ﷽௵  
[18:17:41] <XMPPwocky> two codepoints

[18:18:12] -playbot- '\u{fdfd}'
[18:18:24] <barosl> I think we have another reason to abandon monospaced fonts to be used for coding
[18:18:39] <XMPPwocky> barosl: my terminal breaks monospacing for ௵  
[18:18:40] <barosl> Because we need to use them as operators
[18:18:45] <XMPPwocky> it actually increases the width

[18:20:50] <barosl> I'm surprised that such a character is within the BMP region

[18:21:14] <fmtq> nerdopoly: a clone of Pirates
[18:21:15] <XMPPwocky> does .tk let you do unicode

[18:21:38] <fmtq> I wonder why
[18:21:48] <XMPPwocky> lol
[18:22:42] <nerdopoly> All these characters are appearing as little rectangles for me.
[18:22:43] <barosl> The Web would become more interesting if it allows non-character unicode code points in domains

[18:29:24] <Tiffany> fmtq: I have never used module()

[18:30:01] <Tiffany> why?
[18:30:14] <fmtq> because I'm a perfectionist and this feels wrong
[18:30:23] <Tiffany> all you have to do is accept that all data structures in lua are inevitably tables
[18:30:26] <Tiffany> arrays are tables
[18:30:28] <Tiffany> hash maps are tables
[18:30:30] <Tiffany> structs are tables

[18:32:26] <eddyb> not even chrome can render those characters
[18:32:30] <Tiffany> qt uses UCS-2 strings eddyb?
[18:32:40] <eddyb> Tiffany: look up QString
[18:32:41] <Tobba> Tiffany: it's an arabic characters which is like 10 chars wide

[18:33:14] <Tiffany> I think I have droid sans for that
[18:33:35] <Tiffany> oh
[18:33:47] <Tiffany> wait, so what the fuck is this?
[18:33:54] <Tiffany> their own halfassed multwidth encoding?
[18:34:02] <Tiffany> or do you just have to guess whether or not something is a surrogate pair
[18:34:36] <eddyb> Tiffany: it looks UTF-16 to me
[18:34:47] <Tiffany> I don't know how utf-16 works
[18:35:07] <eddyb> the issue is that a whole bunch of stuff built on top of it makes the stupid assumptions JS does
[18:35:19] <eddyb> *the same stoopid
[18:36:11] <eddyb> it's not designed to prevent treating each 16-bit unit as a codepoint
[18:36:18] <Tiffany> ewww
[18:36:25] <Tiffany> it makes a distinction between null and empty strings
[18:36:31] <eddyb> lol
[18:36:42] <eddyb> that's C++ for you
[18:36:50] <Tiffany> not really?
[18:37:04] <eddyb> you have NULL, why not put it to use :P?
[18:37:14] <Tiffany> but std::string isn't usually passed by pointer
[18:37:27] <eddyb> wait, you mean NULL *QString?
[18:37:30] <eddyb> not null data pointer?
[18:37:43] <fmtq> "" != NULL
[18:37:48] <Tiffany> no
[18:37:53] <Tiffany> QString("").isNull();             // returns false
[18:37:54] <Tiffany> QString("").isEmpty();            // returns true
[18:38:01] <fmtq> which is correct.
[18:38:06] <FreeFull> If you have Option<String>, there is a difference between None and Some("")
[18:38:08] <Tiffany> std::string does not have .isNull()
[18:38:11] <Tiffany> it only has .empty()
[18:38:26] <fmtq> that's just a peculiarity with their API 
[18:38:27] <Tiffany> a default-constructed std::string compares equal to ""
[18:38:28] <fmtq> the concept is sane
[18:38:31] <eddyb> Tiffany: the reasoning for that is "you have two possible empty string states, why not put them to use?"
[18:38:56] <eddyb> is it a good idea? fuck no. is it a good idea to a C++ programmer. not unlikely
[18:39:00] <Tiffany> my feeling on the matter is what freefull suggested
[18:39:16] <Tiffany> boost::optional and std::experimental::optional yo
[18:39:21] <fmtq> I am so tired.
[18:39:24] <fmtq> :<
[18:39:40] <fmtq> I am no longer good at day
[18:39:48] * FreeFull puts fmtq in bed
[18:39:54] <FreeFull> I'm not too god at day either
[18:40:00] <eddyb> Tiffany: Qt/KDE apps avoid boost (which means they reimplement a bunch of stuff) and this stuff is older than the web we know
[18:40:05] <eddyb> like
[18:40:20] <eddyb> WebKit is a fork of KHTML IIRC
[18:40:23] <eddyb> K stands for KDE
[18:40:34] <fmtq> you recall correctly
[18:40:39] <fmtq> []_[]
[18:40:59] <fmtq> ಠ_ಠ 
[18:41:10] <FreeFull> I have fond memories of Konqeror
[18:41:11] <eddyb> "KHTML itself came into existence on November 4, 1998,[4] as a copy of the khtmlw library, with some slight refactoring and the addition of Unicode support and changes to support the move to Qt 2."
[18:41:31] <eddyb> I wonder of unicode support in Qt was added solely for JS
[18:41:38] <eddyb> *if
[18:42:01] <fmtq> I have no memories.
[18:42:06] <eddyb> no, that predates KJS

[18:44:33] <fmtq> it's clearly a wrong number
[18:44:34] <eddyb> Tiffany: that's not an excuse, but that's pretty much the reason for most of this cruft
[18:44:43] <eddyb> fmtq: drama!
[18:44:47] <fmtq> but the message seems to say "I screwed up compiling the phone numbers into a document that I emailed you so I thought I'd text you."

[21:53:12] <barosl> Oh
[21:53:23] <barosl> Then... dunno
[21:53:24] <fmtq> and checking for NaN was easy
[21:53:28] <fmtq> x === x
[21:53:36] <fmtq> the only thing that ever returns false to itself is NaN
[21:53:46] <fmtq> JS.
[21:53:48] <fmtq> a piece of shit.

[21:55:01] <fmtq> and then an if (x === x && ...) 
[21:55:02] <Tiffany> because there's a bunch of 'php'
[21:55:05] <fmtq> it's doing a NaN check
[21:55:06] <XMPPwocky> Tiffany: js, from what the google images things said
[21:55:09] <Tiffany> array() == null && null == 0 && 0 == 'php'

[21:56:54] <fmtq> welcome to PHP
[21:57:06] <Astrum|Lap> I'm just waiting for the ====
[21:57:10] <Astrum|Lap> we need analog equality
[21:57:19] <barosl> I liked CoffeeScript which always converts == into ===
[21:57:41] <Tiffany> does coffeescript have another operator for ==?
[21:57:46] <XMPPwocky> at least equality's transitive
[21:57:48] <Tiffany> like shitty_equals(a,b)
[21:57:55] <barosl> I don't think so
[21:57:56] <XMPPwocky> er
[21:58:20] <XMPPwocky> symmetric
[21:58:34] <XMPPwocky> i remember in one language, equality always coerces the RHS to the type of the LHS
[21:58:40] <XMPPwocky> so like 0 == "" but "" != 0
[21:58:44] <Tiffany> hahaha
[21:58:48] <barosl> Tiffany, They suggest to use "`x == y`"
[21:58:51] <Tiffany> "Additionally, "0"==false is true, but if("0"){/* executes */}"

[21:59:32] <fmtq> https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/21ezh3/javascript_equality_table/cgcm8qz
[21:59:39] <Astrum|Lap> that's nearly an esolang property
[21:59:55] <Tiffany> null >= 0
[21:59:59] <Tiffany> null >= 0.
[22:00:04] <XMPPwocky> Astrum|Lap: at least it's somewhat intuitive
[22:00:19] <Astrum|Lap> it... is?
[22:00:24] <barosl> That Java behavior is amusing too
[22:00:32] <barosl> https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/21ezh3/javascript_equality_table/cgcnnhg
[22:00:40] <Astrum|Lap> anyway
[22:00:50] <Astrum|Lap> I supose I should get back to programming in the best language EVER
[22:01:05] <barosl> Frankly I'm more surprised at that than JS
[22:02:00] <Havvy> Just don't use `==` in JS and you'll save yourself a lot of trouble.
[22:02:33] * Astrum|Lap should grep his code
[22:05:07] <fmtq> Havvy: except for null checking
[22:05:09] <fmtq> foo == null 
[22:05:14] <fmtq> another FUN FACT
[22:05:17] <fmtq> undefined is not a keyword.
[22:05:20] <fmtq> undefined = 42;
[22:05:22] <fmtq> ENJOY;
[22:05:44] <Havvy> fmtq: It's a nonconfigurable global property.
[22:05:48] <fmtq> it's another reason you see bizarre shit like foo = void 0; 
[22:05:49] <Havvy> At least as of ES5.
[22:06:05] <fmtq> Havvy: maybe
[22:06:15] <Astrum|Lap> and the web still manages to function
[22:06:18] <Astrum|Lap> amazing
[22:06:20] <fmtq> for now
[22:06:24] <fmtq> _for now_
[22:06:36] <fmtq> also arguably IE didn't "function" 
[22:06:51] <fmtq> also I love how MS had the chance to finally drop their shit branding
[22:06:54] <fmtq> and went with something dumber.
[22:07:04] <fmtq> they are the dad joke of everything
[22:07:29] <Havvy> You could still do something like `(function () { var undefined = 42; ... })` but the `undefined` variable is only in scope in the IIFE, not outside of it, so it's not really dangerous to use undefined these days.
[22:08:56] <fmtq> heh coincidentally my fiancee has decided to learn JS todya 
[22:09:03] <fmtq> like, actual coincidence.
[22:09:05] <fmtq> creepy shit
[22:09:18] <GaryOak_> the dad joke of everything, that's a perfect description
[22:09:37] <GaryOak_> Microsoft is the Nerdy Dad of the computing world
[22:10:14] <Astrum|Lap> wait, what is MS doing?
[22:10:19] <fmtq> "Edge"
[22:10:23] <fmtq> they named the fucking browser edge.
[22:10:40] <fmtq> they used their stupid fucking internal codename for "always use the latest browser" as the new brand
[22:10:41] <GaryOak_> Spartan was a cooler name IMO
[22:10:49] <fmtq> it's such an e-penis high five I can't believe it
[22:11:06] <Astrum|Lap> oh... good job, MS
[22:11:12] <Astrum|Lap> way to be hip
[22:11:18] <fmtq> well what the fuck is "metro" called
[22:11:24] <fmtq> because everyone just called it metro 
[22:11:29] <fmtq> and nobody remembers the shitty name they gave it

[22:12:27] <GaryOak_> A spokesperson for Microsoft said via e-mail that the Metro name is now "Windows Store apps." 
[22:12:44] <fmtq> that doesn't make sense
[22:12:47] <fmtq> it's a style and UX model 
[22:12:55] <VShell> Metro, the UI, is called Modern UI now.
[22:12:58] <fmtq> MODERN
[22:12:59] <fmtq> LOL
[22:13:04] <fmtq> real fucking descript and timeless
[22:13:05] <VShell> Metro apps are Windows Store apps.
[22:13:14] <fmtq> that's dumb and they should feel dumb.
[22:13:18] <fmtq> do they feel dumb?
[22:13:22] <fmtq> iirc their profits did
[22:13:25] <fmtq> and Windows RT.
[22:13:29] <GaryOak_> hahaha
[22:13:34] <fmtq> like
[22:13:39] <fmtq> it's already obscure in its utility
[22:13:42] <fmtq> why give it such a useless name?
[22:13:54] <fmtq> Not to be confused with Windows Runtime.
[22:14:00] <fmtq> WinRT.
[22:14:03] <fmtq> like.
[22:14:14] <fmtq> I genuinely want to know who these people are who make these decisions
[22:14:28] <GaryOak_> Or the fun names they give their Programming stack
[22:14:29] <Astrum|Lap> MS is such an also-ran except in a few areas
[22:14:43] <fmtq> also-ran?
[22:14:55] <fmtq> Win32.
[22:15:00] <fmtq> System
[22:15:02] <fmtq> System32
[22:15:06] <fmtq> SysWOW64 
[22:15:08] <Astrum|Lap> erm... they're competing but not winning
[22:15:16] <fmtq> surprise, System32 is 64bit and SysWOW64 is 32bit
[22:15:29] <Astrum|Lap> apple/google does something and they follow
[22:15:47] <GaryOak_> Windows Foundation
[22:15:53] <GaryOak_> Windows Core Foundation
[22:17:32] <GaryOak_> They just have no soul
[22:18:07] <fmtq> they never did
[22:18:12] <fmtq> their entire purpose to exist was profiteering
[22:18:18] <fmtq> it's coincidence that some of the shit they built ever worked
[22:19:40] <fmtq> In 1997, the Gartner Group reported that 80% of the world's business ran on COBOL with over 200 billion lines of code and 5 billion lines more being written annually.[93]
[22:19:46] <fmtq> WHO IS WRITING THESE LINES OF COBOL
[22:20:05] <GaryOak_> It's just the same lines over and over
[22:20:16] <fmtq> but
[22:20:23] <fmtq> how does this still happen
[22:20:38] <GaryOak_> It's probably a lot of comments
[22:22:18] <Tiffany> fmtq: who is the gartner group though/
[22:22:18] * GaryOak_ is off learning COBOL to join the horde producing the 5 billion line quota
[22:22:23] <Tiffany> are they pulling those numbers out of their ass?
[22:22:28] <fmtq> I hope so 
[22:22:40] <Tiffany> also, there needs to be a point of comparison
[22:22:43] <Tiffany> how many lines of code are on github?
