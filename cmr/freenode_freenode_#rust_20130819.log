[04:07:01] <dunpeal> wow, two years
[04:07:23] <dunpeal> that's a lot of time in today's fast-paced development scene
[04:14:11] <cmr> dunpeal: writing a language is a lot of work.
[04:16:13] <cmr> The only way the language gets to stability is lots of development and lots of use.
[04:16:51] <cmr> I mean, it'd be a bit premature to declare it production ready before it has been battle-tested and actually used in production, with a mature ecosystem.
[04:17:33] <SiegeLord> What does "production ready" even mean :P
[04:17:46] <SiegeLord> It's really a case-by-case determination
[04:18:10] <cmr> https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/milestones
[04:18:13] <cmr> Milestone #5
[04:18:32] <cmr> ", for each of the aspects described in the "well covered" milestone, and for each supported target platform, test success and benchmark performance has reached a level deemed suitable for production use in environments with substantial business consequences for major defects or low performance"
[04:18:35] <cmr> Quite subjective, yeah
[04:18:52] <cmr> I'll be using it in "production" quite a bit before milestone #1 ;p
[04:19:12] <SiegeLord> That's just Rust developer's idea of it... a user/company may decide differently
[04:19:16] <cmr> true
[04:19:23] <cmr> but it's the working definition of the rust team
[04:19:47] <dunpeal> it's not *that* subjective. I mean, some languages are clearly production ready, others aren't
[04:19:49] <SiegeLord> I wonder how those percentages evolved...
[04:20:08] *** Quits: gazoombo (uid6629@gateway/web/irccloud.com/x-naubkrwpvrsfbyqo) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[04:20:10] <cmr> dunpeal: also a matter of degree
[04:20:17] <cmr> Rust is entirely unsuitable atm, too much change
[04:20:23] <cmr> but after we hit backwards compat, or feature complete?
[04:20:30] <cmr> probably good enough for 99% of usecases
[04:20:33] <cmr> see: go
[04:20:46] <dunpeal> yeah, I bet at that point folks start using it
[04:21:00] <dunpeal> it's a little frustrating for me, because Rust seems so much better than C++
[04:21:08] <cmr> SiegeLord: it's just #issues closed / #issues open, for issues marked with that milestone.
[04:21:09] <dunpeal> and I have a new project, and would have loved to use Rust
[04:21:09] <bjz> dunpeal: folks are using it for side/hobby projects
[04:21:19] <bjz> dunpeal: like me and jeaye
[04:21:22] <cmr> and me!
[04:21:28] *** Quits: Ghoul_ (~uid6924@gateway/web/irccloud.com/x-jxgfbenbxhovcjcy) (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
[04:21:33] <bjz> :)
[04:21:37] <SiegeLord> cmr: I'd like a percentage over time graph... so I can extrapolate into the future >:)
[04:21:39] <dunpeal> *nod*, unfortunately this is a project for my employer
[04:21:43] <cmr> yeah
[04:21:46] <bjz> cmr: what are you doing?
[04:21:55] <cmr> bjz: writing rustc :P
[04:22:01] <dunpeal> how many non-Mozilla-employees are working on Rust?
[04:22:02] <bjz> hah!
[04:22:04] <cmr> I'm using it in my toy OS
[04:22:08] <bjz> dunpeal: a lot
[04:22:24] <cmr> 3 from samsung are paid to do it, although not full time
[04:22:31] <cmr> and the community involvement is huge
[04:22:36] <bjz> dunpeal: https://github.com/mozilla/rust/graphs/contributors
[04:22:46] <dunpeal> makes sense... as far as I can see, Rust is the only new contender for a real systems language
[04:22:50] <cmr> like, the 5 core developers employed by mozilla are not the top 5 contributors
[04:22:54] <dunpeal> since D will likely never take off
[04:22:57] <cmr> ok, they are
[04:23:07] <cmr> but that's only over the history of the whole repo :p
[04:23:15] <dunpeal> cmr: what's Samsung's angle?
[04:23:25] *** Joins: Ghoul_ (uid6924@gateway/web/irccloud.com/x-uhyammzwyaqtungk)
[04:23:38] <cmr> dunpeal: they're interested in Servo
[04:23:44] <bjz> dunpeal: 247 it seems - but that includes folks who've done one or two commits
[04:24:03] <bjz> dunpeal: yeah, rust has a great deal of momentumn
[04:24:06] <cmr> They've mostly been working on performance, arm, and android afaict
[04:24:08] <dunpeal> yeah, that's way high even for a language like Python
[04:24:09] <SiegeLord> You can highlight smaller time segments
[04:24:22] <dunpeal> maybe they want to use Servo in Taizen
[04:24:41] <dunpeal> *Tizen
[04:24:50] <cmr> yeah, in the past year, strcat is #4, above even graydon!
[04:24:53] <dunpeal> or support Rust as a core language in Tizen
[04:26:18] <dunpeal> bjz: "yeah, rust has a great deal of momentumn" -> in some ways, I kinda wonder why :)
[04:26:33] <cmr> I think the reason core dev work on Rust has petered off is because they're working more on servo, and the community has picked up a lot of the slack
[04:26:37] <dunpeal> the major usecase doesn't seem not be that broad
[04:26:51] <bjz> dunpeal: there are core devs who are committed to it
[04:27:04] <bjz> dunpeal: which breeds confidence
[04:27:15] <cmr> Also, it's an awesome language!
[04:27:23] <dunpeal> Agreed, but I mean, when you want the best possible performance, you're going to still use C/++, right?
[04:27:23] <bjz> dunpeal: it is also unique enough from C++ to be interesting
[04:27:48] <cmr> dunpeal: we already match C++ in perf, for the core language features
[04:27:59] <cmr> we just need robust, performant libraries
[04:28:02] <dunpeal> I thought Rust sacrificed some performance for safety?
[04:28:04] <cmr> nope
[04:28:09] <jeaye> Not really
[04:28:11] <bjz> dunpeal: it seems to be drawing people from multiple language communities, not just C++
[04:28:13] <cmr> rust's point is that it *doesn't* sacrifice performance for safety.
[04:28:16] <jeaye> llvm gives it a lot right out of the box
[04:28:18] <cmr> It achieves both
[04:28:28] <bjz> dunpeal: eg. Haskell, Ocaml, Python, Ruby...
[04:28:54] <bjz> dunpeal: lots of Rust's saftey checks are done statically, via the type system
[04:28:58] <dunpeal> OK, a systems language as nice as Rust that still performs like C++ would be a pretty big deal
[04:29:07] <jeaye> aye
[04:29:14] <bjz> dunpeal: so no perf penalties
[04:29:20] <cmr> dunpeal: https://gist.github.com/huonw/5553335
[04:29:25] <cmr> we beat clang at its own game :)
[04:29:37] <bjz> dunpeal: plus, you can always use unsafe {}, if you really need to
[04:30:20] <dunpeal> this is pretty cool, maybe I should apply for work with Mozilla ;)
[04:30:27] <bjz> heh :)
[04:30:28] <cmr> they are hiring a rust dev
[04:30:33] <cmr> https://careers.mozilla.org/en-US/position/oKiEXfwn
[04:31:19] <bjz> dunpeal: what is your background?
[04:31:31] <dunpeal> yeah, one of their recruiters reached out to me a couple of times, but I didn't want to work in a "browser" company
[04:31:39] <bjz> dunpeal: why did you come to #rust?
[04:31:40] <dunpeal> now they have Rust and asm.js and a bunch of other cool stuff
[04:31:56] <dunpeal> bjz: mostly C, especially in conjuction with Python
[04:32:27] <dunpeal> bjz: I'm starting a fairly large project for my employer, and need to pick a language.
[04:32:47] <dunpeal> I really liked Rust, but it seems like I'll have to go with C++ for the reasons you mentioned above.
[04:33:00] <cmr> yup, it'd be insane to use rust in that position
[04:33:54] <dunpeal> I need tight control over memory and CPU, so it has to be either C or C++, and it's a bit too large for my taste for C. I hate C++, but it seems like the only reasonable choice.
[04:34:37] <dunpeal> I don't see any other choices. I looked at Go, it doesn't seem to provide much beyond what C already does, and you give up too much for using it.
[04:35:06] <bjz> dunpeal: C++11 seems decent
[04:35:19] <dunpeal> Rust would have been perfect if it was already stable, alas :(
[04:35:24] <bjz> yeah
[04:35:26] <bjz> :(
[04:35:29] <bjz> tis a shame
[04:35:34] <cmr> C++11 make C++ tolerable I think, it's not bad at all.
[04:36:08] <dunpeal> all of my C++ experience is pre-C++11... what improved significantly?
[04:36:14] <jeaye> Many things.
[04:36:45] <jeaye> lambdas, uniform initialization, thread support (and new memory model) to name a few
[04:36:54] <dunpeal> I saw there's a lambda now, and some neat move semantics, but it didn't seem revolutionary
[04:37:15] <cmr> it's not revolutionary, and I still think rust is better, but it's a huge improvement over c++98
[04:37:21] <bjz> yup
[04:37:27] <jeaye> revolutionary? No. A breath of fresh air for the devs working every day in C++? Yes.
[04:37:50] <jeaye> Unfortunately the company I'm at still hasn't been able to switch to C++11. :(
[04:37:53] <bjz> dunpeal: the idea is you should never be working with bare ptrs
[04:37:55] <dunpeal> ok, I'll take another look. what I saw didn't seem that much of an improvement, but I didn't really dive into the new feature.
[04:37:57] <jeaye> C++14 might be out before we do.
[04:38:31] <dunpeal> bjz: yeah, that's something else I heard... good support for smart pointers.
[04:38:41] <SiegeLord> Can't fix a language by bolting on more features, so Rust will be better even than C++50 imo
[04:39:04] <cmr> yeah, backwards compat really hinders them
[04:39:15] <cmr> especially the original mostly-backwards compat with C
[04:39:21] <jeaye> I think C++ deserves a lot of credit, SiegeLord; it's done wonders.
[04:39:54] <bjz> yup, considering what they had to deal with
[04:39:58] <jeaye> But I've been known the evangalize.
[04:40:05] <SiegeLord> Meh, I still have to help people with C++ code
[04:40:24] <jeaye> Me too.
[04:40:33] <jeaye> It's my job to ensure people write it properly.
[04:40:34] <SiegeLord> And they never use Modern C++
[04:40:44] <bjz> jeaye: really? :(
[04:40:55] <bjz> jeaye: how does that go?
[04:41:05] <bjz> jeaye: like herding cats?
[04:41:33] <dunpeal> wow, you guys really love C++11... is there a good book just about the new features, for someone who already knows C++98?
[04:41:37] <jeaye> bjz: Well, I'm an engine developer for a game studio. One of my primary tasks is overseeing every change to the engine (it's a permission-based system, so they have to go through me).
[04:41:45] <jeaye> dunpeal: The C++ Programming Language
[04:41:54] <jeaye> A new one was just published by Stroustrup
[04:42:00] <jeaye> Look for C++11 on the cover
[04:42:22] <bjz> dunpeal: I don't love it, but I do think it's a decent improvement
[04:43:10] <jeaye> bjz: This means I see a lot of shitty code that I need to comment on and force them to fix. It's hard for game developers (being pushed by nervous product managers) to think about the "big picture" when it comes to infrastructure and design.
[04:43:44] <jeaye> C++ doesn't help with this either.
[04:43:47] *** Joins: maxter (~maxter@sundownness.lullaby.volia.net)
[04:43:57] <dunpeal> how so?
[04:44:13] <bjz> dunpeal: if you're starting from scratch, and you can't use Rust, it would be better to start the codebase with C++11 principles, with a view to embrace C++14 in the future (which should be a minor update to the STL)
[04:44:47] <dunpeal> jeaye: I've never developed in C++ with a large team, what particular aspects / features give you trouble?
[04:44:51] <bjz> jeaye: so many ways to do things, so many styles?
[04:45:41] <dunpeal> bjz: yeah, but I should first learn about the new features :)  was about to start the codebase pretty much like I started C++ 98 projects long.
[04:45:45] <dunpeal> *ago
[04:46:05] <bjz> dunpeal: if you ask Stroustrup himself, there are loads of books/documentation out there that use old styles
[04:46:22] <bjz> dunpeal: which is why you should probably get his book
[04:46:43] <jeaye> bjz: Kind of
[04:46:50] <dunpeal> oh yeah, tons of C++ code out there doesn't even make full use of the 98 standard.
[04:47:09] <jeaye> dunpeal: Encapsulation, composition vs. inheritance mostly
[04:47:19] <jeaye> But we have a lot of old ObjC devs
[04:47:29] <jeaye> So they use backward idioms when it comes to C++
[04:47:33] <bjz> dunpeal: be warned that whilst clang and gcc are up to date with the C++11 features, VS is still a little behind the ball - not sure by how much to date though
[04:47:45] <bjz> mm
[04:47:55] <cmr> latest msvc is catching up quite well
[04:47:58] <dunpeal> bjz: latest VC is actually not bad
[04:48:05] <bjz> yeah?
[04:48:10] <bjz> oh good
[04:48:14] <cmr> I think the next major release is almost all c++11
[04:48:22] <jeaye> Lots of raw pointers, manual "reference counting", unneeded singletons, unneeded preprocessor work, etc
[04:48:22] <dunpeal> Herb Sutter is still on the comitte :)
[04:48:24] <cmr> I watched the //build talk about it, by sutter
[04:48:27] <bjz> awesome (not that I use it)
[04:48:47] <dunpeal> bjz: neither do I, it's a backend project, only needs to run on Linux
[04:49:01] <bjz> cmr: there had been grumblings about for all Sutter's tlak they were behind the ball
[04:49:22] <bjz> cmr: but it's good to hear they're finally catching up
[04:49:36] <bjz> dunpeal: awesome - clang ftw
[04:49:36] <dunpeal> he addressed that in one of his talks
[04:49:43] <dunpeal> "C++ and beyond" IIRC
[04:49:59] <dunpeal> the bare truth is that MS isn't putting that many resources into the VC team
[04:50:15] <dunpeal> IIRC there were only 5 full-time engineers working doing core VC work
[04:50:28] <bjz> aye. big ask for C++ support
[04:50:45] <bjz> (such a monstrosity)
[04:51:08] <dunpeal> he doesn't outright say that, but then he talks about how e.g. Variadic Templates were held back because one guy was assigned and was too busy
[04:51:13] <dunpeal> you get the picture...
[04:51:15] <bjz> when you compare that to all the corporate backing for llvm and the open source community
[04:51:41] <bjz> (llvm/clang)
[04:51:52] <dunpeal> sure... who the hell knows what's MS strategy is, I don't think they know themselves
[04:51:58] <bjz> heh
[04:52:14] <dunpeal> from a very narrow perspective, they'd probably like it if every single C++ developer switched to C#
[04:53:04] <cmr> I've always found their push for C# amusing, because IME, the VS tooling for VB.NET is much better.
