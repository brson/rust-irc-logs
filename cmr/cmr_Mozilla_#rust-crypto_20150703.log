[00:09:14] <Ilari> Hmm... Quad(!) optical fibers to aparment (I think connected to somewhere in basement, for future expansion). Wonder how much data could be put through those (one thing is for sure, WAY more than what devices I have can use)...

[00:17:20] <Ilari> Loose cables can cause all sorts of weird things like: speeding neutrinos, almost causing expensive machines to blow up, etc... :-)
[00:29:02] <eternaleye> Ilari: Depends on what kind of fiber it is
[00:30:32] <eternaleye> Ilari: If we presume simple ethernet over fiber, then 100gbit
[00:30:37] <eternaleye> (per cable)
[00:31:06] <Ilari> eternaleye: Probably cheap multimode plastic stuff.
[00:31:09] <eternaleye> Ilari: However, there are a number of ways to multiplex more over the same fibre
[00:32:22] <eternaleye> Ilari: By using wavelength-division multiplexing, as of 2006 researchers had managed 14Tb/s over a single 160km line
[00:32:33] <Ilari> That it is plastic probably means just more losses, but it is such short run that it won't matter. That it is likely multimode might matter much more (pulse lengthening from path difference).
[00:32:43] <eternaleye> Mm
[00:33:14] <eternaleye> Ilari: Anyway: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber-optic_communication#Record_speeds

[00:34:09] <Elaine> damn that's fast.
[00:34:21] <Ilari> Of course, one could still likely pass lots of channels through, even if each individual channel isn't that fast.

[18:40:09] <Lurkin> Heyo, it's safe to compress data with a lossless alg, then encrypt it correct?
[18:40:37] <Tiffany> well, I would think so, although apparently TLS compression is unsafe
[18:41:19] <Tiffany> leaking details about the plaintext is kind of a definition of a broken cipher, and compression is still plaintext
[18:41:50] <Tiffany> besides length, I suppose
[18:41:54] <Tiffany> and compression does mess with length
[18:42:02] <Ilari> Lurkin: One needs to be careful about leaking information about data via how much it compresses (especially if part of the data is possibly provoded by attacker).
[18:42:50] <Tiffany> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BREACH_%28security_exploit%29 I'm not sure how this works
[18:43:03] *** bpugh is now known as springbot
[18:43:26] <Lurkin> So in otherwords if an attacker knows how the compression in question works its possible the attacker has already figured out what the encrypted compression bits look like/act like.
[18:43:55] <Lurkin> So in practice that means I should do a brief compression in stead of going for size records.
[18:44:59] <Ilari> Lurkin: Especially if attacker can send data through channel after secret data, the attacker can infer the secret data from compression ratio of the attacker-supplied data.
[18:46:46] <Lurkin> Can you maybe link to a paper or article regarding that vector?  I understand what you're saying kind of.
[18:47:15] <Lurkin> OH
[18:47:20] <Lurkin> Nevermind I get it now.
[18:48:26] <Lurkin> So in reality long term storage encryption should not be compressed at all lest data analysis eats it alive in the future.
[18:49:19] <Lurkin> Is there safer compression methods?  I was planning on using lz4.
[18:51:26] <Ilari> Depends on data. And lz4 isn't safe from compression-based probing.
[18:52:33] <Lurkin> lz4 is just for the netlayer after it gets to the destination it gets unpacked and encrypted with something more substantial.
[18:54:20] <Lurkin> IF indeed lz4 archives are detectable with AES-XTS encryption.
[19:01:05] <Ilari> Lurkin: It is about size, not what compressor outputs, since any encryption algorithm that can't mask patterns in data is total garbage.
[19:11:25] <Lurkin> I get what you're saying exactly.
[19:13:41] <Lurkin> It's not too complicated to make sure somebody hasn't added data.
[19:14:54] <Lurkin> But you're saying if you can ensure data integrity putting lz4 archives in an AES container is a'ok.
[19:19:43] <o11c> huh, I never thought about that
[19:20:05] <o11c> it is safe though if you compress blocks independently and can *somehow* ensure that the attacker's data is in a separate block
[19:20:41] <o11c> that's probably hard to actually guarantee
[19:22:14] <Lurkin> What if you get the hash of each block and checksum them once at the destination?
[19:23:57] <Elaine> you can "just" use a MAC if you only care about authenticity.
[19:24:14] <Elaine> ("this is what was sent, and X sent it")
[19:24:59] <Elaine> what are you trying to accomplish?
[19:26:10] <Elaine> (you'd be vulnerable to replay though, you'd want to use a counter or something, assuming your messages are delivered in-order, it's not that straightforward)
[19:29:13] <Lurkin> My goal is secure file syncronization across trusted networks.
[19:31:08] <Elaine> that's an oxymoron :P
[19:31:57] <Lurkin> Well I do trust encrypted networks with proper authentication handling.
[19:32:15] <Elaine> ok, then at that point why do you need to do anything else?
[19:32:27] <Tiffany> lurkin: have you seen tahoe-LAFS?
[19:33:09] <Lurkin> Because when either machine or network get's 0day'd I want to be sure plan b is there.
[19:35:12] <Lurkin> If I notice both my certs and my machines are compromised I know for a fact it's a total loss.
[19:39:15] <Lurkin> The vector I'm most worried about is my provider being compromised and my VM being replayed.
[19:39:58] <Lurkin> On top of the fact that my host only uses SSD's which makes for even more intricate issues.
[19:52:56] <Tiffany> tahoe-LAFS is specifically designed for untrustworthy storage servers

[20:34:44] <Ilari> Less than 6 months time to get SHA-1 certs from "public" CAs. :-)
[20:35:26] <Tiffany> they won't issue certs with less than a year expirey time?
[20:35:44] <Tiffany> are there any CAs still giving out SHA-1 certs by default or exclusively?
[20:36:53] <Ilari> Tiffany: You are familiar with RFC2119 terms like MUST NOT and SHOULD NOT?
[20:37:21] <Tiffany> I'm familiar with the use of them, but I haven't ever actually read their precise definitions
[20:37:26] <Tiffany> I have that RFC in my reading queue right now
[20:37:59] <Ilari> Tiffany: Basically, the baseline requirements say that SHA-1 certs MUST NOT be issued after 2015 and SHOULD NOT be valid past 2016.
[20:38:34] <Tiffany> oh, I was confused for a moment there
[20:38:38] <Ilari> Tiffany: SHA-1 certs valid past 2016 cause problems in chrome right now. Firefox just caps the validity.
[20:38:44] <Tiffany> past as in greater than, not greater than equals
[20:39:31] <Ilari> Tiffany: But then, Chrome can receive all SHA-256 chain from server and then complain that there are SHA-1 certs in it.
[20:40:27] <Ilari> Tiffany: The offending certificate being from Chrome replacing SHA-256 certificate with its own cached SHA-1 one.
[20:41:04] <Tiffany> gross
[20:41:39] <Ilari> Also, one really has to be careful with HSTS (and it is the only current scheme able to deal with misissuance) due to that certificate replacement. I think Firefox is pretty much the only browser that actually evaluates the chains as sent against HSTS.
[20:42:05] <Ilari> Certificate Transparency as presently deployed is a joke.
[20:43:48] <Tiffany> I have HSTS on my site and it works fine in firefox and chrome
[20:44:16] <Ilari> Tiffany: What did you pin? EE cert?
[20:44:28] <Tiffany> huh?
[20:44:47] <Ilari> Tiffany: What certificate in chain did you pin?
[20:44:56] <Tiffany> I didn't pin a certificate chain
[20:45:04] <Tiffany> I guess there's more to HSTS than I thought
[20:45:41] <Ilari> Tiffany: Yeah, each pin is for one certficate, and there can be multiple certificates in sent chain.
[20:47:13] <Ilari> Tiffany: EE cert is the site-specific (not CA) certificate in the chain.
[20:50:21] <Tiffany> I just set Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=63072000; includeSubdomains; preload
[20:50:42] <Ilari> OOps, HPKP, not HSTS.
[20:51:28] <Ilari> I think there were earlier proposals to include HPKP functionality in HSTS, but that wasn't ready, so HPKP became its own thing.
[20:58:14] <Ilari> Basically, without HPKP, site has basically no defense against misissuance (and with modern browser capabilies, consequences can be catastrophic).
[21:02:11] <Ilari> For CT to be taken seriously, there would have to be HSTS directive to require CT for domain.
[21:10:52] <Ilari> CT wouldn't prevent misissuance, but at least one could use it as a material to LART the offending CA.
