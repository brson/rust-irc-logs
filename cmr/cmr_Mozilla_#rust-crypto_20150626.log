[00:05:05] <Ilari> In SSL labs test, having SSLv2 enabled is one of the few things that is instant fail (some others are having EXPORT or DES stuff enabled or being vulernable to POODLE TLS or EarlyCCS).
[00:05:38] <Tiffany> those things that instant fail happen pretty frequency
[00:05:41] <Tiffany> frequently
[00:05:47] <Tiffany> there would be no sites with an F if it wasn't for instant-fails
[00:05:51] <Tiffany> there's no sites with a D
[00:10:35] <Ilari> I don't think D is currently used (that is, I don't think it is possible to get D).
[00:12:21] <Ilari> AFAIK, other than A+ (the base grade is A), the grades are via capping, so to get D, one would have to trip some set-grade-to-D thing, and I don't think there are any.

[00:15:43] <Tiffany> no
[00:15:51] <Tiffany> it is actually more complicated than that
[00:16:18] <Ilari> Then some TLS badness is general menace, as it screws with security of other sites too. E.g. RC4-only servers, servers with version intolerances, servers with extension intolerances or servers that don't support RENEGO extension.
[00:17:09] <Tiffany> it sort of averages the scores of the best and worst in a category
[00:17:36] <Tiffany> so if you have all-256-bit AES, then your score in ciphers will be 100, and that will factor into your overall grade
[00:17:43] <Tiffany> but any 128 bit ciphers will give you a 90 or 95
[00:18:13] <Ilari> AFAIK, scores don't affect grade (the grading is separate).
[00:18:22] <Tiffany> hm
[00:18:27] <Tiffany> possibly
[00:18:34] *** Quits: dpc (dpc@moz-52v2l7.nvidia.com) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[00:18:57] <Tiffany> but sites can definitely get A, B, C without actually being hard capped to them, I'm pretty sure
[00:19:27] <Tiffany> oh
[00:19:31] <Tiffany> I'm looking through results
[00:19:32] <Tiffany> yeah..
[00:19:41] <Tiffany> this oen I just checked on
[00:19:51] <Tiffany> the lowest it has in any category is 80, and it has a C, because it uses RC4
[00:20:28] <Tiffany> weird
[00:20:52] <Tiffany> https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=first-key.com wow
[00:20:55] <Ilari> Also, beware that the documentation looks to be out of date.
[00:21:01] <Tiffany> it actually got a 0 on the key exchange
[00:21:06] <Tiffany> the preferred option is RSA EXPORT
[00:21:07] <Tiffany> man
[00:21:27] <Tiffany> TLS_RSA_EXPORT_WITH_RC4_40_MD5 
[00:21:34] <Tiffany> this is the worst one I've seen so far, I think
[00:21:55] <Tiffany> it has the ciphers listed in ascending order of security
[00:22:59] <Ilari> Apparently the minimum protocol score one can get A with is 95% (since to get lower than that, you would either have to support SSL 3.0 or not support TLS 1.2, and both cap to C). 
[00:23:44] <Tiffany> huh
[00:23:49] <Tiffany> I didn't know there was a T rating
[00:24:16] <Tiffany> https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=sae.gti.mcafee.com&s=8.21.161.23&ignoreMismatch=on
[00:25:53] <Ilari> T is variant of F, which is given to servers with broken cert, but not other flaws big enough for fail.
[00:26:07] <Tiffany> so a self signed server will get a T?
[00:27:45] <Ilari> Yes, unless it has those insta-fail flaws.
[00:28:01] <Ilari> Also, that server supports DES?
[00:28:27] <Tiffany> and it's on the top of the list too
[00:28:51] <Tiffany> how much time does it take to break DES keys?
[00:28:54] <Ilari> And it has 1024-bit RSA key and doesn't support FS... Not good.
[00:31:09] <Ilari> In the past, there have been sites with D (IIRC, last seen early January 2014).
[00:32:19] <Elaine> Tiffany: deep crack did it in the late nineties in like 3 days iirc
[00:32:34] <Tiffany> I was thinking on a typical computer today
[00:33:35] <Tiffany> 2^43 known plaintexts and 2^39-2^43 time, apparently
[00:34:16] <Tiffany> oh wow
[00:34:33] <Tiffany> and deep crack wasn't even using a cryptanalysis, it was doing straight 2^56 time bruteforce
[00:34:48] <Elaine> right
[00:34:51] <eternaleye> ...hm. I'm probably insane, but I find myself wanting to use Nom to implement a BER parser.
[00:35:08] <Elaine> it was custom hw, but I remember seeing an FPGA impl too
[00:35:11] <Ilari> Isn't 2^43 known plaintexts something like 8*10^12 KPs?
[00:56:32] <eternaleye> I think I may have to name this library "nomber1"
[00:56:47] <eternaleye> And then spend the rest of my life going "No, that's not a typo"

[15:01:13] <Tiffany> are there any ciphers designed to be fast in languages like javascript?
[15:01:22] <Tiffany> like, operating on floating point outright, or at least using mostly addition
[15:06:48] <Tiffany> they sometimes have bitwise ops, but they almost always require a cast from float to int first
[15:10:37] <eternaleye> Tiffany: I rather doubt it
[15:11:04] <eternaleye> Tiffany: Mostly due to the variation between floating point implementations in real hardware making it unreliable at lower levels
[15:11:24] <eternaleye> Tiffany: And with typed arrays, you can use sized integers in JS.
[15:11:57] <eternaleye> Tiffany: So it'd basically be _restricted_ to JS and such (where FP semantics are stable), and also has limited benefit
[15:12:14] <Tiffany> it doesn't have to be floating point
[15:12:25] <Tiffany> integers mod 2^32 would probably be okay
[15:12:34] <Tiffany> I think mod 2^32 is cheaper than converting to int and back
[15:13:10] <Tiffany> hmm
[15:13:13] <eternaleye> Converting a Blob to a typed array of its contents is cheap.
[15:13:24] <Tiffany> shift left is equivalent to multiplication by a power of two
[15:13:29] <Tiffany> the main trouble is xor
[15:13:31] <eternaleye> And if the crypto just plain operates on typed arrays straight, done.
[15:13:34] <Tiffany> which, well
[15:13:37] <Tiffany> addition has xor in it
[15:13:42] <eternaleye> It just spits out a Blob on the other end.
[15:13:47] <Tiffany> is there any reason why you couldn't replace all the xors with addition?
[15:14:08] <Tiffany> I'm particularly thinking of lua, which does not have typed arrays
[15:14:19] <Tiffany> it technically got integers in 5.3, but nobody uses 5.3
[15:14:37] <Tiffany> it didn't even get bitwise ops in the stdlib until 5.2
[15:14:39] <eternaleye> Tiffany: Lua also has LuaCrypto
[15:15:02] <Tiffany> that's not pure lua
[15:15:19] <Tiffany> I don't actually need this for anything, I'm just wondering
[15:15:41] <eternaleye> Sure, but the list of domains where you're strictly limited to pure lua *and* crypto is a sensible thing to do may be the empty set
[15:16:02] <Tiffany> well, say you're not being sensible
[15:16:36] <Tiffany> is there any problem with making a cipher using nothing but shift left and addition?
[15:17:22] <Tiffany> a few other ops could be thrown into the mix too
[15:17:40] <Tiffany> like multiplication of a 32-bit integer and a 20-bit integer
[15:19:08] <Ilari> I actually have a piece of software with builtin Lua interpretter. The standard Win32 build does have 5.3. :-)
[15:22:19] <Tiffany> my net went down for a moment, so I might have missed stuff
[15:26:13] <Ilari> Tiffany: I don't see you being disconnected.
[15:26:21] <Tiffany> it's because I use znc
[15:26:45] <Tiffany> znc doesn't start collecting scrollback until after I disconnect
[15:27:04] <Tiffany> but if I just drop into the abyss, then it waits 180 seconds before considering me disconnected, and anything that happens in those 180 seconds is just lost forever
[15:27:05] <Tiffany> it's really stupid
[15:28:09] <eternaleye> Tiffany: Huh, I turn that off, and have it truncate scrollback whenever I send a message
[15:28:28] <eternaleye> Tiffany: And then occasionally do 'znc clearallchannelbuffers' for the whole server
[15:28:31] <Tiffany> that seems a bit awkward too
[15:28:42] <Tiffany> I wish it would just stop being stupid and send any messages that never got ACKed
[15:28:46] <Tiffany> but I guess there's no way to tell with tcp
[15:28:49] <eternaleye> IMO, the whole point of ZNC is to never miss anything
[15:29:04] <eternaleye> So it over-replaying is the better option
[15:29:06] <Tiffany> it could at least always send the last 180 seconds of scrollback
[15:29:27] <eternaleye> And even if it's acked by TCP, that doesn't mean it was shown to the user
[15:29:45] <eternaleye> The client computer could have kernel panicked, not just d/c'd
[15:29:54] <Tiffany> sure
[15:30:08] <Tiffany> this is why I want to build my own chat thing with a gateway to irc
[15:30:12] <Tiffany> so I can just fix all this stupidness
[15:30:12] <eternaleye> You'd need something tracking how far the user has read/scrolled, like I think quassel does
[15:30:22] <eternaleye> Tiffany: http://matrix.org
[15:30:43] <eternaleye> Tiffany: Permalog, state-sync based transport, IRC bridging.
[15:31:28] <eternaleye> Tiffany: At some point I want to make a hybrid Matrix/IRC server, rather than bridging via the AS protocol
[15:31:32] <Tiffany> do these homeservers have to stay up perpetually?
[15:31:43] <eternaleye> Tiffany: Think of it like ZNC.
[15:32:15] <eternaleye> Tiffany: If it goes down and then comes back, you don't have logs for that portion, but it doesn't break the world
[15:32:36] <eternaleye> Tiffany: However, for Matrix-native stuff, it can do better than that
[15:32:58] <eternaleye> Tiffany: Because of the multi-server DAG stuff and permalog allowing the homeserver itself to backlog from other servers
[15:35:43] <Tiffany> how well does the irc gateway work?
[15:36:12] <eternaleye> Tiffany: Quite well; freenode#matrix and freenode#matrix-dev are both bridged using it
[15:36:45] <Tiffany> how does it work?
[15:37:11] <eternaleye> How does what work?
[15:37:21] <eternaleye> The protocol?
[15:37:21] <eternaleye> The bridge?
[15:37:22] <eternaleye> The client?
[15:37:26] <Tiffany> the bridge
[15:37:48] <eternaleye> It speaks the AS protocol to a homeserver
[15:37:56] <Tiffany> AS protocol?
[15:37:59] <eternaleye> The AS protocol is documented on the site
[15:38:31] <eternaleye> Application Service
[15:38:32] <eternaleye> As opposed to the client/server protocol or the federation protocol
[15:38:38] <eternaleye> All of the above are JSON/REST based
[15:39:26] <eternaleye> There are also multiple people running their own homeservers already
[15:40:49] <eternaleye> The devs are mainly focused on two things right now, IIRC

[17:19:57] <bascule> I have a pretty crazy idea of how it should work though
[17:20:09] <eternaleye> Tiffany: Not hard as far as I know; I just have a massive project backlog
[17:20:10] <bascule> which is substantially different from any of the multiparty protocols people have proposed
[17:20:35] <Tiffany> I haven't really put any thought into anything higher level than implementing PMs
[17:21:02] <bascule> people create all these protocols that do multiparty diffie-hellman and rekey any time someone joins or leaves the channel
[17:21:08] <bascule> and I think that's all kind of silly
[17:21:14] <Tiffany> that does sound silly

[17:22:14] <eternaleye> bascule: Well, matrix doesn't quite do that
[17:22:17] <bascule> if you're designing an encrypted chat client, I think you really need to start with the feature set you want to provide and work backwards

[17:22:40] <bascule> instead of "we'll go build a bunch of encryption crap and hope some UX designer can glue a nice frontend on top of it"

[17:40:30] <Tobba> yes, yes it is

[17:42:23] <Ilari> Well, there isn't an widespread assembler that can deal with calling conventions and whatnot.

[18:39:45] <Ilari> "A server might have DHE enabled if it has an ECDSA certificate if it also has an RSA certificate." ... It is also possible to use ECDSA with DHE key exchange in TLS 1.2+ (obscure TLS 1.2 feature).
[18:40:39] <Ilari> Wonder how many clients would have trouble with TLS server that actually used DHE with ECDSA...
[18:43:53] <bascule> lolololol wtf
[18:46:47] <eternaleye> I smell a conference paper!
[18:47:56] <bascule> why would you ever ^^^
[18:48:21] <Ilari> The way one uses ECDSA with DHE in TLS 1.2 is to signal TLS_DHE_RSA_* ciphersuite, and then set ServerKeyExchange SignatureAlgorithm to 3 (ECDSA). This is allowed if client did not send signature_algorithms, or if it sent signature_algorithms, with SignatureAlgorithm 3 entry in it.
[18:49:20] <eternaleye> I think I'm going to be sick.
[18:50:16] <Ilari> *If client did not send signature_algorithms but sent any TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_* ciphersuite.
[18:51:23] <Ilari> Firefox 38 sends DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA and does send ECDSA/SHA-256 in signature_algorithms, so...
[18:56:15] <bascule> can DHE die already
[18:56:18] <bascule> diediedie already
[18:57:15] <Ilari> Reminds me of another area, where one guy first makes draft (now RFC) about handling receiving a thingy. And now is working on draft deprecating sending that thingy...
