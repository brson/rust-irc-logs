[21:08:07] <ski> cmr : someone also suggested "Basic Polymorphic Typechecking" by Luca Cardelli in 1987-04 - 1988-06-21 at <http://lucacardelli.name/Papers/BasicTypechecking.pdf> -- i haven't checked it yet, but Luca Cardelli is often good (i.e. often writes quite readable)

[21:09:32] <ski> Luca Cardelli also has some interesting papers about typing and computation aspects of object-orientation, attempting to distill out some essence out of (at least some important parts of) the vague concept of OO
[21:11:45] <bjz> cmr: lars bergstrom pointed me to Basic Polymorphic Typechecking
[21:11:54] <ski> e.g. according to this view of OO (perhaps ignoring some parts that also have importantly figured in practice in languages deemed to support OO), OO is *dual* to functional programming with pattern-matching on algebraic-data / variant / disjoint/discriminated -union / sum types, / variant record types (all those are basically the same thing)
[21:12:19] <bjz> cmr: when I asked him for advice about HM inference
[21:12:36] <ski> and this duality suggests that both approaches have merits, but fit into different needs

[21:12:55] <bjz> larsberg: cmr asks, "do you have any particularly good resources in the lines of TaPL"
[21:13:20] <ski> very simplified : consider making a type (or interface, if you prefer) of "shapes"
[21:13:31] <larsberg> cmr: depends on what you want to do TaPL is how a lot of us learned pen-and-paper proofs of type systems (safety/soundness properties)
[21:13:38] <ski> shapes come in various variants, like circles, rectangles, triangles
[21:13:52] <ski> also, shapes have various properties, like area and perimeter
[21:14:12] <ski> we could add a position, if we want positioned shapes, or a color, for colored shapes, etc
[21:14:16] <larsberg> cmr: ATaPL has more advanced stuff. The pierce Coq intro is probably the best way to learn how to do machine-assisted proofs. But are you looking for particular resources?
[21:14:30] <bjz> larsberg: btw, Basic Polymorphic Typechecking has been good so far
[21:14:45] <ski> for positioned (and oriented, with a specific rotation) shapes, we also have "properties" like whether a given point is inside the shape or not
[21:15:05] <larsberg> bjz: I'm glad it worked for you! TAPL can be a little... impenetrable, implementation-wise, without the framework of a class accompanying it.
[21:15:12] <bjz> larsberg: yeah
[21:15:24] <ski> cmr : now, we can imagine a rectangular schema, with the basic variants of a shape listed along the top row, and the basic properties of a shape listed along the left column
[21:15:58] <ski> and then each cell of the schema corresponds to a particular property being applied to a particular shape variant

[21:17:32] <ski> and variants of a shape becomes concrete subclasses of an abstract base class (or, more accurately, concrete classes, implementing a common interface, a la Java and C#)
[21:18:13] <ski> now, adding a new shape is easy, we just add another subclass / class-implementing-the-interface. and implement all the methods for it
[21:18:41] <ski> but adding a new property/method is harder, since we have to modify all the existing classes, and that might interact with other stuff in some cases
[21:19:00] <ski> (remember that this is a simplified picture, in practice stuff is harder than in this picture)
[21:19:26] <ski> otoh, FP typically does the opposite choice : group the table by grouping on *rows*
[21:20:03] <larsberg> bjz: bob harper's new book goes into more depth on that stuff as well (http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/plbook/book.pdf ), IIRC, though I've only reviewed the book and chatted with bob about it but haven't tried to teach from it :-)
[21:20:21] <ski> so the variant shapes now become data constructors of the variant / sum / discriminated-union type "shape"
[21:20:36] <ski> (so they contain no behavior at all, of their own)
[21:20:37] <bjz> larsberg: gotta dash now, but I'll have a look
[21:20:39] <bjz> thanks!
[21:21:00] <ski> and the properties now becomes *functions* that *pattern-match* on the data constructors to decide what to do
[21:21:17] <ski> so, each row in the table corresponds to a (basic) function that matches on the data
[21:21:43] <ski> now, adding a new property/function is easy, we just define it, handling each existing variant case of the shape type
[21:22:07] <ski> but adding a new variant shape is harder, since now we must *modify* all existing properties/functions that match on the data

[21:22:32] <ski> (there can also be *derived* functions that don't themselves math, but may call functions which do. these functions wouldn't have to be changed)
[21:24:10] <ski> (similarly in the OO case, one can have functions which aren't themselves object constructors, but calls object constructors which do "message-dispatching" on the "messages send to it" (in SmallTalk terminology), meaning that the object constructor is coupled with definitions for the methods)
[21:25:04] <ski> the point is that depending on whether you expect it be more likely that you have to modify the number or details of the properties, or the numer or details of the variants, it will make sense either to use the OO approach or the FP approach
