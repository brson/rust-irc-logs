[00:04:16] <aturon> wycats: acrichto: what are you up to at the moment?
[00:04:23] <wycats> nothing specific
[00:04:27] <wycats> shooting the shit about FFI
[00:04:29] <acrichto> aturon: we have concluded cargo discussions
[00:04:29] <steveklabnik> chilllin
[00:05:20] <aturon> acrichto: \o/ is `cargo install` a thing?
[00:05:25] <acrichto> it is!
[00:05:29] <acrichto> I've got an RFC to write
[00:06:36] <wycats> :D
[00:06:41] <wycats> aturon: is that what you were hoping?
[00:06:58] <aturon> i think so? excited to hear what this tool is going to do :P
[00:07:09] <aturon> i'm eyeing the list of libs discussion topics
[00:07:26] <aturon> wycats: or did you have anything on your agenda you'd like to talk with me about?
[00:08:52] <wycats> I can tell you what it's going to do :P
[00:09:03] <wycats> would also be good to recap what I talked with acrichto about last night
[00:09:15] <wycats> we got like a second yesterday
[00:09:21] <wycats> but would probably be good to get some clarity
[00:09:27] <aturon> alright, i think i'm no longer relevant on this side of the room
[00:12:18] <pnkfelix> huon: ... we're having them install off USB sticks that we've already made
[00:12:45] <huon> pnkfelix: I guess stability means 1.0 is fine
[00:13:06] <pnkfelix> huon: will the playpen be upgraded to 1.1 immediately?
[00:13:13] * huon doesn't know
[00:13:15] <pnkfelix> that might be ... interesting.
[00:13:19] <pnkfelix> i guess we'll find out
[00:13:22] <huon> presumably we have control
[00:13:35] <huon> either way, theoretically there should be no problem since semver and all that :P
[00:16:34] <wycats> indeed
[00:16:37] <wycats> semver folks!

[07:16:07] <huon> there's the first inclings of aurora toward the north
[07:18:25] <huon> (I guess everyone is mostly asleep :( )
[07:25:51] <acrichto> huon: whoa, is it still going?
[07:29:28] <huon> http://i.imgur.com/4XOyrLi.jpg
[07:29:36] <huon> kinda, but the clouds are closing over :(
[07:31:03] <acrichto> aww :(
[07:31:16] <huon> apparently tomorrow is meant to be good?
[07:31:57] * acrichto eagerly awaits
[07:32:04] <huon> "Another storm forecast for Wednesday night/Thursday | NOAA / NWS Space Weather Prediction Center"
[07:32:09] <huon> "Huge solar storm poses threat to power grid and GPS"
[07:32:12] <acrichto> lol
[07:32:46] <huon> the southern aurora was apparently almost visible in Sydney, which is absolutely ridiculous
[07:32:51] <huon> so hopefully...
[07:33:07] <acrichto> whoa
[07:34:59] * huon checks cloud forecast
[07:36:59] <huon> wooo http://cleardarksky.com/c/WhstlrBCkey.html?1 is looking good
[07:37:06] * huon has no idea if that is at all reliable
[07:37:44] <acrichto> :D
[08:02:20] <jroesch> acrichto: huon +1
[08:02:23] <jroesch> this is good news
[08:02:44] <jroesch> I'm gonna peak my head out my balcony 
[15:17:39] <acrichto> are others at breakfast?
[15:17:49] <acrichto> huon/I are downstairs
[15:34:26] <nmatsakis> fyi pnkfelix and I are in the usual room because we are irresponsible employees
[15:55:19] <jroesch> nmatsakis: in the Hilton? I woke up later then expected and am headed out right now
[15:55:42] <nmatsakis> jroesch: oui monsieur 
[17:03:48] <aturon> acrichto: so it looks like we should wait to discuss rand until we have access to the source, back in SF :P
[17:03:55] <aturon> could discuss no_std if you want
[17:06:23] <acrichto> aturon: sure!

[19:15:00] * edunham attending platform's discussion of buildbot->taskcluster 
[19:15:21] <edunham> taskcluster has nominal windows support as of this morning
[19:15:32] <steveklabnik> neat :)
[19:23:52] <acrichto> edunham: \o/
[20:34:26] <aturon> edunham: whoa!
[21:22:48] <edunham> yeah, i just saw a demo!
[21:24:33] <edunham> also talked about how to manage community-contributed infrastructure, and got some more ideas of ways to mitigate the security concerns around community-built binaries
[21:30:38] <steveklabnik> huon: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-www/pull/153
[22:17:33] <acrichto> `/win 18
[22:17:35] <acrichto> gah
[23:23:28] <edunham> is there a reason we list bors as a contributor in http://blog.rust-lang.org/2015/06/25/Rust-1.1.html ?
[23:27:48] <aturon> edunham: tradition :)
[23:27:54] <aturon> bors works hard!
[23:31:17] <edunham> ok, that's true :)
