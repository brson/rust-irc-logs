[00:01:20] <Luqman> strcat: but the debuginfo fix seems simple enough. looks like you just need to update line 1827 in trans/debuginfo.rs
[00:01:26] <strcat> yeah
[00:01:39] <acrichto> strcat: when you don't have rpath you need all the libraries to be in LD_LIBRARY_PATH (which the makefile isn't setting)
[00:02:02] <strcat> acrichto: how does it work on windows where there is neither?
[00:02:20] <acrichto> windows just looks in the adjacent directory
[00:02:26] <acrichto> and we put all compiler deps next to the exe
[00:02:29] <sfackler> iirc Windows uses its version of PATH for both libraries and executables
[00:02:31] <acrichto> that's why libdir on windows is bin instead of lib

[00:12:49] <Eridius> cgaebel: why would you call such a thing?
[00:12:54] <Eridius> [anything}::new() is what I'd expect for that case

[00:13:09] <sfackler> if you know the size up front
[00:13:17] <Eridius> cgaebel: vec_ng::Vec::new() uses a capacity of 0 by default to avoid allocation
[00:13:58] <cgaebel> it's just a very odd thing to special case

[00:17:29] <Eridius> also I can't impl is_static() on SendStr without a trait, right now it's a direct method, but on MaybeOwned it would be is_slice() :/
[00:19:15] <dbaupp> cn't you do impl MaybeOwned<'static> { ... } ?
[00:19:24] <Eridius> dbaupp: `pub use SendStrOwned = Owned` ...
[00:19:35] <Eridius> oh hmm, for impl, can I do a second impl block like that?
[00:19:39] <dbaupp> and, anyway, why do we need to keep the api identical?
[00:19:40] <Eridius> I guess I can, it's only limited to traits, eh?
[00:19:50] <Eridius> dbaupp: to minimize the impact on the codebase :/
[00:19:51] <dbaupp> it seems reasonable to have Slice and Owned for "SendStr"
[00:19:57] <Eridius> I suppose
[00:20:01] <dbaupp> SendStr isn't sued much
[00:20:07] <dbaupp> (nor is it used much either.)
[00:21:01] <Eridius> damn I can't say `pub use SendStr = MaybeOwned<'static>`
[00:21:03] <Eridius> it doesn't allow the <
[00:21:55] <Eridius> maybe I should just delete send_str and rewrite clients of the API
[00:22:41] <Eridius> huh I'm kind of surprised it's in the prelude
[00:22:52] <Eridius> can't put Owned and Slice there
[00:22:52] <dbaupp> pub type SendStr = MaybeOwned<'static>
[00:23:08] <dbaupp> yeah, just remove it from the prelude
[00:23:10] <Eridius> dbaupp: that doesn't make SendStr an alias for it, though, does it? I thought that made it a distinct type

[00:26:31] <Eridius> oh `use str` fixed that
[00:27:02] <Eridius> huh I can't `impl SendStr`. It's telling me I need to be in the crate the type is defined in. Bug with `type` or something else?
[00:27:13] <dbaupp> yeah, no impls on types
[00:27:30] <Eridius> ok so just misleading error message
[00:27:42] <Eridius> whoa: /Users/kevin/Dev/rust/rust/src/libstd/send_str.rs:24:20: 24:39 error: found module name used as a type: impl send_str::__extensions__ (id=425252)

[00:27:54] <Eridius> that's nonsensical
[00:27:56] <dbaupp> in any case I do think we should just delete send_str and replace it with MaybeOwned, possibly with a SendStr alias to avoid typing MaybeOwned<'static>
[00:28:16] <Eridius> dbaupp: that's probably the right approach

[00:36:36] <Eridius> brson: where MaybeOwned is from https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/12098
[00:37:19] <kmc> it would be cool to have MaybeOwned<'static> with no enum tag, by distinguishing heap pointers from static data pointers
[00:37:24] <brson> With DST: `enum MaybeOwned<'a, T> { Ref(&'a T), Owned(~T) }`?

[00:37:57] <Eridius> brson: yeah that would be a good evolution
[00:38:04] <Eridius> it's called MaybeOwned because it's already in str ;)
[00:38:18] <dbaupp> kmc: heavily platform dependent?
[00:38:25] <kmc> probably
[00:38:40] <dbaupp> we could steal a bit of the length to indicate it
[00:39:11] <dbaupp> (on the assumption that no-one will have strings longer than 2^31 / 2^63 bytes.)
[00:40:07] <Eridius> eh, let's just use tagged pointers
[00:40:33] <dbaupp> Eridius: why tag the pointer (which makes it transparent to LLVM, iirc) when we can tag the length?
[00:40:48] <Eridius> dbaupp: theoretically the entire range of the length is a valid length
[00:41:01] <dbaupp> yeah; theoretically
[00:44:47] <Eridius> hrm, if I keep `pub type SendStr = MaybeOwned<'static>` should I also keep IntoSendStr?

[03:07:57] <strcat> sane clients back off on their retrying...
[03:08:02] <dbaupp> cgaebel: also, bill-myers point is a good one: you could theoretically store `capacity: uint, hashes: *u64, keys: *K, values: *V`
[03:08:14] <dbaupp> but then you're delving deep into the depths of unsafety
[03:08:17] <cmr> this is why using an irc client that *doesn't* show joins/parts for people who aren't talking is a Nice Thing...
[03:08:19] <strcat> should just blacklist clients that reconnect immediately over and over
[03:08:20] <cgaebel> dbaupp: Yeah I like that too. But I think that'd be easy to add in another patch.
[03:08:28] <strcat> cmr: I could enable that but I don't like it

[05:27:42] <dbaupp> Eridius: ping
[05:28:36] <Eridius> dbaupp: pong
[05:30:54] <dbaupp> Eridius: I have some adjustments to is_utf8 that make it 25+% faster, and have some ideas for doing something similar to from_utf8_lossy... but it'll probably trade-off performance for invalid bytes; do you reckon this is OK?
[05:31:11] <Eridius> depends on how big a trade-off it is. What were you thinking?
[05:31:45] <Eridius> e.g. making 100_invalid 25% slower.. probably acceptable for 25% better valid case. Making it 100% slower? Probably not so good
[05:32:14] <Eridius> what's your adjustments?
[05:32:28] <dbaupp> basically scan until the first invalid byte with absolutely minimal work, and then (if it exists) redecode it to work out the details of the invalidity
[05:32:40] <dbaupp> (and repeat)
[05:32:54] <Eridius> re-decode just that byte, or re-decode all the bytes up to it?
[05:32:59] <dbaupp> just that byte
[05:33:22] <Eridius> hrm.. that's probably not atrocious, but I'd want to see the benchmarks. But isn't that basically what is_utf8 is doing anyway?
[05:33:22] <dbaupp> I'll implement it to get some numbers
[05:33:34] <dbaupp> nah, it's not full speed :P
[05:33:46] <Eridius> what are you changing?
[05:33:56] <dbaupp> basically, it should be using * rather than uint, since it's doing unsafe indexing anyway
[05:34:23] <Eridius> I already tried using *u8 with from_utf8_lossy and saw no performance improvement. Have you actually experimented and seen a benefit?
[05:34:35] <dbaupp> for is_utf8, yes
[05:34:53] <Eridius> huh. I was surprised from_utf8_lossy didn't show any benefit
[05:34:54] <dbaupp> I had to redesign it slightly to get the biggest speed up
[05:35:02] <Eridius> though why would using * instead of uint require re-decoding the character to find out why it's bad?
[05:35:41] <dbaupp> to be able to have next_char(*u8) -> *u8 which returns null on invalid bytes
[05:36:10] <dbaupp> makes is_utf8's loop 'while ptr != end { ptr = next(ptr); if ptr.is_null() { return false } }'
[05:36:14] <dbaupp> which is super fast
[05:36:16] <Eridius> hmm well, if you want to submit a PR, please include benchmarks and cc me, I'll want to read it
[05:37:01] <Eridius> hrm, that code as written is dangerous because next() won't know if it runs out of bytes
[05:37:07] <Eridius> I assume it would have to be more like next(ptr, end)
[05:38:16] <dbaupp> yeah, it is

[06:17:23] <Eridius> dbaupp: I rebased on top of fmt. r? https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/12098
[06:17:59] <Eridius> dbaupp: ouch, that's effectively a 100% slowdown on invalid
[06:18:05] <Eridius> on 100_invalid
[06:18:09] <dbaupp> for a string that is 100% invalid characters
[06:18:31] <dbaupp> (it's essentially doing double the work in that case... :P )
[06:19:27] <Eridius> still, that's quite a penalty to pay
[06:20:01] <dbaupp> I guess I could tweak the invalid path to continue scanning for valid characters
[06:20:37] <dbaupp> but meh, if you've got input that is *that* invalid... you're kinda screwed anyway :P
[06:20:57] <Eridius> dbaupp: can we preserve first_non_utf8_index() as a faster implementation on top of next(), but leave the rest of from_utf8_lossy alone, to speed up valid strings but leave the existing performance for invalid?
[06:21:17] <Eridius> well sure, but someone's going to try to pass arbitrary binary data through this thing and it would be nice if it didn't perform 5x slower than expected
[06:21:26] <Eridius> well.. 4x. still.

[10:07:03] <doener> hrm... To get the most out of lifetimes for function arguments, I need to always create an alloca
[10:11:14] <dbaupp> doener: LLVM lifetimes, right?
[10:11:17] <doener> right
[10:12:31] <strcat> doener: does it actually help for function parameters?
[10:12:52] <strcat> if they never leave LLVM registers, why would a lifetime help?
[10:14:37] <doener> strcat: arg ~ argument expression, i.e. what trans_args creates
[10:14:57] <doener> strcat: we can get copies on the stack for byval arguments
[10:15:00] <strcat> ah that mess
[10:15:15] <strcat> doener: well, doing that is wrong ;p
[10:15:42] <strcat> LLVM has first-class aggregates and we should use them as we don't care about following the platform ABI
[10:15:50] <strcat> if they don't get lowered well everywhere, we can fix it in LLVM
[10:16:17] <doener> there's "byval" in LLVM, too. But there are other gains as well
[10:16:21] <doener> consider https://gist.github.com/dotdash/2b2a1ca09898d65e4c5f
[10:16:39] <doener> a and b have function scope lifetimes
[10:16:52] <strcat> doener: sure, I know why it's useful
[10:16:56] <strcat> doener: byval is legacy stuff
[10:17:07] <strcat> LLVM didn't used to have first-class aggregates
[10:17:17] <strcat> to follow the C platform ABI, you need to use stuff like sret/byval
[10:17:22] <strcat> but we don't want that for rust functions
[10:17:36] <strcat> we should just be using first-class aggregates and not doing our own parameter/return copying
[10:18:32] <doener> but if I copy them to allocas for the function call and declare the lifetimes for those copies, LLVM can actually drop a and b and work exclusively with the "extra" allocas for the arguments, which means that they can share the same stack slot
[10:19:08] <strcat> doener: it will already do that if they're by-value because they're in virtual registers
[10:19:29] <strcat> and if it's the last use in the caller, it won't have to copy anything
[10:19:49] <strcat> and it won't make the function have to be not readnone
[10:20:32] <strcat> if we mark the parameters mutable, then they do have to be flushed out to an alloca in general and a lifetime would be useful
[10:20:44] <doener> strcat: hm? The example I gave currently uses two distinct stack slots for a and b, because as far as llvm is concerned, their lifetimes overlap
[10:21:15] <strcat> doener: I'm saying we should pass parameters by-value
[10:22:08] <strcat> so it will change the story a bit
[10:22:17] <doener> everything by value?
[10:22:41] <strcat> yes, we shouldn't be doing our own copying
[10:22:52] <strcat> it's strictly worse than first class aggregates unless there's an LLVM bug
[10:23:08] <strcat> if you pass a struct by-value to a function, it should be compiled down to passing an aggregate by-value
[10:23:21] <strcat> that way the function doesn't become non-readnone, and LLVM can avoid a copy if it's the last-use
[10:23:57] <strcat> rust doesn't follow the platform ABI so there's no reason to be doing our own copying
[10:24:16] <strcat> sret/byval and manual parameter/return copying (and manual return pointers) shouldn't be used
[10:24:28] <doener> uhm, the example is passing a pointer in rust code, I've used that specifically to show that the extra alloca + lifetimes can improve things even if we don't hit the "do a manual byval" path
[10:24:36] <strcat> yes, I understand the example
[10:24:43] <strcat> I know why marking lifetimes is useful
[10:24:49] <strcat> I'm just talking about parameters
[10:27:12] <doener> ok, I guess I don't understand what you mean that. You started by saying "if they never leave LLVM registers, why would a lifetime help?" and now you say that you know that it's useful

[10:34:34] <strcat> doener: I meant for parameters, but I guess they'd end up flushed out to allocas regardless :(
[10:34:41] <strcat> it would at least reduce copying

Does anyone know of a nice way to make additional changes to those lines in a second commit? Like, a way to iterativly jump to each line that got changed, and give me a editor prompt to make further changes. Kinda like gits -p feature, except for already commited changes.

[15:44:39] <kimundi> eddyb: Its not done yet, I'm currently working on a second commit where I'm reintroducing fn iter(self) and turn useless stuff like "for &p in opt.as_ref()" into "for p in opt.iter()"
[15:45:21] <eddyb> so .iter() ensures you don't accidentally empty the original one?
[15:45:27] <kimundi> yes
[15:45:34] *** Quits: notmatt (notmatt@moz-9FB2565E.vc.shawcable.net) (Ping timeout)
[15:45:35] <kimundi> The problem is, "let mut opt = ...; for foo in opt {}" will mutate the opt, vs "let mut opt = ...; for foo in opt.iter() {}" which create a new temporary
[15:45:44] <eddyb> (since the iteration is just self.take())
[15:45:50] <kimundi> yup
[15:46:03] <eddyb> I don't mind that as much
[15:46:18] *** Joins: notmatt (notmatt@moz-9FB2565E.vc.shawcable.net)
[15:46:48] <kimundi> Personally, I don't see "for v in opt.iter() {  }" as a bad pattern, if the intention is explicitly "only do if Some"

[15:47:05] <kimundi> Which, guessing from the amount of code here, is a common pattern

[15:51:29] <kimundi> eddyb: Ah, and the second problem that occurred to me is, that with for hypothetical supporting both a hypothetical Iterable as well as Iterator in the future, for v in opt {  } might become more confusing, as it could pick either one

[20:32:52] <tjc> cmr: I banned notmatt -- I don't think there's a way on IRC to do a ban that automatically gets lifted after a certain amount of time, but if they ask, just let them know any op will unban them once they fix their client
[20:33:30] <eddyb> tjc: maybe ChanServ can do timed bans? though I know nothing about mozirc
[20:34:32] <tjc> eddyb: no idea... if anyone knows, I'll unban and then do a timed ban through that. don't have the patience to read the docs right now :-)

[20:40:45] <flaper87> isn't it something like /tban ?
[20:41:30] <flaper87> oh and I think there's also a -u option for ban

[20:51:10] <tjc> yeah, my IRC client doesn't seem to have either /ban or /tban, and chanserv also doesn't seem to have an equivalent
