[00:00:19] <eternaleye> bascule: For one, I eventually want to make an ORDBMS in Rust (like Postgres) where all the datatypes are defined in Cap'n Proto (and it can be extended likewise), but the _tables_ get columnarized into arrays of those datatypes.
[00:01:00] <tiffany> that sounds cool
[00:01:02] <eternaleye> bascule: And it'd not speak SQL - it'd have an API with the same expressive power based on Cap'n Proto RPC
[00:02:01] <eternaleye> bascule: There's a paper I found on type-level enforcement of DB semantics, one sec
[00:03:44] <eternaleye> bascule: http://homepages.cwi.nl/~ams/publications/hw2006.pdf
[00:05:41] <bascule> eternaleye: so every record is its own capnp "proto"?
[00:05:58] <bascule> that feels like you'd lose a lot of the advantages of protos in general
[00:09:20] <eternaleye> bascule: What capnproto would bring there is for the extensibility of the server.
[00:09:37] <eternaleye> bascule: What _not_ using it everywhere would bring is the ability to do updates.
[00:09:50] <eternaleye> bascule: Rather than needing to do much broader rewrites.
[00:14:03] <bascule> what do you mean "updates"?
[00:16:59] <eternaleye> bascule: Cap'n Proto doesn't support in-place modification IIRC, as of the last time I checked?
[00:18:26] <tiffany> yeah it doesn't

[00:21:52] <eternaleye> I wonder if Cap'n Proto could overcome that by way of something akin to rust's Sized
[00:22:07] <eternaleye> In that for any T: Sized, it could support in-place replacement
[00:23:27] <eternaleye> bascule: I was under the impression that mdbm wasn't especially interesting compared to lmdb
[00:23:40] <bascule> sure, they're quite similar
[00:23:41] <eternaleye> bascule: There were some not-especially-favorable performance results IIRC
[00:23:47] <bascule> haha, I'd like to see those!
[00:23:58] <bascule> I have a Yahoo coworker who wants to use MDBM instead of LMDB for a thing
[00:24:34] <eternaleye> bascule: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8733017
[00:24:40] <eternaleye> >> I don't think it's comparable to benchmark MDBM against LMDB or WiredTiger as keys are not kept in sorted order (no range queries), there is no support for transactions, and MDBM does not offer durability in the event of power loss.
[00:24:46] <eternaleye> That's... kind of painful.
[00:25:07] <eternaleye> >> MDBM is pretty much an optimized persistent hash table. LMDB and WiredTiger aim to be full-fledged ACID compliant database storage engines with functionality similar to that of BerkeleyDB or InnoDB.
[00:25:31] <eternaleye> hyc_symas jumps in downthread, and he's the author of LMDB
[00:25:40] <bascule> ex-Yahoo coworker, I should say
[00:25:45] <eternaleye> >> I should note that in LMDB 1.0 we'll have dynamic unmapping and remapping, to allow 32-bit machines to work with larger DBs. (There's still a significant performance cost for this. It's only being done to allow folks to use the same code on 32 and 64.)
[00:25:48] <eternaleye> Ooooh, nice!
[00:27:53] <tiffany> so MDBM has better perf because it never fsyncs
[00:28:20] <tiffany> does it do ACI, but just not D?
[00:29:01] <eternaleye> Also, one person clearly doesn't know what they're talking about:
[00:29:03] <eternaleye> >>> You pretty clearly haven't used MDBM because the MDBM I worked on at SGI (and still use to this day) gets to any key in two page faults (aka 2 disk seeks) at the most.
[00:29:28] <eternaleye> hyc_symas replies >> [I]t sounds like you're assuming a perfect hash function with no collisions. If you have collisions, you have to deal with the possibility of a hash bucket overflowing and requiring an additional seek.
[00:29:47] <eternaleye> But then in another thread, someone asks >> Care to share any details on the hashing scheme? Is it based on linear hashing, a la Litwin and Larson?
[00:30:05] <eternaleye> And the "2-seeks" person says " The hash is up to you, several are provided."
[00:30:07] <eternaleye> ...
[00:30:25] <eternaleye> So yeah, I have my doubts.
[00:31:40] <eternaleye> bascule: If you want to run the benchmarks yourself:  https://github.com/hyc/leveldb/tree/benches/doc/bench
[00:31:51] <Ilari> Hmm... Seems like Mike has presentation on NIST workshop on ECC.
[00:32:11] <bascule> eternaleye: the stuff we're doing is read-only 99.9999999% of the time
[00:32:20] <bascule> I don't think I'd pick leveldb
[00:32:30] <bascule> I was pushing for LMDB
[00:32:38] <bascule> it's presently sqlite, which kinda blows for this sort of workload
[00:32:45] <Ilari> Also, "Requirements for Elliptic Curves for High-Assurance Applications" ... The authors look like those BSI guys...
[00:32:47] <bascule> it's a tiny database we need extremely fast reads for
[00:32:48] <eternaleye> LMDB's api is a bit annoying, IMO
[00:33:02] <eternaleye> I'd really love to write a from-scratch impl in Rust
[00:33:06] <bascule> heh
[00:33:07] <bascule> do it!
[00:33:21] <eternaleye> bascule: Step 1: Decipher the LMDB code...
[00:33:35] <Ilari> And looks like DJB and friends also have an presentation...
[00:34:22] <bascule> Ilari: yeah I saw that
[00:34:24] <bascule> and Mike Hamburg
[00:36:03] <Ilari> Didn't the BSI guys also wrote a paper about their position during CFRG curve selection? IIRC, I didn't have anything good to say about that paper.

[00:50:15] <eternaleye> bascule: WiredTiger seems intriguing to me - sharing an API for both LSM trees and btree storage modes, where the btree mode is very good for read-heavy loads and the LSM tree mode is good for write-heavy loads, is a neat thing.
[00:51:24] <eternaleye> bascule: Also, in the LMDB benchmarks, its btree mode seems to be the nearest runner-up to LMDB

[21:16:42] <eternaleye> Huzzah! https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0911-const-fn.md
[21:17:50] <Dcoder> finally!
[21:20:08] <eternaleye> One thing I'd really like is if LLVM could annotate instructions with a constant-time bound, and then enforce the absence of branches, and that all instructions along the control flow path are constant time.
[21:20:42] <eternaleye> Hmm, that actually might be a good reason to write a Rust-based assembler (or compiler)
[21:21:05] <eternaleye> Have each instruction as a struct, unsafe trait ConstantTime {}; etc.
[21:21:46] <eternaleye> CtBasicBlock would have a ConstantTime bound on its items...
[21:33:37] <Ilari> Actually, constant-timeness is value property, not codeblock property.
[21:37:10] <eternaleye> Ilari: Mm, I'd argue it's a property of code operating on values that require it
[21:37:23] <eternaleye> Ilari: And BasicBlock in LLVM terms != block in source code terms
[21:38:34] <eternaleye> Ilari: Specifically, a BasicBlock is a container of sequential instructions (branchless, call-less - those are edges between BasicBlocks)
[21:38:53] <eternaleye> Ilari: A CtBasicBlock would be incapable of splitting, and would constrain the instructions within it
[21:40:59] <eternaleye> Ilari: If you enforce that "curve25519 multiplication" must compile to a single CtBasicBlock, then you have something a compiler can actually get its teeth into
[21:41:28] <eternaleye> Ilari: (Hell, even just enforcing a single BasicBlock would be better than it is now, since at least it wouldn't add branches)

[21:44:05] <eternaleye> Ilari: (and yes, it being a trait bound is likely incredibly naive - more likely, it'd be a method that returns true/false/unknown after inspecting what its parameters are)
[21:46:24] <Ilari> Heck, in my code that has internal instrumentation for detecting non-constant-time behaviour (including inserted by compiler) there are couple of places that need to downgrade outside normal function epilogue (most are associated with error returns).
[21:48:39] <Ilari> And then there are things like mul_d_nct (nct => Not Constant Time)...

[23:19:38] <Ilari> Looks like new PCI DSS systems must not allow SSLv3 nor TLSv1.0... Effective immediately.
[23:40:16] <o11c> eternaleye: there can be calls in a BB

[23:58:01] <bascule> Ilari: where did you see that?
[23:58:12] <eternaleye> o11c: I was imprecise with my wording, yeah - I meant more that if you have a call, your basic block has outward edges (aside from return? Is that an outward edge like CPS would definitely do, or is it implied?)
[23:58:14] <bascule> Ilari: because we have insider info from the PCI council that says otherwise
[23:58:20] <bascule> SSLv3 yes, TLS 1.0: next year
[23:58:48] <bascule> I guess that's what you might be saying?
