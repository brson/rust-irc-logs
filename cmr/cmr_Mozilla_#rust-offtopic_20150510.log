[01:34:51] <bombless> I'm thinking that this might be the thing Rust missing to support Monad: http://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/4287
[01:37:23] <bombless> Looks like some kind of runtime Parametric polymorphism.
[01:46:09] <aji> i thought it needed HKT
[01:46:19] <aji> like impl<A, B> Foo for A<B>
[01:46:38] <cmr> it does, but the current type system can express HKT's, albiet in a very rounadabout manner.
[01:46:39] <aji> that's at least what i ran into when trying to "port" haskell's Monad typeclass
[01:57:31] <bombless> I think that pseudo-HKT thing came like 1 or 2 months ago. Not sure when did you try that, aji.

[01:58:51] <aji> it's likely i didn't know what i was doing

[02:41:14] <bstrie> ork accent
[02:41:15] <cmr> void can have no values, and you cannot read pointers to void
[02:41:25] <cmr> whereas () has ostensibly one value
[02:41:38] <cmr> enum Void {} is closer to it.
[02:41:51] <cmr> (a "uninhabited type": it can have no values)

[02:50:21] <bombless> Guest44: You need brainfuck running on x86 real mode.
[02:50:32] <Guest44> I'm doing a presentation on Rust, and I have this 2-dimensional axis where horizontal goes from "dangerous" to "safe", and vertical goes from "slow" to "fast"
[02:50:37] <Guest44> and I'm gonna put Rust in the top right corner
[02:50:44] <whipsch> ahhh
[02:50:45] <Guest44> but I want something in the bottom left, just for fun
[02:50:48] <cmr> slow and dangerous is pretty unpopulated.

[02:50:58] <whipsch> maybe some
[02:51:00] <whipsch> yeah
[02:51:02] <whipsch> damn beat me to it

[02:51:27] <Guest44> damn I was like 9 at the time

[02:51:33] <bstrie> does MUMPS let you deref null pointers
[02:51:35] <bombless> forth?
[02:52:10] <cmr> forth usually doesn't let you do anything bad.
[02:52:28] <bombless> Hmm Ada?
[02:52:33] <cmr> ada is fast and safe.
[02:52:59] <aji> there's the weechat scripting api, lol. scripts get pointers converted to strings as references to internal objects
[02:53:00] <Guest44> Is Ada safe?
[02:53:03] <Guest44> I don't know anything about Ada
[02:53:10] <aji> Ada was designed for safety
[02:53:14] <Guest44> I guess Brainfuck would be pretty slow and dangerous right?
[02:53:15] <bombless> Then why don't we use Ada at first place, because we need generics? :D
[02:53:21] <Guest44> dangerous because you can fuck up and not know about it
[02:53:25] <Guest44> coz it's, you know, unreadable
[02:53:25] <cmr> as safe as Rust.
[02:53:26] <bstrie> bombless: Ada uses GC for safety
[02:53:40] <bstrie> Ada also has a mode where you can't dynamically allocate at all
[02:53:43] <bstrie> you pick one or the other
[02:54:02] <whipsch> interesting
[02:54:08] <bombless> bstrie: I see. And Ada use unmatched single-quote as well!

[02:58:44] <aji> http://eev.ee/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/ here's a fun article that talks about some

[02:58:48] <whipsch> register_globals comes to mind Guest44 
[02:58:56] <whipsch> also check out things like extract
[02:58:57] <aji> my favorite is the "array" type is used for both associative and ordered arrays
[02:59:10] <whipsch> as far as hard crashes like a segfault
[02:59:13] <Guest44> lol aji how does that even work?
[02:59:16] <whipsch> im sure theres something that you can abuse
[02:59:45] <aji> Guest44: if you want to store ["cat", "dog", "mouse"], you get array(0 => "cat", 1 => "dog", 2 => "mouse"), more or less
[02:59:50] <aji> i think, anyway. i may be confusing that with lua
[02:59:56] <Guest44> ah, k
[03:00:11] <cmr> Guest44: http://eev.ee/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/ is the classic piece on the topic ;)
[03:00:15] <whipsch> thats pretty much the case aji 
[03:00:33] <aji> PHP also loves to implicitly cast between types, so 5 == "5 cats" is true
[03:00:43] <whipsch> wait php actually has str_rot13?
[03:00:44] <aji> which is a big problem since it's not a strongly typed language
[03:00:45] <whipsch> wtf
[03:00:56] <aji> erm, statically
[03:01:10] <whipsch> (it does have strong equality, though)
[03:01:15] <whipsch> and nowadays you can type hint
[03:01:16] <aji> it does but you have to opt in
[03:01:18] <whipsch> yeah

[03:02:52] <aji> http://blogs.perl.org/users/ovid/2013/03/what-does-this-php-print.html
[03:03:32] <aji> the thing is PHP was never supposed to be so popular

[03:06:11] <whipsch> my favorite twitter account has to be @mongodbfacts
[03:06:34] <bombless> Why is gitlab so popular...
[03:07:39] <bstrie> I think because people want something like github, but self-hosted
[03:08:25] <whipsch> heh, their homepage even says 'Better than GitHub'
[03:08:26] <bstrie> obligatory xkcd comic, but replace "my code's compiling" with "github's down"
[03:08:58] <aji> yeah i think the complete reliance on a third party makes people nervous
[03:09:09] <bstrie> they have a whiole section on it https://about.gitlab.com/better-than-github/
[03:09:16] <aji> i know when atheme switched from self-hosted git to github, that was a big topic
[03:09:23] <whipsch> do they have a demo instance running somewhere
[03:09:30] <aji> and the main dev did occasional backups of the issues and stuff
[03:09:39] <bombless> http://alternativeto.net/software/gitlab/ this site always bump up when I search for alternatives... but it never help
[03:09:54] <cmr> https://gitlab.com/users/sign_in
[03:10:18] <whipsch> oh
[03:10:18] <cmr> bombless: all the software I know about is listed on that page
[03:11:15] <aji> why does nobody seem to care about bitbucket anymore
[03:11:42] <cmr> I prefer bitbucket
[03:11:45] <whipsch> its decent
[03:12:01] <whipsch> on a side note, sourcetree is decent
[03:12:06] <whipsch> slugs along sometimes on windows though
[03:12:12] <cmr> but ultimately, everyone is using github.
[03:12:38] <bombless> Seems that SourceTree slows down the speed to update.
[03:12:39] <aji> yeah, i'd use bitbucket more if i didn't feel like i was throwing my code into the hosted repo equivalent of google plus
[03:12:46] <whipsch> haha
[03:13:39] <whipsch> i don't really know about distinct feature advantages of bitbucket over github, but i've used them because they offer free private repos
[03:13:45] <whipsch> and thats pretty much my experience with it
[03:14:26] <bstrie> whipsch: sandstorm.io offers a gitlab demo https://sandstorm.io/apps/?host=https://demo.sandstorm.io
[03:15:03] <whipsch> i saw the official instance cmr linked
[03:15:12] <whipsch> but i keep forgetting about sandstorm
[03:15:49] <whipsch> Ported by: David Renshaw
[03:15:57] <bstrie> aji: nah, the hosted repo equivalent of google plus is google code :P
[03:16:03] <bstrie> whipsch: rust's very own
[03:16:10] <whipsch> oh wait he works there
[03:16:12] <whipsch> duh
[03:16:13] <bstrie> yep
[03:18:11] <c74d> bstrie: Google+ is being shut down‽ D:
[03:18:19] <whipsch> google code is
[03:18:23] <bstrie> c74d: not yet! give it time :P
[03:18:41] <c74d> whipsch: I know, which is why bstrie
[03:18:43] <whipsch> they should just move google+ to youtube
[03:18:56] <whipsch> thats the only reason it gets used anyway
[03:18:58] <whipsch> for comments
[03:19:00] <c74d> 's statement would imply that Google+ is being shut down.
[03:19:10] <bstrie> eventually google+ will probably get pivoted to just "google identity" or something and they'll drop the social network aspect
[03:19:20] <aji> i don't know why they're sticking to their guns with the youtube comments thing
[03:19:32] <aji> it's not like youtube comments ever made sense to begin with, but that integration is not helping

[03:21:10] <aji> i mean i think stuff like linking a video on google plus counts as a comment
[03:21:21] <bombless> Why not just use imgur.com directly :D
[03:22:40] <c74d> bombless: Me? Because Imgur is clearly for Internet meme images.
[03:23:12] <niconii> c
[03:23:20] <bombless> So what is Google+ for that sort of categroy, c74d
[03:23:37] <c74d> anything, I guess

[03:28:54] <c74d> possibly, but that seems unlikely… I'd rather have them in the respectably plain milieu of a Google+ album, though.
[03:35:55] <bombless> Once upon a time there was a free photo hosting service that is really fast, like 12MB/s or so to download those photos, that's pretty fast in my country. People started to use it for general file storage by appending data the the end of the image file :D. It took them a year to figure out what was wrong and started to check the size of images.
[03:36:27] <bombless> s/the the/to the
[03:39:22] <niconii> oh wow, that's pretty clever
[03:40:00] <whipsch> very common back in the day of people pwning crappy php forums
[03:40:09] <whipsch> set the jpeg comment field to '<?php ... ?>'
[03:40:12] <whipsch> and find a LFI somewhere
[03:40:42] <whipsch> similar concept
[03:44:56] <bombless> https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/25187 "drop glue", that's a smart way to describe it :)
[03:47:49] <FreeFull> The trick is that if you append a .zip file to a .jpg file, it becomes both a valid .jpg file and a valid .zip file
[03:48:21] <FreeFull> Due to how both .jpg and .zip work
[03:48:23] <XMPPwocky> what
[03:48:25] <cmr> (since .zip metadata is at the end)
[03:48:29] <XMPPwocky> ah
[03:48:30] <XMPPwocky> why
[03:49:44] <bombless> when you decode .jpg you search for leading "PNG", when you decode zip you search for the magic numbers from start but not necessary from the very beginning
[03:50:33] <bombless> and that jpg thing have a ending mark or something, I forget how to call it
[03:50:40] <niconii> ..."PNG"? excuse me?

[03:52:19] <bstrie> it's so great
[03:53:00] <niconii> pngs have PNG near the start, jpegs have JFIF near the start
[03:53:17] <bstrie> I want to believe that this wikipedia article was written by somebody who was forced to use mumps by day and was not happy about that fact
[03:53:56] <bombless> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG_File_Interchange_Format so it's "JFIF", and I think it's called tag.
[03:54:48] <aji> "There has been no contest such as the International Obfuscated C Code Contest for MUMPS, despite the potential of examples such as the following, perfectly legal, MUMPS code:"
[03:54:53] <aji> bstrie: you may be right
[03:55:01] <XMPPwocky> bstrie: reads like poems

[03:56:46] <niconii> by the way, what the hell *does* that code do
[03:57:12] <bstrie> niconii: it's just showing off that mumps doesn't reserve keywords, I think
[03:57:15] <FreeFull> *&mut 0 = 3;
[03:57:24] <bstrie> niconii: but I have no idea what the quits achieve
[03:57:26] <FreeFull> Guess what that does
[03:57:45] <cmr> writes 3 on the stack somewhere?
[03:57:52] <cmr> assuming it doesn't get optimized out
[03:58:00] <FreeFull> Yeah
[03:58:25] <FreeFull> I need to come up with something more complicated
[03:58:33] <XMPPwocky> volatile_store?
[03:58:41] <eddyb> C++ has first class lvalues
[03:59:05] <eddyb> Rust has first class rvalues :P
[03:59:18] <bombless> Hmm so that avoid some memcpy when move through multiply layers?
[03:59:20] <XMPPwocky> the R is for Rust, right
[03:59:37] <bombless> in C++
[04:00:55] <bombless> Hmm nvm, I ... I need to see an oculist.

[07:06:52] <eddyb> that's not how hashmaps work
[07:07:07] <eddyb> bstrie: you just slow down the compiler by microseconds
[07:07:09] <bstrie> if you're deduplicating solely by sticking things in hash buckets, it is
[07:07:09] <eddyb> at most
[07:07:24] <bstrie> "these two hash to the same, therefore they must be the same"
[07:07:33] <eddyb> that's not how hashmaps work
[07:07:41] <bstrie> then you still need dedupe logic
[07:07:55] <eddyb> most of the implementation is to deal with collisions
[07:08:11] <bstrie> so it's not "just a HashMap" :P
[07:08:31] <eddyb> the whole magical robin hood thing we use is a collision avoidance protocol
[07:08:48] <eddyb> bstrie: I am saying HashMap checks equality
[07:10:03] <eddyb> this little global caching is the least of your worries if we had exposed hash collisions
[07:10:12] <eddyb> nothing would work
[07:11:23] <eddyb> collisions happen all the time because you're not wasting enough memory
[07:12:57] <bstrie> I don't know what you mean by "a hashmap checks equality", that's got to be a pretty smart hashmap if it knows that it can act like a set iff its values are 'static
[07:14:07] <eddyb> wat
[07:14:26] <eddyb> are you trolling me?
[07:14:33] <bstrie> possibly
[07:15:00] <bstrie> really I just think you're doing a bad job at explaining what the compiler is using a hashmap for :P
[07:15:14] <eddyb> HashSet<K> is a wrapper for HashMap<K, ()>
[07:15:20] <eddyb> fwiw
[07:15:29] <eddyb> bstrie: everything
[07:15:53] <eddyb> well, almost everything, but the AST, is stored in hashmaps
[07:16:08] <eddyb> bstrie: you seemed to have confused hash buckets and hash maps
[07:16:46] <eddyb> a map keeps the hash, the key and a value, in each bucket
[07:17:08] <eddyb> you cannot observe hash collisions in a hash map outside of mempry consumption
[07:17:16] <bstrie> I think I was probably actually confusing keys and values
[07:18:12] <eddyb> the map for globals is from the value handle to a handle of a global constant containing the value
[07:18:22] <eddyb> the handles are LLVM pointers
[07:18:49] <eddyb> it happens to do some interning for integer values, at least

[17:17:50] <eddyb_> because there are no bloody docs that make sense

[17:30:03] <cmr> It seems that if I want to distribute a staticlib, I need to build in Release and Debug for each platform, and one version for each of the CRTs.

[18:15:19] <XMPPwocky> for some reason, ld won't let you use msvc binaries
[18:15:32] <XMPPwocky> msvc's linker will let you use Rust-built staticlibs though
[18:15:38] <cmr> I'm trying to have that experience but not getting very far.

[19:13:28] <cmr> c74d: what "F" are you refering to?
[19:13:52] <eddyb_> cmr: the generator I mentioned
[19:14:02] <eddyb_> F(0) = value, F(1) = type, F(2) = typeclass
[19:14:24] <cmr> Ah
[19:15:08] <cmr> So... there's a lot of complexity in that question, and I'm not quite so sure about F(2) there.
[19:15:24] <Tiffany> wouldn't F(2) be higher kinded types
[19:15:26] <Tiffany> not typeclasses
[19:15:28] <eddyb_> Tiffany: no
[19:15:32] <Tiffany> actually no
[19:15:44] <Tiffany> since some kinds of values are homomorphic to other types
[19:15:53] <Tiffany> in the same way that some types are homomorphic to different type classes
[19:15:59] <eddyb_> HKTs are functions that take types and return a type
[19:16:09] <eddyb_> they live on the F(1) plane
[19:16:27] <Tiffany> so function's are F(0), HKTs are F(1)
[19:16:35] <Tiffany> but can't HKTs also operate on typeclasses?
[19:16:41] <eddyb_> ehm
[19:16:56] <eddyb_> dependent typing results in functions that can go from F(0) to F(1)
[19:17:31] <cmr> eddyb_: have you seen http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_cube ?
[19:18:04] <eddyb_> I believe the lambda cube explains relationships between values, types and functions

[19:18:14] <cmr> That page has a lot of references to follow as well.
[19:19:05] <eddyb_> value = F(0), type = F(1), function = F(0) -> F(0), type constructor = F(1) -> F(1), dependent type = F(0) -> F(1)
[19:19:24] <eddyb_> but what is F(1) -> F(0)?
[19:19:30] <eddyb_> etc.
[19:20:20] <c74d> is it a value constructor?
[19:20:29] <cmr> Nothing special, certainly? consider, in Rust, fn foo<T: Reify>() -> T::Type { T::reify() }
[19:20:48] <eddyb_> foo(T: Reify) -> T
[19:20:56] <eddyb_> why are the rest special, then?
[19:21:07] <cmr> Are they?
[19:21:14] <eddyb_> in existing languages, they are
[19:21:50] <eddyb_> F(0) -> F(1) doesn't exist everywhere and F(0) -> F(0) has a different syntax from F(1) -> F(1)
[19:21:57] <cmr> Are you asking why certain functions between types and values require stronger type systems, while others can be modeled in weaker type systems?
[19:22:00] <eddyb_> there is a segregation between "worlds"
[19:24:13] <eddyb_> cmr: I am questioning the weak-strong dichotomy, the existence of discrete values of i for which F(i) is supported by a language
[19:25:05] <eddyb_> I guess a LISP or even JS could model something similar to what I'm thinking about
[19:25:17] <cmr> When discussing type systems I prefer to focus on the actual type systems, and not languages which use them...
[19:25:39] <cmr> Languages by necessity do a lot of simplification and duplification to make the type system presentable and usable.
[19:26:28] <eddyb_> precisely, which is why a trivial description is somewhat pointless

[19:30:50] <Tiffany> it doesn't look free
[19:31:00] <eddyb_> lol
[19:31:17] <eddyb_> I mean, there's nothing else that I need to do for it to work
[19:33:01] <eddyb_> oh, I have an idea
[19:35:12] <eddyb_> Tiffany: and I get output like this while assembling: 05: get 00
[19:35:23] <eddyb_> 5 is the stack_depth
[19:35:39] <eddyb_> or sys.stack.depth, rather
[19:36:34] <eddyb_> a macro assembler that produces bytes and prints instructions. what more could you possibly want :P?
[19:39:45] <eddyb_> cmr: the type system thing I was trying to get at is a generalization of "X is (a) Y" relationships that can express existing value: type and type: typeclass constraints
[19:40:50] <XMPPwocky> eddyb_: you could define "types" as "function domains", which seems like a reasonably generic place to start
[19:41:04] <eddyb_> but what's the function?
[19:41:12] <eddyb_> a "is" predicate?
[19:41:25] <eddyb_> (with a hint of Prolog)
[19:41:26] <XMPPwocky> the idea is, *any* function has a type associated with it
[19:41:42] <XMPPwocky> you can group functions together if they all accept exactly the same inputs
[19:41:53] <XMPPwocky> and then that group describes a type
[19:43:22] <eddyb_> x: T: Trait - so isT(x) = true and isTrait(T) = true, is this anything like what you're saying?
[19:43:37] <XMPPwocky> right
[19:43:46] <XMPPwocky> this makes a little more sense with dependent types
[19:44:25] <c74d> eddyb_: would it work to use “X is (a) Y” relationships exclusively and dispense with the terms “type” etc.?
[19:44:34] <eddyb_> well, dependent typing is likely going to be a requirement because it's one of the many possibilities you can express :P
[19:44:44] <XMPPwocky> exactly
[19:44:51] <eddyb_> c74d: what is Y to X and what is X to Y?
[19:45:08] <eddyb_> XMPPwocky: X is an instance of Y makes *some* sense
[19:45:15] <eddyb_> err, c74d ^^
[19:45:23] <c74d> as in “a function from X to Y”?
[19:45:54] <eddyb_> c74d: as in, you'd say Y is X's type
[19:46:27] <eddyb_> wait, this may make more sense with type classes
[19:46:42] <eddyb_> T: Eq, Eq is T's... nothing
[19:46:44] <XMPPwocky> ooh yeah
[19:46:57] <eddyb_> Eq is one of the groups T is in
[19:46:59] <c74d> I guess the latter (X → Y) function would be “type-of”
[19:47:19] <XMPPwocky> or just saying that Eq is actually the set of all functions which work on any "Eq type"
[19:47:22] <eddyb_> Eq is a group of T
[19:47:29] <eddyb_> XMPPwocky: that is very long :P
[19:47:53] <eddyb_> so... X: Y => X is an instance of Y and Y is a group of X
[19:47:59] <eddyb_> I think I like that
[19:48:34] <eddyb_> hmm, in Rust we have F: Fn(T) -> U, where F: type. but what if we used the same thing for describing type constructors?
[19:48:52] <eddyb_> Option: Fn(T) -> Option(T)
[19:48:59] <cmr> eddyb_: I strongly encourage you to dig into https://coq.inria.fr/refman/Reference-Manual006.html (only because it is some of the better documentation on an "advanced" type system)
[19:49:31] <eddyb_> haha the first few paragraphs address a similar issue to mine
[19:49:46] <cmr> I know.
[19:50:25] <eddyb_> something like Coq is probably advanced enough to describe most, if not all that I would put in this "catch-all" "typesystem"
[19:50:37] <eddyb_> I would have to read a lot about it to know for sure, though
[19:51:15] <eddyb_> c74d: "In practice, the Type hierarchy is implemented using algebraic universes."
[19:51:16] <eddyb_> welp
[19:51:34] <eddyb_> oh there was a mention of Coq in your paste
[19:51:38] <XMPPwocky> isn't that the thing the Enterprise got stuck in
[19:51:44] <cmr> hahahah
[19:52:20] <eddyb_> and there's a link to https://pigworker.wordpress.com/2015/01/09/universe-hierarchies/
[19:54:13] <eddyb_> cmr: I know that on a *syntactic* level, I can slightly improve Rust's expressivity (the issue being that some - maybe common - usecases will be nastier to work with)
[19:54:31] <eddyb_> or at least remove the use of <> for generics
[19:55:21] <eddyb_> but I have a lot of reading to do to understand the rest of the story
[19:55:26] <cmr> yes you do.
[19:56:09] <eddyb_> I also know you can do what Haskell does with its generics, without having an uniform representation, or even allocation
[19:56:25] <eddyb_> how efficient is it? I don't know
[19:57:42] <eddyb_> well, Vec(Trait) would be Vec(T: Trait), indirection still required for non-homogenous containers
[19:57:55] <eddyb_> but! you could have generic trait methods

[21:03:10] <eddyb> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVXviz_kp3M now he needs to write a BASIC interpreter
[21:03:34] <Tiffany> oh my
[21:03:46] <Tiffany> I hadn't thought about computers in minecraft using command blocks
[21:03:52] <Tiffany> man, they must be a thousand times faster than they used to be
[21:04:01] <Tiffany> you might be able to get a cycle time of a second!
[21:04:17] <eddyb> Tiffany: you can perform many computations in one second
[21:04:24] <eddyb> have you not seen the ray tracing video?
[21:04:33] <Tiffany> yeah but that's not general purpose
[21:04:43] <eddyb> oh, I see what you mean
[21:04:47] <Tiffany> it's not executing a program, it's executing a fixed configuration of command blocks
[21:04:59] <eddyb> so one thing that you might be able to do
[21:05:12] <Havvy> There's ComputerCraft which flat out gives you computers in a block.
[21:05:15] <eddyb> is interact with "delay memory"
[21:05:24] <eddyb> Havvy: no, it gives you a lua interpreter in a block
[21:05:27] <eddyb> big difference :P
[21:05:36] <Havvy> And a file system...
[21:05:57] <eddyb> I can write a VFS in node.js and replace the fs module to use it
[21:06:06] <eddyb> I believe emscripten has a VFS
[21:06:10] <Tiffany> I'm disappointed with all of the computer mods in minecraft
[21:06:16] <Tiffany> the only good one I've ever seen was the redpower one
[21:06:19] <Tiffany> it was a proper emulated CPU
[21:06:25] <Tiffany> with a FORTH interpreter on the ROM
[21:06:34] <eddyb> Tiffany: redpower was amazing
[21:06:44] <Tiffany> and it wasn't "everything in 1 block"
[21:06:51] <Tiffany> it was a pain to craft, which I didn't like
[21:06:53] <eddyb> but then the author... nobody knew where she disappeared for a while
[21:07:04] <Tiffany> but it gave you an incentive to keep your program under 8K of memory rather than expanding to the full 64K
[21:07:07] *** Quits: Rym (y@moz-o80acm.range86-189.btcentralplus.com) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[21:07:28] <Havvy> She sort of vanished again.
[21:07:29] <Tiffany> someone doxed her because she wasn't updating her mod fast enough (wtf?) and so she disappeared
[21:07:37] <eddyb> oh
[21:07:48] <eddyb> welcome to the internet, where we can't have nice things
[21:07:51] <Tiffany> she's back now, but it's not clear if we will get a new redpower
[21:07:59] <eddyb> I think I've seen a fork
[21:08:01] <Tiffany> everything the old mod did is long since replaced now
[21:08:05] <Tiffany> yeah, project red
[21:08:05] <Havvy> There's no forks.
[21:08:10] <Tiffany> it's not a fork
[21:08:13] <Tiffany> it's a total recreation
[21:08:14] <Havvy> Just reimplementations.
[21:08:15] <eddyb> oh?
[21:08:19] <eddyb> my bad
[21:08:24] <Tiffany> redpower is closed source
[21:08:28] <Tiffany> and she's super defensive about it
[21:08:38] <Tiffany> but yeah, I don't think if it got a new release it would see much light of day
[21:08:41] <eddyb> I would be too, with such jerks
[21:08:44] <Tiffany> she basically built her own game engine inside minecraft
[21:08:48] <Tiffany> which makes the mod extremely slow
[21:09:14] <Tiffany> every single block from redpower is a tile entity that hooks her custom rendering engine
[21:09:23] <Tiffany> and tile entities take the slow path for minecraft rendering
[21:09:35] <Tiffany> back in the old days, it was typically the "main mod" of a pack
[21:09:43] <Tiffany> you installed that mod, and maybe some few other simple mods like NEI or whatever
[21:09:45] <Tiffany> and that was it
[21:09:49] <Tiffany> anything more would lag you out
[21:10:09] <Tiffany> these days, modpacks have hundreds of mods, and they don't have patience for that anymore
[21:10:34] <Tiffany> and because redpower disappeared for so long, other mods gobbled up its functionality
[21:10:47] <Tiffany> microblocks are in forge micropart, all of the worldgen it added is added by other mods
[21:10:55] <Tiffany> I don't know if anyone reproduced computers
[21:11:01] <Tiffany> there are other mods which add redstone bits
[21:11:12] <Tiffany> the tube system is pretty prehistoric as far as they go these days
[21:11:15] <Tiffany> it was almost as bad as buildcraft
[21:11:30] <Tiffany> I can understand wanting to make building pipe systems a challenge
[21:11:40] <Tiffany> but dropping shit on the ground or making it impossible to avoid deadlocks? yeah, no
[21:12:20] <Tiffany> the only way to avoid deadlocks with RP tubes was to put 1 item type per pipe
[21:12:32] <Tiffany> it's literally the only way
[21:12:39] <Tiffany> and deadlocking is inevitable when you don't
[21:13:05] <Tiffany> one item type builds up in the pipe network because nothing wants it, the pipe jams
[21:13:10] <Tiffany> whole network grinds to a halt
[21:16:19] <eddyb> oh, I was wondering earlier today, is it possible to build an autonomous bicycle?
[21:16:45] <cmr> why not/
[21:17:02] <eddyb> that's the wrong question, I guess
[21:17:10] <eddyb> just how hard is it to stabilize it?

[21:56:30] <panicbit> This macro demonstrates exponential growth pretty well:
[21:56:37] <panicbit> playbot-mini: macro_rules!m{($($f:tt)*)=>{m!($($f)*$($f)*);}}m!(!);
[21:56:43] -playbot-mini- playpen: timeout triggered!
[21:56:56] <Tiffany> I don't understand that vine fmtq
[22:00:59] <panicbit> That's weird though. The memory should be growing exponentially but it doesn't.
[22:01:16] <panicbit> It's rather slowly creeping up
[22:01:36] <eddyb> panicbit: it's still exponential
[22:01:42] <panicbit> hm
[22:01:46] <eddyb> it just takes longer to expand the larger invocations
[22:01:50] <panicbit> I see
[22:02:11] <panicbit> Rustc is just a slowpoke at infinite exponential macro expansion :P

[22:29:40] <cmr> WindowsBunny: yeah. trying to get a msvc-generated staticlib and mingw to place nice. Not succeeding.
[22:30:05] <WindowsBunny> mixing staticlibs is very much not recommended
[22:30:07] <WindowsBunny> nor sane in any way
[22:30:27] <cmr> I can't convince msvc to make a dll out of this stuff.
[22:30:33] <cmr> I apparently did it in the past.
[22:31:07] <cmr> It's unfortunate because this component also requires pulling in the C++ runtime
[22:31:24] <WindowsBunny> lol
[22:31:34] <WindowsBunny> mixing CRTs is a big nono
[22:31:43] <cmr> Well...
[22:31:51] <cmr> The C API I expose should have it ok.
[22:31:55] <cmr> No heap mixing etc.
[22:32:11] <cmr> But I can't distribute it.
[22:32:16] <cmr> so
[22:32:33] <eddyb> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6E-dFOXgTg "who? from what?" =))))))))
[22:32:42] <WindowsBunny> If you have two different CRTs in the same binary, thats not good
[22:33:04] <cmr> It's not ideal but it's not the end of the world.
[22:33:04] <WindowsBunny> because each CRT needs to initialize itself through its own entry point
[22:34:29] <cmr> But it's a moot point anyway because lolmingw
[22:35:34] <cmr> Ah I think last time I said "fuck visual studio" and invoked link.exe myself.
[22:35:41] <cmr> I'll give that another spin in a bit...
[22:37:50] <WindowsBunny> But yeah, you're not allowed to have multiple CRTs in a single binary
[22:37:56] <WindowsBunny> Otherwise bad things will happen
[22:40:18] <WindowsBunny> if you want to mix mingw and msvc, then one side has to be built as a dll

[23:30:20] <WindowsBunny> cmr: a DLL is a separate binary
[23:30:38] <cmr> Ah, ok.
[23:30:46] <WindowsBunny> cmr: So the exe can have one CRT, a DLL can have another
[23:30:47] <cmr> Right, own entry points and everything
[23:30:50] <WindowsBunny> yep
[23:31:26] <cmr> supposedly they actually don't have separate heaps as of VS 2012 too, which must be nice for all those people stuck in that sort of hell.
[23:31:49] <WindowsBunny> thats just an implementation detail
[23:31:52] <WindowsBunny> don't rely on it :D
[23:31:59] <cmr> Right, but I mean fragmentation-wise.
[23:32:12] <WindowsBunny> ah yes, reducing fragmentation is nice

[23:56:33] <Tiffany> oh
[23:56:37] <Tiffany> java2k is not what I thought it was
[23:57:59] <Tiffany> "Java2K has a garbage collection: memory is freed when the program exits, or, at random intervals, whichever comes first."
[23:58:00] <Tiffany> oh god
