[03:34:14] <cmr> bjz: whoaa dropbox sends notifications when files are updated
[03:34:17] <cmr> this is cool
[03:34:21] <bjz> sorry!
[03:34:22] * cmr hasn't used it collaboratively before
[03:34:29] <cmr> no, it's a good thing! :P
[03:34:34] <bjz> if I am spamming you
[03:35:22] <bjz> working on this lambda calculus stuff
[03:35:31] <cmr> I know :P
[03:35:35] <bjz> trying to figure out the `plus` function
[03:35:51] <bjz> always makes more sense when you derive it
[03:35:58] <bjz> well
[03:36:00] <bjz> I mean
[03:36:09] <bjz> reduce an expression using it
[03:36:28] <cmr> The biggest revelation for me was that 1. there's no such thing as a value, and 2. computation happens in the reduction process
[03:36:54] <cmr> probably obvious...
[03:37:01] <cmr> but it made a lightbulb go in my head
[03:37:09] <bjz> yep
[03:37:31] <bjz> wait
[03:37:48] <bjz> I'm not sure if 'there's no such thing as a value' is accurate
[03:38:03] <cmr> all there are are functions, bound variables, and free variables
[03:38:08] <bjz> more like, the only value is a function
[03:38:32] <cmr> well
[03:38:34] <cmr> possibly
[03:39:06] <bjz> wait, I'll transcribe the things in the semantic description of the untyped lambda calculus from tapl
[03:39:27] <cmr> but like
[03:39:29] <cmr> 4
[03:39:31] <cmr> isn't a value
[03:39:33] <cmr> it's a function...
[03:39:44] <cmr> although I suppose in this universe the difference between values and functions is nonexistent
[03:40:07] <bjz> yeah, but 4 is still a value
[03:40:20] <bjz> it's just formed by a function
[03:40:32] <cmr> that's like
[03:40:34] <cmr> a meta-value
[03:40:42] <cmr> that's like saying {{}} is 1 :P
[03:40:47] <cmr> IMO
[03:40:50] <cmr> dunno
[03:41:03] <bjz> still a value
[03:41:59] <bjz> the notation 0, 1, 2, 3, ... is an abstraction
[03:44:08] <bjz> as far as I understand it atm, in most programming languages it is simpler to have separate booleans and integers values, along with abstraction values
[03:45:02] <bjz> but the cool thing about church encoding is that it shows how you can actually form those just from abstraction values alone
[03:45:46] <bjz> it's sort of like it easier to work with AND and OR gates etc. rather than just combinations of NAND gates
[03:46:31] <bjz> (plus it is more efficient at a hardware level)
[03:56:31] <bjz> cmr: what do you think? ^
[03:57:15] <cmr> yeah
[03:57:25] <cmr> my bad
[03:57:35] <cmr> I still found it a useful thought though :P
[03:57:59] <bjz> np
[03:58:22] <bjz> just clarifying is all
[03:59:03] <bjz> so: "1. there's only one value: abstraction. 2. computation happens in the reduction process"
[04:05:42] <cmr> bjz: amazon ads just recommended http://www.amazon.com/dp/0521663504/ref=dra_a_cs_mr_hn_it_P3033_100?tag=dradisplay-20 to me
[04:05:46] <cmr> might be interesting
[04:05:51] <cmr> mostly unrelated though :P
[04:06:03] <bjz> yeah, seen that before
[04:06:24] <bjz> :)
[04:06:48] <bjz> tons of books that are cool
[04:06:55] * bjz likes books!

[04:08:52] <bjz> cmr: do you see the rules and syntax I put down at the bottom of the lambda-calc file?
[04:09:16] <cmr> yes
[04:10:10] <bjz> does it kinda make sense?
[04:10:22] <cmr> not to me, no. still not comfortable with that notation.
[04:10:29] <cmr> what does the first one read as?
[04:10:47] <cmr> "If t naught expands to t prime naught..."
[04:10:56] <bjz> the evaluation rule?
[04:11:27] <cmr> "then v naught applied to t one expands to v naught applied to t prime one"
[04:11:29] <cmr> yes.
[04:12:19] <cmr> does tapl actually have a concept of "value"? I haven't seen this so far in the papers I've read
[04:12:25] <cmr> (looking at the syntax section)
[04:12:57] <bjz> "if we have established that `t₀ ⟶ t'₀` then we can assume that `t₀ t₁ ⟶ t'₀ t₁`"
[04:13:21] <cmr> and ⟶ meaning?
[04:14:56] <bjz> "lhs evaluates to rhs in one step"
[04:15:07] <cmr> ah ok
[04:15:38] <bjz> (3.5 of TaPL)
[04:16:06] <bjz> ⇓ is also used for "evaluates to"
[04:17:36] <bjz> the evaluation rules that are given there using ⟶ is called "small step semantics"
[04:17:41] <cmr> yeah
[04:17:58] <cmr> I just re-read the crash-course on whatever this notation is called
[04:18:02] <cmr> does it even have a name?
[04:18:02] <bjz> when you use the downwards arrow its "big step semantics"
[04:18:06] <bjz> (less common)
[04:18:52] <bjz> I believe the evaluation rules define the "operational semantics"
[04:19:07] <bjz> the notation is in part called "natural deduction"
[04:19:49] <bjz> not to be confused with sequent calculus which is quite similar
[04:20:43] <bjz> re. values
[04:21:19] <bjz> TaPL uses them when it uses the `v` metavariable as opposed to say, `t`
[04:24:40] <bjz> so in T-App2, v₀ can only be a value, not any old term
[04:25:21] <bjz> that is my understanding anyway
