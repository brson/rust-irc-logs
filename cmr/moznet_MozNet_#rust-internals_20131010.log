[00:03:45] <cmr> Nothing, there's a patch in the queue and I have it built here

[00:04:21] <dbaupp> cmr: (ReaderUtil etc are reexported by std::rt::io, btw)
[00:04:35] <cmr> there's a bug with read_to_end
[00:04:40] <cmr> or, something
[00:05:46] <dbaupp> oh, I see
[00:09:41] <sfackler> dbaupp: there's a bug with resolve in general, looks like. If you import ReaderUtil from the reexport, rustc can't find any of the methods

[00:14:29] <cmr> Oh,I'm still usnig the reexported.
[00:14:46] <cmr> alright yeah nvm

[00:17:26] <dbaupp> cmr: awesome
[00:17:34] * dbaupp hugs cmr
[00:18:39] <acrichto> haha the default min stack is less than the default fixed stack segment size
[00:20:37] <sfackler> cmr: what's the update rate for the docs server?
[00:23:25] <cmr> sfackler: hourly.
[00:23:37] <cmr> Is something unexpected happening? I can check in on it.
[00:24:09] <cmr> I can also kick it manually.
[00:25:33] <sfackler> it looks like the rust-postgres docs aren't updating
[00:25:51] <sfackler> the message module is still showing up even after this commit https://github.com/sfackler/rust-postgres/commit/942214b55eeb8a43299b54512124170725c659d6
[00:25:51] <cmr> I'll look into it
[00:26:28] <sfackler> thanks
[00:29:37] <acrichto> it appears that if we want to turn on __morestack in the new runtime without segmented stacks, we're going to have to increase the default stack size
[00:29:48] <acrichto> it something even larger than it currently is
[00:30:14] <Luqman> what's the point of __morestack without segmented stacks?
[00:30:22] <acrichto> checking for stack overflow
[00:30:31] <acrichto> making sure you don't run off your stack basically
[00:30:33] <Luqman> ah, and abort?
[00:30:42] <acrichto> that's kinda tricky
[00:30:49] <acrichto> it'd be awesome if the task unwound
[00:30:59] <acrichto> I'm not certain that's possible though
[00:32:17] <dbaupp> rusti: trait Foo {  fn bar(mut int); }

[00:32:44] <dbaupp> that's weird ^
[00:32:54] <acrichto> whoa
[00:32:57] <strcat> acrichto: you probably aren't going to be able to unwind because you need stack for that ;p
[00:33:09] <acrichto> strcat: we can give ourselves wiggle room
[00:33:17] <acrichto> right now it's an extra 20k at the end 
[00:33:19] <strcat> but you don't know how much the destructors are going to want
[00:33:30] <strcat> what if they need to destroy a massive linked list or a tree via recursion?
[00:33:39] <acrichto> I'd want to do something to invoke a different morestack handler
[00:33:45] <cmr> u/me sets that VM to start on boot
[00:33:47] <acrichto> if you overflow during an unwinding then you abort
[00:33:48] <cmr> sfackler: sorry about that!
[00:34:20] <strcat> in the long term __morestack isn't how you'd want to implement stack safety anyway
[00:34:27] <strcat> just a nice ugly temporary workaround ;p
[00:34:36] <strcat> assuming we aren't going to have segmented stacks on 64-bit
[00:34:39] <acrichto> I don't think that llvm supports other methods currently
[00:34:47] <strcat> yeah, that's the issue
[00:35:03] <strcat> (anyway we've discussed this before so we're on the same page)
[00:35:17] <acrichto> I was thinking we should avoid using signal handlers
[00:35:19] <sfackler> cmr: np :)
[00:35:21] <acrichto> to catch a segv
[00:35:34] <strcat> acrichto: yeah we really don't want signal handlers
[00:35:40] <strcat> signalfd, sure ;p
[00:35:50] <strcat> there's likely an equivalent on freebsd
[00:36:00] <acrichto> exception handling is just really hard though

[00:36:15] <acrichto> I can see something working well if we had maybe 2 worls in TLS
[00:36:15] <aatch> It frightens me that it's possible to catch a SEGV
[00:36:25] <acrichto> 1 is the absolute stack limit and the other is the current allocated stack limit
[00:36:30] <strcat> acrichto: you have to use sigaltstack once per thread
[00:36:42] <acrichto> strcat: what if someone wants to handle segvs from libuv?
[00:36:52] <strcat> acrichto: they can use proper modern signal handling
[00:36:54] <acrichto> or installs a segv handler in some other way for the process?
[00:36:56] <strcat> signal handlers are not good
[00:37:11] <acrichto> they're really useful for some things though
[00:37:16] <strcat> acrichto: they aren't
[00:37:21] <dbaupp> does anyone happen to know if ast::DefBinding corresponds to (e.g.) a and b in let (a,b) = (1,2)?
[00:37:23] <strcat> they're totally broken/unsafe in almost every case
[00:37:29] <strcat> modern signal handling uses signalfd
[00:37:54] <kmc> only on Linux
[00:37:55] <strcat> I think it's undefined behaviour to listen for the same signal in multiple threads anyway
[00:38:00] <strcat> kmc: there are alternatives elsewhere
[00:38:03] <kmc> right
[00:38:06] <strcat> I think kqueue has something
[00:38:12] <kmc> there's also the self-pipe trick
[00:38:17] <strcat> the pselect thing?
[00:38:20] <strcat> I don't remember exactlyt
[00:38:22] <kmc> no
[00:38:44] <kmc> you call pipe(2) and then install signal handlers which just write the signal number into the write end of that pipe
[00:38:49] <kmc> and then you can select etc. on the read end
[00:39:03] <acrichto> that's what libuv does
[00:39:05] <acrichto> essentially
[00:39:07] <strcat> we only support freebsd, linux and OS X so if kqueue has something we're all set
[00:39:09] <strcat> http://doc.geoffgarside.co.uk/kqueue/signal.html
[00:39:13] <strcat> acrichto: doesn't it use signalfd?
[00:39:24] <acrichto> not from what I can tell
[00:39:30] <strcat> well, libuv sucks then ;p
[00:39:32] <acrichto> as in 'git grep signalfd' shows up nothing
[00:39:55] <strcat> acrichto: what about timerfd?
[00:39:57] <kmc> I think signalfd is not significantly better that the self-pipe trick if you're maintaining the code for the latter anyway
[00:40:04] <acrichto> strcat: no :(
[00:40:16] <strcat> acrichto: well, that's really awful then
[00:40:22] <strcat> how the hell are they doing timers? polling? :s
[00:40:39] <acrichto> regardless though, I don't think we can use sigaction/signal to handle page faults to auto-grow the stack
[00:41:06] <strcat> it doesn't seem like a good idea to use libuv if they're not even using timerfd ;\

[00:41:36] <acrichto> argh this patch will not land
[00:42:09] <acrichto> of course
[00:44:06] <acrichto> does longjmp run destructors?
[00:44:14] <strcat> no
[00:44:16] <sfackler> nope
[00:44:24] <strcat> you really, really don't want longjmp/setjmp
[00:44:26] <acrichto> I suppose I'd be surprised if it did
[00:44:27] <strcat> or signal handlers
[00:44:31] <sfackler> the results of jumping if you have destructors is undefined iirc
[00:45:30] <strcat> acrichto: you aren't allowed to call longjmp from a signal handler
[00:45:52] <acrichto> oh no for a second I was thinking we could remove c++ entirely  and switch to gcc
[00:46:12] <strcat> acrichto: longjmp is really slow compared to exceptions anyway
[00:46:20] <acrichto> it'd only be for unwinding
[00:46:38] <strcat> acrichto: it's really slow to use it to implement exceptions though
[00:46:45] <strcat> there is a cost on the normal path
[00:47:12] <strcat> you don't need C++ to use exceptions
[00:47:17] <strcat> (in gcc terms)
[00:47:30] <strcat> they define exceptions in libgcc_s
[00:47:40] <acrichto> huh, maybe we could use that...
[00:47:50] <acrichto> I think the only real use-case of C++ right now is rust_try
[00:48:01] <strcat> or use libc++abi, which is supposed to abstract it per-platform
[00:48:18] <strcat> OS X doesn't use libgcc exceptions (although we do)
[00:49:12] <acrichto> wheeee
[00:49:21] <acrichto> I don't think a c++ dep is hurting us though
[00:50:01] <strcat> using libuv might just be a bad way to do it
[00:50:10] * strcat shrugs
[00:50:13] <acrichto> for exceptions?
[00:50:16] <strcat> no
[00:50:20] <strcat> I mean using libuv at all
[00:50:35] <acrichto> I don't think we're moving away from libuv any time soon
[00:50:43] <strcat> it's terrible on linux and it forces you into using callbacks
[00:50:44] <acrichto> but I think the idea was to have a pluggable event loop
[00:50:56] <kmc> how is it terrible on linux
[00:51:07] <strcat> kmc: it's polling
[00:51:31] <strcat> for timers
[00:51:43] <kmc> :(
[00:52:03] <kmc> doesn't Node use libuv? and isn't Node usually deployed on Linux? do they just not use timers?
[00:52:13] <kmc> can we just add timerfd support?
[00:52:27] <strcat> https://github.com/joyent/libuv/pull/928 wat
[00:55:40] <strcat> kmc: *shrug*, it seems there are a lot of problems with it - like I/O being locked to a specific thread
[00:56:04] *** Quits: tjc (tjc@moz-7B0110AD.mv.mozilla.com) (Quit: Places to go, people to annoy)
[00:56:07] <strcat> and it uses fork instead of posix_spawn which is no better than our naive std::run
[00:56:28] <strcat> I realize it's hard to make a cross-platform abstraction, but it seems like we're going to be way behind Go
[00:59:17] <strcat> node.js is single-threaded
[00:59:35] <strcat> (from a language POV - it does use multiple threads, to avoid blocking on I/O)
[00:59:44] <strcat> but 1 event loop
[01:00:17] <kmc> true
[01:00:21] <strcat> like lets say you have 4 schedulers, and you have I/O work on #1
[01:00:27] <strcat> and now #1 is running a CPU task
[01:00:41] <strcat> unless you can move that to another, it's going to all time out
[01:00:49] <kmc> i wonder if any part of the GHC IO manager would be reusable
[01:01:04] <kmc> I think much of it's in Haskell :/
[01:01:14] <strcat> or translate go's scheduler to rust ;p
[01:01:29] <kmc> how much code is it?
[01:01:46] <strcat> dunno
[01:02:05] <strcat> it's probably only solid on linux though
[01:02:40] <kmc> and Linux is one of the easier platforms for this stuff, yeah
[01:03:05] <strcat> yeah, because it has every event in fd form
[01:03:24] <kmc> also a correct pselect(2), although we probably won't use it
[01:03:58] <kmc> some BSDs implement pselect in userspace, which defeats the entire point of it existing

[01:06:25] <acrichto> mmap is cool
[01:08:18] <kmc> yes
[01:08:29] <kmc> memory mapped files are another thing that doesn't play well with userspace threading, though :/
[01:08:47] <strcat> kmc: why?
[01:09:00] <strcat> I guess because the page faults block the thread?
[01:09:01] <kmc> when your IO operations are just memory access, you can't route them through an event loop
[01:09:03] <kmc> yep
[01:09:30] * strcat shrugs
[01:09:40] <kmc> I heard Go wants to move towards a real Linux thread for every Go thread, and introduce some new system calls to cut out the Linux scheduler overhead
[01:09:45] <strcat> I feel like we're falling into the trap of taking on too much and doing nothing well, in many areas
[01:10:02] <strcat> kmc: yep, it was at the linux plumber's conference (the kernel API they want to add)
[01:10:02] <kmc> I forgot the link, though :/
[01:10:16] <kmc> for the record I think it's fine to have userspace threading without a story for mmap
[01:10:44] <strcat> sqlite moved to mmap
[01:10:46] <kmc> not ideal but I don't know of any nice solution
[01:19:32] <strcat> kmc: well, Go reinvents all of libc and uses a calling convention where they only need to save 3 registers to context switch
[01:19:58] <strcat> and it's a *highly tuned* event loop
[01:20:07] <strcat> it sacrifices a lot in performance elsewhere
[01:22:12] <kmc> *nod*
[01:22:22] <kmc> that's interesting
[01:22:32] <kmc> they're optimizing for a different use case than us, for sure
[01:23:28] <strcat> well, that's the problem I see, what is the use case for rust's stdlib?
[01:24:50] <strcat> I really don't think we're going to succeed at doing both the task-based scalable I/O and performance in the C++ niche use cases with the same library
[01:25:28] <aatch> strcat, I see the issue as the server-side camp vs the application camp
[01:25:52] <strcat> depends on the kind of server, lots of them would do real work
[01:26:00] <kmc> IO throughput vs. latency & raw compute power
[01:26:13] <strcat> there are other tensions like managed pointers
[01:26:17] <aatch> kmc, I guess that's what I meant
[01:26:24] <kmc> right, Rust could be a runaway success for e.g. high frequency trading servers
[01:27:11] <kmc> I wonder where things like memcached fall; seems like they would care a lot about both latency and concurrent throughput

[01:31:37] <strcat> well, the stdlib falls really short of doing anything well atm
[01:31:54] <strcat> vectors are ridiculously slow for example
[01:32:02] <strcat> and FFI overhead is high
[01:32:09] <strcat> so trees are slow
[01:32:29] <strcat> jemalloc can allocate faster than we can call a no-op function
[01:34:14] <aatch> Yeah, which is why I'm still not a huge fan of the task stuff. I get the appeal, but it really hurts other places (the vector stuff is just poor design currently)
[01:35:00] * strcat is really close to at least making an alternate container library
[01:35:09] <strcat> I don't know how to fix vectors in libstd
[01:35:15] <strcat> stupid managed ptrs :(

[02:15:42] <strcat> that makes no sense, nvm
[02:16:15] <acrichto> strcat: you were trying to unify adding attributes to functions, right?
[02:16:53] <strcat> acrichto: yes, in base.rs there's a unified point where rust functions are declared
[02:17:04] <strcat> but the attributes also have to be added to call instructions

[02:18:14] <acrichto> strcat: oh wait and the helper set_llvm_fn_attrs ...
[02:18:49] <strcat> right that thing sets inlining, etc.

[06:07:54] <engla> removing the `rust` tool? it's less than 500 lines of code and some use it every day
[06:09:25] <engla> I hope it's resurrected in the future in some way
[06:11:13] <dbaupp> I think it was discussed in the most recent meeting?
[06:11:23] <cmr> It was.
[06:11:25] <dbaupp> (something about being too incomplete to be worth the hassle of 1.0)
[06:11:33] <dbaupp> possibly
[06:11:50] <dbaupp> https://github.com/mozilla/rust/wiki/Meeting-weekly-2013-10-08#rust-tool
[06:13:02] <engla> don't you use it to run tests? I guess that's the part that's working
[06:13:09] <cmr> I don't
[06:13:15] * dbaupp doesn't
[06:13:30] <engla> why not?
[06:13:45] <cmr> Last I tried to use it it was broken so I just use rustc
[06:13:54] <cmr> This was pre-0.7 though

[06:16:51] <engla> cmr: so the `rust test` feature was broken? How? It doesn't seem to be now.
[06:17:01] <cmr> engla: I don't remember details.
[06:17:09] <cmr> I don't think it was rust test though, just `rust` in general.
[06:17:12] <cmr> Like, segfault broken.
[06:19:35] <engla> I'm going to suggest reviving the `test` feature of `rust` in some way, maybe rustc can do it.
[06:20:02] <cmr> engla: are you volunteering to maintain `rust`? ;)
[06:20:12] <engla> no
[06:21:00] <engla> I just looked at how much code was needed to run `rust test`, rustc can ddo tha and do it better
[06:22:51] <dbaupp> you can replace it with `function rust_test() { rustc --test $1 -o /tmp/rust_test.out && /tmp/rust_test.out; }` in your .bashrc (or equivalent)
[06:23:20] <cmr> does -o actually work with --test? it doesn't follow it all the time iirc
[06:23:42] <dbaupp> well, it seemed to work when I just tested it
[06:23:47] * dbaupp shrugs
[06:23:56] <dbaupp> it does strange things with --lib, I think?
[06:24:13] <engla> dbaupp: I think the `rust test` feature is a great feature out of the box. It's the small advantages that can win people over to rust, easy access to the test tools
[06:24:31] <dbaupp> engla: yeah
[06:24:38] <dbaupp> rustpkg test does/will do something smiilar though

[22:18:57] <brson> anybody object if I just delete the 'far future' milestone. it's all pretty speculative stuff. don't think the categorization is buying us anything
[22:19:06] <tjc> brson: I vigorously don't object
[22:19:35] <tjc> although it would be good to have *some* sort of label that sorta discourages working on it *right now*
[22:19:38] <tjc> maybe wishlist is for that
[22:19:47] <aatch> tjc, you are passionately apathetic?
[22:19:54] <tjc> Maybe we don't want ti discourage anything, no matter how speculative. idk
[22:19:57] <tjc> aatch: meh
[22:20:24] <aatch> tjc, do you mean: "meh!"
[22:20:29] <tjc> heh
[22:20:31] <aatch> don't*
[22:23:35] <benh> hm
[22:24:18] <benh> i meddled with temp dir creation and now a test in rustpkg fails approximately every other time
[22:24:48] <tjc> benh: which test, and what did you change exactly?
[22:24:57] <tjc> the test may have been failing sporadically before and we just got lucky on the bots :-)
[22:26:00] <benh> test_install_valid, also only if I'm running all rustpkg tests and not that one specifically, and what i changed is that i replaced mkdtemp with something that returns a struct that wraps a path and also the functions between mkdtemp and that test accordingly... hm
[22:26:15] <tjc> benh: try it with RUST_THREADS=1 and let me know what happens
[22:30:58] <benh> well, it fails more reliably now
[22:31:11] <benh> with: task '<unnamed>' failed at 'called `Result::unwrap()` on `Err` value: error opening /tmp/r8WnkOky7Z0Nzu2gtemp_workspace/rustpkg_db.json: No such file or directory'
[22:31:18] <tjc> benh: hmm
[22:31:56] <tjc> benh: rustpkg_db.json is the workcache database. each test should have its own, basically...
[22:32:04] <tjc> but there *could* be a bug where the same one gets re-used for different tests...
[22:32:14] <tjc> benh: can you gist a diff of your changes to the code?
[22:32:32] <benh> I suspect I am doing my RAII wrong and it's getting deleted early, let me see if making that more explicit fixes it
[22:32:44] <benh> it's a big diff because you have a lot of tests there!
[22:33:06] <tjc> benh: that's ok -- actually, mostly I want to see the diff for the test that fails, but it can't hurt to see the whole thing :-)
[22:33:20] <tjc> it's also big because the test runner isn't that great right now and there's still boilerplate code :-)
[22:33:40] <benh> http://ix.io/8pA
[22:34:11] <benh> I might have gotten tangled up with the path components being popped, hm
[22:36:06] <benh> http://ix.io/8pB here is some RUST_LOG=rustpkg output for that test
[22:36:25] <benh> Maybe those paths look obviously wrong to you? :)
[22:36:58] <tjc> benh: it looks right to me -- let me see if I understand...
[22:36:59] *** Joins: jdm (jdm@moz-25D04F84.zone16.bethere.co.uk)
[22:37:13] <tjc> you changed mk_temp_workspace to return a pair (a, b) where a is the workspace, and b is the package dir, which is a subdirectory of the workspace
[22:37:19] <tjc> before, it just returned b, so the code called pop() twice on it
[22:37:26] <tjc> now, it doesn't need to pop() because it has the actual workspace
[22:37:33] <tjc> let me look at the debug output
[22:37:48] <benh> yeah, that is what i figured. it's not very elegant with the tuple :(
[22:38:04] <tjc> It is an improvement to not pop() things wantonly, though, I knew that was ugly :-)
[22:40:52] <tjc> benh: Actually, can you run it again with RUST_LOG=rustpkg,extra::workcache and paste the results again?

[22:42:15] <tjc> benh: the thing that's different about that test, and also test_install_invalid, is both of those call directly into the rustpkg library
[22:42:16] *** Joins: rusti (rusti@moz-54F7FD49.cpe.net.cable.rogers.com)
[22:42:27] <tjc> Later I realized that's unsafe b/c tests are interleaved and the tests might change directories
[22:42:30] <tjc> so all the other tests shell out to rustpkg
[22:42:54] <tjc> But, off the top of my head, I can't see that that's mattering here. Usually there's a debug statement at the beginning saying what the name of the workcache DB is, and I'm not seeing it here
[22:42:55] <tjc> which is odd
[22:43:10] <tjc> benh: in the meantime, you could #[ignore] test_install_valid and test_install_invalid just to see if everything works then
[22:43:30] <benh> I'm running the test via "RUST_THREADS=1 RUST_LOG=rustpkg,extra::workcache x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/stage2/test/rustpkgtest-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu test_install_valid", is that correct?
[22:44:01] <tjc> benh: yes
[22:45:06] <benh> Just from looking at the fn test_install_valid, the second-to-last line is "debug2!("bench = {}", ...) and then it only asserts on that path's non-existence, and I see the bench = line in the output and _then_ it fails, so uh, does the test spawn another task that lives longer than the raii wrapper that deletes the temporary directory?
[22:45:18] <tjc> benh: I just had an idea
[22:45:31] <tjc> benh: the workcache context (that's defined in extra::workcache) has a destructor
[22:45:39] <tjc> that serializes the rustpkg_db.json file to disk
[22:45:39] <benh> ah!
[22:45:45] <tjc> I wonder if that one is running second
[22:45:49] <tjc> and your temp dir destructor is running first

[22:46:31] <tjc> of course, this wouldn't happen in any of the other tests, because in all the tests but 2, rustpkg gets run in a whole separate process
[22:46:58] <tjc> that's a cool bug. well, assuming my guess is right :-)
[22:48:22] <aatch> Epic race condition
[22:48:36] <tjc> it's actually not a race condition in this case! I think not, anyway
[22:48:38] <tjc> it's deterministic

[23:02:43] <benh> tjc: I think the issue is that the workcache database lives in another task or something?
[23:03:11] <benh> so its destructor runs whenever, not when the local variable that vaguely references it via a channel itself dies

[23:46:43] <tjc> I know it wasn't correctly marking the db as clean

[23:47:24] <benh> I didn't exactly fix it, setting it in the test is just a hack :v
[23:47:40] <tjc> Oh, in the test
[23:47:42] <benh> the issue is probably that somehow the database gets dropped after the test finishes and has deleted its temp directory
[23:47:43] <tjc> well, that's okay for now
[23:47:47] <tjc> I'll fix it for real later :-)
[23:48:01] <tjc> Right, that's what I think the issue is too
[23:48:08] <tjc> I would rather confirm that that's what's really happening, but...
[23:48:15] <tjc> don't spend *too* much time if you don't want to :-)
[23:48:23] <benh> there's a call to task::spawn in workcache.rs and that's good enough for me to say "non-determinism" and shrug ;)
