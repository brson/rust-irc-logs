[00:43:09] <pcwalton> I kinda wish Larrabee had become a thing
[00:43:36] <pcwalton> Intel didn't know it at the time but Larrabee may well have been the ultimate Web rendering device
[00:43:51] * gw never understood how larrabee could work from the high level docs, given the number of memory ports
[00:44:03] <pcwalton> yeah, I dunno
[00:44:08] <njn> gw: https://github.com/servo/servo/commit/c1600934361d48cfeedf04b419bd811bc70c48c0;  apologies for the messiness
[00:44:09] <pcwalton> really wide buses I guess
[00:44:35] <njn> gw: |User| is the type of the thing passed between Rust and C code
[00:44:56] <njn> gw: it's created and passed to the C code in FontContextHandle::new
[00:45:06] <Ms2ger> How coincidental, I heard someone talk about Larrabee just today over lunch :)
[00:45:08] <njn> gw: and the ft_alloc callback gets it passed back
[00:45:13] <pcwalton> heh
[00:45:33] <njn> gw: line 40 is crashing reliably after a few hundreds calls to ft_alloc
[00:45:47] <njn> gw: also, my (*user).size field is being overwritten with pointer-like values sometimes
[00:45:52] <njn> gw: it's a mess :/
[00:46:24] <njn> gw: I've done something very similar to this in Firefox, so I trust FreeType is not touching the void* thing at all
[00:48:29] <gw> njn: it looks like user will get dropped at the end of FontContextHandle::new() when it goes out of scope, leaving your pointer as dangling memory? you might like to impl drop on your user type to confirm that. you probably need something like https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/mem/fn.forget.html so that the box doesn't get dropped

[00:49:52] <njn> gw: so I am expecting to never free the User struct; similar to how the struct_FT_MemoryRec_ is never freed
[00:50:18] <gw> njn: yep, try the mem::forget and see how that goes 
[00:50:30] <njn> gw: so the only thing I do with |user| is this: |user: &mut *user as *mut User as *mut c_void,|
[00:50:44] <njn> gw: I guess Rust doesn't consider that as passing ownership or anything
[00:50:52] <njn> gw: so it destroys |user| at the end of the function
[00:50:54] <njn> ?
[00:50:56] <Ms2ger> Is it a Box?
[00:51:01] <njn> yes

[00:51:45] <njn> (we were discussing that yesterday as one option)
[00:51:55] <njn> gw: ok, hopefully this'll get things working
[00:52:26] <gw> Ms2ger: njn: yep, I guess it makes sense to use that in your ::new function (but stick with the pointer in the callbacks) 
[00:52:29] <njn> Ms2ger: but I think I *don't* want to use from_raw in the callbacks, because I need that void* thing to stick around

[04:11:50] <njn> a lot of this subtle pointer stuff doesn't seem to be really documented anywhere

[04:12:13] -playbot- ()
[04:12:29] <Manishearth> njn: you're not supposed to use it :p
[04:12:44] <Manishearth> njn: on a more serious note, I think it is documented somewhere in the ffi section, if not, I'll look into it
[04:13:01] <Manishearth> njn: note that you should *still* be careful about ownership over ffi boundaries
[04:13:39] <Manishearth> Rust will make assumptions about the data (e.g. an &T will never be mutated) which may be changed if ffi has access to some raw pointers
[04:13:56] <njn> whoa, the Rust Book looks completely different to when I last looked at it
[04:14:10] <Manishearth> though in your case  I think I can guess what you're trying to do and in that situation it would be okay
[04:14:15] <njn> Manishearth: the pointer passed to the C code is not touched by that C code; it only ever passes it back to Rust code
[04:14:20] <Manishearth> awesome
[04:14:42] <Manishearth> njn: now make sure the rust code doesn't do anything strange to it either ;p
[04:15:23] <Manishearth> njn: btw, when you have time I'd like a review on the gfx part of HeapSizeOf
[04:15:30] <Manishearth> in case I messed something up
[04:15:35] <njn> Manishearth: yep

[14:40:33] <mwu> jga: I'm just trying to determine how hard this will be to rebase over
[14:40:38] <jga> mwu: cool, but we still have to use a generic function or repeat the is_clamp/is_enforce_range branches in all the FromJSVal or implement a macro
[14:40:47] <jga> mwu: it will be easy
[14:42:02] <mwu> hmmm
[14:42:07] <jga> ToIntXX has the same signature for all the functions (with ret type T) so we can still use it in the generic convert_int_from_jsval/handle

[14:47:18] <jga> mwu: yeah, for the default behavior we are using SM functions, but when we need clamp or enforce_range we have to do the math from the double float
[14:47:59] <mwu> jga: it should be faster to clamp a i32/u32 though?
[14:48:13] <shinglyu> Hi, is there anyway I can tranform a cssparser::color::Color to azure::azure::struct__AzColor?
[14:48:17] <mwu> and the fastpaths will directly operate on a i32/u32 in many cases
[14:48:45] <mwu> unless we know this data will always be stored as a double
[14:49:18] <mwu> jga: so I guess for this case we can probably just directly implement the fastpath inside conversions.rs

[14:52:22] <shinglyu> I need to use its color attribute for flooding the shadow with the specified color

[14:54:41] <jga> I don't know very much about javascript numbers more than I always get bad results when I try to do math in javascript
[14:55:02] <jga> so I thought Number/double float is the generic
[14:55:08] <jga> s/thought/assumed
[14:55:21] <SimonSapin> shinglyu: if you have `box-shadow: 0 0 currentColor`, it should have the color from the `color` property on the same element, which is known by ComputedValues
[14:55:42] <Ms2ger> SpiderMonkey has an optimization where it stores integer floats as i32
[14:55:48] <SimonSapin> https://github.com/servo/servo/blob/d87af8ac52b16a3763420fb7ad8fb45af785a23b/components/style/properties.mako.rs#L5178-L5183

[15:38:56] <SimonSapin> repeat a few times
