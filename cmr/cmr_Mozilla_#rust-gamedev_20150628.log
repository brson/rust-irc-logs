[01:59:14] <aatch> u32 -> u64 I mean.

[02:03:45] <zofrex> SpaceManiac: but "for e in window" isn't iterating over events... the type of e is Window
[02:04:02] <aatch> JustAPerson, pretty much. the change from 32-bit to 64-bit instructions can increase code size though. I doubt that it's a measurable difference though.
[02:04:11] <aatch> JustAPerson, at least, not on a 64-bit platform.
[02:04:23] <zofrex> pierre_m: I started out with enough of this to just make a window and clear the screen: https://github.com/PistonDevelopers/Piston-Tutorials/tree/master/getting-started
[02:04:45] <pierre_m> ah, that much i had.
[02:04:47] <zofrex> then I saw this and started simplifying https://github.com/PistonDevelopers/piston-examples/blob/master/src/sprite.rs
[02:05:09] <zofrex> and then I simplified even further based on this http://www.piston.rs/
[02:05:20] <JustAPerson> aatch: oh yea, the instructions gain a prefix
[02:05:48] <pierre_m> first example was where i had gotten to.  Updated to the latest version of piston and that example broke.  second link you gave has the correct format for the window function now, thanks
[02:06:18] <SpaceManiac> zofrex: I think it's a borrow checker trickery
[02:06:21] <zofrex> this is where I'm up to https://gist.github.com/anonymous/aabfbfc29e275fdbb0e0
[02:06:49] <aatch> JustAPerson, I'm pretty sure modern processors don't actually get slowed down by prefixes though, so it's literally just the "more code to load from memory" thing, which isn't likely to be an issue given pipelining.
[02:06:59] <zofrex> SpaceManiac: ok... but I dunno how to apply what I see in that first example I linked to the code I have in that gist
[02:07:30] <zofrex> my understanding is I have to handle events, sometimes 'update the game' events and sometimes 'render the game' events but the piston_window examples seem to be rendering unconditionally
[02:08:44] <zofrex> oh, and in order to be a good IRC citizen, the actual problem I want to solve: I want to make the plane move around on the screen when I press keyboard buttons ^^

[02:11:03] <pierre_m> zofrex, you're looking to split out the render code to be separate from the events handling code?  or just add in keyboard handling code?  or both?
[02:13:42] <zofrex> immediate objective: keyboard handling code
[02:18:58] *** Quits: Wild_Cat (Max@moz-msb.ief.175.108.IP) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[02:22:03] <pierre_m> just found this poking through the "Games made with rust" list.  https://github.com/Coeuvre/rust-pong/blob/master/src/app.rs
[02:22:14] <pierre_m> line 119
[02:23:57] <FreeFull> "fn key_press(&mut self, args: KeyPressArgs) {"?
[02:24:58] <pierre_m> that was at zofrex.  he was looking for keyboard handling code....as am i.
[02:25:22] <zofrex> that's using the SDL backend which I think is making things different
[02:25:31] <zofrex> at least, I can't find the render loop or where those methods get called from
[02:25:50] <zofrex> I think https://github.com/PistonDevelopers/piston-examples/blob/master/src/draw_state.rs holds my answers
[02:26:02] <zofrex> "if let Some(Button::Keyboard(Key::A)) = e.press_args() {"
[02:26:12] <zofrex> I still don't understand how it works... but it looks like it will work
[02:27:30] <Dabo> if you're matching multiple keystrokes, e.press(|arg| if let Button::Keyboard(key) = arg { match key { Key::A => ..., Key::B => ..., }})
[02:28:04] <niconii> zofrex: if you're confused about `if let` in general: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/if-let.html
[02:28:58] <pierre_m> thanks zofrex....pardon my blindness there.
[02:29:12] <zofrex> niconii: the part that's confusing me is the part where all types of events have .render_args() as a method. I couldn't figure out how that was the case from the source code.

[02:36:50] <Dabo> zofrex, piston has a huge system of traits, one for practically each event type
[02:37:05] <Dabo> Each event which could *possibly* be an event type, implements the trait for that event type

[02:38:05] <zofrex> thanks Dabo 
[02:39:04] <Dabo> also, side note, while the *_args() methods don't really have that much overhead, they do have a slight overhead over using the methods like .press() which accept a closure and run it with a borrowed argument, rather than copying the argument
[02:39:14] <Dabo> really not that much difference though
[02:39:46] <zofrex> oh I didn't know about .press()
[02:40:30] <zofrex> ohhhhhh
[02:40:41] <zofrex> ok yeah that made some other stuff I saw make sense
[02:40:43] <Dabo> each event type declares both kinds of methods - they are practically exactly the same, .press_args() really just calls .press() and returns a copied argument

[02:49:59] <zofrex> yeah I've been diving into the source a little
[02:50:33] <zofrex> one last question for the time being... I have events for buttons being pressed and released, but what's the nicest way to "do X while key Z is held down"
[02:52:20] <aatch> zofrex, there are separate "key down" and "key up" events, so just track those.
[02:52:52] <aatch> zofrex, key down - set flag, key up - unset flag, do thing while flag is set.

[16:22:36] <ecogiko> Hello! I am learning opengl with glium and I have a question about the index buffer. Is it better to rebind the buffer between draw calls to draw 2 separate trianglestrips or use a triangle list with extra vertexes?
[16:25:25] <tomaka> less draw calls = better
[16:25:36] <tomaka> but for a small amount of data this is negligible

[17:51:06] <tomaka> I'm not sure about what I'm going to tell
[17:51:22] <tomaka> but the problem I think comes from the fact that you can't change the pixel format of a window once it's been created
[17:51:42] <tomaka> so when you're in windowed mode you can use more or less whatever format you want
[17:51:50] <tomaka> since it's handled by the compositor
[17:52:11] <tomaka> but in fullscreen you have to match what is supported in one of the predefined fullscreen mdoes
[17:52:29] <tomaka> so an existing window may not have any fullscreen mdoe compatible with it

[18:06:22] <eddyb> cods: .next_pow2() is a method. probably not with that name though
[18:06:46] <eddyb> .next_power_of_two() apparently

[18:20:52] <kagami> Why is this important? It's called only once from build_font_image
[18:21:22] <kagami> And you call build_font_image only once...
[18:22:18] <cods> indeed, it's not important. It's just that a direct way might be better (might be less error prone.) Especially if Rust already provide it.
[18:22:22] <cods> but it was not about performance
[18:22:40] <cods> (sorry for bad english)

[20:48:06] <aljosa> are mobile platforms a target or does it work right now but there isn't any actual effort and it's mostly a desktop focused project(s)?

[21:29:04] <RC9> and rip from spybotics nightfall incident
[21:29:23] <sp3d> RC9: that game was pure dope
[21:29:51] <sp3d> good luck if you're making anything similar :D
[21:30:16] <RC9> i wanna make a roguelike version
[21:30:24] <RC9> i was messign around with heightmap ideas and stuff
[21:30:30] <sp3d> neat
[21:30:30] <RC9> and then i remembered i actually love spybotics
[21:30:34] <RC9> and we need another game in that style
[21:30:43] <RC9> at the same time just remaking it would be boring
