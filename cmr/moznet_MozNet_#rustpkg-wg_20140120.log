[17:47:21] <wycats> a wild rustpkg working group
[17:47:25] <cmr> hi
[17:47:36] <cmr> I made this channel like a billion years ago.
[17:47:43] <cmr> and no one ever joined it :p
[17:48:16] <cmr> (it's the spiritual successor to #rustdoc-wg)
[18:37:59] <o11c> I wish I had time to actuall work on rust
[18:38:21] <o11c> I have a good idea of *what* it should do though.
[18:38:48] <o11c> Can we agree that current rustpkg is *confusing*, not just lacking?
[18:38:50] <cmr> yes.
[18:38:57] <cmr> it's going to be dismantled.
[18:39:00] <o11c> I think install in ~/.local is the best default
[18:39:11] <o11c> install in . would be an explicit option
