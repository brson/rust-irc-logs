[05:09:12] <vadimcn> acrichto: looks like Rust build scripts end up using Window's version of "find" command.  My local mingw inserts its' own bin directory before %system32% , but I suspect on build bots this isn't true.
[05:09:17] <vadimcn> any idea why?
[05:11:44] <acrichto> vadimcn: that's always happened on the bots, unsure of how to fix it
[05:14:02] <vadimcn> can you log in and check what PATH looks like in msys shell?
[05:16:35] <acrichto> how would I do that?
[05:16:37] <acrichto> check the path
[05:17:04] <vadimcn> echo $PATH
[05:17:06] <klutzy> maybe `echo $PATH` would provide some hints
[05:17:06] <Luqman> you can see PATH in the stdio logs from the builder
[05:17:30] <klutzy> and $MSYSTEM (my msys' /etc/profile uses the variable for PATH setting)
[05:17:51] <acrichto> msystem == MINGW32
[05:17:55] <acrichto> path is lots of stuff
[05:18:02] <acrichto> no copy/paste, what are you looking for specifically?
[05:18:12] <klutzy> is /bin top of PATH?
[05:18:25] <vadimcn> PATH=C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Resource Kits\Tools\;C:\Windows\system32;C:\Windows;C:\Windows\System32\Wbem;C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\;C:\Program Files\SlikSvn\bin\;c:\Python27;c:\Python27\Scripts;c:\mingw\bin;c:\mingw\msys\1.0\bin;c:\Program Files (x86)\Git\bin;c:\Program Files (x86)\Inno Setup 5\
[05:18:32] <acrichto> no, . and /mingw/bin are both before that
[05:18:48] <klutzy> my /etc/profile applies: export PATH=".:/usr/local/bin:/mingw/bin:/bin:$PATH"
[05:18:56] <klutzy> only if $MSYSTEM == MINGW32
[05:19:23] <klutzy> maybe buildbot msys is just old and has different configs :-/
[05:19:25] <vadimcn> (this is from bot build log)
[05:19:35] <acrichto> sec
[05:20:19] <acrichto> http://i.imgur.com/FXTCLVh.png
[05:21:04] <klutzy> hmm, /bin is added before others..
[05:21:16] <klutzy> it would be horrible if /bin/find.exe doesn't exist
[05:21:55] <vadimcn> acrichto: how is make launched? 
[05:22:00] <acrichto> /bin/find.exe exists
[05:22:02] <acrichto> vadimcn: I have no idea
[05:22:04] <acrichto> buildbot magic
[05:22:18] <acrichto> what's the problem?
[05:23:05] <klutzy> acrichto: seems like 1) buildbot doesn't use /etc/profile for some reason, 2) and /mingw/bin is hardcoded in PATH
[05:23:36] <acrichto> yes, but why is not using the right find a problem?
[05:23:45] <vadimcn> Problem is that during build PATH is what I pasted above.   So "find" means %system32%\find, which has completely different parameters and output.
[05:23:58] <acrichto> yes, so make clean doesn't do as much as it should
[05:24:01] <acrichto> but why is that a problem?
[05:24:14] <klutzy> because find is at /bin, not /mingw/bin.
[05:24:29] <klutzy> buildbot doesn't see them because PATH doesn't have /bin
[05:24:51] <vadimcn> acrichto:  check windows build log on try
[05:24:53] <acrichto> yes, that is why the buildbots are not using the right 'find', but again, that is not the problem
[05:25:10] <acrichto> this has never been a problem unless things need to get cleaned and they're not getting cleaned, is that the issue here?
[05:25:35] <klutzy> acrichto: ah, on `make`: rustrt.dll is not rebuilt because some rt code is just disappeard, not changed
[05:25:40] <vadimcn> acrichto: it complains about undefined symbols in rust_cxx_glue.cpp, but I;ve deleted this file!
[05:26:08] <acrichto> sounds like you should trigger a rebuild of rustrt.dll
[05:26:17] <vadimcn> my current hypothesis is that linker finds stale rustrt.lib somewhere...
[05:26:22] <acrichto> like it's not the best solution but I have no idea how to configure buildbot on windows
[05:26:31] <klutzy> s/.dll/.lib/g, sorry
[05:27:32] <klutzy> acrichto: so I added a line at rt/clean.mk to remove .lib properly, but it doesn't work due to wrong find.exe
[05:27:38] <vadimcn> acrichto: how do I rebuild rustrt if make doesn't want to rebuild it?
[05:28:01] <acrichto> klutzy: yes, I know, I hit that in the past, but again, I have no idea how to debug this for just the windows buildbot
[05:28:06] <klutzy> vadimcn: maybe making rust_cxx_glue.cpp empty, not removing?
[05:28:08] <acrichto> vadimcn: modify a rt file
[05:28:21] <acrichto> although it should have been rebuilt
[05:28:25] <acrichto> they should be gated on makefile changes

[05:28:51] <vadimcn> acrichto: ... and logs show that it is rebuilt

[05:29:12] <klutzy> acrichto: I'm worried that broken `make clean` may lead to obscure failures in general
[05:29:29] <klutzy> acrichto: maybe we just replace "find" by something else?
[05:29:52] <vadimcn> klutzy: I think that .bashrc gets processed only if launched with -l parameter e.g. from C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\msys.bat
[05:30:17] <vadimcn> if buildbot just spawns make, it will inherit current PATH
[05:35:34] <acrichto> make clean should not matter here
[05:35:37] <acrichto> there is another bug
[05:35:51] <acrichto> rust_cxx_glue.o should not be getting linked in to rustrt.lib
[05:38:01] <vadimcn> acrichto: where does it come from?   My change deletes rust_cxx_glue.cpp

[05:38:39] <acrichto> rcx
[05:38:40] <acrichto> rcs
[05:38:42] <acrichto> that adds files
[05:38:45] <acrichto> it does not remove the archive
[05:38:51] <acrichto> the old archive is sticking around
[05:38:57] <acrichto> which has rust_cxx_glue in it
[05:39:32] <acrichto> so why not have "export PATH=/bin:$PATH" in the makefile?
[05:41:09] <vadimcn> I dunno... what if it's not /bin on some machine?
[05:41:26] <acrichto> I thought path ignored nonexistent directories
[05:41:27] <vadimcn> acrichto: if build bot source checked in somehwere?
[05:41:39] <acrichto> also all build machines are setup correctly except the bots apparently
[05:41:47] <acrichto> hm
[05:42:05] <acrichto> yes but it's private
[05:42:09] <acrichto> passwords and whatnot
[05:42:12] <klutzy> theoretically it causes problems if /bin exists but it is not mingw one :p
[05:43:27] <acrichto>             if "win" in props["buildername"]:
[05:43:27] <acrichto>                 return {"MACHTYPE": "i686-pc-msys",
[05:43:27] <acrichto>                         "MSYSTEM": "MINGW32"}
[05:43:34] <acrichto> should I add some path thing in there?
[05:44:08] <klutzy> is it place for `export VAR=val`?
[05:44:24] <acrichto> dunno, just guessing
[05:44:37] <acrichto> looks like it though
