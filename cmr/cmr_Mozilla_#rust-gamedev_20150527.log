[05:59:36] <huon> panic safety *is* a concern
[05:59:39] <tomaka> which triggers wrong behaviors, and can trigger crashes with unsafe code
[06:00:01] <huon> e.g. Vec goes to great pains to be as panic safe as possible
[06:00:33] <huon> (the only panic "unsafe" things I know are Vec skipping destructors sometimes)
[06:00:44] <tomaka> yeah, but my point is that panic-safety should be enforced by the language itself and by panic-catching mechanisms
[06:00:55] <tomaka> not by unsafe code writers
[06:01:25] *** Joins: p1start (p1start@moz-nftjhe.org)
[06:01:26] <tomaka> if something as simple as Vec becomes incredibly hard to write to be panic safe
[06:01:47] <tomaka> then I can't imagine writing something complex in unsafe code
[06:01:56] <huon> I don't think it's at all reasonable/possible for panic safety to be enforcable at the language level in the presence of unsafe code
[06:02:08] <huon> it's kinda the point of `unsafe` :P
[06:02:44] <huon> in any case, Vec isn't incredibly complicated/hard
[06:02:48] <tomaka> I initially thought that mutex poisoning was here to enforce panic safety
[06:02:49] <huon> it is just quite careful
[06:03:00] <XMPPwocky> maybe debug builds should have every 500th function call randomly panic, so you catch panic-safety issues early

[06:03:04] <XMPPwocky> ha ha only serious
[06:03:08] <tomaka> and after I opened an issue about panic safety, thread::scoped was changed to not return a result
[06:03:22] <tomaka> again for panic safety
[06:03:28] <huon> XMPPwocky: panic insertion is definitely a desirable fuzzing technique
[06:03:39] *** Joins: canhtak (jeremy@moz-kcs.u0t.149.5.IP)
[06:04:06] <tomaka> now I got answered that ignoring mutex poisoning by calling into_inner on the PoisonError wasn't unsafe
[06:04:16] <tomaka> even though that violates panic safety
[06:04:24] <tomaka> I wonder why we have poisoning in the first place then
[06:04:53] <huon> it still takes unsafe code to trigger unsafety with mutex poisoning
[06:05:03] <huon> and, a helpful "guide" is still useful
[06:05:07] <XMPPwocky> does it not take it without it?
[06:05:20] <huon> there was a *lot* of discussion about this issue fwiw
[06:05:40] <huon> (I wasn't a part of most of it, though, so I can't really offer any specifics)

[06:17:14] <tomaka> but seriously, I'd like to see what the design related to panic-safety is
[06:18:03] <Amaranth> The destructor thing is really sad but I can't think of a way to guarantee it in a world where Rc exists
[06:18:44] <tomaka> by the way, I have an arithmetic overflow panic in alloc/rc.rs after I call mem::forget in one of glium's tests
[06:19:10] <tomaka> since there's a lot of unsafe code I can't really report that, but I'm sure there's a bug somewhere
[06:19:51] <Amaranth> Are you overflowing the reference count because you're throwing away the handles so they can't decrement it?

[06:21:27] <tomaka> The test writes to a buffer in memory, and since I have unsafe code I thought that maybe it writes over the reference counter (which would mean that my code is fucked up pretty hard)
[06:21:38] <tomaka> but even when I remove the writing, it's still there
[06:21:49] <mindtree> Hey all, does anyone have any idea why PortAudio's non-blocking stream might segfault when glutin's cocoa backend calls `NSApp().nextEventMatchingMask_untilDate_inMode_dequeue_` ? I have no idea where to start looking, but the problem seems that the PortAudio stream consistently works fine until that cocoa method is called for the first time :/
[06:21:55] <huon> tomaka: do you really make 4 billion handles to that Rc "accidentally"?
[06:22:03] <tomaka> huon: definitely not
[06:22:15] <tomaka> it's when decrementing the Rc
[06:22:27] <tomaka> the backtrace shows that it's during the cleanup at the end of the test

[06:22:37] <huon> wait, underflow?
[06:22:39] <tomaka> yeah
[06:22:53] <tomaka> Yeah I said overflow because the panic message says overflow
[06:22:57] <tomaka> but it's an underflow
[06:23:04] <huon> sounds like you might be unsafely copying a Rc without calling clone?
[06:23:26] <mindtree> if anyone wants to take a look, here's where i'm tracking the issue https://github.com/jeremyletang/rust-portaudio/issues/88#issuecomment-105428012
[06:23:31] <tomaka> well, the exact same code without mem::forget works fine
[06:23:41] <tomaka> (again, I'm just forgetting a struct that contains references and plain data)
[06:23:59] <tomaka> and there are other tests where I mem::forget the exact same struct, and it works as well
[06:24:33] <huon> without having access to more details, that sounds like there may be semi-unrelated undefined behaviour, that the forget-or-not happens to trigger-or-not
[06:25:14] <tomaka> there's a possibility that this is related to the double drop bug that was fixed a few days ago
[06:25:37] <tomaka> however this bug only happens with OpenGL 4.5 drivers, because depending on the OpenGL version my code takes a different path
[06:25:55] <tomaka> so I can't test this on my dev machine

[06:34:53] <Layl> is this replacing png functionality with C code, or with an external crate that implements the png format
[06:35:09] <tomaka> no
[06:35:30] <tomaka> it's replacing the PNG functionnality with an external crate, and this external crate depends on the flate2 crate, which is C code

[06:52:45] <Layl> I long for the day that there will be rust libraries with C bindings rather than C libraries with rust bindings
[06:52:52] <tomaka> fkaa: freetype as well
[06:53:03] <Layl> hell yea freetype needs a pure rust implementation

[06:53:51] <tomaka> fkaa: I think freetype supports basically every format, but you can probably drop some

[06:54:33] <fkaa> not even sure what freetype does
[06:54:36] <Layl> I would personally be happy with just ttf support
[06:54:47] <fkaa> does it interface with os-level libraries for font rasterizing or does it do everything itself?
[06:54:53] <Layl> freetype loads in fonts and turns them into bitmaps and kerning info
[06:55:03] <jpernst> i think freetype does its own rendering, but i'm not 100% sure
[06:55:37] <Layl> honestly you could port libraries by yanking file by file every .c file out and replacing it with rust

[06:59:04] <jpernst> oh, cool
[07:00:41] <kagami> "there are 25 standards...." <- no, now there is one. Opus easily beats all over lossy/speex codecs. If xiph releases better codec (they mentioned that they know how it can be optimized a bit on a recent Daala presentation) then everyone will use Opus replacement. But now it's Opus.
[07:00:53] <kagami> other*
[07:01:04] <Layl> of course Opus is the one standard you need anymore.... unless you want lossless
[07:01:07] <jpernst> yeah, the only thing opus can't do is lossless, but that's a small price to pay

[10:19:48] <nwin> eddyb: I also borrowed heavily from your ideas ;)
[10:19:53] <eddyb> nwin: but would you reuse BGR bytes for the previous scanline?

[10:20:46] <eddyb> cmr: it also bummed me to find out that somehow my benchmarks were broken when I had beaten libpng
[10:20:47] <nwin> eddyb: at the moment I’m just keeping the previous decoded line 
[10:20:58] <eddyb> nwin: yeah, that's suboptimal
[10:21:06] <eddyb> cmr: though it should still be faster than libpng for some images
[10:21:57] <nwin> eddyb: yes but it should be easy to adapt the interface…I just wanted to get it to work…

[10:24:53] <nwin> eddyb in case somebody feeds an image with a width of (1 << 31) pixels you somehow need to keep the previously decoded data around. The png filtering makes it difficult to resize the line on-the-fly...
[10:25:39] <eddyb> nwin: huh?

[11:41:54] <tomaka> hmmmmm
[11:41:59] <tomaka> I have a stupid question
[11:42:05] <tomaka> Let's say I read a huffman-encoded bits stream
[11:42:28] <tomaka> Let's say that the next byte in the stream is 0x10
[11:42:38] <tomaka> if I read one bit, then one bit, I get 0 then 1, right?
[11:43:01] <eddyb> hehehehe
[11:43:09] <eddyb> let me read my implementation
[11:43:09] <tomaka> >_<
[11:43:29] <eddyb> oh I ran a test and forgot to check the result
[11:43:30] <tomaka> I'm reading image's implementation and it's confusing
[11:43:38] <tomaka> because if you read one bit then one bit, you get 0 then 1
[11:43:43] <tomaka> but if you read two bits you get 0x10
[11:43:47] <tomaka> I'd expect 0x01
[11:43:47] <cmr> tomaka: 3 zeros, 1 bit, 4 zeros.
[11:43:47] <eddyb> wat
[11:44:03] <cmr> Unless you are using 0x10 to mean binary and not hexidecimal, which would be very confusing and you shouldn't do that.
[11:44:14] <tomaka> ooops yeah I meant binary
[11:44:23] <tomaka> I meant 0b10
[11:44:23] <cmr> :P
[11:44:55] <eddyb> so a byte 0x10 would feed into the state unchanged
[11:45:07] <cmr> it depends on the endianness of the source data?
[11:45:08] <tomaka> according to image's implementation, if the byte is 0b10, then reading the next bit gives 0 and the next 1
[11:45:13] <WindowsBunny> Layl: Oh, I should go work on them
[11:45:17] <WindowsBunny> Layl: Thanks for reminding me
[11:45:25] <tomaka> the endianess doesn't matter, endianess is between bytes not bits
[11:45:37] <eddyb> and I'm taking from the lowest bits
[11:45:41] <eddyb> 0, then 1
[11:45:51] <eddyb> if you take two at once, 0b10
[11:45:51] <tomaka> thanks :o
[11:45:51] <WindowsBunny> Amaranth: Windows requires that the amount of commited memory be <= ram + paging file
[11:45:54] <tomaka> ah
[11:45:58] <tomaka> that's the confusing thing
[11:46:01] <eddyb> tomaka: yeah, image's implementation matches what I do
[11:46:18] <eddyb> well, the bits are ordered from LSB
[11:46:25] <tomaka> if the huffman code is 0b10, it's supposed to match 0b01
[11:46:26] <eddyb> so 0b10 is [0, 1]
[11:46:30] <WindowsBunny> Amaranth: You can reserve as much as you have address space though
[11:46:37] <eddyb> 0b1101 is [1, 0, 1, 1]
[11:46:39] <WindowsBunny> You just can't overcommit
[11:46:44] <tomaka> Yeah yeah
[11:46:57] <tomaka> but if the huffman code is 0b10, that means it read a 1 then a 0
[11:47:07] <tomaka> so it should match the start of the byte 0b01
[11:47:52] <tomaka> on one hand image's implementation looks wrong to me, but on the other hand it wouldn't work at all with such a critical mistake
[11:47:53] <eddyb>             let base = BIT_REV_U8[(code << (8 - bits)) as usize];

[11:50:56] <tomaka> so I don't really know how image's implementation works
[11:51:21] <eddyb> does it have a single bit reversal function?
[11:51:29] <eddyb> (don't tell me it manually loops all over the place)
[11:51:54] <tomaka> ohh looks like it does reverse something when creating the table
[11:52:31] <tomaka> I'll just stick to my manual but safe implementation before going crazy with optimisations
[11:53:08] <tomaka> step 1: write things that work, step 2: write tests, step 3: optimise
[11:53:30] <eddyb> sometimes the manual method is harder than the optimized one

[12:16:51] <kagami> Layl: what's the problem with log?
[12:17:19] <Layl> the problem is that it's invisible if you don't know about it and that it interferes with your own logging if you do

[12:21:59] <cmr> I think it's incredibly useful, especially for collecting debug logs from remote clients on a crash or bug report...
[12:22:54] <kagami> Layl: I think we can comment this lines and move log to dev-dependencies once library will be mature enough.
[12:22:56] <ytain> what I would like is to have a crash reporter module so that it can save the logs and stack trace that can be bundled in one file and allow the user to send it back to me by several means like email or web
[12:23:33] <Layl> I can see that it's very useful cmr, I guess I should just get into a better mindset with things like this

[12:28:05] <tomaka> yeah yeah
[12:28:14] <tomaka> like I said, first make it work
[12:28:18] <eddyb> the 9-bit limit is for the static table

[14:13:35] <RCIX> kvark, mostly i want to apply the tutorials tomaka linked me
[14:13:50] <fkaa> not sure how to pronounce it
[14:13:51] <tomaka> RCIX: glutin != glium
[14:13:55] <kvark> RCIX: tomaka probably dragged you into glium
[14:14:02] <RCIX> he did :D
[14:14:09] <kvark> Layl: oh, where is the iffy code?
[14:14:13] <RCIX> and now im confused lol
[14:14:33] <Layl> kvark the thing is any gfx_text renderers require a factory to be given to them by value
[14:14:36] <tomaka> RCIX: so there are two parts, creating an opengl window and executing opengl functions
[14:14:40] <Layl> so that means I need to create a new factory
[14:14:41] <RCIX> ok so all i know is piston uses glutin
[14:14:45] <kvark> Layl: the question to move create_factory down to gfx-rs has not been discussed in detail yet. Perhaps, we can do it in time for 0.6
[14:14:50] <RCIX> which is, im assuming, the former of those two
[14:14:59] <tomaka> RCIX: creating a window can be done with glutin, sdl, glfw, and in piston is generic though piston_window or something like that
[14:15:03] <Layl> then it's a bit odd that gfx_text only works with that
[14:15:25] <RCIX> ohh okay
[14:15:26] <kvark> Layl: where is it in your code?
[14:15:31] <tomaka> RCIX: executing opengl commands can be done with opengl_graphics, glium (glium alone without piston, glium_graphics with piston), gfx/gfx_graphics (same as glium for the distinciton)
[14:15:36] <Layl> kvark: just a sec finding it...
[14:15:47] <RCIX> ah ha, glium_graphics
[14:15:47] <kvark> RCIX: piston doesn't exactly use glutin, it's compatible with everything

[14:16:35] <Layl> which results in this being needed: let mut gui = phosphorus::Gui::new(&mut device, root, |d: &mut gfx_device_gl::Device| d.spawn_factory());
[14:16:41] <kvark> Layl: I see
[14:16:54] *** Quits: hhhhhhhhhh (mike@moz-969kuj.cable.virginm.net) (Quit: WeeChat 1.2)
[14:16:59] <Layl> opengl_graphics is not meant to be used directly iirc
[14:17:04] <Layl> right?
[14:17:08] <kvark> right
[14:17:23] <Layl> it's a piston backend, you CAN do it directly but you shouldn't
[14:17:30] <Layl> *use it
[14:17:56] <RCIX> unless the piston spinning-suare tutorial isnt actually directly using it, thats what it looks like im using
[14:18:09] <RCIX> square*
[14:18:17] <Layl> if you're using piston, you don't even have to think about opengl_graphics
[14:18:29] <Layl> it's like electricity, just plug it in and don't worry about it
[14:18:34] <RCIX> https://github.com/PistonDevelopers/Piston-Tutorials
[14:18:38] <RCIX> that is what i used
[14:18:59] <Layl> yea like that you're using piston's abstractions over graphics rendering
[14:19:14] <Layl> which is alright but it doesn't matter for you what backend you end up using
[14:19:23] <Layl> just pick one that happens to work the fastest on the platform
[14:19:50] <RCIX> ahh
[14:19:56] <RCIX> ok where do i read about that api :P
[14:20:15] <Layl> well, that's shown in the piston tutorials and docs
[14:20:26] <fkaa> kvark: i was summoned :o?

[14:28:23] <RCIX> okay now I'm getting somewhere - specifically, the piston graphics library on github

[14:28:54] <fkaa> i should!
[14:29:55] <fkaa> kinda wonder if ARB_texture_view can be emulated
[14:30:38] <kvark> fkaa: it didn't seem possible to me. It could be fine to return an Error from `factory.create_texture_view` or something
[14:32:04] <RCIX> and now the inevitable question: where should I start reading up to be useful for contributing to rust graphics
[14:32:17] <RCIX> er
[14:32:24] <RCIX> i suck at terminology today, apparently

[14:35:45] <fkaa> don't think i can test this, only have 4.1
[14:36:28] <kvark> texture buffers are supported on GL-3 something. texture views require 4.1, IIRC

[14:53:09] <bur_sangjun> thanks, I'm new to rust, and so I'm never sure if stuffs antiquated or I'm just not using the docs correctly
[14:53:44] <kvark> bur_sangjun: the docs are always a problem. Please feel free to ask here, surely someone will be able to help
[14:54:16] <bur_sangjun> I feel like the way that piston is modularised doesn't help for doc searching
[14:54:19] <RCIX> bur_sangjun, if you just want a running project, i recommend the piston-tutorials
[14:54:28] <bur_sangjun> as it seems to be split across several documentation pages
[14:54:59] <RCIX> piston-examples, at least last i checked, uses SDL which may require an additional install
[14:55:44] <RCIX> i've been referencing piston-examples to figure out how to do things though
[14:56:46] <bur_sangjun> Are there any good examples doing things in Glutin/OpenGL?
[14:57:43] <kvark> gl-rs has some examples but they are using glfw: https://github.com/bjz/gl-rs/blob/master/gl/examples/static_triangle.rs
[14:57:53] <RCIX> bur_sangjun, https://github.com/tomaka/glium#links-to-a-work-in-progress-tutorial for glutin

[14:59:02] <bur_sangjun> piston_window
[14:59:22] <bur_sangjun> so on a higher level it shouldn't matter in theory?
[14:59:29] <RCIX> bur_sangjun, piston uses a wrapper around graphics libraries: http://docs.piston.rs/graphics/graphics/
[14:59:33] <kvark> bur_sangjun: it does. piston_window though is tied to gfx-rs. Just "window" is the abstract one

[17:34:50] <tomaka> it's what you're supposed to use if you want to render dozens of textures without putting them in an array
[17:35:09] <WindowsBunny> tomaka: I want bindless textures :(
[17:35:13] <tomaka> if you're not familiar, in GL you're supposed to call something like glGetTexturePointer
[17:35:19] <tomaka> which returns a raw u64
[17:35:27] <tomaka> and then inside your shaders you can turn that u64 into a texture
[17:35:34] <ebfull> is there an example of using the sdl2 stuff to play audio? i need to play a sound file, but i want to use include_bytes! for it
[17:35:59] <kvark> tomaka: thanks for the info. It does sound horribly unsafe - just allowing shaders to play with GPU pointers
[17:36:20] <fkaa> tomaka: sort of like putting a texture array index with the vertex data?
[17:36:34] <tomaka> fkaa: yeah, except that you put a raw pointer instead of an index
[17:36:41] <fkaa> cool
[17:36:43] <tomaka> and that everything crashes if you put a wrong value
[17:36:55] <WindowsBunny> tomaka: memory safe crash?
[17:36:58] <WindowsBunny> or horrible crash?
[17:37:16] <tomaka> the specs say "leads to an undefined behavior and possibly a program termination"
[17:37:18] <kvark> tomaka: does the unsafety worth it? how much faster does the code get?
[17:37:29] <WindowsBunny> "undefined behavior"
[17:37:30] <WindowsBunny> welp
[17:37:39] <kvark> .. and possibly the launch of nearby nuclear silos
[17:37:47] <tomaka> kvark: I'm not sure it's faster than a texture array, but it's more convenient
[17:38:09] <tomaka> as you don't have to put your textures in arrays
[17:38:24] <kvark> considering the fact that modern GL allows texture arrays of different sizes, this makes bindless stuff less appealing
[17:38:25] <WindowsBunny> kvark: I benchmarked a texture atlas with a VBO vs individually drawing a quad for each sprite, and I got an approximately 2x speedup
[17:38:28] <WindowsBunny> from 1000fps to 2000fps
[17:38:30] <tomaka> also you can use a different sampler for each texture
[17:38:41] *** Joins: qrlpx (smuxi@moz-n7t.3nb.211.95.IP)
[17:39:21] <WindowsBunny> of course, that code was primarily fillrate bottlenecked
[17:39:23] <kvark> tomaka: in D3D you can use different samplers with the same texture, so it's not a problem
[17:39:24] <tomaka> WindowsBunny: you mean, the atlas is faster?
[17:39:43] <WindowsBunny> tomaka: Yes, by not having separate draw calls and texture binds
[17:39:56] <tomaka> bindless texture is even different from that
[17:40:08] <WindowsBunny> So bindless textures should be approximately similar in performance to my atlas setup
[17:40:11] *** Joins: jwilm (jwilm@moz-1rin99.hfc.comcastbusiness.net)

[18:58:00] <tomaka> glutin_window is piston, glutin is non-piston

[18:58:40] <bur_sangjun> Basically, what's going to be easier to get convenient help with if I can't figure something out, if you're here often and don't mind questions I'll switch over
[18:58:59] <bur_sangjun> of not I'll probably stick with what the PistonDeveloper's supply, which is piston_window

[19:06:14] <tomaka> bur_sangjun: yeah, but with short borrows

[22:38:57] <stephan> Hey, I'm having some issues with the glium library; in glutin, I can call the get_inner_size() method on a window object to get the client area of the window. When I try to do the same with just glium, it gets very angry and says the function doesn't exist. Any ideas?
[22:40:20] <stephan> I know I'm trying to call it on a GlutinFacade, which doesn't have that method, but is there any way to get the window object from the facade?

[22:44:16] <stephan> okay, so, I can call get_window and then deref, and that gets me a reference to the underlying window, but I can't draw on that window. Guessing I should put that in it's own block, so the borrow goes away before I draw on the facade?
