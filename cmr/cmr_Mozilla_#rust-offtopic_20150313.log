[00:18:02] <XMPPwocky> bstrie: THIS CSS HAS GONE TOO FAR
[00:18:06] <XMPPwocky> TOO FAR, I SAY
[00:19:42] <cmr> the reddit font has changed
[00:19:50] <cmr> tinycaps!
[00:19:52] <cmr> yay
[00:20:00] <cmr> I kinda like it
[00:20:25] <fmtq> oh jesus it's awful 
[00:20:52] <fmtq> small caps were not designed (at all) for easy reading, they were a mechanism for distinguishing subheadings from body text 
[00:21:58] <cmr> I agree, it's impossible to read
[00:22:00] <cmr> but it looks pretty!
[00:22:18] <fmtq> it looks like a seizure.
[00:22:36] <cmr> no, that would be http://web2.clarkson.edu/projects/cosi/sp2015/students/northug/winner.html
[00:23:27] <XMPPwocky> we really need a bot that responds to any post with "rust slower than" in the body with "have you turned optimizations on"
[00:24:05] <Tobba> have you tried turning optimizations off and on again

[00:25:22] <cmr> fair enough
[00:25:25] <XMPPwocky> ah, i see
[00:25:31] <fmtq> bstrie: ooooh
[00:25:47] <cmr> should have made tht connection...
[00:25:48] <Yurume> well smallcaps are actually not *that* bad
[00:25:57] <Yurume> but... no smallcaps for verbatim code please.
[00:26:12] <Yurume> it makes my eye bleeding
[00:26:24] <bstrie> also, I just like fucking with people via css so
[00:26:47] <XMPPwocky> Apparently Unicode has smallcaps too

[00:31:07] <Tobba> for some godforsaken reason, unicode has "mathematical letters"
[00:31:14] <Tobba> this includes... bold and italic letters?!?
[00:31:14] <tiffany> xmppwocky: the font weighting for that is all fucked up, is that my font doing that?
[00:31:24] <cmr> for the poop?
[00:31:25] <Tobba> all it does is make the font render like LaTeX
[00:31:37] <Yurume> Tobba: I think there are about 20 full sets of various presentation forms for alphabets (and also digits).
[00:31:45] <Tobba> yeeaah
[00:31:54] <Tobba> Yurume: not all of those render identically though
[00:31:59] <Tobba> most of these render identically in most fonts but with fucked up kerning
[00:32:07] <bstrie> let's be honest, unicode was never going to make sense. I see no reason to include basically everything

[00:39:48] <Tobba> I uh. oh fuck it
[00:39:51] <Yurume> so I guess, there are, two sets of normal and full-width variants, 13 additional kinds for mathematical uses, 2 + 3/2 enclosed kinds (parentheses, circled, uppercase-only boxed, uppercase-only black circled, uppercase-only black boxed), and 2 special kinds (regional indicators, tag characters)
[00:40:08] <Yurume> that makes 20.5 full sets of alphabets

[00:41:10] <Yurume> (primarily used in the context of baseball)

[04:44:56] <tiffany> the only system I have runs arch linux
[04:44:58] <adu> Mutabah: yeah, I was thinking of gnulib, the macro thing for fixing platforms
[04:45:09] <tiffany> insaneinside: unfortunately, unless you are insane inside, you can't ignore windows as a game dev
[04:45:49] <Mutabah> adu: Yeah, I rembered there were confusing names about
[04:45:54] <cmr> sure you can, ship to a console instead /
[04:45:55] <cmr> /s
[04:45:57] <Mutabah> Fixincludes is another POS that should DIAF
[04:46:16] <tiffany> I am waiting for the steamOS exclusive games
[04:46:24] <cmr> wouldn't that be the day
[04:46:35] <adu> also, the whole idea of adding things to everything is kind of antiquated, like lib(X), but I feel like filename extensions are here to stay
[04:46:42] <tiffany> valve won't do it, but there's got to be at least some devs who just can't get themselves to do windows
[04:47:18] <adu> Mutabah: "die in a fire"?
[04:47:19] * Mutabah is away (Class and Lunch)
[04:47:44] <tiffany> adu: yeah
[04:49:09] <adu> tiffany: any good file typing system these days has to deal with extensions + xattrs + magic + mimetypes + fourcc + native stuff
[04:50:58] <insaneinside> isn't file magic the same idea as fourcc?
[04:51:21] <adu> insaneinside: no, file magic is based on masks, fourcc is based on 32-bit ints
[04:52:52] <adu> so if the mask is 0xFFFFFFFF, then yes, same idea
[04:53:40] <adu> and if the mask is 2**128 - 1, then it would be the same as UUIDs
[04:54:55] <cmr> adu: what magic are *you* using?
[04:55:13] <adu> cmr: I'm not using magic at the moment
[04:55:18] <cmr> that's not what libmagic does, or any use of the term "magic" I've seen before.
[04:56:04] <adu> cmr: doesn't libmagic have a programmable language that uses masks?
[04:56:14] <cmr> it's not masks.
[04:56:26] <cmr> it's all manner of tests, including regex.
[04:56:54] <adu> cmr: ok, so I left out a feature
[04:57:07] <adu> I was trying to illustrate the difference with a specific example
[04:57:13] <cmr> almost every feature...
[04:57:16] <adu> lol
[04:57:21] <cmr> the "default" usage is looking for a literal value
[04:57:26] <cmr> (which is what most filetypes do)
[04:57:50] <tiffany> anyone writing a file format without an 8 byte identifier at the front is terrible
[04:57:59] <cmr> fourcc is a specific type of magic that happens to be simple and old.
[05:00:07] <adu> so this "default" usage you speak of, is it usually looking for a value in a certain place?
[05:00:42] <adu> kind of like a mask?
[05:00:46] <cmr> yes, it takes an offset and a value. and if you contrive that into a mask (which is can certainly be implemented as), I'll scream :p
[05:00:59] <cmr> it's an equality test!
[05:01:25] <adu> tomatoes tomatoes
[05:01:36] <adu> damn, that doesn't work with ascii
[05:02:47] <adu> təˈmeɪtə, təˈmætoː
[05:02:52] <FreeFull> A file can be valid in multiple formats
[05:02:56] <tiffany> tomaetoes tomahtoes
[05:03:03] <tiffany> æ œ
[05:03:09] <FreeFull> For example, you can have a file that's both a valid jpeg and zip
[05:03:23] <tiffany> you can, freefull?
[05:03:26] <FreeFull> Yep
[05:03:37] <insaneinside> "given suitable definitions..."
[05:03:39] <FreeFull> In fact, simply concatenating a .zip onto a .jpeg will produce such a file
[05:03:55] <tiffany> oh, does .zip store the header at the end of the file?
[05:04:12] <FreeFull> Yep, and JPEG ignores everything after its own data
[05:04:52] <tiffany> that makes sense given all the application which concatenate executables and .zips
[05:04:55] <adu> sounds like a quine
[05:04:57] <tiffany> was that an intended usecase?
[05:05:14] <FreeFull> Maybe

[17:07:51] <c74d> For the replacement... HDD or SSD? It's a laptop, so not fearing vibration would be nice, but I expect it to be host to much compiling (source-based package manager + software development) -- can SSDs reasonably take that yet?
[17:09:33] <tiffany> the SSD's capacity will slowly drop as it stops using blocks which are approaching their read/write maximums
[17:09:49] <tiffany> you might have to eventually replace it
[17:09:55] <tiffany> but it will not be some catastrophic failure
[17:10:18] <tiffany> note the maximum is usually something like 100K writes per block
[17:10:26] <tiffany> it is fine to compile off an ssd
[17:10:29] <tiffany> it's very fast
[17:10:54] <tiffany> the way people talk about how you shouldn't use SSDs for $x is kind of weird
[17:11:07] <tiffany> what are you supposed to use an SSD for if you're never supposed to read or write to it?
[17:11:38] <Astrum|Lap> don't SSDs just slowly degrade into a read-only volume anyway
[17:11:57] <tiffany> not read only, they just keep losing capacity over time

[17:12:16] <tiffany> like if the disk is full
[17:12:18] <Astrum|Lap> presumably you're no longer allowed to write
[17:12:23] <tiffany> flash drives do this too, as well
[17:12:29] <tiffany> reads also cause wear on blocks though astrum
[17:12:39] <Astrum|Lap> on SSDs?
[17:12:48] <tiffany> yeah, at least I'm pretty sure
[17:13:11] <Astrum|Lap> well I was under the impression they just kind of degrade into a read-only drive
[17:13:13] <tiffany> oh yeah, that's another thing
[17:13:14] <Astrum|Lap> I'll have to look into it though
[17:13:24] <tiffany> your SSD will be far better off if you write blocks at a time
[17:13:33] <tiffany> since SSDs can only really do block-at-a-time
[17:13:35] <Astrum|Lap> irritatingly I have two SSDs sitting in my closet, never used
[17:13:42] <Astrum|Lap> haven't had time to install one in my laptop
[17:13:44] <Astrum|Lap> -_-
[17:15:05] <tiffany> I don't have any SSDs
[17:15:49] <Astrum|Lap> I have one in my work laptop
[17:15:55] <Astrum|Lap> boots up instantly... pretty awesome
[17:16:09] <tiffany> my HDD is pretty slow
[17:16:12] <c74d> hm
[17:16:22] <tiffany> usually it gets 1 megabyte/second throughput
[17:16:28] <tiffany> except in one case
[17:16:39] <c74d> I suppose it would be useful if I could find what model of SSD this is.
[17:16:40] <tiffany> when I smash my disk cache, all the applications on my system fight over disk IO
[17:16:53] <tiffany> and it reaches 20 megabytes per second repopulating (or thrashing, if I'm out of memory) the disk cache
[17:17:00] <Astrum|Lap> also, I just learned of this, but apple's new macbook only has a USB3 connector
[17:17:13] <tiffany> no type-C?
[17:17:22] <Astrum|Lap> it is type-C
[17:17:50] <Astrum|Lap> sorry
[17:17:54] <Astrum|Lap> I phrased that strangely
[17:17:58] <c74d> Does it at least have networking capabilities too?
[17:18:11] <Astrum|Lap> new macbook has a USB 3 type-C port and a headphone jack
[17:18:12] <Astrum|Lap> that's it
[17:18:20] <Astrum|Lap> you power it through the usb port
[17:18:32] <Astrum|Lap> which means they're killing off the mag whatever connector, which is a shame
[17:19:24] <Astrum|Lap> c74d: as in ethernet? I assume you'll get a bunch of apple adapters that split that one port into lots of ports
[17:19:25] <tiffany> that'd be usb 3.1 then, wouldn't it
[17:19:36] <c74d> MagSafe, the only thing that Mac laptops have for me over other laptops.
[17:20:01] <Astrum|Lap> http://www.wired.com/2015/03/usb-type-c-faq/
[17:20:23] <Astrum|Lap> seriously, magnetic connectors are awesome

[17:21:01] <c74d> Astrum|Lap: or Wi-Fi/Bluetooth, which I'd assume it has both of.
[17:21:40] <Astrum|Lap> apple laptops have had built in wifi and bluetooth since... I dunno... 2006 or 2007?

[17:32:51] <tiffany> "power management" means "reducing the polling rate"

[17:38:49] <tiffany> to be honest I don't care all that much about anything beyond 6kro

[17:39:50] <tiffany> ghosting is a definite no, though
[17:40:00] <Astrum|Lap> also no blocking or ghosting =P
[17:40:59] <tiffany> it bothers me that USB devices have to poll
[17:41:05] <tiffany> I have a passionate hatred of polling

[17:43:25] <tiffany> maybe tobba would know
[17:44:18] <Astrum|Lap> but if you think about it at the lowest level most of our stuff is poll-based, that's basically what a clock edge is
[17:44:21] <Astrum|Lap> =P
[17:44:42] <tiffany> yeah but USB is awfully high level polling
[17:44:57] <Astrum|Lap> high level'ish
[17:45:08] <tiffany> the OS has to, on some interval, form a request poking all the HID devices, and submit it to the USB controller, and wait on the result
[17:45:18] <tiffany> or rather, form multiple requests
[17:45:28] <Tobba> I'd guess the USB controller uses PCI interrupts somewhere along the line
[17:45:39] <Tobba> I haven't touched the USB HID stuff much, but apparently it's polling
[17:45:41] <Tobba> which is insane
[17:46:20] <tiffany> I don't understand why people value one-way request/reply protocols over efficiency
[17:48:14] <Astrum|Lap> I love how computing is still so new, yet we already have horrible historical baggage
[17:49:01] <tiffany> well, we have cornered ourselves in a uniquely crappy position

[17:49:51] <Tobba> I'm curious actually, let me see if I can dig up the USB HID specs
[17:49:55] <GaryOak_> from scratch
[17:50:07] <Astrum|Lap> not likely, GaryOak_ 
[17:50:11] <Tobba> I think there is some reasoning behind it (which has to do with compatibility)
[17:50:20] <tiffany> I want a 2015 equivalent of the amiga
[17:50:45] <tiffany> a genuinely new system which has unique advantages over the status quo, because it isn't bound to standards
[17:50:53] <GaryOak_> once we get cheap optical computing, it'll be the bees knees
[17:52:15] <GaryOak_> At some point we are constrained by physics, and we are reaching those points
[17:52:38] <tiffany> we are constrained by physics but I would be horrified if x86 was like even 10% of optimal efficiency

[17:53:26] <scott> our architectures are bad and our software is mostly bad, so hitting the physical limits means we have to make those less bad
[17:53:42] <tiffany> which is why I brought up the amiga
[17:54:19] <scott> I've heard others point to the amiga before for the same reason
[17:54:26] <scott> but that's before my time
[17:54:27] <GaryOak_> someone has to rebuild a foundation and not care about history but this is really hard for big companies
[17:54:47] <GaryOak_> that's why microsoft has to support legacy apps
[17:54:55] <tiffany> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga#Hardware
[17:55:01] <Astrum|Lap> bonus: whoever builds this new, better foundation will screw it up
[17:55:02] <tiffany> they did a lot of tricks to get the most out of what they had
[17:55:16] <Astrum|Lap> unintentionally, design by committee, whatever
[17:55:17] <tiffany> and ended up with something which even today people still love reverently
[17:55:24] <Astrum|Lap> and then even more future generations will have to deal with it
[17:55:25] <Astrum|Lap> =)
[17:55:32] <rovar> there is a reason why they went out of business
[17:55:41] <tiffany> astrum: as khronos said, committees are good for refining, not for inventing
[17:56:24] <tiffany> someone needs to go out and build a new PC, and then get it standardised later
[17:56:26] <Astrum|Lap> yeah, they've been amazing at refining ogl into the blob of horribleness it is today
[17:56:41] <tiffany> uh
[17:56:53] <tiffany> given the constraints, they did a pretty good job
[17:57:16] <tiffany> vulkan is free of those constraints
[17:57:58] <Astrum|Lap> from what I understand vulkan grew from mantle
[17:58:31] <Astrum|Lap> in either case, committees are not great at refining
[17:58:36] <Astrum|Lap> look at C++
[17:58:41] <tiffany> it did
[17:58:45] <GaryOak_> to make something better you have to understand the past and work really hard to not repeat the mistakes
[17:58:45] <tiffany> er
[17:58:51] <Gankro> I like the interpretation of vulkan as a scam set up by engine devs to force people to use their engines
[17:59:09] <tiffany> C++11 is pretty nice, and C++14 is marginally nicer
[17:59:41] <tiffany> gankro: sounds like a conspiracy theory by all the derps who still use immediate mode GL
[17:59:43] <Astrum|Lap> I suppose it's a question of semantics on what constitutes 'good' and what 'refinement' connotes
[18:00:06] <tiffany> who produce theories such as nvidia deliberately making immediate mode slow
[18:00:39] <Gankro> tiffany: vulkan is *unquestionably* more complicated to use.
[18:00:43] <tiffany> it is
[18:00:47] <GaryOak_> business needs are not equal to user needs 
[18:01:07] <tiffany> but it's also going to be easier to debug than opengl ever will be
[18:01:08] <saml> how can I config ssh  so that when I do   ssh prd.<foobar>     it'll get expanded to <foobar>.prd.google.com ?
[18:01:09] <Astrum|Lap> vulkan is more complex in you need more code to do the same as ogl
[18:01:19] <Astrum|Lap> but I'd wager it's way easier to understand what's going on with vulkan than ogl
[18:01:24] <Astrum|Lap> which is a giant state machine
[18:01:25] <tiffany> and it's going to be easier to write abstractions

[18:02:13] <tiffany> I'm going to port IL to vulkan
[18:02:28] <Gankro> And around its release several engine devs announced "oh our engine is free to use". So then devs choose an engine to avoid writing all the crazy shit from scratch because it's "free" and then they're locked into the ecosystem.
[18:02:40] <Gankro> I'm not saying it's true, I just think it's a fun thoery ;)

[18:04:18] <Astrum|Lap> but it's more a matter of practiaclly, migrating to a new engine is a crapton of work
[18:04:20] <tiffany> there are worse choices you could make with developing a game than using unreal engine
[18:04:30] <Astrum|Lap> and most people shouldn't make an engine themselves anyway
[18:04:37] <Astrum|Lap> at least not to make a game with
[18:05:00] <Gankro> Yeah totally
[18:05:27] <Astrum|Lap> great learning experience, necessary if your game is very weird in some way (and modifying one of the big engines isn't really an option), but otherwise too much work
[18:05:28] <Gankro> Although vulkan at least makes any chance of rolling your own or migrating that much smaller
[18:05:38] <Astrum|Lap> nah
[18:05:43] <Astrum|Lap> I'll be on top of vulkan
[18:05:55] <Astrum|Lap> I already have a game in mind
[18:05:57] <c74d> saml: I'd think that would expand to prd.db1.prd.google.com?
[18:06:00] <tiffany> I don't agree with that
[18:06:13] <tiffany> it may take more effort on the low level, but you can really easily abstract it all in C++ or rust
[18:06:36] <tiffany> the state machine is a major barrier to effective abstraction of opengl
[18:06:39] <saml> no it doesn't get expanded at all c74d

[19:40:04] <tiffany> instead of one table of straight key->value
[19:40:18] <tiffany> and this vague notion of systems iterating through their tables and performing operations on them

[19:42:37] <eddyb> tiffany: I should try to prototype something
[19:43:03] <eddyb> should I have primitive types?
[19:43:20] <eddyb> what about just values and some primitive combinators of those
[19:43:25] <tiffany> eddyb: you could have a look at some of my notes
[19:43:33] <tiffany> before I realised I had invented prolog
[19:43:34] <tiffany> https://trello.com/c/dTzlAmdJ/8-comprehensions
[19:43:48] <eddyb> u32: 0...0xffff_ffff
[19:44:01] <Astrum|Lap> the world needs more prolog
[19:44:30] <tiffany> I had later realised I had stumbled right into category theory as well
[19:44:37] <eddyb> false, true, bool: false | true
[19:44:43] <tiffany> which, guess what, is the basis of type systems
[19:44:53] <Astrum|Lap> well... it can be
[19:45:12] <eddyb> the cool thing is that you can implement traits just as another kind of entity

[20:10:59] <scott> I have a much better idea what I want out of my next year of school
[20:11:13] <Astrum|Lap> I enjoyed some of my random classes like astrophysics
[20:11:21] <tiffany> if I ever do go to college I'm definitely not majoring in computer science
[20:11:23] <eddyb> Astrum|Lap: it's not a bad uni, it's just not much more than CS & math
[20:11:28] <scott> I really like most of my non-CS classes
[20:11:29] <Astrum|Lap> and the entire reason I went for a dual math/cs major was because I kept taking more math courses for fun
[20:11:32] <eddyb> tiffany: ikr?
[20:11:54] <eddyb> but I can't do all that physics
[20:12:03] <eddyb> I don't hate it
[20:12:04] <Astrum|Lap> yeah... I'll definitely say that with the exception of two CS courses, I hated my CS degree
[20:12:12] <eddyb> it's just that we are not sufficiently advanced
[20:12:18] <scott> I like most of my CS courses, but a lot of them are too easy
[20:12:21] <Astrum|Lap> I was infinitely fascinated with my math degree
[20:12:28] <scott> well, I like more of them in the higher levels
[20:12:30] <Astrum|Lap> and they were ungodly challenging
[20:12:36] <scott> the earlier ones can be pretty bad
[20:12:41] <eddyb> for me to process the information in a satisfactory quantity
[20:12:51] <eddyb> I would fail the first year for sure
[20:12:58] <Astrum|Lap> my embedded systems course (FPGAs) was awesome, but it was basically like an EE course with a *lot* of lab time
[20:13:15] <Astrum|Lap> and my programming language theory course was awesome because we just kind of messed around with stuff
[20:13:15] <eddyb> I've always wanted to work with robots
[20:13:35] <eddyb> but I have to make sacrifices to survive
[20:13:38] <GaryOak_> I took an embedded class using FPGA
[20:13:55] <GaryOak_> I enjoyed it a lot
[20:13:57] <Astrum|Lap> if you pick up a math degree I highly suggest topology and differential geometry though (after taking the 3 years of prereqs...)
[20:14:08] <Astrum|Lap> GaryOak_: VHDL or verilog?
[20:14:12] <GaryOak_> Verilog
[20:14:18] <Astrum|Lap> I was VHDL
[20:14:21] <Astrum|Lap> it was... weird
[20:14:28] <GaryOak_> We wrote a Tron Lightcycle Game!
[20:14:41] <Astrum|Lap> our final project was to make any game
[20:14:46] <Astrum|Lap> my partner and I made bomberman
[20:14:51] <GaryOak_> Complete with the VGA and keyboard driver!
[20:15:02] <Astrum|Lap> another group did as well, but they dumped in a TON of time and included sound and crap
[20:15:10] <GaryOak_> That's really cool
[20:15:22] <Astrum|Lap> I felt like a failure for not doing as much, lol
[20:15:41] <Astrum|Lap> yeah, we did the VGA and KB driver as well
[20:15:45] <GaryOak_> We built the keyboard driver at the beginning of the course, then the Vga driver in the middle, then finally the game
[20:16:03] <Astrum|Lap> and we used a PPC core to run the actual game which was programmed in C
[20:16:04] <GaryOak_> VGA is surprisingly easier than the keyboard driver
[20:16:16] <GaryOak_> that's cool
[20:16:32] <Astrum|Lap> yup, we built up in that same way...
[20:16:35] <tiffany> I've always been interested in math
[20:16:41] <Astrum|Lap> either FPGA courses are the same or you went to CSU =P
[20:16:48] <GaryOak_> I didn't really grasp keyboard debouncing

[20:17:50] <Astrum|Lap> tiffany: I seriously recommend going to uni then. It's hard for me to describe just how much I enjoyed my math degree
[20:17:58] <GaryOak_> and the Riemann hypothesis, and infinite sequences
[20:17:59] <scott> I'm very interested in the kinds of maths that apply to programming language theory and related things
[20:18:13] <scott> discrete math kinds of things mostly

[20:19:55] <tiffany> linear algebra is used quite a lot in high level 3D graphics
[20:19:56] <scott> I've never done much of the kind of math I'm interested in in a formal setting at all
[20:19:59] <Astrum|Lap> most eye opening class I ever took and by far my favorite
[20:19:59] <eddyb> *sigh*
[20:20:13] <tiffany> but yeah, math is the one thing I miss out on the most with going the experience route rather than the degree route

[21:14:50] <WindowsBunny> eddyb: If that's wrong, then that sucks
[21:14:56] <eddyb> why?
[21:15:06] <eddyb> hmmm
[21:15:07] <WindowsBunny> Because now I'm confused!
[21:15:25] <eddyb> WindowsBunny: `move` isn't "by-val", it's "force by-val for everything"
[21:15:52] <scott> so I was right about move but wrong about non-move?

[21:16:28] <eddyb> `move` is a hammer big enough for all the nails
[21:16:47] * eddyb wonders if inferring `move` is only problematic with `Copy` captures and whether that can be alleviated
[21:16:58] <scott> so to pin down what non-move does... it only captures by moving if it's a FnOnce that moves the capture elsewhere?
[21:17:07] <eddyb> scott: yeah
[21:17:20] <scott> is that the only piece missing from my previous understanding?
[21:17:25] <eddyb> maybe
[21:17:32] <eddyb> I'd have to think about it :P
[21:18:17] <eddyb> this is also intertwined with inferring "maximally flexible valid closure kind for this closure"
[21:18:44] <scott> why not take Copy values by-value if it sends them by-value somewhere else?
[21:18:48] <eddyb> what was the ranking? Fn > FnMut > FnOnce
[21:19:02] <eddyb> scott: because it's not *necessary*
[21:19:26] <scott> it could be an optimization in some cases, I think
[21:19:38] <scott> one less indirection
[21:19:45] <eddyb> it can totally be done as an optimization if they're not borrowed (mutably) and they don't contain interior mutability
[21:20:05] <eddyb> you'd use the rule for by-val arguments
[21:20:33] <scott> I guess it could make the closure Send or whatever (I don't understand that stuff very well)
[21:20:45] <scott> but you have `move` to make that explicit, right?

[23:03:36] <bvssvni> scott: are you there?
[23:03:42] <scott> yep
[23:04:10] <bvssvni> scott: so the idea is to pass AST expressions a function that returns a functions
[23:04:16] <bvssvni> *to a
[23:05:00] <scott> are you talking about this in terms of writing the evaluator or something else? I may be missing the context
[23:05:12] <bvssvni> scott: it’s an idea for type checking
[23:06:08] <bvssvni> let’s call that function the “type checker function” or tcf
[23:06:34] <bvssvni> a tcf returns either a function or an error message
[23:06:35] <eddyb> hehe
[23:06:51] <eddyb> bvssvni: I have something beyond that
[23:07:00] <bvssvni> eddyb: you do?
[23:07:01] <eddyb> though it's somewhat inspired by your ideas
[23:07:39] <bvssvni> eddyb: I’ve been thinking on it from time to time
[23:07:49] <bvssvni> eddyb: tell me :)
[23:08:06] <eddyb> so you know the value: type: trait hierarchy, no?
[23:08:21] <bvssvni> hmm
[23:08:40] <bvssvni> value is a subset f types, and types are subsets of traits?
[23:08:44] <eddyb> no
[23:09:00] <eddyb> values are instances of types which are instances of traits
[23:09:09] <eddyb> though it's not exactly that
[23:09:29] <bvssvni> are you thinking of an infinite hiearchy?
[23:10:59] <scott> traits are more like propositions about types, and a type impls a trait when the proposition is true for that type
[23:11:19] <scott> traits with more than 1 type parameter (counting Self) are like relations between types
[23:11:59] <scott> like the "can be added together relation" called Add which is true for (i32, i32) and so on
[23:12:11] <eddyb> scott: no, that's an alternate definition of Add
[23:12:26] <scott> I didn't mean the tuple literally
[23:12:31] <eddyb> which is isomorphic with the form which has the type parameter
[23:12:36] <scott> right
[23:12:48] <eddyb> bvssvni: not a hierarchy at all!
[23:12:51] <scott> the current Add still logically takes two type parameters
[23:12:53] <scott> Self and T
[23:12:55] <eddyb> bvssvni: or rather, not a strong distinction
[23:13:01] <scott> which I wrote as (Self, T) above
[23:13:16] <eddyb> scott: the Self type parameter concept is from type classes
[23:13:24] <eddyb> which I guess would fit with Prolog predicates
[23:13:38] <eddyb> scott: but that's not *necessary*
[23:13:55] <eddyb> bvssvni: so, imagine a function that takes a type and a value and returns a trait
[23:13:55] <bvssvni> eddyb: tell me about the thing :P
[23:13:58] <scott> what do you mean by that? I'm just describing a way of thinking about traits/typeclasses
[23:14:16] <eddyb> scott: you're describing *the* way of thinking about type clases
[23:15:13] <eddyb> bvssvni: it's still very much a mess in a my head
[23:15:26] <bvssvni> eddyb: can you explain the relationship between the type and the value?
[23:17:20] <eddyb> a type is merely a set of properties a value may have
[23:17:30] <eddyb> just like a trait is a set of properties a type may have
[23:17:40] <eddyb> (this can encode various forms of typestate)
[23:17:55] <bvssvni> yes
[23:18:23] <eddyb> I am weary of Prolog predicates because of the backtracking, so I have to come up with better primitives
[23:18:44] <eddyb> but it's mostly a module system

[23:24:04] <tiffany> all javascript has is hash tables
[23:24:11] <tiffany> and arrays
[23:24:24] <scott> associated types actually take traits from relations to functions
[23:24:39] <tiffany> it doesn't seem like you could even implement fancy data structures in a way that they wouldn't have poor performance
[23:24:41] <scott> I guess that's why the semi-equivalent functional dependencies in haskell have their name
[23:24:45] <tiffany> since everything is pointer-indirected hash tables
[23:25:14] <scott> tiffany: runtime optimization
[23:25:17] <tiffany> I thought about this since I'm currently implementing radix trees
[23:25:35] <scott> Rubinius will compile oft-used classes that don't change their structure into a compact form at runtime
[23:25:37] <tiffany> scott: from what I've seen, optimising shitty data structures into less shitty ones is a very difficult problem
[23:25:50] <scott> it's not exactly reliable, for sure
[23:26:05] <eddyb> scott: associated types and methods are the exact same thing
[23:26:57] <scott> eddyb: how so?
[23:27:16] <eddyb> find a difference
[23:27:33] <eddyb> they're both named
[23:27:35] <scott> associated types let me compute a type from the type parameters of a trait
[23:27:38] <eddyb> and they're both associated
[23:27:52] <eddyb> scott: but that's not what they are, that's just an usecase
[23:28:07] <eddyb> methods can be easily reduced to associated constants
[23:28:21] <scott> that is the only purpose of associate types, is it not?
[23:28:23] <eddyb> (makes vtables easier to reason about, too)
[23:28:42] <eddyb> associated types and associated constants are the same
[23:28:53] <scott> I don't think so
[23:29:20] <scott> not in a non-dependently-typed language
[23:29:58] <eddyb> my thought experiment is probably crazily dependent
[23:30:10] <eddyb> scott: but even in Rust, the handling is almost identical
[23:30:41] <eddyb> except for the fact that one is a type and the other one is a value
[23:30:51] <scott> but from a type theory point of view, associated types let you do something you couldn't before, if I'm not mistaken

[23:42:18] <scott> bvssvni: but essentially yes
[23:42:34] <bvssvni> scott: I’m wrong, but right, get it
[23:43:02] <scott> bvssvni: the trick is Idris only lets you write Type (Type 1 is an error), but it infers the correct levels behind the scenes
[23:44:08] <bvssvni> traits says something about types
[23:44:24] <bvssvni> but they don’t say anything about the functions that returns the values
[23:44:32] <bvssvni> only about the type of the value
[23:44:36] <scott> right
[23:44:59] <bvssvni> so you loose some information by restricting type checking to predicates about types
[23:45:08] <scott> and in a dependently typed language, associated types are just like the functions; some unspecified value of type Type
[23:46:03] <bvssvni> if a function returns a non-zero number, then you have to declare a type NonZero<T>(pub T) or something
