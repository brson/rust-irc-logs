[00:04:09] <bjz> Denommus: not sure
[00:04:18] <bjz> me and photex are looking into this
[00:04:34] <bjz> sort of from a dat-oriented-design point of view
[00:05:00] <bjz> unfortunately Rust doesn't help much in this regard, no more than other langs
[00:05:07] <bjz> as far as I know at least
[00:05:18] <bjz> it's been a while since I looked at it
[00:05:39] <bjz> I've learned tons more in that time, so I might be able to do it better now
[00:06:15] <bjz> Denommus: I would at least wrap the id in a struct
[00:06:24] <bjz> to provide a level of abstraction
[00:06:52] <bjz> you might need to dip into some unsafe code to improve efficieny, but you should be able to make a safe API
[00:08:12] <Denommus> I'm looking into a entity-component design due to the lack of struct inheritance (which I honestly don't think was a bad decision, but it brings a whole new way of thinking about abstractions)
[00:11:30] <Denommus> someone at FreeNode gave me a nice direction
[00:11:34] <Denommus> thanks for your input, too
[00:14:45] <tiffany> I think I have accidentally implemented this a few times
[00:18:45] <SiegeLord> My entities are just sets of Option<uint>
[00:21:56] <tiffany> "If this separation is taken to an extreme, with one list for each entity type, then it may be that the entity-component-system pattern does not fit well with the problem." what's it called when you have a list for each entity type?
[00:22:24] <tiffany> also, what is it called when you have one thing that iterates the list, and then dispatches based on the type?
[00:23:20] <Denommus> SiegeLord: Vec<Option<uint>>?
[00:23:41] <SiegeLord> For now, individual fields
[00:23:57] <SiegeLord> I don't see a need to ever iterate across them just yet
[00:24:03] <Denommus> SiegeLord: but why an Option?
[00:24:18] <SiegeLord> Well, it either has a component or it doesn't
[00:24:33] <Denommus> SiegeLord: why is a component a uint, though?
[00:24:56] <SiegeLord> That's an index into the component vector
[00:25:46] <Denommus> SiegeLord: I was thinking about making a Vec<~Component> instead
[00:26:17] <Denommus> SiegeLord: an Entity would "own" its components. I'm not sure if it's a good idea, though. A component wouldn't be reusable in that case, right?
[00:26:24] <SiegeLord> That should be semantically identical
[00:26:34] <SiegeLord> I don't know, maybe I should do it too
[00:26:46] <SiegeLord> What I'm doing is a silly optimization anyway
[00:27:01] <SiegeLord> Some people who do component based entities get very silly about cache lines
[00:27:24] <SiegeLord> Actually, that might not work too well, since components have to be different types...
[00:27:31] <SiegeLord> But that's just an argument against Vec
[00:27:41] <SiegeLord> I could do a set of Option<~ComponentType>
[00:27:43] <Denommus> SiegeLord: your optimization is useful if you have, say, a tiled map
[00:27:44] <SiegeLord> fields
[00:28:04] <Denommus> SiegeLord: "Component", in my case, is a trait, not a type
[00:28:41] <SiegeLord> How are you going to handle different component types then?
[00:28:51] <Denommus> SiegeLord: they implement the Component trait
[00:29:11] <SiegeLord> Yeah, and how will you handle different types?
[00:29:21] <SiegeLord> Vec<~Component> implies using trait objects
[00:29:35] <SiegeLord> And getting a trait object is a one-way trip
[00:29:45] <Denommus> SiegeLord: I'll cast them to Component when I add them to the Vec. Dynamic dispatch will handle the rest
[00:29:46] <SiegeLord> Usually
[00:30:08] <Denommus> SiegeLord: I'm going home, but I'd like to come back to this discussion later
[00:30:13] <Denommus> bye

[00:31:30] <SiegeLord> I guess using a vector of indices would allow me to have variable sized entities...
[00:31:44] <SiegeLord> But that'd force me to do a heap allocation per entity :/
[00:36:04] <o11c> if that's an issue, write a custom pool allocator
[00:36:40] <SiegeLord> That's exactly what using an index is
[00:36:47] <SiegeLord> index is my 'pointer' into the 'pool'
[00:36:58] <SiegeLord> I guess with a nicer API, hah
[00:37:11] <SiegeLord> I could implement Deref and DerefMut on a newtype around a uint
[00:41:01] <o11c> I mean, have one pool for allocating each type, but the indices not related to that
[00:42:26] <SiegeLord> I currently have a vector for each component type

[00:44:25] <SiegeLord> I'll probably switch it to Option<~Component>... if I need to, it's easy to optimize using a custom allocator, or a manual index/vector scheme

[01:45:26] <Boscop> bjz: with gl-rs do i have to load each function individually?
[01:47:10] <bjz> Boscop: no
[01:47:27] <bjz> gl-rs will do it with gl::load_with
[01:47:33] <Boscop> ah ok
[01:47:39] <bjz> note that my examples might be out of date
[01:48:00] <bjz> I've done lots of improvements to the glfw API lately
[01:48:18] <Boscop> great :)
[01:48:25] <bjz> you will probably have to do something like: `gl::load_with(|s| glfw::get_proc_address(s))`
[01:48:29] <bjz> woops
[01:48:40] <bjz> I mean, `gl::load_with(|s| glfw.get_proc_address(s))`
[01:48:49] <Boscop> will gl33.rs work with glfw 3.0.4?
[01:49:06] <bjz> yep, no reason why not
[01:49:09] <Boscop> ok
[01:49:28] <bjz> you just have to request it using the appropriate window hint
[01:50:02] <Boscop> how?
[01:50:19] <mvian> glfw.window_hint(glfw::ContextVersion(3, 3));
[01:50:24] <bjz> yep
[01:50:27] <Boscop> thanks
[01:50:40] <bjz> when you compile glfw it build the docs
[01:50:44] <bjz> *builds
[01:50:56] <Boscop> i used the binaries
[01:51:04] <bjz> should be in the glfw-rs/doc directory
[01:51:14] <Boscop> ok
[01:51:19] <bjz> woops, I mean, compile glfw-rs
[01:51:41] <bjz> the docs could still do with a ton of work, but they are slowly improving
[01:52:58] <Boscop> i'm currently trying to build rust-portaudio but getting these errors http://pastebin.com/qxWvvTdc (portaudio itself built fine (with asio enabled)) it looks like it's supposed to link against something
[01:53:26] <bjz> yeah, looks like it
[01:53:30] <bjz> whose lib is it?
[01:53:39] <bjz> you might be able to ping them on IRC
[01:53:42] <Boscop> https://github.com/JeremyLetang/rust-portaudio
[01:53:56] <bjz> hmm, don't know him :(
[01:54:02] <bjz> you could post an issue
[01:54:14] <bjz> or look through the issue list
[01:54:33] <Boscop> what struck me as odd, was that when i built portaudio without asio support it generated a dll but not with asio
[01:54:35] <bjz> Boscop: new to Rust btw?
[01:54:47] <Boscop> bjz: yes, i was using C++ and then D before
[01:54:58] <bjz> heh, that was my progression too
[01:55:11] <bjz> although that was almost two years ago
[01:55:18] <Boscop> and how do you like it compared to D?
[01:55:24] <bjz> not that I got too deep into them though
[01:55:27] <Boscop> (especially for gamedev)
[01:55:41] <bjz> compared to D, I really miss the static code gen stuff
[01:55:54] <bjz> (from a library author's point of view)
[01:56:05] <bjz> Rust is slowly getting better though
[01:56:12] <Boscop> static if and string mixins?
[01:56:21] <bjz> not so much string mixins
[01:56:30] <bjz> more the static if and template stuff
[01:56:46] <bjz> you might find thise sort of useful: https://gist.github.com/bjz/9220415
[01:56:54] <Boscop> how does rust compare in terms of metaprogramming?
[01:57:11] <bjz> we have parametric polymorphism and macros
[01:57:20] <Boscop> e.g. is it possible to generate json reader/writer from a struct?
[01:57:47] <Boscop> does it have compile-time reflection?
[01:57:56] <bjz> I'm not sure
[01:58:03] <bjz> I think its limited at the moment
[01:58:05] <Boscop> i like the macros in Nemerle
[01:58:18] <bjz> you might have to ask on #rust for this kind of thing
[01:58:44] <Boscop> do you think rust is a good fit for high perf DSP?
[01:59:00] <bjz> but yeah, my issue with D was it's ergonomics discourages immuability
[01:59:15] <bjz> well, that was only one of my issues
[01:59:19] <bjz> DSP?
[01:59:25] <Boscop> digital signal processing
[01:59:41] <bjz> I'm sure it would be
[01:59:43] <Boscop> with simd etc.
[01:59:54] <bjz> simd support is being worked on
[02:00:11] <bjz> it's not ready yet though
[02:00:11] <Boscop> nice
[02:00:32] <bjz> there are some open issues on the rust repo I think
[02:00:52] <bjz> from memory... aatch and jensnockert might be ones to ask?
[02:01:07] <Boscop> D was too slow because of the GC, and not functional enough for my taste
[02:01:13] <bjz> yeah
[02:01:18] <bjz> GC made me sad
[02:01:44] <Boscop> i always had long ass lines using map and reduce chains etc
[02:01:46] <bjz> it's also hard to encode invariants into APIs in D
[02:02:08] <bjz> you have these compile time contracts with D
[02:02:13] <Boscop> is it better in rust?
[02:02:21] <bjz> yes - sheck out that gist
[02:02:26] <Boscop> ok
[02:02:54] <bjz> think of template metaprogramming as "a duck typed, purely functional code generation program that is run at compile time"
[02:03:12] <fmtq> think hacks
[02:03:36] <Boscop> i know, c++ does templates badly
[02:03:56] <Boscop> btw, i meant the api invariants when i asked "is it better in rust?"
[02:04:00] <o11c> but at least it does templates!
[02:04:29] <bjz> Rust, like haskell, checks the type up front, checking if it complies with a certain interface. whe as with D the error could be thrown deep in the expansion
[02:04:31] <tiffany> does rust support DSPs?
[02:04:59] <bjz> Boscop: in terms of API invarients, yes, Rust is much better
[02:05:09] <Boscop> bjz: D also checks upfront
[02:05:11] <bjz> Boscop: and it prodeces far better errors
[02:05:25] <tiffany> I thought the supported platforms list was pretty short because of lack of maintainers
[02:05:34] <bjz> tiffany: DSPs?
[02:05:56] <bjz> Boscop: yeah I might not have everything with D correct
[02:05:58] <tiffany> bjz: they are processors with their own architectures designed for heavy pipelining
[02:06:05] <bjz> Boscop: been a while sisnce I used it
[02:06:16] <Boscop> bjz: i can't find anything with google about api invariants
[02:06:51] <bjz> Boscop: so, like encoding state machines in the type system, so it's *impossible* to get into a bad state
[02:06:59] <tiffany> my knowledge of them comes from the talks about the mill cpu though
[02:07:24] <bjz> Boscop: things like making types not able to be shared between tasks
[02:08:27] <Boscop> the problems with D templates are that they can't be used in a functional style (e.g. writing combinators or composing them) and the type checking often has to be done manually for alias arguments like functions (e.g. in map/reduce) so that leads to large errors
[02:09:06] <bjz> that's what I mean - it is possible to do this in D, but it requires more discipline
[02:09:29] <Boscop> TMP is very verbose, you have to alias template calls to new names all the time
[02:09:42] <Boscop> can't call foo!(a)!(b)
[02:09:48] <bjz> In Rust I can hack out an API based simply on the types, then work with the compiler to get everything to fit together nicely
[02:09:57] <Boscop> have to do alias foo!(a) A; A!(b)
[02:10:03] <bjz> then I can start working on the implementation
[02:10:05] <Boscop> because of the parser
[02:10:13] <bjz> ah
[02:10:36] <Boscop> and tuples are untyped
[02:10:51] <Boscop> lots of checking has to be done manually
[02:11:01] <Boscop> e.g. variadic arguments type checking
[02:11:11] <bjz> I think language support for algebraic data types and pattern matching is critical
[02:11:20] <Boscop> yes, i was missing that in D too
[02:11:29] <Boscop> std.Variant doesn't work recursively (trees)
[02:11:40] <bjz> I know its possible to build them as libs, but it isn't pretty to use
[02:11:41] <bjz> yeah
[02:11:46] <Boscop> and there is no exhaustiveness check for switch
[02:12:05] <Boscop> and the whole switch is nothing compared to match and destructuring
[02:12:26] * bjz notes that Haskell doesn't check for exhastiveness by defualt - he found that really surprising
[02:12:31] <bjz> yeah
[02:12:51] <Boscop> also the whole immutable/const system that's transitive but can't work for custom pointer types
[02:13:01] <bjz> dang
[02:13:07] *** Quits: brson (brson@moz-62518563.mtv2.mozilla.com) (Ping timeout)

[02:14:05] <Boscop> immutable as default makes more sense
[02:14:21] <bjz> this is where syntax is *extremely* important in terms of encouraging safe practices
[02:14:30] <Boscop> scala uses the short "val"
[02:14:51] <bjz> (despite all they say about syntax not being important compared to semantics)
[02:14:53] <Boscop> and so far there has been no benefit of distinguishing between const and immutable in D

[02:15:59] *** Quits: alex-abreu (alex@moz-7421D6C9.mc.videotron.ca) (Ping timeout)
[02:16:07] <bjz> are really?
[02:16:09] <Boscop> yes, that also bugged me
[02:16:22] <bjz> didn't know that immutable wasn't really immutable
[02:16:50] <Boscop> immutable is really immutable, i meant there are no benefits yet for how the compiler handles immutable vs const
[02:16:54] <Boscop> no extra optimizations
[02:16:58] <bjz> in Rust immutability is garranteed - unles somebody is doing naughty unsafe stuff
[02:17:01] <Boscop> might as well all be const
[02:17:20] <bjz> :(
[02:17:23] <bjz> so yeah
[02:17:54] <Boscop> and in D the inout stuff doesn't work in all cases
[02:18:02] <bjz> despite the fact that Rust is less expressive when it comes to static code gen (macros only go so far), I think what I gain is worth it
[02:18:39] <bjz> things will improve too
[02:18:59] <tiffany> will it be better with procedural macros or static function evaluation?
[02:19:39] <Boscop> before checking out rust i was designing a systems language out of frustration with c++, but it seems a lot of my ideas/wants are covered by rust
[02:19:47] <bjz> yeah
[02:20:35] <Boscop> first i checked out D but found that it wasn't satisfyable but it influenced my design, and scala too
[02:20:46] <bjz> I think there is going to be an even better language in 5 years or a decade's time that I will like a ton more than Rust, but for now it's got tons of momentum and enough to satisfy me at this point in time
[02:21:11] <Boscop> bjz: what would that language have?
[02:22:26] <Boscop> i'm kind of pissed off that rust checks so many points off my checklist :P because it kinda discourages me to continue my design
[02:22:39] <Boscop> cause i also have to get work done
[02:22:41] <bjz> an even richer type system - dependent types, theorem proving... like a nicer ATS... pretty like Idris, regions and linear types like in Rust... zero cost abstraction as paramount. All super difficult things though
[02:23:11] <bjz> dependent types still need more brewing time though
[02:23:12] <Boscop> yeah, zero cost abstractions are also very important for me
[02:23:20] <bjz> not really ready for prime time yet
[02:23:34] <Boscop> don't they need runtime checks?
[02:23:39] <bjz> no
[02:24:13] <Boscop> theorem proving in a systems language would be cool
[02:25:04] <bjz> classic example is in haskell: `concat :: [a] -> [a] -> [a]` in idris: `concat : Vec m a -> Vec n a -> Vec (m + n) a`
[02:25:07] <Boscop> also ability to embed DSLs and stack abstractions from the metal to the most functional realm
[02:25:22] <bjz> yeah, that's what idris does well
[02:25:33] <bjz> but it's not really a systems language
[02:26:15] <bjz> it also is very slow development wise. I suspect it will be one of those langs that remains researchy
[02:26:19] <bjz> which is fine
[02:26:48] <Boscop> yeah, a lot of good ideas never get implemented for the real world
[02:27:02] <Boscop> or just in separate toy languages
[02:27:44] <bjz> I think the philosophy their taking is they want to build downwards to a fast systems lang from a high level of abstraction. where as I think you need a foundation that is closer to the metal then build safer and safer abstractions on top
[02:27:51] <Boscop> and whenever a new language comes along, a lot of functionality is rewritten in that language...
[02:27:58] <bjz> but I still have tons to learn
[02:28:01] <bjz> yeah, indeed

[02:35:44] <Boscop> the code is written in D, and more functional than looks pretty in D
[02:35:56] <bjz> I would encourage you to at least have glances at ATS
[02:36:00] <Boscop> i plan to open it up once i rewrite it in itself
[02:36:21] <Boscop> yeah, i have looked at it, haven't used it tho
[02:36:30] <Boscop> but i've used Coq a bit
[02:36:34] <bjz> looks like a cat sat on the grammar, but it looks interesting
[02:36:50] *** Joins: kimundi (kimundi@moz-DF1E95E2.dip0.t-ipconnect.de)
[02:36:55] <Boscop> my syntax is more like python
[02:37:06] <Boscop> no clutter
[02:37:17] <bjz> curried?
[02:38:25] <bjz> haskelly type signatures? ie. above the argument bindings?
[02:38:33] * bjz is hoping
[02:38:37] <Boscop> partial application is possible explicitly (e.g. foo _), it's not the default because of optional arguments etc
[02:39:02] <bjz> the thing I love about haskell is the whitespace dependent stuff is just a preprocessor
[02:39:10] <Boscop> yeah, haskelly type sigs and the syntax is also curry-y
[02:39:13] <bjz> (with some really nice heuristics)
[02:40:11] <Boscop> there is a 1 to 1 mapping from multiline code to single line code
[02:40:21] <bjz> the issue with pervasive currying is whether it would cause undue overhead
[02:40:24] <Boscop> everything can be written in one line or multiple
[02:40:29] <Boscop> not like python
[02:40:30] <bjz> yeah
[02:40:38] <bjz> you would know more about it than me
[02:40:49] *** kimundi is now known as zz_kimundi
[02:40:53] <Boscop> yeah, there are hidden perf issues with unintentional currying
[02:41:30] <Boscop> that and optional arguments are the main reasons why i decided against it
[02:41:55] <Boscop> but it has partial application like scala
[02:42:15] <bjz> I'm thinking that having stuff like regions and a by-ref/by-val distinction would make the language less 'pretty' on the page compared to haskell, but it is a necessary tradeoff
[02:43:08] <bjz> anyway, I gots to get back to work
[02:43:14] <Boscop> ok :)

[02:50:27] <Boscop> thanks
[02:50:50] <bjz> rebol looks super interesting
[02:50:57] <bjz> as with concatentive langs
[02:51:03] <bjz> so much cool stuff out there
[02:51:19] <Boscop> yeah, but all in different langs...
[02:51:41] <bjz> an XKCD comic comes to mind...
[02:52:06] <bjz> (a far too overused on, mind you)
[02:52:17] <Boscop> do you know why ATS isn't used much?
[02:52:33] <bjz> it's ugly as fuck
[02:52:39] <Boscop> true
[02:52:41] <bjz> to put it crudely
[02:53:06] <Boscop> but apart from that? it's can't be all that, otherwise someone would have written CoffeeATS
[02:53:25] <bjz> I also think they were probably really bad at marketing it

[13:28:01] <rsaarelm> I wonder if something like Travis could be used to generate binary builds of executable projects to a download site as well as checking that the thing works.
[13:28:44] <rsaarelm> The biggest need would probably be for a cross-compiled Windows version.

[14:17:26] <rsaarelm> Yeah, if I owned an online server I could do all sorts of stuff. I was wondering what I can do as long as I'm making an open source game at zero budget. Travis seems to let github projects build stuff and check the output for free. But I guess they have checks in place for attempts to exploit the system.

[14:19:38] <zokier`> even if they didn't, i'd rather not see nice free services being exploited
[14:20:07] <zokier`> or abused rather
[14:20:10] <csherratt> travis is pretty flexible, you could add a command to upload the build output to S3 or something
