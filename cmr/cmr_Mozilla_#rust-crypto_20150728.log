[01:34:42] <Ilari> Hmm... Seems like if ClientHello/ServerHello are to fix the messages in handshake, one needs to put some extensions in ServerHello instead of EncryptedExtensions (of course one could put those in EncryptedExtensions if that could affect the message sequencing).
[01:37:55] <Elainemo> Ethereum is doing something that I don't understand yet.

[16:51:09] <Elainemo> There's not a lot of technical information about the vulernability.
[16:51:35] <Elainemo> I'm curious if the attacker can disable the notification and delete the text before there's a notification (buzz or wahtever)
[16:52:24] <Ilari> I found a article that yes, the attacker can delete the message without notification.

[16:57:08] <bascule> oh, one of those
[16:57:10] <Tiffany> https://github.com/Habsup/Habsup/issues/1
[16:57:18] <Tiffany> AES-CBC with no MAC, RSA key exchange, reused nonces
[16:57:23] <bascule> :(
[16:57:27] <bascule> RSA without padding?
[16:57:33] <bascule> or with a public exponent of 1?
[16:57:34] <bascule> lol
[16:57:38] <Tiffany> it's whatever "PKCS1" in OpenSSL corresponds to
[16:57:49] <bascule> PKCS#1v1.5 probably
[16:57:59] <bascule> which is bad
[16:58:02] <bascule> but uhh
[16:58:09] <bascule> ^^^ was actually true of SaltStack's homebrew crypto, lol
[16:58:28] <bascule> the only thing they could've done worse is use a public exponent of 0
[16:58:36] <Elainemo> lol
[17:00:51] <Elainemo> Tiffany: wow that sucks.
[17:02:43] <Tiffany> urbit's crypto is not as bad as I originally thought, it turns out
[17:03:06] <Tiffany> despite their code saying "ECB", supposedly they use counter mode with the nonce set to the hash of the plaintext (which they call "HIV" mode)
[17:03:27] <Tiffany> and they do actually do a handshake, instead of just encrypting every message with RSA
[17:03:34] <Tiffany> but I think it's an RSA key exchange
[17:04:22] <Tiffany> is that special way of generating nonces actually secure?
[17:04:56] <Tiffany> I mean, there's the obvious stuff
[17:05:08] <Tiffany> you leak the hash of the message's contents, you leak whether two messages have identical content
[17:05:42] <Ilari> PHP polyfill for P-256... Probability that it isn't horribly insecure is indistinguishable from 0.
[17:06:10] <Ilari> Where "horribly insecure" probably means vulns that let one dump remote keys and such.
[17:17:59] <Ilari> P-256 and AES-GCM (without hardware acceleration) are both extremely difficult to implement.

[18:43:16] <Tiffany> what is the deal with all the stuff SIV does to generate the tag?
[18:44:35] <Tiffany> AES-CMAC, a strange 'double' operation
[18:47:45] <Tiffany> bascule: why doesn't this just use an existing MAC algorithm to generate the tag?
[18:59:41] *** Quits: erickt (erickt@moz-1mb.0ej.162.69.IP) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[19:01:18] <Tiffany> the RFC doesn't really explain why the S2V operation exists...
[19:05:54] <eternaleye> Tiffany: The point of SIV is that it's a robust, nonce-misuse-resistant AEAD
[19:06:09] <Tiffany> eternaleye: why does it need that crazy S2V construction to do it, though?
[19:06:20] <eternaleye> Tiffany: Because it was one of the first such AEADs
[19:06:28] <eternaleye> Tiffany: A better way hadn't been found yet
[19:06:31] <Tiffany> a MAC wasn't good enough?
[19:06:35] <eternaleye> Tiffany: Nope
[19:06:39] <Tiffany> why not?
[19:06:40] <eternaleye> Tiffany: MRAE is _hard_
[19:06:41] <Ilari> Tiffany: S2V looks like IV generator (also acts as a tag).
[19:06:43] <eternaleye> Tiffany: Yes.
[19:07:19] <eternaleye> Tiffany: Basically, in MRAE, if the (nonce, AD, message) tuple is unique, NOTHING can be leaked
[19:07:52] <eternaleye> Tiffany: And if the tuple is the same, the only allowable leakage is the one-bit leak of "these two messages are identical"
[19:08:05] <eternaleye> Tiffany: MRAE is very strict, and quite difficult
[19:08:13] <eternaleye> Tiffany: Only two entrants to CAESAR are MRAE
[19:08:24] <Tiffany> that still doesn't answer my question though
[19:08:36] <eternaleye> Tiffany: HS1-SIV (SIV altered to work over ChaCha) and AEZ (from the same person as SIV, Rogaway)
[19:08:56] <Tiffany> what does this construction of AES-CMAC + finite field stuff do that an existing MAC doesn't?
[19:08:59] <eternaleye> Tiffany: Basically, the cipher needs an IV that is a PRF over the tuple
[19:09:16] <eternaleye> Tiffany: They use CMAC + FF to construct a universal hashing function, IIUC
[19:09:45] <eternaleye> Tiffany: And the advantage of CMAC is that it doesn't require any primitives over a block cipher, which you already have if you're using SIV
[19:10:01] <eternaleye> Tiffany: Simplifies the security analysis, fewer pieces to break
[19:11:47] <Tiffany> I don't really understand what universal hashing is
[19:11:57] <Tiffany> if SIV was made today, you could just use poly1305 right?
[19:12:30] <Ilari> Tiffany: Nope, since Poly1305 has fixed-length key.
[19:12:39] <Tiffany> oh
[19:12:49] <Tiffany> why is the fixed length key important?
[19:13:15] <Ilari> Tiffany: You need PRF that can take arbitrary amount of input (since you need to stuff AD and plaintext there).
[19:14:12] <Tiffany> S2V doesn't seem to treat AD and plaintext as the key?
[19:15:15] <Ilari> Tiffany: Also, Poly1305 is very predictable if the key is known.
[19:15:47] <Ilari> Oops, fixed length nonce, not fixed-length key.
[19:16:24] <Tiffany> I don't really understand the constraints here
[19:17:07] <eternaleye> Tiffany: For MRAE, the cipher needs an IV that is derived from _all three of_ the AD, the message, and the input nonce.
[19:17:35] <eternaleye> Tiffany: That derivation needs to be a strong PRF, in order to guarantee indistinguishability if any of them changes
[19:18:48] <Ilari> Tiffany: The problem with Poly1305 is that the key is only 32 bytes, and if it is ever repeats for two different messages, the key can be solved for.
[19:19:21] <Tiffany> oh
[19:22:40] <Ilari> And the reason why using HMAC won't work is that HMAC is too slow.
[19:23:11] <Tiffany> oh
[19:23:24] <Tiffany> but it would be secure, if you used it?
[19:23:31] <Tiffany> is blake2b too slow, or otherwise unfit?
[19:24:22] <Ilari> Too slow (despite being very fast for a hash function).
[19:27:27] <Tiffany> huh
[19:27:52] <Ilari> Oh fun: One website doesn't work here... And traceroute shows loop between 3 routers.
[19:28:04] <Tiffany> heh
