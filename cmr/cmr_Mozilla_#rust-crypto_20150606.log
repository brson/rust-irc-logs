[01:57:39] <bascule> I <3 Yubico but
[02:10:14] <Ilari> Wrong about what?
[02:14:20] <bascule> "I believe you are mistaken.  OpenPGP with EdDSA only hashes once, during
[02:14:20] <bascule> streaming.
[02:17:19] <Ilari> At least according to the spec, EdDSA in OpenPGP hashes the stream with hash function and then signs the hash using EdDSA. Section 5.
[02:18:49] <Ilari> Might have been unclear (Wiio's laws and all that).
[02:19:14] <eternaleye> Yeah, I think it reads like they claim only one _invocation_ of the hash function
[02:19:32] <eternaleye> Ignoring that EdDSA includes invocations within itself
[02:19:55] <bascule> Ilari: this guy seems to do a fairly decent amount of work drafting specifications, but he points me at some pretty crazysauce code like "go use that, seems fine" o_O

[02:32:45] <Ilari> (The attacks won't work, that is)
[02:35:42] <bascule> attacks that don't work are the best
[02:36:05] <bascule> that's called "when I'm on the on-call rotation that has to review bug bounty entries"
[02:36:25] <bascule> a.k.a. argue with pedantic people about why silly things aren't actually vulns
[02:36:44] <bascule> like "congratulations, you found a bug with no security impact. thanks, but that's out-of-scope"
[02:38:11] <Ilari> More like programming equivalent of: What if unconditional branch isn't taken? :-)
[02:39:07] <bascule> heh
[02:39:34] <bascule> Ilari: that's how I feel about FFDHE as a "backup" for ECC
[02:39:35] <bascule> it's like
[02:39:36] <bascule> ok
[02:39:42] <bascule> there's an ECC catastrophe
[02:39:46] <bascule> it affects all curves
[02:40:03] <bascule> so... solving DLP for elliptic curves over finite fields of a large characteristic
[02:40:16] <bascule> but not generally solving DLP for finite fields of a large characteristic
[02:40:31] <bascule> so we have a backup with a lot of convoluted technical caveats where somehow it doesn't break too
[02:40:39] <bascule> and the most likely threat seems to be quantum computers?
[02:41:19] <Ilari> For prime curves, there isn't even publically known technique that can get good handle at the structure.
[02:43:46] <Ilari> The results are like: For Curve25519, one can accelerate breaking of keys from ~2^126 time to ~2^84 time by employing table of size ~2^84, which takes ~2^168 time to compute. Whereas table of much smaller size could accelerate DH3k to practically breakable levels (but the table itself seems to be unreachable effort).
[02:47:12] <Ilari> Whereas for anything with exponent >2, one can likely get good enough handle that it is broken (except maybe binary, but that looks broken in other ways).
[02:48:17] <Ilari> Some think that the attack against binary curves recently published doesn't actually work in complexity advertised (i.e. the complexity estimate is wrong).
[03:48:59] <eternaleye> bascule: Doesn't Google want to do fixed-DH with (very) short lifetimes?
[04:21:11] <bascule> eternaleye: I don't know, although Sleevi defended FFDHE so *shrug*

[10:51:46] <eternaleye> bascule: Re the guy asking about credentials on CFRG, I figure they are (mis)using ZKP to mean "Eavesdroppers can't use this to fake it for themselves" (so giving the same cred to everyone won't work), and the anonymity requirement means that the cred being a signature on some per-person ID is out as well
[10:52:29] <eternaleye> bascule: http://eprint.iacr.org/2008/428 is a pretty interesting option, though
[10:52:46] <eternaleye> bascule: In particular, the delegation of the credentials has real possibilities
[10:54:00] <eternaleye> bascule: The federal government could hold a toplevel credental for the (national) driving age, delegate it to the various DMVs at level 1, and then each driver gets it at level 2. Then you just verify that they posess a credential at level 2 from the root.
[10:54:17] <eternaleye> *credential
[10:55:14] <eternaleye> I don't remember if that paper had a revocation system, though
[11:01:14] <eternaleye> Ah, it doesn't, but another paper ("Solving Revocation with Efficient Update of Anonymous Credentials", Camenish, Kohlweiss, and Soriente 2011) does
[11:03:10] <eternaleye> Huh, it actually seems to have some things in common with Macaroons using third-party caveats in terms of the actual workflow
[11:03:23] <eternaleye> (the 2011 paper, that is)
[11:04:05] <eternaleye> The underlying math is completely different, but the process is similar (of requiring periodic revalidation by embedding a lifetime)
[11:15:09] <eternaleye> bascule: ...hm, I also suspect there's a (mildly silly) equivalence between unlinkable Chaumian e-cash and anonymous credentials.
[11:15:56] <eternaleye> bascule: Specifically, if you instantiate an e-cash currency per credential type, and issue coins on-demand to valid credential bearers, then verifiers just take the "merchant" role.

[19:43:53] <Ilari> As for doing client certs at HTTP level, one could avoid some problems with TLS-level client certs.
[19:51:37] <Ilari> "If we are going to fully satisfy TLS everywhere we have to support mechanisms that allow embedded devices to acquire certs both automatically and with local admin override." -- TLS in embedded has been pretty much a disaster.
[19:54:14] <bascule> :(
[19:54:33] <bascule> or... pretty much anywhere outside the browser
[19:57:58] <Ilari> The reason why TLS in embedded is a disaster is that the ciphers and protocol versions choosen are dodgy, and the devices get used for a LONG time without upgrading. And then to interop with that, one needs code for the ciphers/versions, which is of course dangerous to security.
[19:59:44] <Ilari> At least cert validation failures one often sees in non-browser use of TLS don't endanger others.
[20:15:20] <Ilari> Well, it wouldn't be so bad if TLS wasn't bad protocol and cipher choices were on mark. I mean, one could have choosen ciphers in 2001 that even if not very hot today would still be very solid.
