[01:19:11] <acrichto> Seldaek: http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/master/extra/treemap/struct.TreeMap.html
[01:19:15] <acrichto> also cmr
[01:19:26] <acrichto> how would you feel about by-default no documentation shown on trait methods
[01:19:39] <acrichto> or actually what I'd rather see
[01:19:42] <cmr> Trait methods == provided methods == default methods?
[01:19:49] <acrichto> is "fn foo()                                      [from trait XXX]"
[01:20:04] <acrichto> umm, bottom of the page
[01:20:11] <acrichto> only when you're looking at enums/structs
[01:20:33] <acrichto> so right now if you want "all methods", it's still kinda tough to get
[01:20:40] <acrichto> lots of tabbing in and out
[01:21:10] <acrichto> maybe I'd just prefer the trait name to be smaller and on the right instead
[01:21:16] <acrichto> so it doesn't clutter up all the stuff on the left
[01:21:22] <acrichto> and then removing documentation from those pages
[01:21:27] <cmr> So, it'd just show fn decode(....) -> TreeMap [from Decodable<D>] ?
[01:21:27] <acrichto> because you can always click through to the trait
[01:21:43] <acrichto> yeah the problem with that is then everything has [from trait XXX]
[01:21:53] <acrichto> which is too much, so it should probably only be mentioned once
[01:22:06] <cmr> I agree that the current presentation is noisy and hard to read.
[01:22:52] <acrichto> we really need to hide priv things :(
[01:23:19] <acrichto> I'd like to merge https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9432 though
[01:23:25] <acrichto> the analysis outputs would be really useful
[01:23:37] <acrichto> anyway, brb
[01:24:21] <cmr> acrichto: bring it up at the meeting tomorrow!
[01:26:03] <cmr> acrichto: One easy fix, I think, would be not-rendering the full path
[01:26:04] <cmr> so like
[01:26:08] <cmr> std::cmp::TotalOrd
[01:26:11] <cmr> becomes TotalOrd
[01:26:17] <cmr> and it shows the full path when you hover over it
[01:26:22] <cmr> Also ideally it'd be a hyperlink to the trait
[01:26:34] <cmr> Same for when K, V is referenced later.
[01:41:34] <acrichto> that's b/c they're xcrate references
[01:41:37] <acrichto> the full paths
[01:41:47] <acrichto> inside of libstd they aren't full paths
[01:42:05] <acrichto> but lol my agenda items are already large in number :P
[01:46:10] <cmr> Are you the only full-time rust developer? It seems many of the others are also working on servo
[01:55:34] <acrichto> I think tjc is a full-timer as well
[01:55:47] <acrichto> most others seem like they've got servo + other projects
[01:55:54] <cmr> mmm
[01:55:55] <acrichto> I personally want to stay full-time on rust :P
[01:56:01] <cmr> I personally want that too :P
[01:58:23] <acrichto> man I wish we could hire like all of #rust
[01:58:31] <acrichto> that would be awesome lol
[01:58:38] <cmr> I'd pick strcat next
[01:58:49] <cmr> Then get aatch out of his PHP job
[01:58:51] <cmr> :P
[01:59:03] <acrichto> lol
[02:23:41] <acrichto> cmr: why does Import have an array?
[02:23:49] <acrichto> in ViewItemInner
[02:25:23] <cmr> use a::{b, c, d};
[02:25:38] <acrichto> that's ImportList
[02:25:41] <cmr> Oh
[02:25:43] <cmr> Hmm
[02:26:20] <acrichto> cmr: see rusti in #rust
[04:37:09] <acrichto> started filtering based on privacy
[04:37:13] <acrichto> everything disappeared
[04:37:14] <acrichto> whoops
[04:37:47] <cmr> heh
[04:39:58] <acrichto> do you know if trait implementatio methods are TyMethod or Method ?
[04:40:05] <acrichto> in impl Trait for Type
[04:40:40] <acrichto> cmr: ^
[04:47:54] <cmr> acrichto: no idea!
[04:47:56] <cmr> I think it's Method
[04:48:07] <cmr> I could barely tell the difference when I was *writing* that code
[04:48:22] <acrichto> looks like it's mixed
[04:48:26] <acrichto> impls show up as Method
[04:48:33] <acrichto> traits show up as TraitMethod/Method
[05:06:47] <acrichto> cmr: opinion?
[05:06:51] <acrichto> struct with only priv fields
[05:07:03] <acrichto>  // some fields filtered
[05:07:07] <acrichto> or show them all with 'priv' in front?

[07:38:53] <Seldaek> acrichto: regarding your question (damned time zones make communication hard unless I hang here in the evening:/) would that mean you wouldn't see what type params etc are in the impl of a trait?
[07:39:06] <Seldaek> you'd just see the method is from trait X but not see with what you can use it?
[07:39:22] <Seldaek> sounds like a regression to me in a way, but it would sure clean it up visually.. 
[07:39:43] <Seldaek> I'm not too happy with those impl/method lists but there is so much info it's hard to organize 
[07:40:49] <acrichto> Seldaek: oh yeah no you should definitely still see all the typarams
[07:40:58] <acrichto> basically the conclusion that cmr and I reached was:
[07:41:13] <acrichto> 1. Remove all documentation by default (you can click the trait and see it if you want)
[07:41:25] <acrichto> 2. Make the headers for what impl it's on much smaller and possibly to the right,
[07:41:35] <acrichto> that way you can quickly scan down on the left and see what's what
[07:41:39] <acrichto> in theory at least
[07:42:18] <Seldaek> hmm okay
[07:42:52] <Seldaek> I don't see how that will work in my head right now but I hope it's just me and it'll be amazing :p
[07:44:12] <Seldaek> I mean the problem is that the impl lines are very long
[07:44:16] <Seldaek> even if you reduce the font size
[07:44:57] <acrichto> oh well I can tell you that you're far more qualified of a designer than I am
[07:45:13] <acrichto> I was just curious what you thought about it
[07:45:28] <acrichto> it's still semi-difficult to answer "I have a HashMap, what can I do with it?"
[07:46:17] <Seldaek> well, one thing perhaps that would be good is as cmr said before to convert the list of derived trait impls to just that: a list of derived trait with just links to the traits
[07:46:39] <Seldaek> since those are very common, it would remove some clutter, and people will quickly learn what they mean anyway so won't have to click too often to get details
[07:46:43] <acrichto> that seems like it'd make it harder though
[07:46:53] <Seldaek> how so?
[07:46:53] <acrichto> some are common like Eq/Clone, things like Map aren't so common
[07:47:01] <Seldaek> hm fair enough
[07:47:09] <acrichto> it's till be nice to have a list of methods somewhere of what methods you could call on a struct
[07:47:17] <acrichto> it'd still*
[07:47:28] <Seldaek> let's just reboot the language and do docs driven development :P
[07:47:32] <Seldaek> this is too hard to represent
[07:47:34] <acrichto> lol
[07:47:39] <acrichto> kinda true :P
[07:48:24] <Seldaek> oh one thing you missed that might help a bit.. let me dig the commit
[07:48:39] <Seldaek> (I said *a bit*;)
[07:49:17] <acrichto> ?
[07:49:23] <Seldaek> if you could render all fn names  like this: <strong class="fnname">' + fn.name + '</strong>
[07:49:33] <Seldaek> then css https://github.com/Seldaek/rustdoc_web/commit/94f8f5bc3866752d294c9a329dc7c0a6e23400b3#L2R160
[07:49:51] <acrichto> oh yeah!
[07:50:08] <acrichto> did you see that trait dox have links as well?
[07:50:10] <Seldaek> it highlights the names a bit, makes it just a bit easier to scan
[07:50:26] <acrichto> yeah i totally agree
[07:50:31] <acrichto> http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/master/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html
[07:50:37] <acrichto> right now they're bolded a bit for being links
[07:50:41] <acrichto> which may not be so nice
[07:50:57] <Seldaek> ah yes that is cool
[07:50:59] <Seldaek> no no that's fine
[07:51:04] <Seldaek> the css above anyway makes them bold
[07:51:05] <Seldaek> + colored
[07:51:12] <acrichto> think it's still worth it to make them colored?
[07:51:49] <Seldaek> I'd say yes because it's the fn color 
[07:51:53] <Seldaek> #8c6067
[07:52:09] <Seldaek> take a look, it's a fairly light saturation anyway
[07:52:31] <acrichto> yeah I like the color
[07:52:37] <Seldaek> oh wait no
[07:52:45] <Seldaek> the css makes it un-bold even when it's links ;)
[07:52:54] <Seldaek> http://seld.be/rustdoc/master/std/hashmap/struct.HashMap.html
[07:52:58] <Seldaek> that one has it if you wanna see
[07:53:12] <acrichto> would you prefer bolded or un-bolded?
[07:53:19] <Seldaek> not sure about the bold or not for links really
[07:53:31] <acrichto> other ones appear all bold
[07:53:34] <Seldaek> yeah
[07:53:38] <acrichto> so perhaps for consistency
[07:53:46] <Seldaek> I guess just remove the font-weight:normal from .fnname 
[07:53:52] <Seldaek> so links are bold and not links are not bold
[07:53:54] <Seldaek> probably best
[07:54:02] <acrichto> I'm generating a large queue of patches to go into rustdoc
[07:54:08] <acrichto> so I think this'll just get thrown in with that
[07:54:12] <Seldaek> alright
[07:54:13] <acrichto> trying to render use statements right now
[07:54:15] <acrichto> they're hard :(
[07:54:23] <Seldaek> the pub uses?
[07:54:31] <acrichto> yeah
[07:54:33] <Seldaek> why hard?
[07:54:42] <acrichto> I want to linkify all components
[07:54:50] <Seldaek> ah yeah that's probably nasty 
[07:54:54] <acrichto> there's various bugs in rustdoc that I've been fixing along the way as well
[07:55:04] <Seldaek> I took the easy way out on that one.. http://seld.be/rustdoc/master/std/hashmap/index.html
[07:55:05] <acrichto> also hooking more into resolve
[07:55:18] <acrichto> that's actually a rustdoc bug lol
[07:55:22] <acrichto> none of those are 'pub use'
[07:55:32] <Seldaek> eh well ok that is another problem:p
[07:55:38] <acrichto> that part I've fixed
[07:55:43] <Seldaek> ok cool
[07:57:23] <Seldaek> btw one thing I would recommend because I've seen it be a problem on many doc sites that serve multiple versions, is canonical URLs.. the only one I saw doing this right has a /current/ version that is the latest release, then we can still have /master/, /0.7/  etc
[07:57:39] <Seldaek> but all the others would have a canonical meta tag pointing to the same url under /current/
[07:58:11] <Seldaek> that effectively gives you always the most relevant results in google, as opposed to getting 0.4 results randomly
[07:58:21] <Seldaek> I can report an issue if you like
[07:58:40] <acrichto> yeah an issue would be nice I think
[07:58:44] <Seldaek> alright
[07:58:48] <acrichto> could you also open one for function colors while you're at it?
[07:58:51] <acrichto> feel free to assign me to it
[07:59:11] <Seldaek> it's not critical because the day you add it it'll clean up the google index pretty quick anyway
[07:59:17] <Seldaek> but it should be done at some point IMO
[07:59:34] <acrichto> makes sense to me
[08:00:23] <Seldaek> as for broader changes to the way things are rendered, if you want to discuss it maybe doing plain html mockups is easier than to discuss things here
[08:00:40] <Seldaek> and faster feedback loop than going through bors & builds :)
[08:01:24] <acrichto> yeah definitely
[08:01:24] <Seldaek> I'll be in argentina next two weeks, it should help the timezone issue :p
[08:01:29] <acrichto> lol
[08:01:36] <acrichto> what's the utc offset there?
[08:01:46] <Seldaek> -3 I think now
[08:01:57] <acrichto> that's a lot farther east than I thought
[08:02:02] <acrichto> but I'm terrible at geography :P
[08:02:27] <Seldaek> http://www.worldtimezone.com/ :p
[08:02:57] <Seldaek> south america is actually pretty much all east of the US east coast
[08:03:09] <Seldaek> never thought of it like this.. 
[08:03:28] <Seldaek> you're in SF right?
[08:03:56] <acrichto> yeah
[08:03:58] <acrichto> but weird...
[08:04:03] <acrichto> the planet is crazy man
[08:04:36] <Seldaek> hehe
[09:11:27] <Seldaek> acrichto: can't assign you since I'm not a contributor, but you're cc'd

[14:41:31] <cmr> acrichto: Private fields are still hard
[14:41:37] <cmr> acrichto: You need to indicate somehow that it can't be constructed
[14:51:26] <dbaupp> struct Foo { public: int, priv private: int } -> "struct Foo { public: int, ... }"
[14:51:38] <dbaupp> (maybe?)
[14:52:25] <cmr> Mmm that's a nice way of doing it
[14:52:30] <Seldaek> IMO show nothing or show them, but "..." is just teasing people that know, and confusing those who don't 
[14:52:45] <Seldaek> sorry to be mr killjoy all the time
[14:52:53] <cmr> Seldaek: no, it's good
[14:53:01] <cmr> The problem with showing them is that they're completely useless
[14:53:04] <cmr> You can't do anything with them
[14:53:27] <Seldaek> yes, I'd rather not show them but either mark the struct as "priv struct"  or find another way to indicate this is private
[14:53:32] <Seldaek> because I guess priv struct is wrong too
[14:54:00] <Seldaek> I mean it could be in the page title "Struct Foo (private)"
[14:54:07] <Seldaek> makes it kinda obvious then
[14:54:25] <Seldaek> not to say there isn't a more elegant way, but at least it'd be visible
[14:55:11] <dbaupp> what happens when you have some public fields?
[14:55:34] <Seldaek> you can still show those no?
[14:55:54] <dbaupp> "struct Foo { public: int, (private) }" ?
[14:56:02] <Seldaek> a priv struct means you can't instantiate it but you can use it's public fields if something public returns it to you right?
[14:56:14] <dbaupp> yeah
[14:56:14] <cmr> no, that's a struct with private fields
[14:56:18] <Seldaek> dbaupp: I meant the page title
[14:56:22] <dbaupp> oh
[14:56:24] <cmr> priv struct is entirely unaccessible, I thought
[14:56:37] <dbaupp> hm, I'm possibly "solving" a different problem
[14:56:47] <Seldaek> get your stories sorted :P
[14:56:54] <dbaupp> cmr: I think it can still be returned from functions
[14:57:00] <acrichto> oh the question is if you have >= 0 public fields and > 0 private fields, how should you display the struct?
[14:57:12] <cmr> dbaupp: right, but I don't think you can access even the public fields
[14:57:13] <cmr> Not sure
[14:57:21] <acrichto> I was looking at the go documentation and they have "// some fields filtered" or something like that
[14:58:08] <dbaupp> (see #rust)
[14:58:50] <cmr> Well, that answers that.
[15:02:03] <Seldaek> acrichto: yeah it might be better than just an enigmatic "..."
[15:02:29] <acrichto> sounds like we should just show them for now
[15:02:42] <acrichto> I suppose doc(hidden) would still work, albeit annoyingly so
[21:28:00] <Seldaek> acrichto, cmr, dbaupp ping?
[21:28:09] <acrichto> pong
[21:28:09] <cmr> Seldaek: good timing, just finished up classes for the day :)
[21:28:49] <Seldaek> I couldn't resist, had to try something.. would love feedback
[21:28:54] <Seldaek> http://d.pr/i/1E2e
[21:29:14] <Seldaek> it isn't much changes, just trying to have common links more prominents and parsable
[21:29:37] <Seldaek> also I'm thinking it's time to promote stable releases over master
[21:29:49] <Seldaek> for doc links
[21:29:59] <Seldaek> well, it's time when 0.8 is out I mean
[21:30:02] <acrichto> haha you're ambitious
[21:30:16] <acrichto> not bad though, I like it
[21:31:55] <Seldaek> just annoys me every time I have to go dig for that Standard | Extra in the side bar:p
[21:32:18] <acrichto> I'm not entirely sure how to update the website itself
[21:32:28] <cmr> graydon has a rust-www repo or something, iirc
[21:32:30] <Seldaek> I know how to that' snot an issue
[21:32:36] <Seldaek> that one I can handle ;)
[21:32:41] <acrichto> lgtm
[21:33:08] <Seldaek> guess I'll send a PR then to get broader feedback
[21:33:12] <Seldaek> after a few more nitpicks
[21:33:17] <cmr> Seldaek: I like it!
[21:33:31] <cmr> acrichto: should probably get the core devs to hash out a better summary while we're redesigning
[21:33:38] <cmr> because the current one is nonsensical, IMO
[21:33:44] <cmr> "Here's a pile of buzzwords!"
[21:33:59] <cmr> And it hasn't changed since 0.1 or before
[21:34:01] <cmr> So..
[21:34:08] <Seldaek> yeah I agree the content should be reviewed
[21:34:15] <Seldaek> not a task I can undertake though
[21:34:17] <acrichto> probably worth at least looking at again heh
[21:34:30] <cmr> Seldaek: What's the hash sign icon between github and twitter?
[21:34:35] <Seldaek> IRC :(
[21:34:38] <cmr> oh!
[21:34:46] <cmr> I don't think that's a good idea
[21:34:57] <cmr> If it's not obvious to me...
[21:34:59] <Seldaek> well, yeah, it does have an alt 
[21:35:10] <cmr> ah, that'd help
[21:35:11] <Seldaek> but I know it sucks
[21:35:31] <Seldaek> I wish there was an official irc icon of some sort
[21:35:35] <Seldaek> # is as close as it gets 
[21:35:39] <cmr> Seldaek: "also I'm thinking it's time to promote stable releases over master"
[21:35:46] <cmr> I disagree very strongly.
[21:35:50] <cmr> They aren't really stable releases
[21:35:55] <cmr> Just time-based snapshots of the current state.
[21:37:11] <Seldaek> yes and no, I mean yes but ultimatley most people just download those and start off using them
[21:37:30] <Seldaek> and now that syntax changes are calming down and hopefully std a bit too
[21:37:46] <acrichto> syntax is pretty good for now, apis are still very much in flux
[21:37:58] <Seldaek> I figure maybe less and less people will run off master
[21:39:54] <cmr> Yes and no
[21:40:03] <cmr> There's still a lot of work to be done around closures and the rt
[21:40:22] <Seldaek> I see
[21:40:39] <Seldaek> I killed the tutorial/manual links to master though
[22:11:34] <Seldaek> cmr: reported an issue for content updating too..
[22:11:41] <Seldaek> let's hope someone cares :p
[22:13:33] <Seldaek> and on that note, Europe out.
[23:14:13] <acrichto> https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9475
[23:14:15] <acrichto> alright that's good for now
[23:14:24] <acrichto> I will land that, then make another round of improvements later
[23:15:42] <dbaupp> acrichto: the pub use clickability is cool
[23:15:48] <dbaupp> (weird that foo::{} imports aren't?)
[23:17:03] <acrichto> resolve is a bit tricky with those
[23:17:08] <acrichto> you can click all the destinations 
[23:17:12] <acrichto> but the sources are a little harder
[23:17:29] <acrichto> I suppose not that much harder though
[23:17:31] <acrichto> just annoying mostly
[23:18:08] <dbaupp> yeah
[23:41:01] <cmr> acrichto: http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~acrichto/doc/extra/getopts/index.html
[23:41:08] <cmr> acrichto: you broke `# Foo` being a heading
[23:41:38] <acrichto> whoops
[23:53:52] <acrichto> just pushed a fix
