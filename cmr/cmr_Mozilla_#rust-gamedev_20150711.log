[02:55:39] <jpernst> yeah, coming from c#, editing rust is painfully spartan
[02:55:44] <jpernst> took a while to adapt
[02:56:11] <DroidLogician> someone needs to convince Jetbrains to write a Rust IDE
[02:56:16] <jpernst> i'd love that
[02:56:29] <DroidLogician> there is an IDEA plugin but it's been dead for a while
[02:56:44] <DroidLogician> I dunno if they have protocol for putting dead plugins into receivership

[02:59:21] <WindowsBunny> I'm personally waiting for VisualRust to get cargo integration
[02:59:27] <WindowsBunny> and eventually, fancy intellisense
[02:59:57] <DroidLogician> something about Windows dev just turns me off
[03:00:04] <DroidLogician> I think it's the recommended code style for C#
[03:00:34] <DroidLogician> that or POSIX APIs just seem to be generally more common-sense oriented

[03:12:31] <WindowsBunny> jpernst: msys2 uses mingw-w64, and provides both 64 and 32 bit versions of it
[03:12:43] <Layl> it's very confusing
[03:12:45] <WindowsBunny> so you use mingw64_shell.bat when you want 64-bit and mingw32_shell.bat when you want 32-bit
[03:12:56] <jpernst> sounds like things have improved substantially then
[03:12:58] <WindowsBunny> and for the most part things just work

[05:02:27] <pierre_m> dlight, what vesrions of opengl do those go over?
[05:02:59] <dlight> they are all for modern opengl (3.something)
[05:03:43] <pierre_m> i'm still debating what i want to do, my opengl knowledge is from the 1.5 days
[05:04:04] <pierre_m> glium or learn opengl 3.2/3.3
[05:04:08] <dlight> the font on the last book render very ugly here, but the Firefox readability button fixes it
[05:04:18] <dlight> pierre_m, with glium you need to learn opengl anyway
[05:04:41] <pierre_m> gotcha, things aren't that abstracted away then.
[05:06:07] <dlight> I think glium and gfx have a very solid win: you don't need to litter your code with glBind(something), effectively emulating direct state access even if the underlying opengl driver don't support it

[06:02:01] <Elaine> the world will never know
[06:02:16] <pierre_m> tomaka, would you reccomend https://github.com/PistonDevelopers/glium_graphics or not?
[06:02:37] <pierre_m> that is true Elaine, very true.
[06:02:39] <Elaine> piston's graphics library is primitive and slow, but if it works for you, it works.e
[06:02:54] <tomaka> yes ^
[06:03:07] <pierre_m> Then i'll take a stab at it there
[06:03:17] <tomaka> as a beginner you probably won't be able to write something faster though
[06:03:34] <pierre_m> I'm only looking for 2d right now anyway
[06:04:02] <pierre_m> sprites and the like right now.
[06:04:28] <tomaka> if, for example, you want to draw 10 000 sprites per frame, it can either run at 100fps or 2fps depending how you code it
[06:04:52] <pierre_m> right

[06:07:26] * rsaarelm grumbles about https://github.com/tomaka/cpal/issues/39
[06:09:46] <rsaarelm> Spent a while at that before I figured to check the bug tracker.
[06:10:12] <tomaka> hmm
[06:10:22] <tomaka> This bug is a bit weird
[06:10:39] <tomaka> when playing an Ogg file everything seems correct
[06:10:45] <tomaka> I mean a vorbis file
[06:10:55] <tomaka> And vorbis also uses signed/unsigned shorts
[06:11:13] <tomaka> on the other hand, this bug was opened because someone's hear thinks it is wrong
[06:11:20] <mindtree> I think that issue was just with the phase of the sin though, wasn't it?
[06:11:21] <tomaka> that's not really scientific
[06:11:34] <tomaka> someone's ear*
[06:12:08] <tomaka> I still don't know what the problem is exactly
[06:12:30] <rsaarelm> The thing I ran into wasn't subtle at all, if I try to operate in u16 like the buffer is, the moment my wave goes above 2**15, it turns into a 100 % volume blare.
[06:13:10] <mindtree> rsaarelm: that sounds like a diff problem?
[06:13:49] <rsaarelm> So I'd have a sine wave running along what I think is the center line at 2**15, and I make it sin(x) * 0.001 and I get 100 % volume because the bad conversion makes the actual value jump between i16 min and i16 max.
[06:14:49] <mindtree> rsaarelm: what os are you on?
[06:14:51] <rsaarelm> And the solution is the same as the comment in the bug report, do my wave math in [-2**15, 2**15] with midline at zero and then just cast to u16 and let it wrap the negatives around.
[06:14:53] <tomaka> I see
[06:14:55] <rsaarelm> Linux.
[06:15:51] <tomaka> my guess is that's it's likely a problem with the interaction with ALSA
[06:15:52] <rsaarelm> The ogg example sounds fine for me too.
[06:15:58] <tomaka> ah
[06:16:10] <rsaarelm> I guess the ogg data module it uses mangles the shorts correctly.

[09:37:51] <WindowsBunny> so if the GPU resets the driver can resend those commands
[09:38:01] <WindowsBunny> I wonder if Vulkan will do that for you

[09:41:12] <OmniMancer> I'm not sure
[09:41:31] <OmniMancer> that level of stuff is a bit weird
[09:41:56] <OmniMancer> also I'd think htat whatever strategy it used would not be foolproof

[10:37:26] <eddyb> ah
[10:37:31] <tomaka> not "change" but just "set"
[10:37:59] <tomaka> with mantle/vulkan, just creating a buffer is a challenge
[10:38:28] <tomaka> the most efficient way is to create a local buffer, a remote buffer, and then setup the DMA to copy from the former to the latter
[10:38:58] <OmniMancer> I think most of this just exposes the pain that the driver has to do to make GL actually work :P
[10:42:00] <tomaka> it's also useful to actually understand what OpenGL is doing
[10:42:28] <tomaka> understand why your thing-that's-supposed-to-run-at-400-fps actually runs at 5fps
[10:42:42] <OmniMancer> yea
[10:42:52] <OmniMancer> the way graphics hardware actually works is really interesting

[12:42:27] <tomaka> there's also a plan to allow creating a Voice with a specific format, but it's more difficult to implement because I have to check what is supported and what isn't
[12:42:38] <OmniMancer> ah

[12:43:03] <tomaka> yes there are getters

[12:43:30] <tomaka> the only benefit of submitting the right format is better performances
[12:44:39] <tomaka> the idea behind this design is that in the worst case scenario cpal can handle a chip that expects a precise format
[12:45:06] <OmniMancer> most of the codecs I have looked at treat stereo as just two separate channels, perhaps with inter-channel correlation reduction, but interleaving the channels isn't hard to do for playback

[13:37:05] <OmniMancer> does anything ever use 32bit fixed point samples?
[13:37:15] <tomaka> ecogiko: the easiest short term solution is to manually create a glium::texture::RawImage2d from the SubImage
[13:37:20] <tomaka> and use that as input for Texture2d::,new

[19:24:19] <rAad> I don't have much practical advice, but http://rsaarelm.github.io/ is a good read for problems with Rust and the way you're describing.
[19:24:33] <rAad> I myself am working through the very same issue (I'm writing a roguelike)
[19:24:51] <Tiffany> you could have a Vec of entities and then two indexes based on column and row

[19:26:26] <Tiffany> sort of, except that you want to store indexes into the entity vector
[19:26:40] <Tiffany> you can get away with only storing one index if you store entities in the same tile contiguously

[19:29:23] <Tiffany> are you actually doing something that needs a data structure optimized for very fast accesses like this though?
[19:30:31] <Tiffany> also, the solution depends on how sparse your data is
[19:30:43] <Tiffany> do you expect to have few entities spread over a large grid, or many entities packed together?
[19:31:33] <Amaranth> Sounds like you just need a Vec and some helpers to grab all the entries from a row or column, don't see how you're going to get much faster
[19:31:34] <rovar> would be relatively dense
[19:31:43] *** Joins: nwin (textual@moz-jnocob.pools.arcor-ip.net)
[19:32:16] <Tiffany> yeah, an O(N) search is fine until proven too slow
[19:32:17] <rovar> I don't think I need to go so far as indexing.. 
[19:32:18] <Amaranth> I mean, you can precompute what the rows and columns are but why? The couple of CPU instructions to calculate it are probably free when compared to the memory access to load the data
[19:33:07] <Amaranth> If you're grabbing an entire row or column at a time they're probably literally free because the CPU will just calculate them while waiting for the previous one to load

[19:34:34] <rAad> My current implementation uses a Vec and some helpers to be able to index it as if it was a 2D array since mostly I'm iterating through the rows.

[21:24:15] <rovar> Amaranth, I would assume that both the rows and the columns vector would be resident in cache in most cases..   I guess both approach depend greatly on the size of the matrix

[21:24:50] <Amaranth> rovar: But then you either need to duplicate your data or store pointers to it
[21:25:35] <Amaranth> Duplicating it would still get you that cache friendly setup I suppose but pointers would be more likely

[21:41:01] <rovar> Amaranth, right.. 2 vectors of refcells, one column oriented and the other row oriented should do the trick :)

[21:42:33] <Amaranth> rovar: Two vectors of pointers, wonder if the prefetcher is smart enough to chase them ahead of time
[21:46:41] <rovar> well.. if it were just pointers it would fit into 8 cache lines
[21:46:56] <rovar> uhmm
[21:48:22] <rovar> I'm going to start with the easiest to code :)
