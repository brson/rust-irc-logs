[02:00:10] <bjz> brson: woops, dropped out there
[02:00:30] <bjz> brson: also posted thoughts on mascots: https://github.com/TheHydroImpulse/rust-website/issues/6
[02:03:38] <TheHydroImpulse> brson It's going pretty well. Started prototyping some designs for the documentation and added some more screenshots to the repo.
[02:04:29] <bjz> TheHydroImpulse: cool!
[02:08:11] <bjz> We should also probably think about a style guide
[02:08:59] <TheHydroImpulse> bjz Style guide for writing or design?
[02:13:04] <bjz> I was thinking more for identity stuff
[02:14:20] <bjz> So that future sites, shirts, stickers, etc are consistent
[02:15:07] <bjz> But that could include copywriting - I'm not sure
[02:15:20] <bjz> Style guides are a pain though :P
[02:15:42] <TheHydroImpulse> bjz ahh, ok. Yeah, they take a lot of work.
[02:15:45] <bjz> but very useful, especially on a big distributed project like Rust
[02:16:36] <bjz> maybe just something we should have in the back of our minds is all
[02:17:48] <bjz> it's just I've noticed that Rust collateral has been quite varied of the moment
[02:18:12] <bjz> the docs are styled differently to the main site, with a different header font
[02:18:32] <bjz> sometimes a logo with a gradient is used, sometimes not
[02:18:52] <TheHydroImpulse> bjz Yeah, definitely.
[02:19:07] <bjz> there's no clear idea where the type on the logo should go
[02:19:20] <bjz> things like that
[02:20:24] <bjz> TheHydroImpulse: I can probably assist in some areas, but I have other commitments
[02:20:40] <TheHydroImpulse> bjz Sounds good.
[02:21:40] <bjz> but yeah, would be awesome to have something great!
[02:21:52] <brson> I love it when Rust things are great!
[02:21:54] <bjz> what is your interest in rust by the way?
[02:22:00] <bjz> just curious
[02:22:04] <bjz> brson: \o/
[02:22:11] <bjz> brson: <3 rust
[02:22:45] <TheHydroImpulse> bjz Are you asking me?
[02:22:54] <bjz> TheHydroImpulse: yes :D
[02:23:04] <bjz> TheHydroImpulse: brson is well accounted for ;)
[02:23:33] <bjz> (he leads the rust project at mozilla btw)
[02:24:43] <TheHydroImpulse> bjz hehe, yeah, just making sure. I've been looking for a replacement for C++. I hated Go and D didn't sit well with me.
[02:25:59] <bjz> yeah, sounds like me
[02:26:50] <bjz> I also looked at haskell, but it din't have the low level control and the laziness was an issue
[02:27:14] <bjz> ATS is kinda insane, nimrod is GCed and doesn't have the safety stuff that rust has
[02:27:37] <bjz> I also love immutable by default... <3 <3
[02:27:52] <bjz> and of course DDC is dead
[02:27:54] <TheHydroImpulse> bjz Yeah. I'm a huge fan of Clojure, and love it for high-level stuff, but the JVM is pretty heavyweight. Plus many of my current projects require precise control.
[02:29:14] <bjz> what kind of projects?
[02:29:30] <TheHydroImpulse> Distributed Systems more less.
[02:29:55] <bjz> Ah nice
[02:30:03] <bjz> not Erlang or Elixir?
[02:30:20] <TheHydroImpulse> I tried to get into it, but just never clicked.
[02:30:33] <bjz> Ah
[02:31:29] <bjz> so you wouldn't use a glue language on top of Rust?
[02:32:15] <TheHydroImpulse> What type of glue language?
[02:32:26] <bjz> ..Erlang? :)
[02:33:05] <bjz> just curious, I don't know a great deal about distributed stuff
[02:33:36] <TheHydroImpulse> ahh, I hadn't really thought about it. I don't know those languages/platforms at all, so that's probably why I didn't go there.
[02:34:01] <bjz> I'd be interested to know how the distributed things would go in Rust - you might be forging new ground. We have tasks written as a library, and the language is very extensible.
[02:34:22] <bjz> well, it's getting much more extensible, which is great
[02:34:56] <TheHydroImpulse> bjz Yeah, exactly. I'm going to have to build many of pieces myself, although, they don't exactly exist in other languages (Gossip protocols, JITed Query Engine, etc...)
[02:35:12] <bjz> lots of the Rust stuff is single machine as far as I can see
[02:35:34] <bjz> pull out the power cable - poof
[02:35:47] <TheHydroImpulse> bjz Yeah. I think it'd be perfect for distributed stuff. I know Go has started to fill that niche a little bit.
[02:35:53] <bjz> awesome
[02:36:25] <TheHydroImpulse> C++ was just horrible. Had to build my own http and tcp stack on-top of libuv
[02:36:28] <bjz> yeah, not trying to put you off. When I started in rust the amount of game dev stuff was minimal - I had to build lots myself
[02:36:57] <bjz> but it's super exciting, and if you design your APIs well, people *will* use your work
[02:37:02] <TheHydroImpulse> Oh definitely. 
[02:37:18] <bjz> it's not like the C++ community which is very established
[02:37:52] <bjz> btw, ChrisMorgan does rust-http I think
[02:37:56] <bjz> he's on #rust
[02:38:20] <bjz> which is supposed to be getting quite good now
[02:38:22] <TheHydroImpulse> And the build systems/packaging is horrible for C++. Can't wait until rust's package manager gets off the ground some more.
[02:38:28] <bjz> they use it in Servo I think
[02:38:36] <TheHydroImpulse> Yeah, I've been taking a look at it recently. Looks awesome.
[02:38:43] <bjz> yeah, that will be an important design/ux project
[02:39:11] <bjz> as in, not a gui - just making a good system that people are ok using
[02:39:16] <TheHydroImpulse> Have you been contributing to Rust for a while?
[02:39:36] <bjz> since 0.4
[02:40:28] <TheHydroImpulse> So a good bit then. It hasn't gotten much tracking in the tech community too much (HN, etc...), but that's probably because it's pre 1.0
[02:40:43] <TheHydroImpulse> tracking = traction**
[02:40:46] <bjz> I looked at Rust at 0.3, and even though I sympathised with the work they were trying to do, I recoiled in in horror at the jumbled mess it was
[02:41:12] <TheHydroImpulse> oh boy. I think 0.5 was the earliest I looked at it.
[02:41:18] <bjz> but everyone has done an immensly good job at honing it down to its core essence
[02:41:29] * bjz applauds graydon and brson
[02:41:57] <TheHydroImpulse> hehe. Definitely. Does Graydon still work on the Rust project?

[05:55:51] <cmr> TheHydroImpulse: no, he stepped down.
[05:57:21] <TheHydroImpulse> cmr ahh ok. Thanks for the info
[05:57:31] <cmr> bjz: it's quite impresive how much more focused rust has become.
[05:58:16] <cmr> it's especially impressive when you consider how new traits are. and modern pointer types.
[05:59:06] <cmr> TheHydroImpulse: when you say you're doing some prototypes/sketches of docs, do you mean prose docs like the tutorial or the API docs rustdoc generates?
[06:01:17] <TheHydroImpulse> the latter.
[06:02:32] <cmr> cool. do you have any screenshots/guiding principles to share yet? I've generally found the current incarnation pleasant; far more pleasant than any other API docs I've seen.
[06:05:56] <TheHydroImpulse> I've been watching and reading a few things that other community members, like Steve, who talk about what they want in the docs. So the goal is to have a two column layout. The left sidebar (and only sidebar) will hold the current context navigation. For example, if you're within the std section, you'll see it's subsections within the sidebar and a link to go back up. I'm also testing out putting examples for each API 
[06:05:56] <TheHydroImpulse> function. Although, getting rustdoc to generate it will take a little while.
[06:06:35] <TheHydroImpulse> http://i.imgur.com/4t6Nfj6.png
[06:07:46] <TheHydroImpulse> That's an example layout
