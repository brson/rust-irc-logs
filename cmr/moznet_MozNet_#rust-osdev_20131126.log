[09:38:48] <Leo`> eddyb: do you remember where are the ast::Block that have to be boxed in libsyntax ? :p
[09:39:21] <Leo`> I started replacing some, but I end up replacing every Block with a Rc<Block>
[09:39:41] <Leo`> also, for functions such as visit_block that take a &Block
[09:39:54] <Leo`> should I change it to Rc<Block> just like other functions take a @T ?
[09:40:07] <Leo`> or should I put borrow() everywhere the function is called ? :p
[09:40:28] <eddyb> errr
[09:40:53] <eddyb> Leo`: I suggest replacing it in ast_node, Expr_ and that other place, and then going from there
[09:41:27] <eddyb> .borrow() is better, I would think
[09:41:41] <Leo`> ok
[09:41:45] <Leo`> that's how I started
[09:42:14] <Leo`> but when I saw the number of places where I will have to do it, I had a doubt :p
[09:42:30] <eddyb> type-error-guided-refactoring
[09:42:53] <Leo`> exaclty :D
[09:43:12] <Leo`> also, do you agree that functions returning a Block should definitively return a Rc instead ? :p
[09:43:55] <eddyb> if similar functions return a @T, yes
[09:44:42] <cmr> If they take a Block, and return that Block in any way, it should be Rc<Block>
[09:45:47] <Leo`> cmr: oh, so i'd better change &Block to Rc<Block> in parameters ?
[09:45:50] <Leo`> rather than borrow() in each call ?
[09:46:08] <cmr> Hm, well.
[09:46:10] <cmr> Depends
[09:46:14] <eddyb> &Block is cheaper than Rc<Block>
[09:46:20] <eddyb> and I doubt it's ever reboxed
[09:46:26] <Leo`> yeah
[09:46:30] <Leo`> reboxed ?
[09:46:36] <cmr> If it's not actually returning the block, ie copying it in any way, there's no reason to have it be an Rc<Block>
[09:46:56] <eddyb> Leo`: take the value from the reference and put it somewhere else, i.e. ^
[09:47:18] <Leo`> eeeh ?
[09:48:08] <eddyb> something like return @node_block(*reference_to_a_block) - that would copy the block
[09:49:01] <Leo`> yeah
[09:49:18] <Leo`> I don't know if there are things like that
[09:49:27] <Leo`> in general functions that return Block create a new Block
[09:49:48] <Leo`> that is not a copy of a block passed un parameter
[09:49:51] <eddyb> good

[10:27:16] <Leo`> eddyb: https://github.com/mozilla/rust/blob/master/src/libsyntax/parse/token.rs#L104
[10:27:19] <Leo`> what should I do with this one ?
[10:29:38] <eddyb> Leo`: it's not a problem right now... but it might be cloning at some point
[10:29:57] <eddyb> or simply copying, by boxing/unboxing
[10:30:35] <eddyb> Leo`: you could look for nt_block(~some_block_by_value), that would benefit from using Rc<Block> instead
[10:31:53] <Leo`> eddyb: mh
[10:32:01] <Leo`> eddyb: i've got a problem in a macro with it
[10:32:43] <Leo`> the macro does (*x).clone()
[10:33:09] <Leo`> the problem is I can't put this in a Rc, since the macro is also used for other tokens
[10:33:18] <eddyb> hmm
[10:33:33] <eddyb> can't you make nt_block a special case?
[10:33:38] <eddyb> Leo`: where is the macro?
[10:33:40] <Leo`> https://github.com/mozilla/rust/blob/master/src/libsyntax/parse/parser.rs#L203
[10:33:45] <eddyb> with Rc that would be x.clone(), btw
[10:34:08] <Leo`> but x is the ~Block from nt_block
[10:34:18] <eddyb> see deref
[10:34:59] <eddyb> Leo`: .clone on an Rc creates a different Rc pointing to the same ref-counted box, I hope you know that :D
[10:35:17] <Leo`> this is not the problem :p
[10:35:26] <eddyb> Leo`: ok, so, maybe_whole!(deref self, nt_block); should become maybe_whole!(self, nt_block);
[10:35:38] <Leo`> the problem is that the macro, here, returns a Block
[10:35:48] <eddyb> and the return type of parse_block should be Rc<Block>
[10:35:49] <Leo`> and it is used in a function that must return a Rc<Block>
[10:35:55] <eddyb> Leo`: the macro has multiple forms
[10:35:57] <Leo`> but the macro uses an explicit return
[10:36:06] <eddyb> it's using deref right now, just remove that
[10:36:32] <Leo`> if I remove deref, the macro will return a Block anyway
[10:36:39] <Leo`> since it uses .clone() on a ~Block
[10:36:49] <eddyb> make nt_block(Rc<Block>)
[10:36:59] <Leo`> ok
[10:37:05] <Leo`> that's what I wanted to know :D
[10:37:16] <Leo`> and then
[10:37:20] <eddyb> [12:30] <eddyb> Leo`: you could look for nt_block(~some_block_by_value), that would benefit from using Rc<Block> instead
[10:37:24] <eddyb> ^ that's what I meant :P
[10:37:44] <eddyb> although it's unboxing here
[10:37:49] <Leo`> should I return a Rc to the same Block in the macro then ?
[10:38:02] <eddyb> Leo`: you should let the macro clone
[10:38:25] <Leo`> but clone what
[10:38:28] <Leo`> the Rc, or the block ? :p
[10:38:32] <eddyb> the Rc
[10:38:35] <Leo`> ok
[10:38:37] <Leo`> so remove the deref
[10:38:40] <eddyb> yupp
[10:38:44] <eddyb> rusti: (~5).clone()
[10:38:45] -rusti- ~5
[10:39:17] <Leo`> are you sure it doesn't matter if it keeps a pointer to the same block, where it cas previously copied ?
[10:41:32] <eddyb> Leo`: nope, since it's immutable anyway
[10:42:06] <eddyb> (it could actually show a 2x improvement *somewhere* :P)
[10:42:28] <Leo`> fine
[10:42:41] <Leo`> https://github.com/mozilla/rust/blob/master/src/libsyntax/parse/parser.rs#L251
[10:42:46] <Leo`> and this one ?
[10:43:22] <eddyb> eeeeeeeeeh
[10:43:26] <eddyb> who wrote this stuff :P?
[10:43:33] <Leo`> no idea
[10:44:56] <eddyb> you could copy that match case into a version with x.clone() and no (ref x) and name it pair_empty_no_deref :P
[10:46:17] <Leo`> seems legit
[10:46:23] <eddyb> Leo`: naaah, no need
[10:46:57] <eddyb> maybe_whole!(pair_empty appears in only one place, so you can just replace the macro expansion for it
[10:47:04] <Leo`> :D
[10:47:16] <eddyb> (i.e. that (**x).clone() thing is used only for Block)
[10:47:26] <Leo`> so
[10:47:34] <Leo`> no ref
[10:47:38] <Leo`> and x.clone()
[10:47:40] <Leo`> should be fine
[10:47:45] <eddyb> yeah

[11:41:39] <Leo`> eddyb: if I bind a Rc in a pattern, withouth a "ref", this is a bind by-move ?
[11:41:51] <eddyb> I think so
[11:42:36] <Leo`> and same question with an enum instead of an Rc ?
[11:43:17] <eddyb> I think by-move and by-value are the same thing in different contexts
[11:44:21] <Leo`> well
[11:44:36] <eddyb> and move is related to having a dtor - for example, simply passing an Rc<T> by value to a function should be possible, but once you do that it's gone
[11:45:01] <Leo`> I had something like some_constructor(ref foo, bar, baz, ref lol, ref qux)
[11:45:08] <Leo`> now that qux is a Rc, i removed the ref
[11:45:13] <Leo`> and.... cannot bind by-move and by-ref in the same pattern
[11:45:24] <eddyb> make all of them the same, I guess
[11:45:57] <eddyb> there's no problem with binding Rc by-ref, especially if you don't want to destroy the original

[11:57:03] <Leo`> why doesn't Block fulfill Freeze ? :d
[11:57:13] <Leo`> WHY
[11:57:46] <eddyb> ouch
[11:58:17] <eddyb> I know things like Cell aren't Freeze
[11:58:59] <Leo`> I could use Rc::from_send

[12:12:36] <cmr> To prevent cycles
[12:12:40] <cmr> it needs either freeze or send
[12:13:03] <eddyb> guess why I wanted @Block instead of Rc<Block>?
[12:13:10] <Leo`> fuuuu
[12:13:40] <eddyb> because it would've worked out of the box, and a later PR could replace *all* the @T with Rc<T>
[12:13:54] <Leo`> :(
[12:14:13] <eddyb> while doing some restructuring to ensure we don't run into problems like that
[12:15:02] <eddyb> everything depends on @ anyway atm
[12:15:27] <eddyb> so all Block -> @Block is doing is decreasing the size of some enums

[12:15:50] <eddyb> s/on/for/
[12:16:42] <cmr> Ideally it'd just be an arena in TLS
[12:16:50] <cmr> That way we can actually destruct it when we want to
[12:16:59] <cmr> And wouldn't have refcounting overhead
[12:17:02] <Leo`> TLS ?
[12:17:05] <cmr> task local storage
[12:17:32] <eddyb> @ -> arena might be easier than @ -> Rc (-> arena)
[12:18:39] <cmr> We don't really have the primitives to express arenas.
[12:18:45] <cmr> but niko is working on that
[12:19:07] <Leo`> what are arenas ?
[12:19:12] <cmr> Leo`: a type of allocator
[12:19:29] <cmr> Rather than using malloc or something, the arena allocator allocates everything within itself
[12:19:37] <cmr> It can also reuse things within that arena
[12:19:51] <cmr> The advantage here is that after trans runs, you can destroy the arena entirely.
[12:20:14] <Leo`> mhhh.
[12:20:19] <cmr> Right now, we don't have that freedom, and we leak almost 700MB through @ boxes
[12:21:02] <Leo`> outch :D
[12:21:08] <cmr> Yeah :\

[12:25:12] <eddyb> Leo`: there's no point for Rc<Block>, especially with cmr's mention of arenas
[12:25:45] <eddyb> (arenas work more like @T does right now, but with better control)
[12:25:49] <Leo`> well ... 
[12:26:00] <Leo`> so what should I do, give up this PR ?
[12:26:23] <eddyb> Leo`: do you have a PR already for the Rc additions? those are still useful
[12:26:58] <eddyb> as for the refactoring work, leave it in a local branch for now
[12:27:31] <Leo`> the Rc additions ?
[12:27:47] <eddyb> I thought you changed something in std::rc, maybe I'm wrong
[12:28:02] <Leo`> oh yes
[12:28:14] <Leo`> I impled IterBytes, Eq, Cmp, and some other things
[12:28:17] <Leo`> but it's merged already
[12:28:49] <eddyb> good :D

[12:53:00] <Leo`> https://github.com/mozilla/rust/blob/master/src/libsyntax/parse/lexer.rs#L779 is this the right place to put this ? cmr ?
[12:57:15] <cmr> Leo`: yeah, actually, looks like exactly the right place
[12:57:51] <Leo`> the problem is that there is no such thing as a "keyword" in the lexer
[12:58:10] <cmr> Surely there's a list somewhere?
[13:00:26] <Leo`> the Token enum doesn't have constructors for keywords
[13:00:33] <Leo`> it looks like they are treated like idents at first

[13:01:56] <Leo`> I found this

[13:02:29] <cmr> Well..
[13:02:37] <cmr> it can't be any of the ones that aren't keywords anyway...

[13:08:14] <eddyb> Leo`: if the string is interned as an ident, then it should be free
[13:08:33] <eddyb> that's the point of an interner, AFAIK, to replace strings with numbers/pointers
[13:09:21] <Leo`> uh yes
[13:09:23] <Leo`> but mhh
[13:09:29] <eddyb> Leo`: str_to_ident should return a Name which you can compare to that range
[13:09:59] <Leo`> oh
[13:10:04] <Leo`> idents are ints
[13:10:06] <Leo`> okay
[13:10:23] <eddyb> no, they are Names which are ints (or u32, after my PR)

[13:10:36] *** zz_kimundi is now known as kimundi

[13:13:19] <Leo`> why this special case for static and self ?
[13:13:51] <eddyb> oh, interesting helpers
[13:14:12] <eddyb> Leo`: because they're not part of the strict keyword range
[13:14:29] <Leo`> ok
[13:14:31] <Leo`> by the way
[13:14:38] <Leo`> 'self should be disallowed as well ?
[13:14:49] <Leo`> that will require a huge refactoring
[13:14:58] <eddyb> nope, 'self and 'static stay
[13:15:12] <Leo`> what's the meaning of 'self ?
[13:15:13] <eddyb> so you don't actually need to add exceptions if you do the check yourself
[13:15:36] <eddyb> Leo`: it used to be the only lifetime parameter you could put on structs, I think
[13:16:18] <Leo`> is it still the case ?
[13:16:38] <eddyb> and it might have had self-referential semantics (a reference within an object must outlive the object, etc.)
[13:16:57] <eddyb> Leo`: I would ask dbaupp and/or nmatsakis
[13:18:22] <eddyb> libstd has 538 'self
[13:18:36] <eddyb> and you'll have to allow 'static
[13:25:04] <Leo`> yeah I know for static

[14:16:53] <eddyb> Linux 4.0
[14:22:57] <sbalmos> eddyb: Released the same year the Linux desktop takes over, right?
[14:23:27] <eddyb> linux is getting rusty (no pun intended)
[14:26:17] <sbalmos> It's over 20 years old. Of course it is.
[14:54:13] <strcat> sbalmos: linux has capabilities, dunno what an sid is ;p
[14:54:25] <strcat> setuid binaries are basically obsolete, for example
[14:55:38] <sbalmos> strcat: security IDs, really Kerberos tickets / tokens under the cover. What Windows uses (for better or worse)
[14:58:32] <strcat> sbalmos: well for example, ping used to be setuid
[14:58:44] <strcat> now ping has setcap CAP_NET_RAW
[14:59:05] <strcat> so if ping has an exploit, the worst thing you can do is make it bind to any address and send ICMP requests
[14:59:09] <strcat> bad, but not the end of the world bad
[15:01:05] <sbalmos> strcat: Yup, I remember all that fun
[15:01:41] <strcat> anyway linux has a lot of this stuff.
[15:01:51] <strcat> there's gid/uid, and the basic permissions
[15:02:10] <strcat> POSIX ACLs (which I think weren't ever actually added to POSIX)
[15:02:25] <sbalmos> Ya, I never liked the basicperms.
[15:02:26] <strcat> seccomp (syscall filtering), namespaces (trees of stuffs)
[15:02:39] <sbalmos> ARGGGGHHH. Damn remote keybboard       is going berseerk
[15:02:42] <strcat> and then the security module stuff (apparmor, smack, selinux) which are insane ;p
[15:03:11] <strcat> sbalmos: well they finally added sysctl flags to break the POSIX rules and make hardlinks/symlinks sane ;p
[15:03:22] <strcat> apparmor needs it to be meaningful
[15:03:30] <strcat> since it just uses paths.
[15:04:54] <sbalmos> And then there's the whole mess with *Kit, *Manager, etc
[15:05:12] <sbalmos> dbus, hald, etc etc etc

[15:11:27] <strcat> udev rules can tag devices as uaccess
[15:11:42] <strcat> in which case, the user active at the seat they are assigned to has ACLs on them
[15:11:53] <strcat> it's for multiseat. and fast-user-switching
[15:11:58] <sbalmos> ya
[15:12:08] <strcat> when you switch to another user, it needs to remove permissions from devices so your stuff stops outputting sound, etc.
[15:12:28] <strcat> and seats need to have devices associated with them
[15:12:39] <strcat> so a monitor, input devices and speakers are assigned to one
[15:13:11] * strcat is sure windows has stuff like that
[15:13:18] <strcat> maybe not multiseat ;p
[15:13:46] <sbalmos> it does
[15:14:05] <sbalmos> Also probably how they do RDP A/V and device redirection
[15:15:05] <sbalmos> Oh, that's another thing... A single defined OS-supported widget set. Theming's one thing, but the core widget set is another.
[15:15:36] <sbalmos> I've always (anecdotally) found widget-based remoting protocols like RDP have outperformed pixel-based ones like VNC, regardless of pixel caching
[15:16:15] <strcat> sbalmos: yeah but windows applications always draw their own windows decorations and don't follow the system theme at all
[15:16:19] <strcat> it's even worse than linux
[15:16:30] <sbalmos> yeah I know
[15:16:38] <strcat> at least on linux 99% of stuff you'd ever want to use is gtk/qt or fakes it like libreoffice/firefox
[15:16:38] <sbalmos> no allowing any of that shit either. :)
[15:16:58] <strcat> chrome and steam look awful on both, ofc
[15:17:04] <sbalmos> sick of "vendor cuteness" or whatever they want to call it
[15:17:12] <strcat> although chrome has the option to use the system gtk theme + window decorations
[15:17:25] <strcat> since I don't have titlebars... it looks awful without that
[15:17:42] <strcat> (well I do have titlebars but not for only for tabbed windows)
[15:18:14] <sbalmos> Like right now, I'm back to RDP'ing under Win7. It has *always* looked better, and felt more responsive, than any standard KDE install
[15:18:22] <sbalmos> (combined with either VNC or NX)
[15:19:18] * strcat shrugs
[15:19:30] <sbalmos> anyway...
[15:19:39] <sbalmos> Just another topic of ranting. :)
[15:19:51] <strcat> sbalmos: there's gtk-based remoting ;p
[15:20:00] <strcat> but that's per-app
[15:20:04] <sbalmos> ya
[15:20:30] <sbalmos> actually I've never seen/tried Gtk remoting
[15:21:10] <strcat> weston (wayland) uses RDP
[15:21:29] <sbalmos> Wonder how they were able to license that from MS and/or Citrix
[15:21:43] <strcat> don't need to
[15:21:56] <sbalmos> oh, FreeRDP
[15:22:07] <strcat> I just mean RDP as in the protocol
[15:22:29] <tiffany> can't copyright interfaces
[15:22:31] <strcat> like samba implements their file sharing and whatever else
[15:23:18] <sbalmos> sure
[15:23:20] <strcat> wayland is pretty neat, it works quite well on my laptop
[15:23:33] <strcat> if only there was a sane window manager built on it
[15:23:50] <strcat> (and firefox would have to work... they still need to finish moving to gtk3 afaik :P)
[15:24:10] <strcat> although
[15:24:15] <strcat> it does render X applications faster than X
[15:24:26] <strcat> because X is really dumb.
[15:25:02] <strcat> wayland applications render by writing to a shared memory buffer, no copies
[15:25:10] <strcat> X is similar but requires a copy for non-fullscreen ones
[15:25:43] <tiffany> afaik firefox's main problem is directly using X pixmaps and the transition to cairo
[15:25:45] <strcat> but when you run an X app in wayland it treats it as rootless and it gets those fullscreen benefits
[15:25:53] <strcat> tiffany: ah
[15:26:02] <tiffany> it's much larger than moving to gtk3
[15:26:13] <tiffany> or was, the last information I read about it was like a few years old
[15:26:13] <strcat> I'd be sad if I had to use another browser, but I might ;(
[15:26:13] <sbalmos> interesting. Just found the RDP protocol spec at MS
[15:26:19] <strcat> vimperator is getting pretty broken anyway
[15:26:31] <strcat> at some point I'll give up and use a webkit browser like dwb
[15:27:33] <sbalmos> what else can we gripe about that should be fixed in this imaginary OS? :P
[15:27:39] *** kimundi is now known as zz_kimundi
[15:27:49] <eddyb> Blink should become better than WebKit, without all the legacy crap
[15:28:04] <eddyb> (if it's not already performing better)
[15:28:07] <strcat> sure, but nothing but operator/chrome use it
[15:28:10] <strcat> opera*
[15:28:16] <strcat> opera is basically chromium now
[15:28:21] * strcat shrugs
[15:28:30] <eddyb> with a different JS engine - or not, not sure
[15:28:46] <strcat> dwb is a nicer browser than firefox + vimperator, it's just slow because the webkit JS engine is slow
[15:28:50] <strcat> eddyb: no same js engine afaik
[15:28:54] <strcat> just UI differences
[15:29:05] <eddyb> JSC had no JIT until recently or so
[15:29:14] <eddyb> TBH, I'd like to see Servo + v8
[15:29:55] <strcat> spidermonkey is competitive with v8
[15:30:07] <tiffany> [10:17] <sbalmos> sick of "vendor cuteness" or whatever they want to call it
[15:30:20] <tiffany> the majority of it seems to be custom window decorations and menu bars along the top of the screen
[15:30:28] <tiffany> in any interface I make, I will almost certainly have none of these
[15:31:10] <tiffany> once you get that point, custom widgets are largely used for optimizing interfaces, like sticking buttons within the url bar for firefox or whatever
[15:31:35] <tiffany> one could argue that most of the useful parts of custom widgets are just a need for a more flexible GUI toolkit
[15:31:41] <strcat> if an application forces me to have a title bar I'm not using it ;p
[15:32:05] * strcat wants 1 pixel window borders ;)
[15:32:20] <tiffany> gtk remoting looks exactly like it does natively, probably using an ungodly amount of js+css hacks
[15:32:35] <strcat> tiffany: I imagine it's just a bunch of canvas
[15:32:49] <strcat> some company made a canvas based remote desktop thing
[15:32:53] <tiffany> oh, I hasn't even considered that
[15:32:56] <tiffany> [10:24] <strcat> because X is really dumb.
[15:32:58] <tiffany> understatement
[15:33:26] <strcat> all wayland does is implement an IPC protocol and directly use the infrastructure they built for modern X (evdev, dri, etc.)
[15:33:34] <sbalmos> heh
[15:33:39] <tiffany> I think the best place to learn about how horrible X is would be daniel stone's talk about wayland
[15:33:41] <strcat> X is just a massive useless pile of junk implementing a really bad IPC protocol now...
[15:34:12] <sbalmos> tiffany / strcat: Though that does remind me of another old idea - have the widget set in the OS itself have multiple render output formats - including HTML5 with JS/CSS/SVG.
[15:35:44] <strcat> tiffany: anyway canvas-based VNC is probably trivially
[15:35:56] <strcat> you just leverage an existing VNC server, render the pixels it sends, send events
[15:36:00] <tiffany> doesn't VNC just send updates to screen regions compressed with whatever?
[15:36:01] <strcat> I bet it's 300 lines of code
[15:36:04] <strcat> tiffany: yeah
[15:36:08] <sbalmos> yup
[15:36:32] <sbalmos> It'd get more interesting to have a widget remoting protocol where the dialog box was an actual HTML5 page
[15:36:52] <tiffany> if I was designing an OS I would make it so there'd be multiple places where a seat can intercept the UI drawing process
[15:37:23] <sbalmos> Sit at console, full GUI, then be able to remote via HTML5 and pick up the current console session?
[15:37:32] <strcat> wayland actually moves to client-side decoration does by toolkits, at least weston does
[15:37:47] <strcat> sbalmos: the issue is that you want everything library-based rather than having a server doing any rendering at all
[15:37:52] <strcat> for performance/latency
[15:37:56] <sbalmos> exactly
[15:38:01] <strcat> so applications are free to do it wrong
[15:38:08] <strcat> because they're just rendering into a pixel buffer
[15:38:19] <tiffany> you'd be able to intercept the GUI calls from the application, the widget scenegraph itself, the framebuffers of each window, or the entire finished screen
[15:38:40] <strcat> tiffany: so they'd have to use a specific toolkit? :)
[15:38:42] <sbalmos> strcat: Rendering into a pixelbuf is disallowed.
[15:38:50] <strcat> sbalmos: but now it's slow ;p
[15:39:21] <sbalmos> strcat: Sending a remote command to "draw a button at grid coords x,y" is slower than sending a pixel stream?
[15:39:21] <strcat> trying to standardize widgets/drawing server-side was the *old* X11 way
[15:39:27] <tiffany> those first two would require you support whatever toolkit the application is using
[15:39:29] <strcat> sbalmos: yes
[15:39:31] <strcat> sbalmos: round trips.
[15:39:39] <tiffany> in fact, they'd be implemented in the toolkit itself
[15:39:40] <strcat> sbalmos: much better to prepare your frame and inform the server with 1 context switch
[15:39:42] <strcat> in shared memory
[15:39:44] <strcat> that's how dri works
[15:39:56] <strcat> you get perfect, tear-free frames and copy-free rendering
[15:40:00] <strcat> via opengl or *whatever*
[15:40:17] <tiffany> but if I was designing an operating system, it'd be a bit too esoteric for applications to be easily ported and function fully
[15:40:32] <strcat> it does have to do 1 blit for non-fullscreen apps if it's enforcing tear-free
[15:40:36] <sbalmos> strcat: That's a client rendering issue. Server still should just have to remote over dialog widget updates. It's up to the client end to figure out partial rendering, clipping, etc
[15:40:39] <strcat> but it's not a big deal because it's not a context switch
[15:40:43] <tiffany> but with how much I like exokernels, you could certainly implement "personalities" for windows and linux
[15:41:00] <strcat> sbalmos: well afaik that's what wayland does, remoting is a client problem
[15:41:15] <sbalmos> strcat: Okay, so we're closer in idea than we thought. :)
[15:41:18] <strcat> it provides RDP and then to be efficient the clients have to know about it
[15:41:34] <strcat> and toolkits can easily do that stuff
[15:41:36] <sbalmos> strcat: Again, I'm back to RDP. It streams a Win32 "paint widget of type blah here" command
[15:42:20] <sbalmos> strcat: I'd just rather be more like Windows and OSX, with One Unified User API Toolkit [tm]
[15:42:41] <strcat> but they don't have that - plenty of windows/osx applications use other toolkits
[15:42:47] <tiffany> more like core X11
[15:42:49] <strcat> and they indirectly use cocoa or native win32
[15:42:53] <sbalmos> *sigh*
[15:42:57] <tiffany> the beautiful state-of-the-1980s graphics
[15:43:19] <tiffany> native win32 is rather horrendous to use
[15:43:23] <tiffany> a lot of applications use gtk or qt
[15:43:36] <strcat> mostly qt on windows
[15:44:07] <sbalmos> Sorry if I'm a One API To Rule Them All kind of person
[15:44:21] <strcat> if it's not portable no one will use it
[15:44:35] <strcat> the one API to rule them all is Qt, if anything
[15:44:40] <tiffany> correction: only toolkit devs will use it, if anyone
[15:44:51] <strcat> sbalmos: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qt_(software)#Platforms ;p
[15:44:56] <sbalmos> Fine. Port/rewrite Qt in Rust
[15:45:25] <strcat> binding Qt will be easier than binding win32/cocoa
[15:45:46] <tiffany> does qt have a C API?
[15:45:47] <sbalmos> strcat: We're back to a fundamental problem though. Qt is C++

[15:49:59] <sbalmos> strcat: Just as pretty much Apple had to do with the * Kits because of using Obj-C as the userland language (yes, I know, NextSTEP did the heavy lifting, bear with me), we're fairly open to designing a similar API kit in Rust for the Rust OS. Yeah, we can pretty much lift Qt's ideas and layout, but the work is still there.
[15:50:15] <sbalmos> We can't just grab Qt, plop it down, and say this is our OS API.

[16:05:11] <tiffany> this looks like it would have been a pretty nice thing
[16:06:20] <sbalmos> I either scared or (more likely) pissed off strcat
[16:07:08] <tiffany> they could also be busy or otherwise away
[16:07:19] <sbalmos> More likely, hopefully.
[16:07:28] <sbalmos> I'm just watching training videos. :/
