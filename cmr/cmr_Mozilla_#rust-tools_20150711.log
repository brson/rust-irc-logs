[21:06:45] <Gankro> holy *shit* Cargo has so many features
[21:06:50] <Gankro> acrichto: you poor bastard
[21:06:53] <acrichto> ?
[21:06:58] <Gankro> oops
[21:07:00] <Gankro> forgot a word
[21:07:05] <Gankro> so many feature requests
[21:07:09] <acrichto> bahahaha
[21:09:26] <Gankro> I briefly thought about actually trying to implement one but... oh my god so many
[21:11:27] <vadimcn> acrichto: um, sorry for asking this again, but how do you test changes in std without rebuilding all of stage1?
[21:11:46] <acrichto> vadimcn: make check-stage0-std-
[21:11:51] <acrichto> er, check-stage0-std
[21:12:03] <acrichto> and if that doesn't work -- make check-stage1-std + run the compiler manually afterwards
[21:12:18] <acrichto> e.g. ./$target/stage1/bin/rustc src/libstd/lib.rs --test
[21:12:20] <acrichto> ./std
[21:13:35] <vadimcn> hmm, let me try this...
[21:22:34] <vadimcn> acrichto: so this fails with this message: "error while loading shared libraries: test-7e44814b.dll"
[21:25:43] <vadimcn> also, stdtest-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu.exe depends on std-7e44814b.dll, is this right?
[21:25:55] <vadimcn> shouldn't it be self-contained?
[21:28:16] <acrichto> vadimcn: are you running manually?
[21:28:21] <acrichto> vadimcn: or via `make`
[21:28:32] <acrichto> if it's manual you'll need to set PATH so it's pointing in the dll dir
[21:28:47] <vadimcn> via make
[21:28:49] <acrichto> but if you're compiling manually it shouldn't have dynamic deps...
[21:28:55] <acrichto> and make should set the gith env vars
[21:29:00] <acrichto> weird
[21:29:11] <acrichto> but make definitely does compile stdtest with dynamic deps
[21:29:16] <acrichto> (it does so for basically our whole build system)
[21:29:26] <acrichto> this *may* be the whole stage1-libs-are-bad problem
[21:29:36] <acrichto> you may get more mileage just driving the compiler manually
[21:30:32] <vadimcn> so when you change std, is this how you test it?
[21:30:54] <acrichto> it kinda depends on what I'm doing
[21:31:02] <acrichto> I typicall write code outside std nowadays and then move it in
[21:31:11] <acrichto> but I haven't done many large-scale changes recently
[21:31:18] <acrichto> if I get annoyed though I just drive everything manually
[21:31:22] <acrichto> b/c I don't like rebootstrapping :P
[21:32:01] <acrichto> ah brb train arriving
[21:34:51] <vadimcn> acrichto: I usually fail when trying to compile rust crates manually :)
[21:35:21] <vadimcn> it seems that too much know-how about paths and env vars is needed :)
[21:38:52] <vadimcn> usually I end up doing `make rustc-stage1`, which, of course, re-bootstraps
[21:41:07] <vadimcn> I dunno, I think a blog post of a wiki article about the fastest ways to test compiler and std changes would help a lot of people.
[21:42:53] <vadimcn> the info given here https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-requests is good for the final check before submitting a PR, but this is way too slow for day-to-day development
