[02:25:31] <barosl> http://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/184fe9/bors/c8bpvs6
[02:25:48] <barosl> This comment seems to have anticipated the future!
[02:26:06] <barosl> "Continuous Build is scalable in the sense that it will just integrate bigger chunks of code at once; however building and running tests for each and every PR may not scale (as the number of PRs grow). Of course, I guess that it would great for Rust to run into this problem :D"
[02:26:26] <barosl> That's why we use rollups nowadays, and yes, we got the exact problem :)
[02:26:34] <cmr> we were already hitting scale issues even then
[02:26:41] <barosl> Oh, really?
[02:26:48] <cmr> yeah
[02:27:12] <cmr> once the build time went from ~15min to 30 and then skyrocketed to an hour or so, it was not fun.
[02:27:53] <barosl> Haha, I cannot imagine a world that compiling rustc only takes 15 mins to finish :P
[02:28:16] <huon> it was amazing
[02:28:23] <Havvy> I wonder if it would be possible again.
[02:28:35] <cmr> Havvy: probably not with today's libstd/libcore
[02:28:36] <huon> although I believe the tree often broke
[02:28:42] <cmr> all the time, yeah
[02:28:55] <huon> since the speed was due to not running the full testsuite/not running on many platforms
[02:29:00] <cmr> it got longer because of more thorough testing :P
[02:29:02] <huon> (partially, anyway)
[02:29:36] <cmr> I think the final drop in the bucket was the death of check-fast and the gating of cross-compiling...
[02:29:54] * Yurume should collect coverage for entire rustc tree to eliminate redundant tests
[02:30:27] <cmr> getting coverage for rustc would be really nice.
[02:30:37] <cmr> find the ICEs before they find you
[02:30:39] <Yurume> place bets :p
[02:31:11] <cmr> at least in the frontend I'm willing to bet we get about 80-90% coverage, across the testsuite and the stdlib
[02:31:39] <Yurume> we are building with debuginfo by default, right?
[02:31:44] <barosl> I'm not familiar with the coverage check at all. How can we use it to eliminate redundancies or to find ICEs?
[02:32:09] <cmr> barosl: it can tell us when a code path is never taken, which helps for ICEs.
[02:32:22] <Yurume> (redundancies thing is a bit joke, but it is nevertheless useful.)
[02:33:10] <Yurume> it may help dividing tests into "essential" ones (enough for taking all possible branches) and "optional" ones (can be omitted for casual testing), which was my original point.
[02:33:13] <cmr> I'm having a pretty hard time rationalizing BLAS into a nice Rust wrapper.
[02:33:20] <cmr> LAPACK is going to be a lot more fun~
[02:33:28] <Yurume> oh my

[02:36:42] <Yurume> well, I think I've done slightly better than V8
[02:37:04] <Yurume> I found that V8 had some false negatives for a particular mode of Grisu
[02:37:25] <Yurume> that doesn't make the algorithm incorrect (of course), but slightly inefficient from time to time

[02:40:02] <huon> also, it seems like you could file a V8 bug? :)
[02:40:30] <Yurume> huon: technically not a correctness bug, but I think it is unintentional.
[02:40:44] *** Joins: panicbit (panicbit@moz-gg7i2b.dip0.t-ipconnect.de)
[02:40:49] <huon> is it a performance bug?
[02:40:52] <Yurume> I didn't exactly quantify false negatives but I guess some 10--20% of valid input is incorrectly rejected
[02:40:58] <Yurume> possibly.
[02:41:06] <huon> woah, that's a lot!
[02:41:13] <cmr> that's a competitive advantage! don't file a bug!
[02:41:15] <cmr> :P
[02:41:25] <Yurume> (that's my guess from random testing)
[02:41:32] <barosl> When I saw the relevant code in the current tree, it simply did `while num > 0 { current_digit = (int)num; num *= 10; }`, so I thought the process was easy, althought it also did seem pretty naive
[02:41:34] <Yurume> FYI, however, Go got this correct :p
[02:41:53] <Yurume> (I had to cross-validate V8 and Go to check if this is intentional...)
[02:41:57] <huon> barosl: yeah, it falls down with rounding
[02:42:49] <Yurume> I was also able to merge two modes of operation out of three, doing the same work with a smaller number of routines
[02:42:57] <barosl> Good to hear there's more reliable algorithm, and also great to realize that I will never have a chance to implement it myself!
[02:43:46] <Yurume> there are three primary modes, "shortest" (find the shortest and closest "correctly-rounded" repr), "exact" (like printf %.*e) and "fixed" (like printf %.*f)
[02:44:05] <Yurume> but I suspected that "exact" and "fixed" modes are similar enough that they can be merged
[02:45:17] <huon> barosl: btw...
[02:45:22] <Yurume> well, it worked surprisingly well
[02:45:32] <huon> barosl: I'm thinking of trying to setup homu on my own repos, using travis CI
[02:45:38] <huon> barosl: any tips? :)
[02:45:41] <Yurume> so that's another competitive advantage over V8 (which has at least 5 routines for doing that) :p

[04:11:59] <barosl> huon, That would be great, thanks

[04:16:28] <reem> Gankro: What does that mean?
[04:16:41] * reem knows very little about the rust build infrastructure
[04:17:02] <Gankro> reem: basically getting the sweet UI for managing all the stuff: http://buildbot.rust-lang.org/homu/queue/rust+cargo
[04:17:42] <reem> ah, but you still get test runs and stuff without the buildbot portion, right?
[04:17:43] <Gankro> I assume iron is just using travis for verification, so you don't need buildbot?
[04:18:07] <reem> Oh I see, homu hooks into an existing verification system, so I can use it with travis?
[04:20:01] <Gankro> reem: I don't think so... But most of the homu states are due to the "accept then test" nature of buildbot
[04:20:10] <Gankro> Whereas travis is "test then accept"
[04:20:32] <Gankro> As soon as you want to r+ you just hit the merge button, right?
[04:20:40] <huon> barosl: btw, what permissions are needed?
[04:20:47] <reem> ya
[04:20:56] <reem> I guess it's less useful if your build time is really fast
[04:21:26] <Gankro> reem: So basically the only state that would matter in homu is "cannot merge"
[04:21:49] <reem> doesn't github check that for you?

[04:22:15] <Gankro> reem: Yeah
[04:22:19] <huon> it just checks if the branch builds, not the branch merged with master
[04:22:33] <huon> (whereas homu does the latter)

[04:27:44] <Gankro> Although gist and repo are probably useless
[04:28:07] <huon> barosl: idea: a homu command you can run that sets up the right webhooks for a repo and adds it to the cfg.toml
[04:28:19] <huon> e.g. homu-add huonw/foo
[04:29:05] <huon> bonus points: checking out the repo, adding the right hooks to the .travis.yml and pushing that back up

[04:34:03] <barosl> As an off-topic, I don't understand why Travis uses the in-tree configuration file
[04:34:25] <Yurume> it sucks a lot
[04:34:32] <barosl> It should really be set from the Travis UI itself
[04:34:45] <Yurume> barosl: I think that's not optimal either
[04:35:00] <Yurume> the best way would be to have a separate branch for travis confs only
[04:35:26] <Yurume> so that the confs can be managed via git *but* it is not affected by other branches by default
[04:35:30] <barosl> The one I'm using recently, https://codeship.com/ , lets me to configure using their UI, and I find it more pleasant than using .travis.yml
[04:36:03] <barosl> Do you know that .travis.yml can vary between the branches? (Of course it can!)
[04:37:07] <barosl> If they are not going to pull out the in-tree configuration, at least they should read the .travis.yml of the master branch only. But they said it is not possible due to the backward compatibility concerns
[04:37:44] <Yurume> barosl: that greatly sucks when you are updating gh-pages (duh!)
[04:39:10] <barosl> Yurume, Does Travis try to read the configuration file from the gh-pages branch too? Maybe we can add the branch to the blacklist?
[04:39:48] <Gankro> barosl: btw, any news on the homu licensing issue?
[04:39:50] <Yurume> barosl: it can be done, but if you are managing the global gh-pages repo (<org>/<org>.github.io)...
[04:40:29] <barosl> Gankro, Oh, I'm going to comment on the issue soon. I think it would be good to have the license be the same with the Rust project itself, but I'm open to other possibilities
[04:40:47] <Gankro> barosl: Sounds good to me
[04:40:55] <barosl> Rust uses MIT, right?
[04:41:03] <Gankro> dual MIT/Apache or something
[04:41:23] <barosl> Duh, I'm not familiar with dual licensing at all!
[04:41:40] <Gankro> barosl: The only reason I favour using the Rust license is for merging stuff into std
[04:41:45] <Gankro> But that's not a concern for homu
[04:41:55] <huon> barosl: https://github.com/barosl/homu/issues/70
[04:42:18] <barosl> huon, Thanks! That example looks very professional :P

[04:43:03] <barosl> Ok, so what is your favorite OSS license? Gankro huon Yurume Havvy and others?
[04:43:12] * huon just copies the Rust one
[04:43:17] <barosl> lol
[04:43:18] <Gankro> barosl: BSD because it's very human
[04:43:23] <barosl> huon, That's what I thought
[04:43:32] <Yurume> I think dual licensing is to allow the user to select between multiple licenses listed, and not to selectively pick the characteristics from multiple different licenses
[04:43:34] <barosl> Gankro, Human? What is it like?
[04:43:38] <Yurume> but IANAL
[04:43:38] <Gankro> BSD is basically "HERE IS CODE ENJOY"
[04:43:51] <Yurume> my favorite OSS license is CC0 :)
[04:43:52] <barosl> MIT is somewhat similar, no?
[04:43:58] <Gankro> barosl: iirc yes
[04:44:12] <Havvy> barosl:  ISC because it's BSD but shorter.
[04:44:18] <Yurume> Gankro: I normally prefer MIT/X11 because there is no confusion over the different incarnations of "BSD"-like licenses.
[04:44:24] <barosl> ISC? I've heard that for the first time
[04:44:29] <Havvy> Also, it's the default when asked by `npm` doing `npm init`.
[04:44:46] <Gankro> Yurume: for practical purposes they're all identical, no?
[04:44:47] <barosl> Huh, then it must be somewhat popular
[04:44:57] <barosl> My bad for not hearing it before :(
[04:45:00] <Havvy> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISC_license
[04:45:20] <Havvy> "It is functionally equivalent to the simplified BSD and MIT/Expat licenses, with language that was deemed unnecessary by the Berne convention removed."
[04:45:20] <Yurume> Gankro: "modified" or "simplified" BSD licenses are functionally equivalent, the "original" BSD license isn't.
[04:45:35] <Gankro> Yurume: Does much software use OG BSD?
[04:45:56] <Yurume> nowadays not much, but I want to be concise and correct :)
[04:46:21] <Gankro> anyways I just include the full license text since it's like 3 paragraphs
[04:46:22] <barosl> Havvy, That's interesting, so it means that MIT and BSD were born before the Berne convention
[04:46:42] <Havvy> barosl:  Either before, or written by people who had not heard of it..
[04:46:50] <barosl> I see, cool
[04:46:56] <Yurume> (technically speaking, "MIT license" can be slightly confusing because there are many licenses developed in MIT. but there is virtually one license which is commonly called MIT license, so I think that's fine.)
[04:47:11] <Yurume> (but to be sure, I also say "MIT/X11 license".)
[04:47:18] <Gankro> Apache just seems needlessly big and scary by comparison
[04:47:34] <Havvy> Gankro:  A lot of the Apache license is patent protection.
[04:47:42] <Gankro> And I don't think anyone except for like Stallman understands GPL
[04:48:06] <Yurume> Gankro: the license is an abstraction; lawyers did the hard work so you don't have to.
[04:48:08] <barosl> Yurume, I argue that GNU has also released so many "public" licenses since the GPL!
[04:48:28] <Yurume> (this is my main objection against Unlicense too.)
[04:48:40] <Gankro> unlicense?
[04:48:46] <Yurume> http://unlicense.org/
[04:48:47] <barosl> Yeah, Unlicense is a thing
[04:49:07] <barosl> It's one of the public domain-ishy licenses, but AFAIK it has some legal concerns in some countires
[04:49:11] <Yurume> it's a pretty way to put works into the public domain
[04:49:24] <Havvy> ISC is a prettier way.
[04:49:27] <Yurume> and it is problematic on jurisdictions where the PD is not a thing
[04:49:34] *** Joins: reem (reem@moz-2icmmi.ca.comcast.net)
[04:49:47] <barosl> I remember that CC0 is a proper way to make one's work public domain
[04:49:49] <Havvy> Why isn't Public Domain a thing in all jurisdictions anyways?
[04:49:54] <barosl> But hasn't really investigate it
[04:50:09] <Gankro> Yurume: Unfortunately licensing and copyright is a source of much cargo-culting
[04:50:10] <Yurume> Havvy: who knows? anyway that's where we are.
[04:50:39] <Gankro> The MIT-style licenses make it very clear what is going on
[04:50:52] <Havvy> Oh look, they're being funny by using the Unlicense or WTFPL. I should copy that!
[04:51:14] <geofft> Havvy: I don't know for sure, but if you view copy_right_ as a fundamental right, you can't give it up 
[04:51:24] <Yurume> Gankro: yeah, I think there are precisely three main choices on the software licensing today: "totally free", "free but please attribute me", "free but benefit others".
[04:51:31] <geofft> plenty of jurisdictions say that "unconscionable" contracts can't be enforced 
[04:51:56] <Yurume> (my preferred choices for these three categories are: CC0, MIT/X11, and AGPL.)
[04:52:40] <barosl> Yurume, Interesting, so do you think that GPL isn't a way to go anymore?
[04:52:51] <barosl> Using AGPL as much as possible?
[04:53:42] <geofft> or a bit more imaginable example: it's super common that customers cannot give up certain customer protection rights 
[04:53:44] <Yurume> barosl: I actually think that it might be possible, but haven't investigated much.
[04:54:03] <Yurume> (I didn't have to work with GPL or AGPL softwares for recent years.)
[04:54:04] <geofft> like I can't sign a housing contract that says I'm OK with the landlord violating housing law 
[04:54:12] <geofft> or I can, but the landlord still has to respect housing law 
[04:54:19] <Gankro> huon: barosl: I wonder if homu could be a one-stop-shop for setting up a github-rust-travis project. Set all the gh-pages, docs, travis etc
[04:54:33] <geofft> it's not too much of a stretch to imagine a jurisdiction where copyright is viewed as protecting the artist from an exploitative label 
[04:54:52] <geofft> and the artist can't give up certain rights, even if they sign a contract 
[04:54:58] <barosl> Gankro, Haha, that's huge! Definitely a dream feature
[04:55:34] <barosl> Regarding gh-pages and docs, it may be a tool that integrates with Cargo, no?
[04:55:39] <Gankro> barosl: I'm not sure it'd be too huge to make. As far as I know the configs are pretty boiler-plate for a cargo project
[04:55:53] <barosl> So it could also create Cargo.toml
[04:56:06] <barosl> Although its coverage would be limited to the Rust projects
[04:56:07] <huon> cargo solve-my-automation-problems
[04:56:13] <barosl> lol
[04:56:15] <Gankro> huon: basically
[04:56:34] <Gankro> cargo webscale
[04:56:45] <barosl> I heard that cargo supports subcommands currently (invoking cargo-blahblah when needed)
[04:56:57] <barosl> So we could create a project named cargo-webscale
[04:57:22] * Havvy wonders if the Cargo team have looked at Elixir's Mix.
[04:58:40] <Yurume> geofft: that's why I avoid to think about that and simply say that "this work is put in the public domain, or alternatively, available in terms of CC0."
[05:00:27] <reem> Gankro: I have a home grown bash script that I use for new projects, sets up travis, cargo, readme, etc.
[05:00:42] <barosl> Yurume, It seems that FSF actually calls the MIT license as the X11 license. Are you referring the same thing? https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#X11License
[05:01:10] <reem> I tried to add gh-pages support but I couldn't get it to work reasonably so I gave up
[05:01:10] <Yurume> barosl: yes, FSF is being maximally precise.
[05:01:49] <barosl> Yurume, In that case, do I also include the "X Window System is a trademark of X Consortium, Inc." thing?
[05:02:36] <barosl> Oh, it seems not. The Rust project removed it
[05:03:08] <Yurume> barosl: I'm not sure, but I personally haven't seen the occurrence of that.
[05:03:18] *** Quits: reem (reem@moz-2icmmi.ca.comcast.net) (Connection closed)
[05:03:29] <Yurume> the trademark law is radically different from the copyright law so I'm really not sure.

[05:04:31] <wycats> Havvy: yah
[05:04:39] <wycats> Havvy: I'm friends with José
[05:04:43] <wycats> we were on Rails core together
[05:04:58] <wycats> José was around while we were building Bundle
[05:05:01] <wycats> Bundler
[05:05:18] <Havvy> wycats:  Ah, cool. I've seen Jose` a lot in #elixir - he's a great guy, and a wonderful programmer.
[05:05:23] <wycats> big confirm
[05:05:24] <barosl> Yurume, https://www.diffchecker.com/6m2szer2
[05:05:31] <barosl> There are some differences!
[05:05:45] <barosl> Especially the `AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS`
[05:05:45] <geofft> barosl: there's also the Expat license on that page 
[05:05:52] <Yurume> barosl: oh.
[05:06:03] <geofft> which is exatly like the X11 license but doesn't use "X Consortium" in its text 
[05:06:55] <geofft> yeah that license is the Expat license 
[05:07:08] <geofft> I mean human names for licenses are just that, they don't have any legal meaning 
[05:07:28] <geofft> it's easier for people checking compliance, corporate legal departments, etc. if you use the exact same words as someone else 
[05:07:33] <barosl> geofft, Yeah, the expat license's the same as the Rust project
[05:08:15] <barosl> Interesting. I didn't know the MIT license somewhat diverged
[05:08:38] <barosl> (It actually doesn't make much difference, but still)
[05:09:57] <Gankro> Just due a XOR of all the texts it will probably work out
[05:09:57] <geofft> we used to have that problem with 4-clause BSD 
[05:10:29] <geofft> "All advertising materials mentioning features or use of this software must display the following acknowledgement: This product includes software developed by the University of California, Berkeley and its contributors." 
[05:10:42] <geofft> and everyone went and modified it to their own name :( 
[05:10:57] <reem> Gankro: Right now it's a combo of https://github.com/reem/rust-bare and https://github.com/reem/rprezto/blob/master/runcoms/zshmodules/rust.zsh#L2-L20
[05:11:14] <barosl> geofft, lol that's fun
[05:11:20] <Yurume> This product includes software developed by the company or organization which name can be found from the output of the following program: cat /dev/urandom
[05:11:43] <geofft> then UC just unilaterally relicensed everything they own to get rid of that, and so did most? all? of the BSDs 
[05:11:48] <geofft> and there was much rejoicing 
[05:12:13] <geofft> 'cause then you could make advertisements that weren't half covered in "This product includes software developed by x" 
[05:12:58] <barosl> Strictly speaking, I also want to raise a concern on the text width of the license texts!
[05:13:38] <barosl> The expat license posted on FSF, the X11 license, the MIT license posted on the OSI site, and the Rust license
[05:13:44] <barosl> They all have different text widths
[05:14:19] <Yurume> 1GVGJ all the way
[05:14:43] <barosl> Expat: 70 / X11 & MIT: 80 / Rust: 60 (!!)
[05:14:48] <barosl> Where did 60 come from
[05:15:35] <Gankro> obvi 60 is standard legal formatting
[05:15:57] <Gankro> I'm sure Mozilla legal went over it with a fine comb
[05:16:04] <barosl> Maybe the judges cannot read lines more than 60 letters /s
[05:16:18] <Yurume> https://github.com/lifthrasiir/cson-rust/blob/master/src/lib.rs#L4-L17 this one I've written is 70.
[05:17:25] <barosl> We have a convention of tw=100 on the Rust code, so we should alter the license text to follow it!
[05:17:44] <Yurume> actually that's why we have several variants of licensing texts for each text width in licenseck.py
[05:18:06] <geofft> change the line width every six weeks 
[05:18:09] <barosl> Huh, do already suffer from the problem?
[05:18:15] <barosl> do we already*
[05:18:26] <geofft> that way if someone makes a proprietary fork we can tell which version it's from! 
[05:18:50] <Yurume> geofft: meh, just use the varying number of trailing spaces
[05:18:51] <barosl> https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/etc/licenseck.py
[05:18:51] <barosl> Ack
[05:19:10] <barosl> That BSD's are enjoyable

[08:44:00] <barosl> huon, I want to let you know another fact for fun: The port number (54856) was chosen based on the Unicode code point of the Korean character, '홈'
[08:44:03] <barosl> http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/d648/index.htm
[08:44:14] <barosl> And it reads as [Hom]

[18:56:26] <mrmonday> GaryOak_: there's a lot more to functional programming than just side-effect freedom
[18:56:45] <GaryOak_> like first order functions?
[18:57:01] <mrmonday> I don't know of a good resource for understanding the benefits, other than actually writing some code and understanding what's going on
[18:57:17] <mrmonday> wikipedia's probably a good start, I haven't actually read it though
[18:57:23] <GaryOak_> I figured I couldn't really understand it until I try to build something
[18:58:11] <mrmonday> (also, I guess I should mention that functional programming doesn't have to give any side effect freedom...)
[19:01:11] <mrmonday> I could rant/rave about different programming styles forever, I'll try not to do that though :p
[19:01:18] <GaryOak_> is it mostly about the idempotent input -> output idea?
[19:02:25] <GaryOak_> I guess that's just immutable state
[19:03:59] <mrmonday> there's lots of things which make functional programming nice... it's typically far easier to reason about what a program is doing (multitude of reasons for that, depending on which language you're using), and it's typically super-easy to compose different bits of functionality without worrying about weird interactions
[19:04:23] *** Quits: eerie (eerie@moz-nu5r7u.red.bezeqint.net) (Connection closed)
[19:05:00] <GaryOak_> mrmonday: that kind of makes sense, is that why most functional languages use types?
[19:05:18] <GaryOak_> because you need to know what a function can operate on
[19:05:49] <mrmonday> well, that's an entirely different question really - types are important in all languages, not just functional ones
[19:06:11] <GaryOak_> well static vs dynamic types
[19:06:22] <mrmonday> I guess they're typically a lot more visible with functional languages though, since you can learn a lot about what a function does by simply reading its type signature
[19:07:13] <GaryOak_> like in Rust, you know exactly what an input needs to pass it to a function
[19:07:49] <tiffany> garyoak: functional programming languages tend to have strong formal bases in mathematics, particularly type theory
[19:07:53] <mrmonday> For example (Haskell syntax): map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b], you can pretty much figure out exactly what the function's going to do there, even without seeing the implementation
[19:08:15] <mrmonday> it takes a function which take's a's and returns b's, as well as a list of a's
[19:08:18] <mrmonday> then returns a list of b's
[19:08:32] <mrmonday> so you can fairly reasonably assume that it's going to apply the function to every element in the list
[19:08:47] <tiffany> but there are dynamic functional languages
[19:08:49] <tiffany> such as erlang
[19:09:13] <UberLambda> Anyone using some kind of lisp here?
[19:09:37] <mrmonday> that's a pretty interesting thing to think about actually - imperitive languages appeared since they model the hardware, and that's how hardware works
[19:09:38] <tiffany> uberlambda: why?
[19:09:45] <UberLambda> tiffany: https://github.com/digego/extempore
[19:09:51] <mrmonday> whereas functional languages typically express a mathematical model of how things work
[19:10:06] <mrmonday> of course, pretty much all modern languages are converging somewhere in the middle
[19:10:10] <UberLambda> tiffany: I think this thing would be totally amazing for prototyping & gamedev
[19:10:46] <GaryOak_> functional languages model mathematics, while imperative languages model hardware
[19:11:31] <tiffany> uberlambda: system's language lisp with a whole lot of buzzwords?
[19:12:12] <UberLambda> tiffany: I like the compiler-as-a-service concept... not sure if other lisps offer such functionality
[19:12:37] <tiffany> other lisps let you compile code at runtime, usually, afaik
[19:12:44] <UberLambda> tiffany: watching the demo, the guy literally reloads single functions while the application is running via emacs
[19:12:44] <mrmonday> GaryOak_: that's one way to think about it - it's a little unfair to completely generalise like that though - you don't need any knowledge of maths to use functional languages
[19:12:58] <tiffany> that's not really terribly novel
[19:13:04] <tiffany> reloading single functions is very easy to implement
[19:13:09] <GaryOak_> sure, but you are using the concepts without knowing the background
[19:13:27] <GaryOak_> which is how we learn math
[19:13:29] <UberLambda> tiffany: speaking of which, do you think that these things would perform good?
[19:13:43] <tiffany> I don't see anything particularly low level in the examples...
[19:13:50] <UberLambda> tiffany: I swear I could try coding a full game like this... if the functional part doesn't bite me too hard
[19:14:30] <UberLambda> tiffany: afaik, there was a demo with opengl
[19:14:43] <UberLambda> not really low-level, but not even so high-level
[19:14:47] <tiffany> that's not exactly performance-intensive on the host language
[19:15:17] <UberLambda> tiffany: ergo?
[19:15:48] <UberLambda> tiffany: I mean, does that mean that it could be much (50x +) slower than, say, Rust?

[19:16:09] <UberLambda> well, the demo wasn't that impressive, that's true
[19:16:18] <tiffany> you could write a 60fps game in ruby as long as you're not doing too much game logic and have a decent rendering pipeline
[19:16:46] <UberLambda> tiffany: yeah, but what if you needed the extra time to iterate a octree or similiar?
[19:17:20] <tiffany> the games I'm developing, the render thread uses about 5% cpu, and 95% of that time is spend computing matrices, something which I will likely migrate to the GPU when vulkan comes around

[19:24:43] <zwarich> live reloading with LLVM and any optimization is a pain

[21:05:59] <WindowsBunny> oh my god I fucking hate vim
[21:06:06] <tiffany> why?
[21:06:14] <WindowsBunny> Because git always sets it to the default editor
[21:06:24] <XMPPwocky> export EDITOR=whatever
[21:06:31] <XMPPwocky> or setenv or whatever powershell feels like
[21:06:46] <tiffany> git config --global core.editor 'emacsclient -c'

[21:07:35] <WindowsBunny> git config --global core.editor "'C:/Program Files (x86)/Notepad++/notepad++.exe' -multiInst -notabbar -nosession -noPlugin"
[21:07:52] <WindowsBunny> I'm just so annoyed at the default of vim
[21:08:05] <tiffany> it actually defaults to vim?
[21:08:08] <WindowsBunny> yes
[21:08:12] <tiffany> I guess it makes sense

[21:08:43] <tiffany> oh
[21:08:49] <tiffany> what would you have it use by default on windows?
[21:09:02] <killercup> ed of course!
[21:09:12] <WindowsBunny> Even plain notepad would be better
[21:09:20] <tiffany> uhh
[21:09:23] <tiffany> it really wouldn't
[21:09:32] <XMPPwocky> yeah let's not go overboard heer
[21:09:33] <tiffany> notepad fucks up line endings so hard it's incredible
[21:09:38] <WindowsBunny> true
[21:09:41] <tiffany> just opening and saving a file can fuck it up
[21:09:52] <WindowsBunny> and notepad++ isn't always installed
[21:09:54] <tiffany> it drops all \n's
[21:09:58] <tiffany> enter key = \r\n
[21:10:09] <tiffany> and word wrap is not soft word wrap
[21:10:11] <tiffany> it is hard word wrap
[21:10:15] <tiffany> it actually inserts newline characters
[21:10:41] <WindowsBunny> No, it doesn't insert newlines in the saved file when you use word wrap
[21:10:56] <tiffany> it did that on me at least once
[21:11:00] <tiffany> they might have changed it
[21:11:15] <tiffany> I opened it in notepad, it broke the file, and then I tried it in a proper editor, and..
[21:11:19] <tiffany> newlines, where it word wrapped
[21:11:35] <WindowsBunny> tiffany: I just tested opening a file with \n newlines in notepad.exe
[21:11:39] <WindowsBunny> I enabled word wrap
[21:11:39] <c74d> Doesn't Vim use hard line wrapping for Git commit messages?

[21:11:48] <WindowsBunny> opened it in notepad++, no issues
[21:12:12] <WindowsBunny> tiffany: It did insert a utf-8 BOM at the beginning
[21:12:15] <WindowsBunny> But that's it
[21:12:28] <killercup> if you assume you have vi on windows, don't you also have nano? its a bit friendlier and still works in a terminal
[21:12:41] <tiffany> oh boy
[21:12:47] <tiffany> okay so
[21:12:51] <tiffany> 1. notepad supports utf-8 now?
[21:13:01] <tiffany> 2. since the fuck when did utf-8 have BOM?
[21:13:24] <tiffany> 3. gross
[21:13:45] <XMPPwocky> > GoldSource is a heavily modified version of the Quake engine, and runs on C++ programming code.

[21:14:06] <WindowsBunny> 1. For a long time, yes
[21:14:18] <WindowsBunny> 2. Always? It's optional though.
[21:14:28] <WindowsBunny> 3. k
[21:14:49] <tiffany> it's just painful how notepad tries so hard to fuck up every file you open in it

[21:15:15] <tiffany> but sure
[21:15:25] <tiffany> I suppose if it doesn't do hard word wrap, you could edit git commit messages in it
[21:16:14] <FreeFull> Notepad doesn't support unix line endings
[21:16:27] <FreeFull> Wordpad does
[21:16:40] <tiffany> does wordpad even support plaintext files?
[21:16:43] <FreeFull> Yes
[21:16:45] <XMPPwocky> if you believe in yourself you can do anything^M
[21:16:46] <c74d> Why is hard wrapping a problem there? Can Git not handle CR-LF line endings?
[21:16:48] <tiffany> last time I used it, it wrote an RDF header even when I saved it as .txt
[21:16:52] <GaryOak_> XMPPwocky: thanks
[21:16:54] <FreeFull> Git probably can handle it
[21:16:59] <tiffany> c74d: there's a bunch of comments at the end of the file
[21:17:03] <tiffany> telling you what files have been changed
[21:17:09] <tiffany> if those hard wordwrap, they stop being commented out
[21:17:10] <FreeFull> But if you open an existing file that has unix line endings in Notepad, everything ends up one line
[21:17:18] <tiffany> and so your commit message has word salad at the end
[21:19:05] <c74d> tiffany: Hm, I thought that changed to having everything below a given line ignored?
[21:19:18] <tiffany> maybe

[21:28:27] <eddyb> tiffany: definitely need a better name than "logic" errors
[21:28:53] <eddyb> tiffany: protocol violation?
[21:28:56] <tiffany> definitely
[21:29:08] <tiffany> yeah, you can validate state machines such as those provided by protocols
[21:29:20] <XMPPwocky> i want to say "expression bug" or something

[21:29:50] <eddyb> for all of your expression problems
[21:29:52] <eddyb> :P
[21:30:05] <eddyb> tiffany: I meant, protocol as in interface
[21:30:06] <tiffany> nothing stops you from validating a model of a protocol/API/etc. that doesn't line up with reality, though
[21:30:19] <eddyb> I'm trying to remember a better word for this
[21:30:22] <eddyb> tiffany: contract!
[21:30:56] <tiffany> oh
[21:30:58] <tiffany> yeah, idris does those too
[21:31:42] <tiffany> of course, idris is still prone to the classic problem with formal correctness, that all of your complexity skeletons come out of the closet

[22:37:28] <bluss> or a minor thinko. those happen
[22:38:45] <huon> it seems like struct Vec<T> { len: usize, ... } isn't a crazy thing to get "the type includes the length" from
[22:38:53] <huon> i.e. the definition of the type literally includes a length field
