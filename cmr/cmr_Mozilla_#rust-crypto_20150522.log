[17:11:03] <Ilari> "I don't think browsers will ever be able to handle anything other than low value data, so I probably won't have to worry about web browsers and what do (or don't) validate before use."

[17:19:42] <Ilari> If one wanted to try validate "safe" primes, one way would be to do Baillie–PSW on (p-1)/2 and then base-2 Fermat on p...
[17:23:13] <Ilari> AFAIK, there is no known number other than "safe" primes that passes those tests.
[17:36:51] <Ilari> BTW, got more ideas for extra signature inputs than hash domains and contexts? :-)
[17:55:22] <eternaleye> So, wait, he's never visited his bank's page?

[19:04:51] <Tiffany> ilari: how could it?
[19:04:59] <Tiffany> you need to make new keys every time in order to achieve forward secrecy
[19:05:14] <Tiffany> since deriving the shared secret is entirely deterministic
[19:06:20] <Tiffany> if you are able to obtain one of the private keys that was in use during a message exchange, you will be able to derive the shared secret and decrypt the message, how could that be FS?
[19:06:37] <Tiffany> I think I'm going to avoid using crypto_box for this reason
[19:06:52] <Tiffany> it seems easier to use regular old DH instead of building a big system for ephemeral key management
[19:09:00] <Tiffany> I expect the reason crypto_box uses DHE is because it makes the API simpler, being able to derive the shared secret instead of needing to store it somewhere (even though it does offer an API for caching the secret instead of deriving it every time)

[19:27:42] <Ilari> Tiffany: Well, DHE is the standard Diffie-Hellman...
[19:27:47] <Tiffany> er
[19:27:51] <Tiffany> I might be confusing terms a bit
[19:28:16] <Tiffany> I'm thinking of the thing libsodium does, where it derives a shared secret by combining your private key with the other party's public key
[19:28:44] <eternaleye> Tiffany: Um, "new keys every time" is the E in DHE (Ephemeral)
[19:28:55] <Tiffany> oh
[19:29:34] <Tiffany> the thing I don't like about crypto_box is how you need to make new asymmetric keys every time
[19:31:00] <Tiffany> yeah
[19:31:08] <Tiffany> DHE seems annoying to manage
[19:32:27] <eternaleye> Tiffany: See: Noise Pipes
[19:32:54] <eternaleye> https://github.com/trevp/noise/wiki
[19:33:11] <Tiffany> maybe there's something I'm missing
[19:33:48] <Tiffany> it seems like it'd be easier to just feed random data as one of the inputs to DH and get a shared secret which is different every time, than to make new keys every time
[19:34:05] <Tiffany> oh
[19:34:14] <Tiffany> I see now
[19:34:48] <Tiffany> that wouldn't have forward secrecy, since the "common paint" (wikipedia doesn't seem to mention a better term) would either be in the clear or encrypted with the receiver's public key
[19:36:39] <Tiffany> there's still something that bothers me about needing to generate new asymmetric keys every time though

[19:49:42] <eternaleye> bascule: Looking at the noise2 document (https://github.com/trevp/noise/blob/noise2/noise.md) again, I'm not liking the strategy it takes for padding.
[19:50:41] <eternaleye> bascule: I'd much prefer if Payload used one of the (various) minimal padding mechanisms, rather than a trailing u32 length and such
[19:50:58] <eternaleye> bascule: (leaving aside that it'd be a pain in Rust due to sized-type-after-unsized-type)
[19:51:26] <eternaleye> bascule: IIRC, there was a proof done about the "one set bit, followed by unset bits up until the padding boundary"
[19:57:52] <eternaleye> bascule: Or there's the "padding byte = number of padding bytes" approach
[20:01:01] <Tiffany> the 1 followed by 0s thing is used by sha, I remember

[20:33:31] <eternaleye> DST structs without that are just a massive pain in the ass

[20:35:23] <eternaleye> I'd also really love the ability to do compile-time slicing, but that can be implemented once generic ints go in

[21:33:47] <eternaleye> Ilari: Anyway, I actually want to bound on _exactly_ primitive array, or primitive unsized slice
[21:34:15] <eternaleye> Ilari: Since I want it for DST structs that I pass to ioctls, like the device-mapper ioctls
[21:34:59] <eternaleye> Ilari: I want to be able to allocate as Foo<[U; n]>, and then as-convert the pointer to Foo<[U]>
[21:35:50] <eternaleye> Ilari: Hell, even just being able to bound on "any size of primitive array" would be nice, though not perfect.
[21:37:03] <eternaleye> Ilari: As is, you either get stuck with relatively unconstrained generics (not necessarily contiguous in memory, doesn't work for ioctl) or you transmute.
[21:37:32] <eternaleye> Ilari: I mean, Index and len() don't tell you nearly enough to actually guarantee safety there.
[21:40:18] <Tiffany> this all sounds like dependent types, eternaleye
[21:42:01] <eternaleye> Tiffany: Not really, no
[21:42:13] <eternaleye> Tiffany: Dependent types would satisfy _some_ of it
[21:42:28] <eternaleye> Tiffany: Being able to constrain it to [T; n] for some N
[21:43:13] <eternaleye> Tiffany: But there are functions (like the actual ioctl call) that don't care about n at all, and just want to know that this is a valid Foo, where Foo<[T]> is much more relevant
[21:43:40] <eternaleye> Tiffany: And that's one where the dependency is _erased_
[21:44:17] <eternaleye> Tiffany: quantheory already did an RFC for (integer-)dependent types; it got postponed to post-1.0 (I should check on that)
[21:44:25] <eternaleye> Tiffany: But that wouldn't solve the whole issue
[21:44:51] <eternaleye> Tiffany: Since if I made Foo a dependent type on the size, like Foo<n>, then it *could not express* Foo<[T]>
[21:45:47] <eternaleye> Tiffany: That kind of bound may require new syntax - either Foo<_> in a dependent-types way, or Foo<[T; _]> in an HKT-ish way
[21:46:36] <eternaleye> Though it might need to be ?, to mean "runtime determined", since HKT seems to use _ to mean "compile time determined"
[21:55:38] <Ilari> Also, when coding up ECC stuff, I came across places where I would have needed to express dependent type that is array or at least something array-like.
[21:56:08] <eternaleye> Ilari: Mm, and associated constants still ICE there, huh?
[21:57:34] <Ilari> Yup, can still ICE the compiler with those.
