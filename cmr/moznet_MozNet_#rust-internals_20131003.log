[00:06:33] <benh> if not for the copyright implications I'd be tempted to include an IOCCC submission in a raw string test

[01:21:42] <acrichto> benh: did you have more work you wanted to do on raw string literals?
[01:22:12] <benh> Not right now. I just push -f'd to my branch and was gonna ping you once my local make check finishes.
[01:22:32] <benh> I extended the run-pass test a bit and added a commit with some mention of raw strings in docs/{rust,tutorial}.md
[01:22:34] <acrichto> did you mean to leave out the definition of raw_string_body in the grammar?
[01:22:52] <benh> yes, because I can't figure it out and someone I talked to suggested it's not really expressable in ebnf :(
[01:23:17] <acrichto> yeah I guess it isn't
[01:23:22] <benh> or at least not conveniently, i dunno
[01:23:27] <acrichto> would you mind explicitly defining itin the paragraphs below though?
[01:23:32] <acrichto> at least just mentioning it

[01:30:13] <benh> "The _raw string body_ is not defined in the EBNF grammar above: it can contain any sequence of Unicode characters and is terminated only by another `U+0022` ..." etc 
[01:30:33] <acrichto> sounds good to me
[01:30:38] <acrichto> although I'm no grammar nazi
[01:31:38] <benh> ok, then I'll let the PR sit until someone else has a look at it. thanks for your help :)
[01:31:49] <acrichto> np, thanks again for taking care of it :)
[01:32:02] <kimundi> Yeah, EBNF uses regular expressions, and raw string literals are not regular ;)
[01:32:06] <benh> sorry again to kimundi and Eridius for stealing their pet project :)
[01:32:27] <Eridius> benh: that's ok. Turns out I'm still busy with my path stuff anyway
[01:32:32] <Eridius> I'd rather have it done sooner
[01:33:02] <kimundi> And I got be awake till 3:30 am to play around with dynamic typing
[01:33:17] * kimundi wants to get up at 8 am
[01:33:20] <benh> kimundi: wikipedia made it sound like ebnf covers context-free grammars, and anyway i only attended one year of computer science in uni :)
[01:33:24] * kimundi asks himself what he is oing
[01:33:27] <Eridius> I also started a brand new job today, so I suddenly have less free time than before ;)
[01:33:37] <benh> Eridius: Oh, congrats :)
[01:33:45] <Eridius> benh: thanks
[01:34:21] <kimundi> benh: EBNF IS a context free grammar, that uses regular expressions for defining each of its rules
[01:34:38] <benh> oh dear
[01:35:15] <sfackler> acrichto: I'm going through rt::io and getting rid of the newtype wrappers, but rt::uv::process::set_stdio reaches into an rt::io::pipe::UnboundedPipe and messes around in the uvio internals of it. What's the best way of dealing with that?
[01:35:24] * kimundi wrote a test about that on tuesday
[01:35:56] <acrichto> sfackler: I never really could quite get the two to work out with one another
[01:35:58] <kimundi> grammars, turing machines, linear automata, regular expressions, computability...
[01:36:23] <benh> I had some vaguely recollection that a^n x b^n was the standard example for a non-regular language but... :)
[01:36:42] <sfackler> crate-private functions would be perfect here :( I guess I can either leave UnboundedPipe as a newtype or add a public function on it that extracts the native handle with some dire warnings attached to the doc
[01:36:43] <acrichto> sfackler: I tried my best to hide the uv implementation, but currently it can only bind a uv pipe and no other pipe (if we ever had another)
[01:37:15] <acrichto> sfackler: everything which has some parent as private is currently "not crate public"
[01:37:31] <acrichto> it might be too intra-crate public, but it's certainly not inter-crate public
[01:37:45] <sfackler> right
[01:37:51] * dbaupp is a little nervous about "crate-private" wrt to partial compilation of crates
[01:37:59] <kimundi> benh: Yeah, you can disprove it as an regular language with the pumping lemma ;)
[01:38:16] <acrichto> sfackler: basically just do whatever you feel looks ok, there's no attachment to it, I was just doing my best to hide the uv implementation
[01:38:38] <sfackler> I guess I'll leave it as a newtype for now and stick a comment on it
[01:38:38] <acrichto> dbaupp: we have a much longer way to go I imagine before we get partial compilation of crates
[01:39:06] <dbaupp> acrichto: yep, just I imagine this will make it harder

[01:55:03] <cmr> See the huge drop?
[01:55:05] <cmr> That's lint
[01:55:22] <strcat> I want to make a Pointer trait and replace 90% of the @ ASAP
[01:55:32] <strcat> it would be a big difference due to them being freed as soon as possible
[01:55:53] <strcat> rather than being freed when the call stack gets back past the point where the original was
[01:56:31] <dbaupp> what's the minimum pointer trait required for that? just borrow(&'a self) -> &'a T?
[01:57:09] <strcat> yes but it has to be wired up to the compiler's deref stuff
[01:57:17] <strcat> in a way that you can do &*x but not &mut *x
[01:58:32] <dbaupp> isn't that automatic?
[01:58:43] <acrichto> cmr: I like that graph. That is a nice graph.

[02:01:19] <dbaupp> cmr: how long does each one generally take?
[02:02:14] <cmr> dbaupp: each bench? About 4 mintues. I gzip+rsync every 16 minutes and it consistently has 4 benches to upload.
[02:04:15] <dbaupp> cmr: and each build?
[02:04:25] <cmr> dbaupp: no idea, I don't keep track of them.

[02:04:51] <cmr> yeah

[03:27:54] <acrichto> dbaupp: nah just now running with RUST_DEBUG_BORROW (which I think is the right thing to do?)
[03:28:09] * dbaupp has no idea
[03:28:15] <acrichto> nopt failures with opt successes are always disturbing
[03:28:33] * dbaupp was really excited to see a 1GB drop on IRFY
[03:28:40] <dbaupp> :(
[03:29:18] <dbaupp> acrichto: yeah, it is... hopefully it's not an LLVM bug, and just us doing something silly.
[03:30:35] <cmr> Yeah
[03:30:37] <cmr> LLVM bugs :|
[03:30:48] <acrichto> hmm, it appears that RUST_DEBUG_BORROWS was entirely un-helpful
[03:31:16] <acrichto> argh it's a static constant set to falst
[03:31:17] <acrichto> false*
[03:31:22] <sfackler> acrichto: any idea why this process test failed with the newtype changes? it works for me on my linux vm at stage1 http://buildbot.rust-lang.org/builders/auto-linux-32-nopt-t/builds/934/steps/test/logs/stdio
[03:31:25] * acrichto rebuilds
[03:31:42] <acrichto> sfackler: hmm that's the second failure
[03:31:51] <acrichto> these libuv process tests absolutely hate me
[03:33:24] <acrichto> oh hm maybe the test is just wrong
[03:33:28] <acrichto> does eof raise a condition?
[03:33:56] <sfackler> no
[03:34:09] <sfackler> it just causes read to return none
[03:34:26] <acrichto> perhaps the test is just wrong then
[03:34:33] <acrichto> oh dear
[03:34:39] <acrichto> RUST_DEBUG_BORROWS prints once per borrow
[03:34:43] <acrichto> and I just compiled rustc with it
[03:34:50] <acrichto> this is not going to end well
[03:34:55] <cmr> Heh
[03:34:57] <sfackler> bahaha
[03:35:14] <acrichto> sfackler: would you mind making a small amendment to your pull
[03:35:33] <sfackler> sure, what?
[03:35:33] <acrichto> sfackler: line 87 of rtio-process.rs, just remove the Some(0) case
[03:36:00] <acrichto> apparently I don't know how to write a read_everything() function
[03:36:10] <sfackler> :/ will libuv really do a zero byte read?
[03:36:28] <acrichto> I'm hoping that's the bug?
[03:36:38] <acrichto> it's kinda not a cool bug
[03:36:43] <acrichto> I kinda doubt it's the bug :(
[03:37:31] <sfackler> done

[05:11:32] <cmr> Eridius: I see Path::from_str disobeys the standard FromStr convention of returning an Option. Reasoning for this?
[05:12:03] <Eridius> it's not a FromStr impl
[05:12:11] <cmr> I know
[05:12:13] <Eridius> there's an actual FromStr impl that returns an Option
[05:12:14] <cmr> That's why I'm asking.
[05:12:17] <cmr> Oh
[05:12:19] <cmr> Ok
[05:12:39] <cmr> Ah right, static methods from traits and method methods share different namespaces.
[05:12:40] <Eridius> there's both Path::from_vec and Path::from_str. I needed both constructors, and didn't have a better name
[05:12:44] <Eridius> right
[05:15:50] <dbaupp> Eridius: is there are particular reason that with_display_str is still around?
[05:16:15] <Eridius> dbaupp: in case you're not outputing to format!()
[05:16:54] <dbaupp> Eridius: implement to_str() on Display and FilenameDisplay?
[05:16:55] <Eridius> dbaupp: for example, std::io still uses it in order to construct an Err(~str) value
[05:17:07] <Eridius> that still causes unnecessary allocation
[05:17:33] <dbaupp> oh, and with_display_str doesn't necessarily allocate?
[05:17:33] <dbaupp> hm
[05:17:35] <Eridius> take std::io. it has `do path.with_display_str |p| { Err(~"error opening " + p) }`. Avoids unnecessary allocation, although to be fair that is at the cost of a closure (which is hopefully inlined out, but w/e)
[05:17:48] <Eridius> with_display_str doesn't allocate unless it needs to insert U+FFDF
[05:17:50] <Eridius> U+FFFD
[05:17:56] <dbaupp> yeah
[05:18:11] <Eridius> and since one of the design goals of the path was to avoid unnecessary allocation, it seems like something worth keeping
[05:18:32] <Eridius> I count 8 uses of .with_display_str left in the rest of the source base (though I only looked at how std::io uses it)
[05:20:33] <cmr>  +    /// Returns a normalized string representation of a path, by removing all empty
[05:20:35] <cmr> +    /// components, and unnecessary . and .. components. 
[05:21:01] <Eridius> cmr: ?
[05:21:07] <cmr> Eridius: What counts as unnecessary for . and ..? Aren't they *all* unnecessary? Does this give an absolute path/
[05:21:26] <Eridius> cmr: ../../foo is a valid relative path with necessary .. components
[05:21:31] <Eridius> similarly there's no empty path, there's "."
[05:21:51] <cmr> ../../foo/.., the last .. is unnecessary?
[05:21:59] <Eridius> cmr: yes, that would get normalized to ../..
[05:22:59] <Eridius> note that the .normalize() methods are largely just helpers, and that I'd be kind of surprised if anyone actually needs to use them, but I left them public because a) the old path did, and b) it's not implausible that someone would want to normalize a path without going through the rigamarole of creating a Path object, then converting it back into a ~str/~[u8]

[05:23:35] <cmr> That fact should be documented.
[05:23:44] <Eridius> honestly, it's public largely because the old path had it public
[05:24:14] <cmr> If there are no users, can you just make it private?
[05:24:18] <Eridius> also, there are examples of .. being normalized away in tests. But I should mention normalization in the crate comment
[05:24:22] <Eridius> I suppose I can
[05:25:08] <cmr> Github's diff viewer isn't that great for complex patches like this.
[05:25:17] <Eridius> no it's not, unfortunately
[05:25:28] <Eridius> if you slap .patch on the end of the PR URL you get something you can pass to `git am` to look at locally
[05:27:47] <cmr> Not really important to the patch but https://github.com/kballard/rust/commit/9775a89958bbb2cecae4e5b1f221c09d8c653f56#diff-e2d647cfb76e47dedebab735369868d6R920 could have you some extra macroization for the from_str calls.
[05:28:04] <cmr> s/you/used
[05:28:16] <Eridius> cmr: yeah, those t!() macros are from the one defined at the top of the module. Most of the tests re-define a specialized macro

[05:35:19] <Eridius> I don't know what olsonjeffery's FileInfo is
[05:35:45] <Eridius> the stat stuff was also copied verbatim from the old path module. I think it really should be removed from path entirely and done elsewhere (and in fact is already mostly done in rt::io as I understand it)
[05:36:48] <cmr> http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/master/std/rt/io/file/trait.FileSystemInfo.html
[05:37:07] <cmr> It is implemented for Path, so that old stat stuff should be nuked if possible.
[05:37:17] <cmr> I think rustpkg or workcache might use it?
[05:37:25] <cmr> Not sure if they got ported to the new fileinfo stuff
[05:37:47] <Eridius> I see. Well, I figure I'll leave stat in for now since I'm pretty sure there are clients of the API, and it can be nuked in a different PR

[05:58:54] <cmr> I looked more closely at the windows stuff than the posix stuff.
[05:59:00] <cmr> Probably needs a windows expert to review it.
[05:59:11] <cmr> It looks nasty, lots of things to handle :\

[06:00:51] <cmr> I have a friend who is deep into windows, but he only knows so much about the details of win32, he's more of a .net guy.

[06:01:21] <Eridius> dbaupp: just from reading the description of your rand PR, I like it. I didn't realize re-seeding PRNGs was a typical thing
[06:01:36] <dbaupp> Eridius: being able to control it is
[06:01:59] <dbaupp> and having the option to reuse memory/arrays seemed reasonable.
[06:02:06] * dbaupp is happy to remove that if necessary

[06:03:05] <Eridius> because having an env var control seeding of my RNGs seems kind of surprising

[06:04:28] <cmr> dbaupp: agree
[06:04:56] <dbaupp> Eridius: well, you have to find a seed that gives you that :P

[06:05:30] <cmr> Well the game can reseed itself.

[06:26:31] <cmr> Well that's truly a gem.
[06:27:07] <cmr> local_data gives you shared semantics, and so does @, and @mut just adds an extra layer of dynamic failure to the pile.
[06:27:26] <cmr> (which local_data already does!)
[06:27:30] <Eridius> and who doesn't love dynamic failure!
[06:27:43] <dbaupp> it becomes @mut TaskRng so it can be passed around normally, otherwise it'd require a closure
[06:27:59] <dbaupp> (rather than being just TaskRng, that is.)

[06:39:32] <cmr> We need a policy about obsolete. Whether to support it for a full release cycle or what.

[06:39:32] <cmr> Yes.

[06:41:39] <cmr> &const needs to stay, it'd be nice if we had an obsolete checker for old-for-loop, loop/continue needs to stay

[06:44:28] <cmr> (at least!)
[06:44:42] <cmr> And most of them suggest invalid syntax as replacements :\
[06:44:57] <benh> I was going to fix the invalid syntax at least :)
[06:46:13] <cmr> It's really confusing when you make a typo by hitting a key by accident and rustc suggests you replace that obsolete mode with something weird.
[06:46:45] <cmr> Or leave out the struct name in the constructor and it tells you some nonsense about records.
[06:46:54] <cmr> When did those go? 0.4? :P
[06:46:58] <cmr> Earlier?
[06:47:35] <benh> I think with 0.4
[06:48:35] <benh> You're not sympathetic to the use case of copying outdated code from stackoverflow? :)
[06:48:40] <cmr> No
[06:48:42] <cmr> Not at all.
[06:49:11] <cmr> Backwards compatability isn't a concern of mine at all.
[06:49:14] <cmr> Not yet :)
[06:49:55] <cmr> I like that we have obsolete warnings, and I'm fine with them living for at least a release cycle, but much longer than that and it becomes a bit silly.
[06:51:01] <Eridius> backwards compatibility becomes important at 1.0
[06:51:13] <Eridius> before then, it's a gift to the community, not an obligation
[06:55:37] <benh> How long has <-> swap been gone?
[06:55:53] <cmr> Removed in the 0.6-0.7 span.
[06:56:41] <benh> I assume priv { ... } has been dead longer than that?

[07:04:58] <cmr> Types implement ToStr all the time :)
[07:05:34] <SiegeLord> Let's say I implement Clone... how will rust-lang.org's documentation show my library implementing it?
[07:07:11] <cmr> I imagine it'd just show up in the list of implementors.
[07:07:39] <SiegeLord> How would it know?
[07:08:02] <cmr> Because the std docs would be regenerated any time a library's docs are build.
[07:08:05] <cmr> *built
[07:08:12] <cmr> It's all in the json
[07:08:23] <SiegeLord> The only way it'd work is if you'd couple ALL the documentation in Rust's ecosystem be compiled in one spot

[07:08:46] <SiegeLord> That's not scalable

[07:09:09] <cmr> But I don't think it's a problem.
[07:09:47] <SiegeLord> I'd rather my library's documentation show that there exists a trait Clone within some external crate, and then it shows its implementors
[07:10:55] <cmr> Hm, I can see that as desirable too, at least in the docs for the library.
[07:11:09] <cmr> But I don't think that precludes showing all the known things that implement a given trait on the trait page>?

[07:18:32] <SiegeLord> But I guess I just started using the new documentation, so maybe the use case isn't apparent to me yet
[07:19:08] <cmr> I think it's useful if you're using a trait bound and want to know which types it will accept.
[07:19:40] <SiegeLord> That doesn't seem very useful, as you already know everything there is to know about that type
[07:19:42] <cmr> I agree that it's definitely not as useful as knowing how you can use a given type though :p

[07:22:30] <SiegeLord> It seems to be analogous to the types from external crates though... at least superficially
[07:22:52] <cmr> The only hard problem is where to put them.
[07:23:37] <SiegeLord> Somewhere in the crate root, I'd imagine
[07:23:46] <cmr> Which crate?

[07:24:41] *** kimundi is now known as zz_kimundi
[07:25:04] <SiegeLord> The crate we are documenting
[07:25:40] <SiegeLord> Well, again... depends on how you deal with cross-crate things...
[07:26:03] <SiegeLord> If you insist on a global mesh of documentations, there could be a unique global documentation page with built-in types in it
[07:27:02] <SiegeLord> If you don't, then each crate can have a section for built-in types unique to it

[17:32:35] <Eridius> erickt_: if you want to run tests yourself instead of waiting for bors, you can grab an Amazon EC2 m1.medium. I did that the other day to test a linux failure
[17:32:45] <Eridius> costs $0.12 per hour
[17:33:13] <Eridius> specifically I needed to attach gdb, so I couldn't just rely on bors
[17:33:34] <erickt_> yeah I've done that before :) In this case I think I've already gotten it and there was just some small edge case I hadn't considered
[17:34:20] <erickt_> Eridius: for example here, I wrote `assert_eq!(int::max_value.to_u32(), Some(i64::max_value as u32))`
[17:34:35] <erickt_> that is quite wrong on 32 bit machines :)

[17:43:28] <acrichto> the gate happens before injection so it works just fine
[17:43:49] <acrichto> std-macros are maintained by the compiler anyway, so if we change how macros are invoked it's our responsibility to change those macros anyway

[18:48:27] <cmr> tikue_: https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9686
[18:50:13] <engla> acrichto: how does #[feature(globs)]; interact with the prelude import? Every module in rust uses globs for use std::prelude::*;
[18:50:26] <cmr> engla: feature gating happens before injection.
[18:50:30] <acrichto> engla: similarly to macro_rules, the gate checking all occurs before injection
[18:50:42] <acrichto> so if we do decide to remove it, it's gonna be pretty painful
[18:51:01] <acrichto> but we're open to "removing it" in a sense of vastly reducing the complexity if there's only one use case
[18:51:11] *** Quits: lbergstrom (Adium@moz-7DDD1300.ifiber.telenet-ops.be) (Quit: Leaving.)
[18:51:20] <engla> aha
[18:59:26] *** zz_kimundi is now known as kimundi
[19:01:12] <engla> cmr: so great. So for inspiration, how did you find that lint had a cycle?
[19:01:42] <cmr> engla: I didn't, acrichto did
[19:02:23] <acrichto> I was running through my todo list, and one of the items was "make sure lint is actually sane", and when I was reading over the code I noticed that there was a cycle which retained the tcx after trans
[19:02:39] <acrichto> this had also happened before so I kinda knew what to look out for
[19:02:47] <engla> aha ok
[19:03:05] <engla> so no tools for cycle detection or memory consumption per module
[19:03:18] <acrichto> sadly not that I know of
[19:03:23] <acrichto> other than "your eyes"
[19:03:33] <acrichto> which I've gotta say are some of the worst tools
[19:03:33] <engla> Maybe I can drop the swapfile now again
[19:03:43] <cmr> Mk II Eyeball
[19:03:46] <engla> better than my eyes
[19:03:53] <acrichto> I've been toying around with the idea of asserting that the tcx has a refcount of 0 after trans
[19:04:29] <cmr> That sounds like a great idea to me.
[19:10:04] *** kimundi is now known as zz_kimundi
[19:20:29] <engla> So with the lint memory release, it looks like the memory peak for smaller creates is during linting. I.e. compiling libsyntax peaks at 1600M resident before dropping to 600M, climbing to end on around 1100MB. just eyeballing
[19:20:41] <engla> *smaller crates
[19:21:35] <acrichto> engla: it's probably peaking during trans
[19:21:50] <acrichto> which kinda makes sense b/c we can't really throw anything away before trans
[19:22:22] <acrichto> although it may be nice to rewrite trans to take ownership of the AST completely, that way it could consume the AST as it goes along
[19:22:32] <acrichto> in theory reducing memory usage at least a bit
[19:22:33] <engla> ah yes
[19:22:35] <cmr> I'm not sure that's possible.
[19:22:43] <acrichto> not with the Visitor interface it isn't
[19:22:48] <cmr> Doesn't it use the ast_map and such?
[19:23:07] <acrichto> oh hm maybe it wouldn't help as much as I thought
[19:23:36] <acrichto> aww :(

[21:38:53] <acrichto> lol yeah sorry about that :P
[21:39:12] <acrichto> I don't like github's code review tools, I would much rather prepare all my comments at once and then send you one email
[21:39:23] <cmr> Yeah
[21:39:24] <cmr> I agree
[21:39:27] <acrichto> I also want all my comments to go away when you rebase, I don't want them to stick around
[21:39:34] <cmr> I'm finding that Github's really quite awful for code review.
[21:39:57] <acrichto> I don't think they ever really intended to create a high-quality code review tool
[21:40:05] <dbaupp> acrichto: I'm unlikely to have time to review that doc PR this weekend, btw.
[21:40:09] <acrichto> it's fantastic for small comments here and there, but for serious code review it doesn't quite cut it
[21:40:19] <acrichto> dbaupp: no worries, it's not like it's a high priority
[21:40:26] <steveklabnik> i think it's great for a certain model
[21:40:35] <steveklabnik> you're not expected to have long-running pull requests
[21:40:49] <steveklabnik> acrichto: they DO go away if the LOC where the comment happened changes, but not otherwise
[21:40:52] <cmr> steveklabnik: but that's how software works!
[21:40:54] <steveklabnik> which can be awkward at times, yeah
[21:41:03] <acrichto> steveklabnik: yeah I think we're using github in a way that it wasn't meant for
[21:41:05] <steveklabnik> where you come from, maybe ;)
[21:41:19] <steveklabnik> i feel bad if a pr is open on one of my projects for more than a week
[21:41:59] <acrichto> I suppose in theory we shouldn't ahve that many long-running pull requests
[21:44:01] <steveklabnik> in the GitHub View of the World, it means you took off too big a chunk
[21:45:00] <cmr> Every non-trivial project I've worked on doesn't subscribe to this github view of the world :P
[21:45:07] <steveklabnik> :)
[21:45:13] <steveklabnik> i'm not saying it's right for everything
[21:46:15] <steveklabnik> .... if i were in a snarkier view of the world, i'd suggest that you may have worked on projects with better engineering than many on github
