[00:07:04] <Tiffany> I don't get how people can manage to fuck up crypto this hard
[00:07:19] <eddyb> zofrex: aaaaand it's on sourceforge
[00:07:20] <Layl> god damn it why isn't there just a single program that tells you "this is what you need to do better security wise, now install this and do this"
[00:07:31] <Layl> why does there have to be all these grey areas and questions
[00:07:42] <eddyb> Layl: because NSA will break it
[00:07:46] <brandonson> Layl: keeps things interesting
[00:08:44] <Tiffany> there was some group which actually wrote a tool to automatically detect android applications using AES-ECB
[00:08:46] <zofrex> Tiffany: how can Bruce Schneier fuck up crypto this hard??
[00:08:49] <Tiffany> there were over 5000
[00:09:26] <Tiffany> somehow I do not think Bruce Schneier encourages TwoFish-ECB
[00:09:30] <Layl> last time I had to write something with passwords, blowfish was the recommended thing
[00:09:36] <Layl> now that has changed as well I guess
[00:09:53] <zofrex> maybe he should be more careful about what he puts his name on? or maybe that design is just really really old or something...
[00:10:03] <Tobba> I'm pretty sure Schneier never wrote that
[00:10:06] <Tobba> I hope
[00:10:07] <Tiffany> I don't think he put his name on this, zofrex
[00:10:33] <Tiffany> he's well known in infosec, not designer of shitty password management software
[00:10:43] <eddyb> it's also on sourceforge

[00:11:42] <Tiffany> he actually did write it

[00:23:01] <Tiffany> the header file outright states that the Encrypt and Decrypt functions only take a single block
[00:23:03] <Tiffany> and the code shows as much

[00:28:18] <zofrex> you should blog about this bloggable discovery on your blog
[00:29:35] <Tiffany> I suppose that ECB is kind of hard to exploit when you're encrypting individual passwords
[00:29:42] <Tiffany> but the entire file isn't encrypted
[00:29:48] <Tiffany> so you reveal a ridiculous amount of information to attackers
[00:29:54] <Tiffany> for example, whether two passwords are the same...
[00:29:59] <Tiffany> and which websites those two passwords belong to
[00:30:01] <Tiffany> like, what the shit?
[00:30:07] <Tiffany> just use chacha in counter mode and encrypt the entire damn file

[00:35:40] <zofrex> that is a LOT of information to leak

[00:38:37] <zofrex> oh for fuck's sake I'm angry now
[00:38:44] <zofrex> I just opened up HN and what do I see but this? https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9727297
[00:39:04] <zofrex> KeePass is ALSO not authenticating :|
[00:39:31] <c74d> But… if one encrypts the whole file, one would need to write out the whole file! The… the *disk I/O*! The slowness!
[00:40:35] <Tiffany> but you don't
[00:40:41] <zofrex> I have always wondered why LastPass locks up my entire browser when I write a new password. I assumed it was the PBKDF2 rounds.
[00:40:42] <Tiffany> counter mode is random-access
[00:40:54] <Tiffany> all you have to do is xor the bits you read/write with the appropriate hunk of keystream

[00:45:39] <Tiffany> hm
[00:45:49] <Tiffany> maybe it runs the KDF with a different salt for each entry zofrex
[00:45:57] <Tiffany> that would prevent passwords from being compared by someone without the keys
[00:46:09] <Tiffany> still stupid
[00:47:22] <zofrex> LastPass is all sorts of stupid when it comes to the UI (like doing whatever it's doing on the main thread)
[00:47:48] <zofrex> anyway this HN thread is pretty interesting. It looks like maybe PassSafe isn't as bad as it seems
[00:49:33] <Tiffany> uh
[00:49:34] <Tiffany> how?
[00:50:02] <zofrex> "ECB mode is only used for the internal keys. The database records are encrypted in CBC mode, and there is an integrity authenticator HMAC as well"
[00:50:37] <Tiffany> but they still don't encrypt the whole database

[00:52:23] <Tiffany> I wouldn't mind using a password manager if they weren't all horrible
[00:52:27] <Tiffany> maybe I should write one in rust
[00:53:21] <zofrex> so far, 1Password is still looking alright
[00:53:39] <zofrex> "We use Encrypt-then-MAC authenticated encryption everywhere we use encryption. The MAC is HMAC-SHA256 and encryption is AES-CBC using 256-bit keys. Key derivation is uses PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512"
[00:53:58] <Tiffany> but do they encrypt the whole database, or just the passwords?
[00:54:06] <Tiffany> I can't believe I have to ask this question
[00:56:14] <Tiffany> at least their design is open and documented
[00:56:16] <zofrex> not actually sure from skimming, but the full deets are here https://learn2.agilebits.com/1Password4/Security/keychain-design.html
[00:56:43] <Tiffany> yep, they only encrypt parts

[00:59:11] <c74d> GNU Emacs's front-end to GPG encryption (but not decryption… thankfully?) can't seem to handle passwords beyond some length. >_>

[05:00:55] <Havvy> Anybody else wish TC39 used Rust's RFC model?
[05:01:14] <cmr> I don't give a shit about TC39 :P
[05:01:17] <Quxxy> WindowsBunny: Do you think there'd be any value in some kind of Rust-specific MSYS2 package with special support in gcc-rs?
[05:01:38] <Quxxy> After That Guy complained about openssl being a PITA to build against on Windows, I started wondering if there wasn't some way to make things work smoother
[05:02:14] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: with regards to openssl, use the msys2 package or don't use openssl
[05:02:23] <Quxxy> Mmm
[05:03:43] <Quxxy> The problem is that, if you're a Windows dev, "use iron" turns into "install msys2, learn to use pacman using documentation that wasn't written for msys2, install the right toolchain (not the "native" one), realise there are multiple openssl packages and install the right one, then compile from *inside* the msys2 shell"
[05:04:19] <FreeFull> Fun
[05:04:22] <Quxxy> I'm just wondering if things would be helped if Rust came with a stripped-down, isolated MSYS2 install, so that cargo packages could include msys2 package metadata
[05:05:04] <Quxxy> Although, once MSVC is supported, that's going to cause *new* problems :P

[05:33:47] <Quxxy> I've wondered in the past if it would make sense to have a build support crate that lets a *-sys package list all the known package names and sources for a native library

[08:01:20] <Quxxy> Oh WOW
[08:01:28] <Quxxy> If a metro app crashes, it brings down *all* metro apps
[08:01:47] <Quxxy> *Including* things like the new Control Panel in Windows 10
[08:02:02] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: wat
[08:02:06] <Quxxy> Seriously
[08:02:11] <Quxxy> I had Windows Feedback and Control Panel open
[08:02:18] <Quxxy> Feedback locked, so I killed the window
[08:02:22] <Quxxy> And Control Panel died
[08:02:30] <Layl> that sounds like a really bad crash
[08:02:33] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: Are you sure they weren't connected?
[08:02:42] <Quxxy> Then I realised, that when I clicked the X, Windows said that "App Frame Host" wasn't responding
[08:02:50] <Layl> probably that's the runtime crashing, rather than just the app crashing
[08:03:26] <Quxxy> If it can bring down an apparently unrelated program, I don't care *whose* fault it is
[08:03:45] <Quxxy> Also, it's listed as a different process to Control Panel
[08:04:13] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: If App Frame Host wasn't responding
[08:04:30] <WindowsBunny> that means there is a single process that encapsulates all the metro apps in frames
[08:04:42] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: And that frame host froze up
[08:04:56] <Quxxy> *Except* that the apps themselves show up in the process monitor as different processes; so presumably it's kinda like Conhost.exe
[08:04:56] <WindowsBunny> not necessarily the metro app itself
[08:05:17] <WindowsBunny> except you get one conhost per console
[08:05:18] <Quxxy> I didn't see the control panel in the process list *after* the host crashed
[08:05:26] <WindowsBunny> but here its one frame host for everything
[08:05:33] <Quxxy> So I'm unconvinced that the host blowing up doesn't kill the hostees
[08:05:37] <Quxxy> Looks like it
[08:05:43] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: Well presumably if a metro app no longer has a host to live in, then the app has to shutdown
[08:05:53] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: But if an app dies, then the frame host itself shouldn't die
[08:06:12] <Quxxy> Except Control Panel was still working, Feedback *wasn't*
[08:06:27] <Quxxy> So something went wrong in Feedback, and killing that window killed the whole host process?
[08:07:42] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: you killed the frame host, not feedback
[08:07:57] <Layl> it's the runtime's fault here probably
[08:08:08] <Layl> whoops the chat client didn't scroll down
[08:08:16] <Quxxy> Right, but the TP metro apps are all wildly unstable, the system ones don't tend to be nearly as bad
[08:08:33] <Quxxy> You could be right, though
[08:08:38] <Layl> metro apps should be separated using appdomains right?

[08:30:09] <Quxxy> c63: That was just a "we should go talk over there"
[08:30:10] <aatch> Hmm, a binary logging system with a well-specified format and some helper tools would actually be pretty cool.
[08:30:13] <Quxxy> Anyway
[08:30:26] <Quxxy> I wrote a simulator for honours/PhD
[08:30:26] <c63> aatch: I think so too
[08:30:38] <Quxxy> Produced *vast* volumes of data, and we were bound by IO perf
[08:30:47] <Quxxy> So I had an idea for an append-only binary database design
[08:30:57] <Quxxy> It occurred to me that you could also use it for logs
[08:31:13] <c63> indeed, batched binary append only can be pretty fast
[08:31:28] <Quxxy> So the thought was that + some embedded JS to handle conversion from the serialised binary formats into a common set of displayable types
[08:31:53] <c63> Quxxy: that's exactly what i was thinking about as well
[08:31:58] <aatch> It'd be useful for the compiler actually, there's a fair bit of debug logging that's useful for, well, debugging, but it massively slows down compiles.
[08:32:47] <Quxxy> And because it's append-only and write speed is the #1 priority, you can do things like massively compress the records, that a normal DB doesn't really try (because it messes up seeking)
[08:34:08] <c63> Hm, maybe we can join forces to make that happen? This is far away from my main research topic, but it would be really helpful
[08:34:43] <Quxxy> Right now, I can't; I'm in a death march to get my thesis done, and I need to find a job
[08:35:11] <c63> :p I'm just about to start my PhD, so I have a bit of time
[08:35:27] <c63> But I would like to have a second opinion, if this might be beneficial for other
[08:35:28] <c63> s
[08:35:28] <Quxxy> Completely serious: good luck
[08:35:44] <Quxxy> I know I would have *killed* for it for the simulator
[08:36:33] <Skyler> aatch: how massively?
[08:38:48] <aatch> Skyler, depends on the modules enabled, but in some cases I give up waiting for the compiler.
[08:39:28] <Quxxy> c63: Even if I can't help much, I could jot down my thoughts on the design
[08:39:42] <aatch> c63, I'm interested, if you can get a rough initial design together (doesn't necessarily need to be code) I can help with the building.
[08:39:43] <Quxxy> and what I would have needed from it
[08:40:03] <Quxxy> I also had a name (though I didn't check very hard to see if it was taken): appendb :P
[08:40:59] <c63> What about I start a Gist and you review/comment/extend it?
[08:41:30] <Quxxy> If you want to do it that way; it'll probably be quicker *for me* to just do a braindump into a text file (probably after dinner)

[12:44:21] <Manishearth> *class

[12:53:37] <pnkfelix> So for a class like `class="buffer conversation active"`
[12:54:04] <pnkfelix> what does the `'selector'` argument look like?  e.g. `querySelectorAll('class="buffer conversation active"')` ?
[12:54:18] <pnkfelix> (because my attempt to do that is currently yielding a syntax error)
[12:54:37] <Manishearth> pnkfelix: .buffer.conversation.active
[12:54:42] <Manishearth> you want to ignore the active part
[12:55:09] <eddyb> pnkfelix: to test for an exact value of an attribute you need [attr="value"], but classes are special
[12:56:31] <pnkfelix> okay, NOW i'm getting somewhere!
[12:58:20] <pnkfelix> eddyb: okay, where would that `attr="value"` array go in the selector then?
[12:58:35] <pnkfelix> eddyb: e.g. if I wanted to test for the attribute `title="nmatsakis"` ?
[12:59:30] <pnkfelix> or maybe I'll just check for that manually after I do the query
[13:00:45] <pnkfelix> Manishearth: eddyb: So I'm still trying to understand the code that you two are suggesting
[13:00:53] <eddyb> pnkfelix: [title="nmatsakis"]
[13:01:21] <pnkfelix> Manishearth: eddyb: in particular, it looks like you think there is a close button on each of these elements
[13:01:39] <eddyb> [attr="value"].class and .class[attr="value"] are equivalent AFAIK
[13:01:48] <pnkfelix> Manishearth: eddyb: but its not quite like that.  (Instead a close button appears elsewhere in the UI after you click on the element in question)
[13:02:02] <pnkfelix> Manishearth: eddyb: still, I will try to adapt what you suggest
[13:03:21] <eddyb> well, that "element in question" is what you want to select in the inner find or qS call
[13:04:09] <eddyb> but I'm not sure if an element opened by the click handler in the application, will become availalbe immediatelly
[13:04:21] <eddyb> or if you need to use setTimeout(0) for this
[13:04:29] <pnkfelix> eddyb: yeah I might need to wait
[13:12:00] <pnkfelix> heh, I've gotten too used to Rust's "return the last expr" semantics

[13:16:26] <pnkfelix> Manishearth: eddyb: so, I'd rather try to emulate typing "/wd" rather than emulating clicking the delete button
[13:16:37] <pnkfelix> Manishearth: eddyb: because clicking delete brings up a confirmation dialog

[13:32:38] <Sho> should I switch to NixOS
[13:33:55] <Quxxy> Sho: It's weird, and it seems like little of the advice on how to administer a linux system applies any longer
[13:34:31] <Sho> Quxxy: how so @ latter part?
[13:35:10] <Quxxy> If you have a problem and the solution is "edit $SOME_FILE", then you might not be able to *use* that solution, because that file is *probably* generated from the Nix configuration
[13:35:22] <Quxxy> Which means you have to work out how and where it's generated and how to modify the thing that generates it
[13:35:27] <Sho> Ah
[13:35:50] <Quxxy> Also, doing things like, say, untarring and building some program don't really sit well with it
[13:36:03] <Quxxy> Since the *whole point* is to have the whole system configuration defined by a Nix expression
[13:36:19] <Sho> All of my custom building pretty much happens in $HOME
[13:36:30] <Quxxy> It really feels like, in order to use it, you *really* need to set aside the time to learn the Nix language
[13:36:52] <Quxxy> Sho: Nix allows you to do per-user installs of packages
[13:37:03] <Quxxy> So you *still* want to do your building with Nix, or why are you even using it?
[13:37:22] <Quxxy> What got to me was that there's just... *no* direction on how you're supposed to use the damn thing
[13:37:38] <Quxxy> I couldn't find any advice on how I'm supposed to manage the configuration
[13:38:03] <Quxxy> It's a bit like being given a big, incredibly shiny, technologically advanced machine... and *no* instruction manual
[13:38:13] <Sho> I appreciate that more realistic take vs. the glowing reviews I've been hearing lately

[13:38:29] <Quxxy> Oh, it's *really* cool
[13:38:44] <Quxxy> But it definitely feels like being dumped in at the deep end :)
[13:38:54] <Quxxy> I feel like you have to *really want* to learn it
[13:39:04] <Quxxy> It's not something you can really just casually play around with
[13:39:21] <Quxxy> That said, it definitely seems like it'd be worth it, if you have the time
[13:40:14] <Sho> I used to use Gentoo from 2002-2009 before I abandoned it for Fedora, I guess Nix seems interesting as potentially the first real advance beyond portage
[13:41:18] <Quxxy> Cool thing about Nix: If you have an expression that defines a set of packages, you can do `nix-shell blah.nix` to get a shell which *only* has those packages available

[17:31:07] <Astrum|Lap> ogham: what are toe shoes...
[17:31:24] <ogham> https://xkcd.com/1065/ toe shoes!
[17:31:28] <Tiffany> ergonomic keyboards are awful for touch typing
[17:31:46] <Tiffany> I had such bad hand pain after having to use one for a couple days
[17:31:57] <Tiffany> I think there are some which wouldn't be so bad
[17:32:02] <dfockler> for some reason using vim without a mechanical keyboard feels disgusting
[17:32:03] <Tiffany> but the classic S-shaped ones are shit
[17:32:32] <Tiffany> in what way could an S-shaped keyboard possibly be ergonomic
[17:32:48] <dfockler> what's an S-shaped keyboard?
[17:32:54] <Astrum|Lap> and using emacs without a meta, super, uber, etc... key feels gross
[17:33:14] <Tiffany> wow, I can't even find them on google images anymore
[17:33:18] <Tiffany> they must have died in like 2003
[17:33:34] <Tiffany> all I can find are those newer ones where they're split in half
[17:33:35] <Astrum|Lap> I don't even know what an s-shaped keyboard is
[17:33:37] <ogham> It's not really shaped like an S, is it?
[17:33:39] <Tiffany> it is
[17:33:41] <Astrum|Lap> and I was alive in 2003
[17:33:42] <Astrum|Lap> =P
[17:33:49] <ogham> The split-in-half keyboards are awesome!
[17:33:53] <Tiffany> the one I had was a first-gen wireless keyboard from microsoft, as well as being "ergonomic"
[17:33:54] <ogham> but that's less S-shaped and more 8-shaped
[17:34:06] <Tiffany> so it was like the epitome of horrible keyboards
[17:34:10] <lahwran> ogham: cue ball is obviously a moron
[17:34:12] <Tiffany> rubber dome with mushy, hard to register key presses
[17:34:13] <dfockler> I have a Microsoft Ergonomic 4000
[17:34:18] <lahwran> if they have to think about it
[17:34:19] <Tiffany> wireless that died constantly and had huge packet loss
[17:34:22] <lahwran> toe shoes vs immortality
[17:34:27] <lahwran> I don't think there's any question
[17:34:42] <ogham> The Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 was awesome
[17:35:10] <ogham> well-designed, but not *too* far out there to make people think you're weird
[17:35:35] <Tiffany> the one I was using was like this
[17:35:36] <Tiffany> https://www.microsoft.com/presspass/images/gallery/hardware/WOD5000_lg.jpg
[17:35:37] <ogham> I mean, on the scale of typewriter to ergodox
[17:35:42] <Tiffany> but the curve was more pronounced
[17:35:46] <Tiffany> look at how god damn wide the N key is
[17:35:54] <ogham> oh that one just looks bent
[17:36:07] <dfockler> my n key is that long
[17:36:13] <dfockler> but it's actually split in the middle
[17:36:20] <Tiffany> split in the middle seems acceptable to me
[17:36:25] <Tiffany> but this is just a crime against humanity
[17:36:29] <dfockler> haha
[17:37:15] <ogham> still want to know what an S-shaped keyboard is
[17:37:30] <ogham> that one's shaped like a (
[17:37:48] <ogham> I expected full bend
[17:37:50] <Tiffany> I might have been remembering a bit long
[17:37:54] <Tiffany> I would have to find the keyboard I was using
[17:37:58] <Tiffany> wrong*
[17:38:15] <Tiffany> I'm surprised nobody knows what I mean
[17:38:29] <Tiffany> first-gen wireless keyboards were all really terrible
[17:38:32] <Tiffany> and they were all the rage
[17:38:35] <Tiffany> in like the early 2000s
[17:38:36] <ogham> dfockler: it's actually illegal to use vim on anything except a physical VT100.
[17:38:42] <dfockler> haha
[17:39:00] <ogham> never joined the wireless bandwagon
[17:39:45] <dfockler> the new ones are decent enough for everyday use

[17:51:21] <fmtq> you can just tell 
[17:51:58] <dfockler> Once you start labeling software on the keyboard, you know you're in trouble
[17:52:24] <Tiffany> I have an old gateway keyboard which has generic application buttons which I don't think have ever worked on any OS
[17:52:30] <Tiffany> without manually rebinding them
[17:52:38] <Tiffany> the worst button though
[17:52:46] <Tiffany> is that fucking crescent moon on some keyboards
[17:52:53] <Tiffany> which there's no way to disable, and is super easy to accidentally press
[17:52:56] <Tiffany> which puts the computer into hibernate
[17:53:31] <dfockler> ah yeah fuck that
[17:54:09] <dfockler> I bought an Xbox One recently, god help me, and my cat turned it off my bumping his nose on the power button

[21:50:48] <reem> like if I want to declare a bunch of variables with different types then reassign them all
[21:51:21] <mrmonday> use the comma operator
[21:51:32] <huon> comma operator will discard the result of the LHS and evaluate to the RHS
[21:51:42] <mrmonday> if you're asking what I think you are
[21:52:05] <reem> well I can’t put multiple full statements in an LHS though, right?
[21:52:17] <reem> e.g. int x = 3, char field = ‘a’ does not work
[21:52:27] <huon> declare them outside the for loop
[21:52:41] <huon> int x; char field; x = 3, field = 'a'

[22:30:23] <Astrum|Lap> tempted to take a picture
[22:30:44] <Astrum|Lap> has a whole bunch of daughter boards connected to a huge backplane that it initializes... somehow
[22:31:15] <cmr> I wonder if it's a qbus.

[22:32:18] <Astrum|Lap> hmm...
[22:32:29] <cmr> depends on how old it is.
[22:32:36] <cmr> to my knowledge linux never supported the qbus though

[23:59:14] <santiago> Hm. #rust won't let me join because I need to "identify to a registered account." Is there any word on how to do this?
[23:59:37] <bluss> santiago: /msg NickServ I think
[23:59:39] <aatch> santiago, /msg nickserv help register and go from there
[23:59:44] <santiago> Thank you.
