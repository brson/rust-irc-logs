[14:57:00] <xyproto> I fail at writing "Hello World" in Rust. How should one write it? I tried punching in examples from three different sites, after googling. Here are my attempts: http://ix.io/6Cl I failed :P
[14:57:20] <xyproto> rust 0.7
[14:57:32] <bstrie> haha
[14:57:33] <bstrie> it's
[14:57:42] <bstrie> fn main() { println("hello, world"); }
[14:57:52] <bstrie> all those examples are so close :P
[14:58:08] <bjz> xyproto: there's lots of old examples out there :(
[14:58:09] <xyproto> the compiler gave me all sorts of suggestions
[14:58:24] <bstrie> one day we'll erase the notion that io:: is required before println
[14:58:45] <xyproto> the most exotic one was 'maybe a missing `extern mod io`?' but then I though: hey, wait a minute, it can't be this hard ;)
[14:58:56] <bstrie> bjz: I always keep the wikipedia article up to date
[14:59:03] <bstrie> and that includes a hello world
[14:59:34] <bjz> we should hook the wikipedia article into the testsuite :3
[14:59:36] <xyproto> bstrie: finally, your version worked :) Thanks
[15:00:01] <bstrie> bjz: would be a good test for our theoretical net lib and html parsing lib
[15:00:11] <xyproto> Also, it took some googling just to figure out that ".rs" was the file extension one was supposed to use. Most tutorials and examples didn't give any example filenames.
[15:00:35] <xyproto> So I started out with .rust. No idea if the compiler would care.
[15:00:47] <bstrie> xyproto: did it care?
[15:00:58] <xyproto> bstrie: now that I have a working example, let's see...
[15:01:21] <xyproto> bstrie: no, it's happy with "rust build hello.rust" too :)
[15:01:22] <bjz> it wouldn't unless you tried acessing a different module
[15:01:49] <bstrie> xyproto: just a warning, the "rust" tool isn't very good right now. we all just use "rustc" (note the c) directly
[15:01:50] <xyproto> my very first rust program, thanks for the help guys :)
[15:01:58] <bjz> no worries
[15:02:12] <bstrie> xyproto: were these example on sites that we can edit?
[15:02:18] <xyproto> bstrie: let's see...
[15:02:21] <bstrie> like wikis or github repos
[15:02:28] <bjz> the irc.mozilla.org #rust channel is far more active btw
[15:03:05] <xyproto> here's one: http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Hello_world/Text#Rust
[15:03:23] <bjz> xyproto: if you're looking to get more into rust, I'd reccomend lurking there
[15:03:41] <xyproto> here's another (blog, but perhaps the author is willing to change it?) http://bluishcoder.co.nz/2011/03/31/a-quick-look-at-the-rust-programming-language.html
[15:03:58] <bstrie> yikes, 2011
[15:04:00] <xyproto> bjz: good tip, thanks, I'll consider joining that channel
[15:04:20] <bstrie> xyproto: basically any online resource older than a month is going to be out of date :)
[15:04:21] <xyproto> bstrie: one of the top 2 hits when googling 'rust hello world' here
[15:04:35] <xyproto> bstrie: that's good to know now, in hindsight :)
[15:05:23] <xyproto> Didn't know rust had changed so much over the last two years. The for loop syntax is changing as well now, as I gather from the latest hacker news mention?
[15:05:49] <xyproto> Hard for a poor beginner to write 'hello world' and maybe even for loops if everything is changing.
[15:06:20] <xyproto> but, ok, only updated sources it is :)
[15:06:24] <bstrie> xyproto: sorry :( if all goes well, I'd expect 0.8 to be the last release with drastically breaking language changes
[15:06:32] <bstrie> libraries will continue to break
[15:07:20] <xyproto> you have a big heart to apologize for something that probably isn't your fault, at least not singelhandedly :)
[15:08:05] <bstrie> xyproto: rust is basically a different language every year. poke around http://brson.github.io/archaea/ for a while
[15:08:30] <bstrie> that's an archive of our test suite over time

[15:12:23] <bjz> xyproto: why are you interested in  it?
[15:13:21] <xyproto> Just tried glfw-rs, everything worked except one example that didn't compile. Fun that one can write OpenGL applications with Rust.
[15:13:42] <bjz> ooh, I maintain  glfw-rs
[15:14:07] <xyproto> bjz: it seems promising for writing 3D applications with. Hopefully, the speed of C++ without the gnarly memory management could be possible,
[15:14:13] <xyproto> bjz: just reported an issue ;)
[15:14:26] <bjz> thanks!
[15:14:38] <bjz> I'm currently working on a maths lib too
[15:14:46] <bjz> could use some expertise
[15:14:54] <xyproto> Also, "thestinger" made me more interested in looking at it. He's also an Arch Linux trusted user.
[15:15:06] <bjz> ahh
[15:15:15] <bstrie> that's strcat
[15:15:20] <bjz> (strcat on #rust)
[15:15:23] <bjz> oh
[15:15:25] <bjz> :)
[15:15:50] <xyproto> he seems like a brilliantly clever person, so I thought I should give Rust an extra look
[15:16:03] <bstrie> he's completely brilliantly clever
[15:16:20] <bstrie> single-handedly responsible for our new iterator libraries
[15:16:24] <bstrie> and the switch to external iteration
[15:18:57] <xyproto> yeah, well done
[15:19:37] <xyproto> Which domain would you say Rust would be the best fit for? I understand that "browsers" is one target. But games? Servers? Mobile applications? Editors? :)
[15:19:45] <xyproto> Anything goes?
[15:20:19] <bjz> real-time performance critical applications. embedded systems
[15:21:14] <bjz> games fit the bill nicely, which is why I'm trying to create libs to make it easier to get started
[15:21:30] *** Joins: k00mi (~koomi@188-193-205-89-dynip.superkabel.de)
[15:21:45] <xyproto> I think Go is pretty great for multithreaded servers, but it feels lacking for things like 3D demos or 3D games, in terms of speed and realtimeness.
[15:21:59] <xyproto> It may be more a feeling than "facts", though.
[15:22:15] <bjz> well, rust is not reliant on a GC
[15:22:38] <xyproto> yes, and the precise memory control sounds like a big plus for demanding 3D-games, for instance
[15:22:52] <bjz> which is very important for real-time applications, where dealines are critical
[15:23:03] <xyproto> exactly
[15:23:29] <bjz> so yeah, basically where-ever you'd use C or C++
[15:23:36] <xyproto> (You can turn off the GC in Go and manage memory by hand, btw, but it's uncommon).
[15:23:51] <bjz> and unsafe I'd assume
[15:24:00] <xyproto> yes
[15:25:12] <xyproto> well, you could allocate a huge blob of memory, keep the GC on and just manage that blob yourself, which wouldn't be unsafe-unsafe (since it wouldn't touch memory on the system outside of the application), but it would be easy to mess things up
[15:25:47] <ski> bstrie : how does external iteration work with multiple iterators and mutation ?
[15:25:56] <xyproto> the syntax for managing memory is one of the attractive things about Rust, imo

[15:56:01] <ski> hm, iiuc, it'll output something like `[2,4,6]' and `[10,11,12]'

[16:00:48] *** Parts: matematikaadit (~adit@39.209.70.193) ("Leaving")
[16:03:42] <bstrie> ski: if mutable iterators are involved, you can only have one iterator at a time. trying to nest a mutable iterator in an immutable one or vice versa is verboten
[16:04:40] <bstrie> otherwise you run the risk of invalidating your iterators, which rust prevents statically
[16:06:13] <ski> yeah

[16:08:11] <bstrie> it's actually really neat
[16:08:23] <bstrie> one day someone just realized that the borrow check prevented iterator invalidation
[16:08:32] <bstrie> "oh, that's nifty"
[16:09:27] <ski> the mutable iterator borrows the mutable array, so it can't be accessed until it has released it -- is that the right terminology ?
[16:09:55] <ski> (s/accessed/accessed \(apart from by the iterator\)/)
[16:13:01] <bstrie> ski: here's what the error messages look like for nesting mut in immut and vice versa: https://gist.github.com/bstrie/5985642
[16:14:15] <ski> ok
[16:14:21] <ski> ty
[16:15:35] <bstrie> ski: as long as you don't nest them, it works. prior to 0.7 this wasn't always the case, we had to improve the borrow checker
[16:15:54] <bstrie> you can have x.mut_iter() and then later on x.iter()
[16:16:15] <bstrie> it all seems to be rather nice
[16:16:23] <bstrie> I'm very happy with how it turned out
[16:16:57] <ski> and the iterator is only active for the duration of the `advance' call ?
[16:17:25] <ski> or can you pass around the iterator, store it somewhere, later decide to advance it a few steps, &c. ?
[16:18:23] *** Quits: xyproto (~alexander@archlinux/trusteduser/xyproto) (Quit: WeeChat 0.4.1)
[16:29:02] <bstrie> ski: ah, good point. `advance` is just a shim to get external iterators working with our old iteration protocol (due to be updated in the 0.8 cycle to mesh with external iterators better). if you just store the iterator somewhere, the compiler will yell at you if you have a mutable iterator in scope along with an immutable one
[16:29:21] <bstrie> but yes, you can advance them manually
[16:29:25] <bstrie> and do other cool stuff too
[16:29:58] <bstrie> like `x.iter().filter(|x| x%2==0)` to filter out all the odd numbers in a list
