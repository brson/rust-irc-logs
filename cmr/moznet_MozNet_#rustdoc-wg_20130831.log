[16:35:10] <austincheney> the search data at http://seld.be/rustdoc/master/search-index.js appears to be malformed if it were intended to be JSON format
[16:35:50] <austincheney> JSON must be a global object literal that is not assigned to anything
[16:37:05] <austincheney> so just wrap that data in curly braces and make the name "searchIndex" into a label instead of a variable
[16:37:30] <austincheney> {searchIndex:[ .... ]}
[16:38:40] <austincheney> i have a plan for creating an autocomplete feature for the site search, but the JSON would need to be reformatted for more efficient execution
[17:04:21] <cmr> austincheney: it's not intended to be JSON.
[17:04:30] <cmr> and afaik Seldaek hacked it together fairly quickly
[17:04:48] <cmr> The search needs a lot of work, so if you take that up that'd be super cool!
[19:20:30] <austincheney> cmr: i would love to take it up
[19:21:07] <austincheney> but for performance considerations it would work faster to have it formatted as proper JSON so that I could parse the string into code with the browser's JSON object
[19:21:23] <cmr> send a PR for it
[19:23:00] <austincheney> pr?
[19:23:05] <cmr> pull request
[19:23:17] <cmr> https://github.com/Seldaek/rustdoc_web
[19:27:46] <austincheney> thanks cmr
[19:28:08] <austincheney> the file does not appear to be in the github repo, so i will just wait until Seldaek is online tomorrow
[19:28:26] <cmr> It's generated.
[19:28:57] <austincheney> ahhh
[19:29:10] <cmr> https://github.com/Seldaek/rustdoc_web/blob/master/rustdoc.js#L1041
[19:29:25] <cmr> rustdoc_web generates a site from a JSON file that rustdoc_ng generates from Rust soruce.
[19:29:27] <cmr> *source
[19:37:19] <austincheney> ah, thank you very much
