[16:56:45] <bjz> see the `for` syntax just looks for a .next() method from the Iterator trait

[23:01:32] <iron_houzi> Hello. I'm a CS undergrad who's still learning the basics, with a bit of experience with Java, C and asm. I'm very curious about Rust: What people are doing with it and how it handles memory. For instance: What is the benefit of having a pointer type that can only have one variable using the pointer?
[23:02:41] <iron_houzi> I can assume that narrowing the number of variables using the pointer can reduce bugs and unforseen behaviour. Is this correct and if so, are there any other benefits?
[23:03:25] <bjz> iron_houzi: just to let you know, theres an official channel wich is far more lively
[23:03:26] <SiegeLord> Amongs many things, it allows you to know where this owned pointer goes out of scope
[23:03:35] <SiegeLord> at compile time
[23:03:57] <bjz> gamedev is a big one in terms of usage
[23:04:22] <iron_houzi> SiegeLord: Knowing where the pointer goes out of scope.. will that help reducing memory leaks?
[23:04:35] <bjz> ownership is extremely important for safe concurrency
[23:05:02] <SiegeLord> It allows you to insert the cleanup code there... otherwise you'd need to use some sort of garbage collection
[23:05:21] <SiegeLord> Memory leaks aren't really an option, but preventing them does not necessitate unique ownership
[23:05:24] <bjz> iron_houzi: it allows the compiler to do malloc/free automatically, something even the best programmers can fail at
[23:05:37] <iron_houzi> Ahh .. yes. I really know much too little about concurrency, but I did get some assingments on it to learn about race conditions and shared memory..
[23:06:18] <iron_houzi> OK. Will Rust do both automatic and manual GC?
[23:06:38] <iron_houzi> s/do/allow for
[23:07:06] <SiegeLord> What do you mean by manual GC?
[23:07:13] <iron_houzi> garbage collection
[23:07:21] <iron_houzi> calling free
[23:07:24] <iron_houzi> free()
[23:07:46] <SiegeLord> That's doesn't really count as garbage collection, does it?
[23:08:06] *** Quits: Lions (~Lions@2600:100f:b009:a90c::103) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[23:08:34] <iron_houzi> I thought so, but I'd love to learn what the difference is.
[23:09:41] <SiegeLord> Well, forgetting GC for a moment, owned pointers in Rust manage the memory automatically by freeing it when they go out of scope
[23:10:42] <SiegeLord> You could manually free them too by forcing them to come out of scope at a predefined location
[23:10:58] <iron_houzi> How nice.
[23:11:00] <SiegeLord> As for GC, which is separate from that, it also exists
[23:15:53] <iron_houzi> SiegeLord: I'm trying to find some information on the difference between freeing unused heap memory and garbage collection. Do you have a link to an article or blog post?
[23:17:59] <SiegeLord> I don't really know... it's just the usual definition of it seems to be quite different from just being mindful to call free() yourself
[23:19:58] <iron_houzi> Well I do like the choice of designing Rust in this way. Are there any semi stable projects written in Rust that I could install on Linux?

[23:25:57] <SiegeLord> I do wish there was a nice registry for libraries/projects...
[23:26:12] <iron_houzi> Are there any good libs for graphics and GUI?
[23:26:35] <SiegeLord> See that same page, a bit higher
[23:26:39] <SiegeLord> No GUI yet, though
[23:26:51] <SiegeLord> Someone's working on wxWidgets
[23:27:19] <iron_houzi> I've always seemed to think that QT is doing things really well, then I remember that I have to learn C++..
[23:28:15] <SiegeLord> Rust and many new languages have big issues interfacing with C++
[23:28:31] <SiegeLord> I'm not expecting a Qt binding for another year or two
[23:28:56] <bjz> iron_houzi: we have opengl bindings and glfw and sdl, but ui libs are really hard
[23:29:05] <SiegeLord> I'm thinking that wxWidgets, if it takes off, and a custom, OpenGL based UI will be out before then
[23:29:34] <SiegeLord> Someone will make a for-games UI which will be "good enough" for other, basic, uses
[23:30:10] <bjz> iron_houzi: gui might be something that might have to be done from scratch
[23:30:43] <bjz> yep, but not for desktop apps
[23:30:59] <bjz> ie. platform-specific uis
[23:35:39] <SiegeLord> Yeah well... look at Photoshop and MS Office... I feel like platform UI is for the little people
