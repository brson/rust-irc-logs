[03:22:28] <Manishearth> I plan on dialling in
[03:22:33] <Manishearth> wait a sec. dammit
[03:22:44] <Manishearth> 10PM. I have a quiz then :/
[03:22:45] <larsberg> jack has a few ideas about where we should go w.r.t. build systems, etc.
[03:22:48] <Manishearth> recently got scheduled
[03:23:24] <larsberg> darn :-( 
[03:27:13] <larsberg> but regardless I'd recommend chatting with jack or myself, as we likely won't land wholescale replacements of the build infrastructure without a lot of conversation (b/c there are a ton of long-term requirements) and I wouldn't want you to waste effort :-)
[03:28:29] <Manishearth> larsberg: oh, I wasn't plannng on starting just yet. Hey, I don't have the time anyway :)

[03:38:32] <Manishearth> yeah, but this meeting was about wpt, which I'm working on :)

[03:39:34] *** Joins: LuckyTiger88 (Mibbit@moz-3F964EEC.hsd1.ma.comcast.net)
[03:39:47] <jack> the most recent plan of record for the build system was to use cmake.
[03:41:16] <larsberg> jack: yeah, that's why I was hoping we could have a discussion about whether we're interested in mach or something else (it's come up in the context of whether wpt should be run from a "make wpt" or "mach wpt" or w/e)
[03:41:18] <Manishearth> jack: That's still rather rigid though, right?
[03:41:36] <jack> Manishearth: i'm not sure what you mean about rigid.
[03:41:52] <jack> also, i have no idea what mach does other than control how firefox gets built with makefiles
[03:42:07] <Manishearth> jack: So mach internally calls make anyway. Or something like that. But it controls a lot more than that
[03:42:08] <jack> i'll put it on my list to investigate
[03:42:22] *** Parts: LuckyTiger88 (Mibbit@moz-3F964EEC.hsd1.ma.comcast.net) ()
[03:42:38] <jack> cmake can generate ninja files, which make the build extremely fast. and it uses all the nice dependency info so it's basically never wrong.
[03:42:39] <Manishearth> It gates clobbers, it lets you call tests individually, and does the configure
[03:43:01] <Manishearth> jack: part of what is wanted for servo-mach is listed in #2046
[03:43:02] <crowbot> Issue #2046: Switch to mach or similar - https://github.com/mozilla/servo/issues/2046
[03:43:16] <Manishearth> ooh, we're close to a round number
[03:43:25] <jack> Manishearth: and most of those cmake will handle afaik. like for example, ninja automatically does parallel builds
[03:43:40] <Manishearth> True.
[03:44:14] <jack> i've done quite a lot of testing with tup, cmake, better Makefiles, and i've used scons and other things in the past
[03:44:25] <jack> i'll take a look at mach too
[03:45:19] <Manishearth> jack: I'm not sure if mach can be just used like that on servo. AFAICT it's rather firefox-specific
[03:46:42] <Manishearth> larsberg: I ust checked. My quiz is most probably an hour before the meeting. So I can come. Yay :D

[08:45:54] <Manishearth> Ms2ger: wha? wow. I'm finding myself wanting a second clone. Well, I have one, but it's totally borked
[08:46:22] <Manishearth> I prefer m-c's way of doing it, mq is much better for managing lots of changes without triggering full builds.
[08:46:55] <Ms2ger> It is
[08:47:57] <Manishearth> But I imagine huge changes are harder to manage with mq
[08:49:59] <Manishearth> Ms2ger: so in the macro I should just use ElementCast, right? 
[08:50:38] * Manishearth doesn't like it
[08:51:18] <Manishearth> Also, if I want to use it, I have to `use dom::bindings::codegen::InheritTypes::{ElementCast};` in the file the macro is being called in, right? Putting it into macros.rs doesn't work
[08:51:33] <Ms2ger> Can you put it in the generated function?
[08:51:54] <Manishearth> `use`? IIRC macros don't like multiple blocks being in them
[08:51:56] <Manishearth> lemme check
[08:52:50] <Ms2ger> No, deeper :)
[08:53:04] <Ms2ger> fn GetFoo() {
[08:53:11] <Ms2ger>     use dom::bindings::codegen::InheritTypes::ElementCast;
[08:53:15] <Ms2ger>     ...
[08:53:40] <Manishearth> Hm, maybe we can do that in the impl
[08:53:53] <Manishearth> That bit of code looks totally strange to me though :p
[08:54:40] <Manishearth> nope
[08:54:44] <Manishearth> the impl doesn't work
[08:55:14] * Manishearth tries it in the fn
[08:55:38] <Manishearth> I assume that the `use` command adds no runtime overhead, right?
[08:59:36] <Ms2ger> Nope
[09:02:14] <Manishearth> Ms2ger: Any reason why macros don't automatically take into account `use`s from the file they are defined in?

[10:09:40] <Ms2ger> Manishearth, I want to get this right, so don't be surprised by the number of comments :)
[10:13:44] <Manishearth> Ms2ger: sure :)
[10:13:54] <Manishearth> If this gets used it will be used everywhere.... so yeah :P
[10:14:02] <Manishearth> Ms2ger: I didn't add setters because setters have special logic
[10:14:07] <Manishearth> usually
[10:14:11] <Ms2ger> How so?
[10:14:21] <Manishearth> Though jdm mentioned something about BeforeSet and AfterSet (https://github.com/mozilla/servo/issues/1931)
[10:14:21] <crowbot> Issue #1931: Centralize bare attribute getters and setters into HTMLElement - https://github.com/mozilla/servo/issues/1931
[10:14:35] <Manishearth> also, the setter macro is harder, since concat_idents! doesn't work
[10:15:06] <Manishearth> Ms2ger: why can't we use a single invocation for defining most getters though?
[10:15:29] <Ms2ger> We can, but I'm not convinced that's the most readable approach
[10:15:48] <Manishearth> Hm
[10:16:42] <Ms2ger> Doing it like that kinda forces you to group the attributes by type, but I usually prefer to have them in the same order as in the IDL

[10:19:29] <Ms2ger> Yeah
[10:19:29] <Manishearth> I personally like the conciseness :)
[10:19:39] <Manishearth> Besides, bool attributes are pretty rare
[10:19:44] <Ms2ger> But at that point, it seems better to be consistent :)

[10:23:12] <Manishearth> I don't see why we need macros for enums, though

[14:37:37] <Manishearth> (going through /r/rust, looking for interesting things. I knew the term before, but one post made it really clear why the term makes sense )
[14:43:50] <strcat> tagged unions are one of the possible implementations of rust's enums
[14:43:56] <strcat> not all enums are tagged unions
[14:44:15] <strcat> enum Foo { A(~(int, int)), B } // not a tagged union
[14:44:25] <strcat> enum Foo { A, B, C } // also not a tagged union
[14:44:54] <strcat> the former is a nullable pointer, the latter is just an integer - it's an implementation detail
[14:45:10] <strcat> (the high level term for all of them would be 'sum type')
[14:45:33] <Manishearth> strcat: true
[14:45:52] <Manishearth> But most uses are as tagged unions. Which makes sense
[14:47:01] <Manishearth> as in, the terminology makes sense
[14:48:19] <Manishearth> strcat: i think that the term "tagged union" works for a nullable pointer too
[14:48:46] <Manishearth> it's a union of a pointer and a dummy  "null" type. if that makes sense
[14:48:46] * strcat shrugs
[14:49:18] <strcat> but it doesn't have a union with a tag
[14:49:22] <cmr> Manishearth: but there's no tag, ou're using the contents itself to determine the variant, not an external data.
[14:49:27] <cmr> *some
[14:49:46] <strcat> tagged pointers, nullable pointers, integers, etc. are some of the possible representations of enums and I wouldn't really call them tagged unions
[14:50:03] <Manishearth> cmr: ah, I see
[14:59:09] <SimonSapin> integers are the tag of a tagged union with a zero-sized union

[15:23:27] <Ms2ger> SimonSapin, are you a mathematician?
[15:23:46] <SimonSapin> I like math :)
[15:24:14] <SimonSapin> and I’m fascinated by type theory
[15:24:31] <strcat> SimonSapin: except then the value of the union would always be (), and it's not ;)
[15:24:32] <SimonSapin> but by integers I meant enums whose representation is just an integer
[15:25:29] <Ms2ger> Mm, type theory
[15:25:48] <larsberg> yeah, you don't want to make too many promises on variant / tagged union representations unless you're using them for dynamic lang interop purposes (e.g., the old VB-style variants)
[15:25:49] * Ms2ger particularly recalls how his textbook suddenly cited roc
[15:26:23] <larsberg> Most modern MLs have super-complicated things to figure out "this datatype has two nullary and a unary constructor whose payload is of size <x>, so we can use representation <y>"
[15:26:52] <larsberg> And some of them (e.g., SML/NJ) also then have optimizers that run afterwards to ensure that no types share a representation (without reyling on a fixed tagging scheme), which they then feed into the GC
[15:27:35] <larsberg> (which allows the GC to just scan instead of doing something like we do in Manticore where we also know the types of everything based on its location in the stack/registers at a given program point)
[15:27:37] <Ms2ger> No comment about MLs :)
[15:27:53] <larsberg> sorry, sorry, I get carried away sometimes :-)
[15:28:20] <Ms2ger> I hear you're into programming languages ;)
[15:28:59] * Ms2ger notices he should say Dr larsberg 
[15:29:20] <strcat> rust was basically an ML before
[15:29:39] <strcat> less so now that stuff like structural records is gone

[15:45:50] <Sharp> Question about http://dev.w3.org/csswg/cssom-view/#extensions-to-the-htmlelement-interface : the very first requirement in the algorithm is "The element [must have] an associated CSS layout box."  But if you try to examine the definition of CSS layout box, it says: "The term CSS layout box refers to the same term in CSS...."  And then immediately after that: "The [term] CSS layout box ... [is] not currently defined by CSS...."  So what does it 
[15:45:51] <Sharp> actually mean? :)

[15:56:27] <Sharp> Well, it is linked in the issue I was taking a look at, so I think I'm intended to use it.
[15:56:31] <Manishearth> oh, wait, that's w3. not whatwg
[15:56:45] <jgraham> Manishearth: No, but SimonSapin does :)
[15:56:51] <Manishearth> Sharp: is there a living standard on whatwg?
[15:56:56] <Manishearth> for that
[15:57:14] <Sharp> I hadn't checked.  I will do so, though.
[15:57:20] <SimonSapin> every spec has "Editors" with some names near the top

[15:58:05] <Sharp> Sure.
[15:58:06] <Manishearth> i think
[15:58:07] <Sharp> Thanks.
[15:58:22] <Ms2ger> Sharp, no, the box tree is not defined at all
[15:58:27] <SimonSapin> Manishearth: that’s complementary, not really a replacement
[15:58:28] *** Joins: untitaker (untitaker@moz-B8CEC22D.adsl.highway.telekom.at)
[15:58:29] <Ms2ger> Sharp, that's not fancy enough
[15:58:35] <Sharp> It doesn't seem to be defined in that document either.
[15:58:54] <Manishearth> SimonSapin: true, but some definition is better than no definition
[15:59:02] <Manishearth> at least to get a rough idea
[15:59:43] <Sharp> I'm fine with itt being an undefined term, but there have to be properties I can use to test for it or I can't reject elements that don't have one.
[16:00:06] <Sharp> s/itt/it
[16:01:11] <Ms2ger> SimonSapin can probably tell you how to figure it out
[16:01:15] <SimonSapin> Sharp: I think that "the same term in CSS" refers to http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css2/visuren.html#box-gen
[16:01:39] <Sharp> Ah.  That seems plausible.
[16:01:45] <SimonSapin> so "not have a box" means "be in a 'display: none' subtree"
[16:02:38] <Sharp> Weird that table-column and table-column-group are explicitly mentioned as having a CSS layout box, if that's the case.
[16:02:52] <SimonSapin> mentioned where?
[16:03:22] <Sharp> On the original page, under "CSS layout box".
[16:04:03] <SimonSapin> I guess that’s because CSS2 is not precise enough regarding what’s a box or not
[16:04:31] <SimonSapin> table cells are children of the table rows, not the columns
[16:05:02] <Sharp> I'm starting to get that familiar W3C headache :)
[16:05:18] <SimonSapin> columns kinda hang out there on the side (in terms of box tree), so it’s not obvious that they have a box
[16:05:33] <Ms2ger> CSS2.1 is an enormous improvement over CSS2.0
[16:05:40] <Ms2ger> Imagine how much *that* sucked
[16:05:47] <Sharp> Haha
[16:05:50] <Sharp> It seemed cool at the time!
[16:06:56] <SimonSapin> It even has a cool background http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-CSS2-19980512/
[16:06:57] <crowbot> SimonSapin: that's probably not the spec you want. Please read https://github.com/mozilla/servo/wiki/Relevant-spec-links
