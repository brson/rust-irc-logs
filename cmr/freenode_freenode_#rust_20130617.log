[05:23:03] <bjz> napalmbrain: sure
[05:28:20] <napalmbrain> Awesome
[05:28:22] <napalmbrain> One sec
[05:28:56] <napalmbrain> Okay.
[05:29:04] <napalmbrain> So, I've been learning Rust and really like it so far.
[05:29:08] <napalmbrain> </preface>
[05:31:21] <napalmbrain> However I've been comparing and contrasting traits and inheritance with the standard things like classes and class based inheritance. The one thing that I've been wondering how to do in Rust is basically implement a function across multiple structs without having to duplicate the function into two impl TraitHere for Obj blocks. Is there an elegant way to do this in Rust?
[05:33:02] <napalmbrain> If that doesn't make sense, just let me know and I'll try to clarify it.
[05:34:08] <bjz> napalmbrain: I'm not sure

[19:13:13] <PuercoPop> Quick question, So if I want to start with rust I grab 0.6 or just trunk? (I remember reading to better just use trunk)
[19:13:29] <bjz> trunk
[19:13:46] <bstrie> well the branch is called master now
[19:13:46] <bjz> like an elephant
[19:13:51] <Jeaye> You should use master.
[19:13:53] <bstrie> like the dr. who villain
[19:14:06] <bjz> I thought it was like master chef
[19:14:20] <Jeaye> master chief?
[19:14:27] <bstrie> bjz: I'm not sure if that's a typo for master chief or a japanese tv show
[19:14:36] <Jeaye> Me neither. :P
[19:14:54] <bjz> oh, I guess that's an aussie/uk thing *facepalm*
[19:15:03] <bjz> (tv show)
[19:15:13] <bstrie> is... is the protagonist of the halo series named Master Chef over there?
[19:16:03] <Jeaye> "What's Halo?"
[19:16:22] <bstrie> I guess they don't have... chieves... in australia, so they had to repurpose halo as a cooking-mama clone

[19:17:42] <bstrie> but, this computer doesn't have speakers
[19:17:55] <Jeaye> No headphones?
[19:18:15] <bstrie> also sometimes I worry that one of these days the network admin will notice all of this traffic getting proxied over port 22
[19:18:31] <bstrie> and streaming youtube videos can only exacerbate this fear
[19:18:55] <Jeaye> Sounds like you're in prison, not work.
[19:19:21] <bstrie> in my defense, I *had* to set up a socks proxy because it was literally impossible to load google over the standard network
[19:19:38] <bstrie> I think they're trying to attempt some kind of inept packet sniffing
