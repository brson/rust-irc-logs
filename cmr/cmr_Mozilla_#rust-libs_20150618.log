[13:04:53] <bluss> Gankro: I think you missed the mark in the hashing discussion, since the user's question stems from `impl Hash for Foo` changing, and is not related to any hashing algorithm in particular
[13:05:30] <bluss> Gankro: I've already said that in the thread but I guess I'm annoyed that the discussion seems to confuse the things

[23:12:03] <acrichto> aturon: brson: FromRawFd isn't part of the os-specific prelude :(
[23:12:09] <acrichto> we... could backport?
[23:12:13] <acrichto> but may be slightly late
[23:13:04] <sfackler> acrichto: seems like not that big of a deal to leave it to 1.2
[23:13:07] <sfackler> papercut at worst
[23:13:25] <acrichto> sfackler: it does have the problem of conflicting with a * prelude import
[23:13:31] <acrichto> if you import it manually otherwise
[23:13:49] <aturon> we should really fix that...
[23:14:00] * sfackler not it
[23:14:03] <aturon> :)
[23:14:17] <aturon> but i tend to agree with sfackler on this one
[23:14:22] <sfackler> but it seems like a not-that-scary change to make to resolve
[23:14:34] <sfackler> tag the import with a "fromglob" thing
[23:15:52] <acrichto> aturon: sfackler: from-raw-fd-prelude
[23:15:55] <acrichto> er
[23:15:55] <acrichto> https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/26413
[23:16:07] <acrichto> brson: have you kicked off a stable build?
[23:16:10] <acrichto> or just a beta build for today?
[23:16:14] <brson> acrichto: just the beta
[23:16:22] <acrichto> hm ok, so it's not totally implausible to backport
[23:17:15] <aturon> acrichto: i don't object to backporting given that it's basically 0-risk, just didn't want to delay things
[23:17:20] *** Quits: simukis (nagisa@moz-8t068g.static.zebra.lt) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[23:18:17] <acrichto> brson: thoughts on backporting?
[23:20:13] <brson> acrichto: if you feel strongly about it then it's fine by me
[23:20:30] <acrichto> ok, I'll let it bake for a few hours
[23:22:01] <brson> acrichto: why? should we backport it now and restart the beta?
[23:24:53] <acrichto> brson: I don't think we need to restart the beta, but I'm worried about the prelude start import conflict problem
[23:25:13] <acrichto> brson: the trait was stabilized this cycle and it's clearly intended to be in the prelude as well
[23:25:18] <acrichto> it's obvious that it's a mistake at least
[23:25:58] <brson> i'm not clear on your thinking here. if we don't restart the beta are we going to do another beta?
[23:26:45] <brson> maybe by 'bake' you meant 'think about it'
[23:26:55] <acrichto> yeah just sit on master
[23:26:59] <acrichto> I don't mind if this never makes it into a beta
[23:27:22] <brson> i do not want to put something on stable that didn't go to beta
[23:27:22] <acrichto> e.g. bake as in "don't rush something into 1.1 after literally 5 minutes"
[23:27:27] <brson> ok
