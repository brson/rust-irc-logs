[16:31:39] <Ilari> Lurkin: The AEAD mode itself or that in TLS?
[16:33:21] <Lurkin> The AEAD mode itself
[16:34:19] <Ilari> Lurkin: As for the AEAD mode itself, I have an implementation. It has some very slow baseline implementations or can call into Floodyberry's implementations for actually decent performance (with CPU autodetect).
[16:38:02] <Ilari> Lurkin: Wrote it in C++ a while ago, later wrote Rust bindings into that library.
[16:38:42] <Lurkin> Do you have a link to your repository?
[16:38:51] <Lurkin> I am reading through floodberrys now
[16:39:57] <Ilari> Also, the interfaces are a bit crappy, I should clean those up.

[17:50:30] <Tiffany> whoa
[17:50:52] <Tiffany> I am reading about how crypto_box works
[17:51:39] <Tiffany> it's neat how two parties can both compute a secret key from their private key and the other party's public key
[17:53:59] <Ilari> Tiffany: Diffie-Hellman. :-)
[17:55:16] <Tiffany> oh
[17:55:24] <Tiffany> I had never looked into DH before
[18:02:33] *** Quits: erickt (erickt@moz-4hh.6p3.217.74.IP) (Connection closed)
[18:17:35] <cmr> heh, welcome to crypto 101 :P
[18:36:43] <kmc> diffie hellman is one of those things where it takes a while to believe it's possible
[18:36:49] <kmc> like zero knowledge proofs
[18:37:31] <kmc> there's a really simple and intuitive ZKP algorithm for graph coloring
[18:37:51] <cmr> Actually digging into the math has always been easier for me, with crypto...
[18:38:15] <Tiffany> I should probably find a book or something to introduce me to crypto
[18:38:24] <Tiffany> reading wikipedia is pretty hard when everything is cyclically referential
[18:38:35] <Lurkin> Maybe do a test set up Tiffany.
[18:38:51] <cmr> Wikipedia is near useless for learning from.
[18:39:11] <Tiffany> I'm not terribly interested in writing my own primitives, but it would be nice to get more understanding of why things like double-sha1 are frowned upon
[18:39:25] <Tiffany> I've heard that mixing crypto like that can lead to vulnerabilities but I've never really seen how or why
[18:40:45] <Lurkin> Because crypto more or less relies on the ability to generate randomness for the initial seed.
[18:41:20] <Lurkin> Since computers are only pseudorandom their randomness is only as good as the software allows, unless you use other sources of entropy.
[18:42:10] <kmc> Tiffany: the matasano crypto exercises are fun
[18:42:14] <kmc> I think they're publishing a book
[18:42:26] <kmc> it's all about building little systems and learning how to attack them
