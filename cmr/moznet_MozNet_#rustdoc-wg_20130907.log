[05:30:14] <austincheney> file_test_invalid_path_opened_without_create_should_raise_condition_impl
[05:30:21] <austincheney> that is a long item name
[05:30:27] <cmr> it's a test name
[05:42:11] <austincheney> i am preparing to put my latest revision
[05:42:45] <austincheney> I am completely rewritten the sorting logic for far greater performance and fixed a minor gap in the prior logic
[05:43:48] <austincheney> there is an open matter in preferene in the current sorting logic
[05:44:48] <austincheney> most importantly I am sorting by the index of the search keyword in the result name and then sorting by length of result name
[05:45:53] <austincheney> this means when searching for "t" as the keyword the name "state" appears higher than "bit"
[05:46:13] <austincheney> this is visually disruptive when there are thousands of results
[05:46:29] <austincheney> and I have not found a solution
[05:47:03] <austincheney> http://prettydiff.com/rustdocc/master/
[05:47:32] <austincheney> also, get your opinions in as early as possible and be very critical
[05:47:42] <austincheney> today is the last day that I can supply code
[05:48:15] <austincheney> ^^ cmr Seldaek
[05:48:47] <cmr> austincheney: I think it's awesome!
[05:48:58] <cmr> there's not really a perfect way to sort
[05:49:56] <austincheney> currently I have it set to examine a maximum of 10000 indexes of the searchIndex raw data, which is 11242 long
[05:50:02] <austincheney> at least the version I have been using
[05:50:23] <cmr> by index of substring seems to work well from the few queries I'm throwing at it.
[05:50:26] <austincheney> there is some minor delay when painting a great many results as output to the dom
[05:51:07] <cmr> The one problem I see with it is that it isn't searching impls
[05:51:09] <austincheney> the header filtering is much faster now even with far greater data
[05:51:20] <austincheney> impls?
[05:51:45] <cmr> trait implementations
[05:51:48] <cmr> it's not a big deal
[05:52:04] <austincheney> naw, be more specific
[05:52:18] <austincheney> lets get it right while I can
[05:52:54] <cmr> Do you know rust at all?
[05:53:04] <cmr> (not meant to be degrading)
[05:53:28] <cmr> you can have like `trait ToStr { ... }` and then `impl ToStr for SomeType { ... }`
[05:53:38] <cmr> The search includes the ToStr trait and methods *on* types
[05:53:43] <cmr> but not types that implement ToStr
[05:54:41] <austincheney> no, i don't know rust at all
[05:55:35] <austincheney> yeah, i wont be able to sort for something that is not in the data anyways because there are too many records
[05:56:09] <cmr> well, it should be there, but I don't know what the search index includes
[05:58:37] <austincheney> it is an array where each index is an object literal of these four properties:  name, type, path, desc
[05:59:04] <austincheney> and while name is always populated with a value the others are not always populated with a value

[06:22:19] <cmr> austincheney: the search looks great to me, and it's a huge improvement over what we have now.
[06:22:40] <austincheney> thanks for the opportunity

[12:30:00] <Seldaek> austincheney: thanks a lot for the work yeah :) can you maybe email me the relevant stuff to j.boggiano@seld.be? so that I can try to integrate it in the existing code base. 
[12:30:13] <Seldaek> or send a pull request if you have it integrated, but it's no big deal if you don't

[17:37:01] <austincheney> i am not sure how I would submit a pull request for my changes since the structure of the git repo does not seem to match the files/structure of the web front end as published
