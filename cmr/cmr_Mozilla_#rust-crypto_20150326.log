[00:00:28] <Ilari> *noticed
[00:00:51] <bascule> lololol
[00:01:21] <bascule> any idea why?
[00:01:59] <Ilari> Looks like some optimization going wrong (it works without optimizations but crashes with).
[00:02:49] <Ilari> Also, I considered sticking that known vector overflow ICE code in couple of my crates that don't like overflow checks. :->
[00:08:09] <Ilari> (Try to do any +, - or * with SIMD with overflow checks on, and the compiler will crash).
[00:09:19] <klutzy> Ilari: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/23692
[00:20:17] <Ilari> klutzy: Yeah, I saw that.

[17:29:12] <Ilari> bascule: As to how TLS WG meeting did go, not well. Consensus on the "DH-based key exchange" crap. Plus things that I consider to downright weaken the crypto.

[17:57:44] <bascule> :(
[18:00:15] <Ilari> E.g. dumping per-connection "IVs". I'm not that concerned what that does to strength of Chacha20 (due to key/nonce symmetry, it is equivalent to loss of some key bits, which there are still plenty of). I'm much more worried about what it does to various *-GCM ciphers.
[18:04:32] <Ilari> Also, replacing TLS PRF with HKDF, and I consider HKDF to be weaker (with keys <=64 bytes).
[18:04:57] *** Joins: erickt (erickt@moz-4hh.6p3.217.74.IP)
[18:14:35] <Ilari> I think that if HKDF is used, the baseline prf-hash needs to be updated to SHA-384 (or SHA-512).
[18:16:05] <Ilari> Also, the "DH-based key exchange" looks to have basic mathematical errors.
[18:22:46] <Ilari> It considers only 2 key inputs. The problem is that unified scheme (like that change is presented as) has _3_ key inputs.
[18:23:33] <Ilari> PSK input, eph. DH input and static DH input.

[22:08:02] <LinuxBunny> Ilari, Is the kernel at least open souce?
[22:09:47] <Tobba> Ilari: Intel AMT has a TLS implementation in the kernel of a closed source chip with backdoor access to the NIC and the CPU that noone has been able to fully decipher the code for
[22:09:50] <Tobba> scary!
[22:10:30] <tiffany> but we all trust intel to not be evil, right??
[22:10:41] <tiffany> wow
[22:10:44] <tiffany> AMT is impressively terrible
[22:10:48] <Tobba> at least its not on unless the BIOS loads the right executable into it, I think
[22:12:50] <Tobba> but the ME chip is pretty scary
[22:13:25] <tiffany> how common is this thing?
[22:13:32] <tiffany> I better not have one
[22:13:39] <Tobba> I think every new intel board has one
[22:13:44] <tiffany> oh my
[22:13:47] <Tobba> but I don't think they really do much by default
[22:13:57] <lahwran> they made a whole tls implementation
[22:13:58] <Tobba> the "active" part of the management has to be enabled, somehow
[22:14:01] <lahwran> but it's off by default
[22:14:21] <lahwran> the level of resources companies like intel have to throw at this stuff is insane
[22:15:20] <Tobba> I'm not actually sure what the ME chip does when AMT is disabled, it shouldn't do anything with the network card
[22:15:27] <Tobba> but I remember a lot of computers crashing if you simply didn't initialize it
[22:15:54] <tiffany> I suppose that's what happens when you have a monopoly and don't stagnate, lahwran
[22:16:15] <tiffany> intel has so much money coming in that they can afford to just throw billions of dollars at R&D
[22:17:40] <tiffany> oh, intel doesn't put AMT into i3 CPUs
[22:17:43] <tiffany> that makes me feel better
[22:17:56] <Tobba> they don't?
[22:17:57] <tiffany> here's their privacy statement, for how little that helps http://www.intel.com/technology/vpro/privacy/
[22:18:09] <Tobba> I thought it sat in the PCH (which is on the chipset)
[22:19:02] <Tobba> I guess it's possible it simply doesn't let you enable the AMT features on i3s?
[22:22:32] <Ilari> The amount of precauntions one would have to take to use feature like that (or iLo) even remotely safely is insane. E.g. physically separate interface (not just a VLAN).
[22:23:51] <Ilari> And the network that is connected to is very strictly audited.
[22:25:55] <Tobba> sounds too sane to exist
[22:26:12] <Ilari> Yeah. :-/
[22:32:08] <tiffany> tobba: according to a 2011 howtogeek article, anyway; I can't really find any way to determine concretely...
[22:32:16] <tiffany> it looks like some BIOSes might let you enable/disable it and view status?
[22:32:27] <tiffany> on windows, the AMT driver thingy will tell you whether it's enabled as a status tray icon
[22:32:34] <Tobba> the ME chip is always "on", but the AMT part can be enabled/disabled
[22:32:43] <tiffany> that wasn't clear either
[22:32:44] <Tobba> it shouldn't respond to anything when its disabled
[22:32:48] <tiffany> this is really scary
[22:32:56] <Tobba> the scary part is ME-based malware
[22:33:08] <tiffany> how far do you have to go to not have this damn thing?
[22:33:17] <Tobba> buy AMD I guess?
[22:33:25] <tiffany> well, besides that
[22:36:04] <bascule> better watch out, hackers can upload malicious HTML to your printer and cause it to catch fire
[22:36:17] <tiffany> lp0 on fire
[22:36:34] <bascule> Tobba: it at least needs to be signed by Intel, right?
[22:36:47] <Tobba> yeah, keys are burned into the silicon iirc
[22:36:48] <bascule> but yeah lol J2ME running in your chipset
[22:36:57] <bascule> I'd be more scared if they wrote it in C, heh
[22:37:11] <tiffany> oh
[22:37:12] <Tobba> I think it's part C part Java or something
[22:37:16] <bascule> yeah
[22:37:18] <Tobba> I don't think anyone knows
[22:37:31] <Tobba> it has weird compression done in hardware as well, I don't think anyones bothered to figure it out yet
[22:41:39] <LinuxBunny> tiffany, I heard windows
[22:42:06] <LinuxBunny> <lahwran> but it's off by default
[22:42:20] <LinuxBunny> lahwran, Except for the exploits that hackers find to turn it on remotely and then you're screwed
[22:42:33] <lahwran> that's not my point
[22:42:51] <lahwran> my point is that there's this HUGE THING that intel made, but then basically abandoned... and it's still there
[22:42:52] <tiffany> I still have no idea how to tell whether my laptop has this damn ME
[22:43:28] <tiffany> intel tries to pretend like it isn't a problem just being there, because AMT is off by default
[22:43:36] <tiffany> apparently the TPM runs of the ME as well

[22:51:43] <lahwran> LinuxBunny: I was with it until it said "Windows is, and always has been un-securable because of Microsoft’s design choices. Microsoft will not secure Windows because it will cost them marketshare and money, something that far outweighs customer security in Redmond. Instead, Microsoft retroactively patches flaws, sometimes, and steadfastly refuses to fix the underlying flaws."
[22:51:48] <lahwran> that's... not the case anymore at all
[22:52:33] <lahwran> anyone has to come in with patches after the fact, that's not a bad thing necessarily; and microsoft *has* been restructuring to be more secure
[22:58:46] <tiffany> what would making windows secure even mean in their eyes?
