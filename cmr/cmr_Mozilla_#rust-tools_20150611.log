[00:02:38] <brson> Gankro: what is it for?
[00:03:04] <Gankro> brson: things like https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/10185 fall off the radar too easily
[00:06:14] <brson> Gankro: perhaps this could be a 'soundness' tag or something. there are only a few ub's in rust so a ub tag would seemingly not extend very far
[00:06:35] <brson> maybe nmatsakis has an opinion

[17:52:05] <edunham> acrichto: do you know of any repos that highfive runs on where the correct branch to PR against is other than master?
[17:52:27] <acrichto> edunham: nah I think everything is master nowadays
[17:53:44] <edunham> okay cool
[18:15:32] <gleb> does the rust team consider providing highfive and homu for other projects?
[18:16:47] <acrichto> gleb: probably not as a hosted service, but all the code is available!

[18:40:36] <gleb> brson: can foreign library bindings participate in regression/breakage testing?
[18:41:27] <brson> gleb: i want that, but don't have any particular system in place for it yet
[18:41:42] <brson> gleb: the only thing i've done there so far is put a few popular native libs on the docker image we use
[18:42:05] <brson> there's a lot of interest in improving crater's compatibility though so we'll work something out sooner than later
[18:42:19] <gleb> okay, thanks

[20:34:58] <brson> edunham: sfo7 independent
[20:35:45] <edunham> huh, vidyo isn't showing me anyone else in there?
[20:39:08] <edunham> (fixed it; the remote camera wasn't on before. yay, computers.)
[20:51:31] <brson> https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster-client
[22:17:32] <edunham> acrichto: just landed a highfive patch that warns when PR is against an unexpected branch :)
[22:18:56] <acrichto> edunham: \o/

[22:51:50] <nrc> edunham: I tried to test it here: https://github.com/nrc/highfive/pull/52
[22:52:01] <nrc> I think it should have flagged that, but it didn't
[22:53:31] <edunham> nrc: indeed. definitely updated the bot before sending the test PR?
[22:53:57] <nrc> edunham: if you think that should have been flagged I'll try to investigate later. I'm afraid my setup is totally amateur and I have no good way to give you access to the my server :-( 
[22:53:59] <nrc> I did
[22:54:28] <edunham> okay. Then the correct solution is probably to attempt writing a test suite for the bot :)
[22:54:44] * edunham will look at that during next break from unix-ing
[22:54:58] <nrc> yeah, that would be nice :-)
[22:55:20] <nrc> I'll be offline for a bit, but I'll do a bit of debugging when I get back too
[22:55:48] <nrc> longer term, we could think about moving highfive some where official so its easier to hack on
[22:56:09] <edunham> good point; having it on a personal box of yours is also terrible from a bus standpoint
[22:56:22] <edunham> i could easily have done a dumb and put the code in the wrong place or something :)
[22:56:24] <nrc> (it was such a hassle at the time to get an official resource to use that I ended up just buying server time)
[22:57:07] <edunham> aw, sadness. 
[22:57:18] <edunham> also, terrible quesiton, but are there plans to rewrite highfive in rust? :P
[22:57:33] <nrc> I occasionally do stupid stuff too like reboot the server and forget to restart one of the bots
[22:58:13] <nrc> edunham: I have no plans to - doesn't seem worthwhile to me, but I'd be happy to see someone else do it if they were interested
[22:59:03] <nrc> I have thought about rewriting it in node.js because that's what all my other bots and web stuff use, but that never seemed worth the effort either, really
[23:00:09] <edunham> for what it's worth, I find Python a lot easier to read and write than js
[23:02:22] <nrc> for me it depends on what I use more - I used to prefer Python when I was hacking a lot on DXR, now I don't use it so often and JS feels more natural. I end up using JS for frontend stuff, so it is more familiar to use it for backend stuff too. I like Python but I don't use it much any more
