[01:20:22] <tiffany> have you asked your employer about opensourcing it?
[01:20:30] <bjz> h3r3tic: you need to assert your rights in your next contract :(
[01:20:35] <tiffany> ^
[01:20:45] <bjz> h3r3tic: that's too cruel
[01:21:36] <bjz> h3r3tic: but it's probably wishful thinking :(
[01:25:52] <h3r3tic> tiffany: last time I asked about sharing /anything/ it took them between 5 and 8 months to respond. and all of them have been tiny things. 5 months for two lines of shader code
[01:26:21] <tiffany> ow
[01:26:36] <h3r3tic> last time I wanted to work on an open source project for cube-map prefiltering ( so it matches the glossiness of the surface via a simple mip selection in a shader ), I had to write an equivalent of a journal article describing every bit of it
[01:26:47] * photex long time luker.. just chiming in
[01:26:53] <photex> those contracts are standard in vfx and animation also
[01:26:56] <h3r3tic> it all goes through some terrible lawyers in SEGA Japan :S
[01:26:56] <photex> :/
[01:27:00] <tiffany> what happens to your contributions to existing open source projects?
[01:27:03] <h3r3tic> eek
[01:27:17] <bjz> photex: hihi, welcome!
[01:27:36] <photex> for the studios I've worked for it all depends. If the project is far enough from the "core business" then you can get it added as "prior art" or something
[01:27:36] <h3r3tic> tiffany: I'm probably not allowed to do any; but no clue how they would resolve it, should any potential conflicts arise
[01:27:58] <h3r3tic> I contribute tiny stuff every now and then, but only when I know they couldn't possibly have any issues with it :P

[01:28:17] <photex> cheers bjz 
[01:28:19] <h3r3tic> aye. if it doesn't compete with the 'core business', then you have a chance of getting rights to it :P
[01:28:21] <photex> I'm still new
[01:28:31] <bjz> photex: awesome
[01:28:45] <photex> so I'm mostly just trying to build things from rustpkg
[01:28:52] <bjz> ahhhk
[01:28:57] <bjz> ugh rustpkg
[01:29:01] <bjz> -_-#
[01:29:06] <jeaye> The company I work for owns all of my code and ideas that are materialized at work. They also prevent me from developing a game in the same industry, or to the same market.
[01:29:08] <photex> I started lurking around 0.7 or so... tried to build a little opengl demo and failed miserably
[01:29:14] <photex> taking another shot at the moment
[01:29:16] <photex> heh
[01:29:26] <jeaye> Not so bad though, since that's pretty much the standard.
[01:29:27] <bjz> photex: I've been trying to improve the situation
[01:30:17] <photex> bjz it's so much better already
[01:30:17] <bjz> photex: I'm getting bogged down in trying to knock std::num into shape again
[01:30:26] <photex> docs look great for instance
[01:30:40] <h3r3tic> nah, getting stuff off the ground is a breeze compared to say, the early days of D :)
[01:30:48] <h3r3tic> largely thanks to bjz
[01:30:54] <bjz> photex: but I will get back to my game dev libs - luckily I have lots of awersome folks helping me stay on top of things
[01:31:00] <photex> yeah, it's really motivating to see the energy
[01:31:08] <bjz> h3r3tic: really? compared to D?
[01:31:21] <photex> I'm trying to determine the best practice for wrangling dependencies

[01:31:58] *** Joins: summerlight (summerligh@327FC32B.2C956A45.501EFF44.IP)
[01:32:02] <photex> certainly
[01:32:13] <h3r3tic> bjz: yus. your libs/bindings are enough to do fancy GL stuff. in early D there was total chaos, and a handful of incomplete, incoherent libs :P
[01:32:35] <bjz> photex: I am planning to move my projects to CMake for now, but cmr is working on a stop-gap solution in python
[01:32:38] <photex> It's interesting you mention D h3r3tic because I've been eyeing Rust and D
[01:32:45] <h3r3tic> hah
[01:32:52] <photex> CMake and Rust you say bjz 
[01:32:57] <photex> Itriguing
[01:33:00] <bjz> photex: he's planning to move my stuff to it, so we will see
[01:33:09] <photex> I was considering a side quest with Gradle myself
[01:33:15] <photex> or Waf (python build tool)
[01:33:22] <tiffany> wasn't someone trying to make rustic opengl bindings?
[01:33:22] <bjz> photex: not the best match in heaven, but better than lots of the alternatives
[01:33:25] <h3r3tic> I used to be a D user ages ago. since D ~0.68 till 1.something. was pretty fun overall, but they never cleaned it up, and are just adding more mess in D 2 :P
[01:34:25] <bjz> h3r3tic: unfortunately it now looks like D is built on a poor foundation type theory wise
[01:34:28] <photex> Between Rust and D I've really just grown fond of what I see with Rust. It's hitting like every sweet spot
[01:34:36] <h3r3tic> tiffany: I think that would be difficult, as the spec is rather messy. and the value isn't that great, as typically you'd have your own layer on top of GL anyway
[01:34:54] <photex> but getting a working knowledge of something new takes a bit of time
[01:35:00] * photex has kids
[01:35:07] <photex> hehe
[01:35:09] <h3r3tic> bjz: yus. some 3 years ago Walter ( the main creator ) went "what is a delegate?" on a forum. :P
[01:35:28] <bjz> h3r3tic: Rust isn't the state of the art, but it's defintitley pulled a ton more out of the academic languages and hopefully they will become more mainstreame now 
[01:35:28] <tiffany> I used a language based on D
[01:35:29] <h3r3tic> sorry, "what is a closure"
[01:36:09] <dbaupp> h3r3tic: ... really? surely there was some more context that means it wasn't quite as silly?
[01:36:11] <photex> h3r3tic: somehow closures were reeeeallly new to a lot of people until the Javascript apocalypse
[01:36:28] <photex> I think they must have gone by another name at some point
[01:36:29] <bjz> h3r3tic: I don't care if a language designer doesn't know everything, only that the language is well put together and there are folks helping to make sure things are solid
[01:36:36] <dbaupp> (given google could've answered that question.)
[01:37:05] <h3r3tic> dbaupp: nope. not really. Walter doesn't care about the theory. he just wants a C with this and that, implemented in ad-hoc ways. and hence D grew through accretion. it was pretty neat and minimal in the start, but they just kept bolting extra legs onto it
[01:37:17] <bjz> h3r3tic: I've personally felt for quite awhile that Rust seemed like it had some shoddy foundations, but it seems now to be really tightening up
[01:37:27] <h3r3tic> photex: yeah... but a language creator should know them T__T
[01:37:49] <bjz> photex: well C# introduced them
[01:38:07] <h3r3tic> bjz: mm. well for me one of the biggest pros for Rust is that it's self-hosting and the authors are eating their dog food a lot. D had none of that.
[01:38:07] <bjz> photex: as in, to a more mainstreme audience
[01:38:17] <bjz> h3r3tic: indeed
[01:38:33] <bjz> h3r3tic: I really need to get back to using my libs for that reason
[01:38:40] <dbaupp> Is D self-hosting now?
[01:38:45] <h3r3tic> no clue :P
[01:38:47] <bjz> dbaupp: no
[01:38:57] <bjz> dbaupp: still in C++, but there is talk
[01:39:05] <h3r3tic> I spent days trying to argue productivity issues with D, but they fell on deaf ears, because the creators weren't using it.
[01:39:42] <dbaupp> bjz: ah, similar to Go, then.
[01:39:48] <tiffany> can't do too much dogfood eating though or you risk having a dependency on a broken new feature
[01:39:57] <bjz> dbaupp: last DConf they were addressing that - but it remains to be seen how long it will take for that to happen - they don't have much momentum unfortunately
[01:40:09] <bjz> tiffany: heh, story of Rust
[01:40:26] <dbaupp> bjz: lies, we never have any broken features
[01:40:29] <dbaupp> :P
[01:40:32] <tiffany> I think it may be a fundamental problem of self-hosting compilers, they are never representative of the language they compile
[01:41:02] <bjz> dbaupp: well it's taken two decades for D to get to that stage of talking about it - at least Go has been a little more on the ball
[01:41:14] <bjz> tiffany: yeah, but is that a bad thing always?
[01:41:20] <h3r3tic> yeah but then you also have the creators doing side-projects; like the (NES?) emulator :)
[01:41:36] <jeaye> bjz: Well, fortunately language developers can learn from eachother.
[01:41:45] <tiffany> compilers are interesting time machines
[01:41:59] <bjz> h3r3tic: yeah, acrichto is doing a GBA emulator too
[01:42:05] <jeaye> GBA?
[01:42:11] <jeaye> Ah
[01:42:12] <dbaupp> h3r3tic: and the servo side project
[01:42:16] <bjz> or might be a GBC
[01:42:23] <bjz> I think?
[01:42:29] <bjz> (game boy colour)
[01:42:35] <jeaye> mmmhmm
[01:43:07] <photex> I'm ignorant of some of the wider tooling for Rust still. Is there a debugger that you all recommend? gdb? lldb?
[01:43:09] <bjz> tiffany: at least the standard libs can be better
[01:43:21] <bjz> photex: gdb I think is the main one
[01:43:26] <photex> thanks
[01:43:38] <bjz> photex: and I think pcwalton uses the osx profiler too
[01:43:53] <bjz> pcwalton: and they use the osx opengl debugging stuff too
[01:44:03] <bjz> I mean photex ^
[01:44:07] <h3r3tic> dbaupp: hah, yeah, that one! tiny, but yeah! *cough* xD
[01:44:20] * bjz is curious about valve's gl debugger
[01:44:25] <pcwalton> yeah, I do
[01:44:47] <bjz> pcwalton: so what do you use the profiler mainly for?
[01:44:54] <pcwalton> everything
[01:45:02] <pcwalton> when I want to know why something is slow I use instruments.app
[01:45:06] <bjz> pcwalton: just speed stuff, or is it good for lots more?
[01:45:11] <pcwalton> speed usually
[01:45:30] * bjz wished there was a good gui debugger on osx
[01:45:52] <bjz> it's all tied up in xcode unfortunately

[02:01:35] *** kimundi is now known as zz_kimundi
[02:07:50] <Amaranth> I thought the plan for std::num now was that we didn't know what std::num should look like yet so everything was getting ripped out of it
[02:09:25] <bjz> Amaranth: less that, more that the std should focus on being minimal and simple
[02:10:30] <bjz> Amaranth: and folks should be able to decide to use their own thing if needed. But hopefully we will ba able to bundle some common abstract algebra foundation with the distribution
[02:10:36] <bjz> but not in the std
[02:11:12] <bjz> the question is also, should ieee754fp be included in the std
[02:11:58] <bjz> I am currently working on lots of this stuff out of tree, then we can debate that stuff later
[02:15:24] <h3r3tic> bjz: I'm somewhat dubious about that transform3d thing. not sure if I'm reading it correctly, but it seems that you basically have a struct which groups a quaternion, a vector, and a scaling factor; but it has no meaning until you actually decide what you want to do with it via the rotate/scal/translate interface. when I had a similar struct, I thought of it as a reference frame rather than an arbitrary collection of quat/vec/scale. and that made it 
[02:15:24] <h3r3tic> a very well defined concept to manipulate. nesting transforms made sense like that; inverting them as well, etc.
[02:16:33] <bjz> h3r3tic: so you mean the transform3d in the proposed PR
[02:16:41] <h3r3tic> yeah
[02:16:42] <bjz> or what we have currently?
[02:16:57] <jeaye> h3r3tic: What's a listing of the rendering techniques you're using there?

[02:22:54] <h3r3tic> jeaye: well, not that many actually. so it's a deferred renderer, though the lighting pass is currently pretty silly. lights use the Trowbridge-Reitz reflectance model with the geometric term from Ashikhmin Shirley, an exponential remap of roughness, and a custom approximation to the Fresnel term. after lighting I do screen-space reflectoins via a novel algorithm I'm woring on. all lighting is scaled by screen-space ambient occlusion ( the variant 
[02:22:54] <h3r3tic> called 'Alchemy' ). At the end I combine it with some glare, and tone-map the HDR lighting values using an exponential operator with a contrast gain.
[02:23:28] <bjz> h3r3tic: it'd be nice to have a rephrasing of your critique of the PR - didn't quite follow you
[02:25:20] <h3r3tic> mm; which bits did you not follow? xD
[02:25:41] <h3r3tic> well I mostly doubt the usefulness of this 'new transform api'. doesn't sound like anything I'd really use myself

[05:20:48] <csherratt> I was just saying it is ambitious.
[05:21:21] <csherratt> And my other thought is that libc often is optimized by silicon vendors, which you would lose out on if you wrote your own.

[05:35:25] <bjz> Denommus: hurro!
[05:35:51] <Denommus> I'm sleepless tonight, so I'll ask something that is making me curious 
[05:35:57] <bjz> shoot
[05:36:42] <bjz> ...
[05:36:48] <Denommus> If I ever made a game engine based on the actor model, would the physics engine need to be based on the same model? 
[05:36:57] <bjz> No Idea
[05:37:12] <Denommus> Sorry for the delays, typing on a tablet 
[05:37:35] <bjz> you might have to ask folks who know more about game engine achitechture, like jeaye or h3r3tic 
[05:37:40] <cmr> Why would it be, though?
[05:37:51] <bjz> yeah
[05:38:02] <bjz> I dunno why it would have to be
[05:38:10] <cmr> I mean, you could incrementally update all the things...
[05:38:18] <Denommus> I'll try to explain myself 
[05:38:25] <cmr> but you could also just update at a fixed tick. and probably use something like a functional data structure
[05:38:32] <cmr> jeaye: h3r3tic: come to the rescue!
[05:39:43] <Denommus> If a Physics actor changes state, wouldn't it be better if it was in the same thread as my actor? 
[05:40:10] <Denommus> Or should I just send a signal to this actor? 
[05:40:40] <jeaye> eh
[05:41:12] <jeaye> The actor model is inherently concurrent, aye? You'll have a much harder time with physics because of this.
[05:41:20] <Denommus> I may be sound
[05:41:50] <Denommus> I may sound stupid, but I'm still figuring that model out

[05:43:19] <Denommus> jeaye: so, physics should not be concurrent? 
[05:43:34] <cmr> physics can't be fully concurrent.
[05:43:41] <cmr> but I think sending signals should be fine, if not slowish.
[05:43:45] <jeaye> Well, physics is very tough to make concurrent.
[05:44:04] <jeaye> Things need to happen sequentially and deterministically.
[05:44:56] <Denommus> Hm. So, like graphics, I should have just one thread running for it. That may make some things simpler 
[05:45:14] <jeaye> It will make most things simpler.

[05:46:30] <Denommus> Well, the communication between my actor and the physical world gets a little more complex. But then, I will have the same complexity regarding graphics 
[05:46:32] <jeaye> Graphics can be on multiple threads (q3 uses multi-threaded GL), as can physics. But, especially with an actor model, I don't think I'd dig myself into it.
[05:47:12] <jeaye> I mean, is it an entirely physics-based game?
[05:47:34] <jeaye> Are you spending a lot of time on physics calculations completely independent of one another?
[05:47:36] <Denommus> No, it is actually just a engine 
[05:47:56] *** Quits: pcwalton (pcwalton@moz-DA87EE4.hsd1.ca.comcast.net) (Quit: pcwalton)
[05:48:04] <Denommus> I don't have lots of inspiration for doing games, but I like the technical side 
[05:48:04] <jeaye> If so, you might consider attempting to thread your physics. Otherwise, there are much more sane avenues for threading.
[05:48:13] <jeaye> Denommus: I'm the same way. :)
[05:48:34] <jeaye> I say "I'm gonna make a game", and then I make a new engine for that game and move on.
[05:49:13] <Denommus> The only time I actually worked with games I got so lost with a DSL I had projected that I ended up late 
[05:50:59] <Denommus> And now I'm inspired about doing a engine in Rust, with a Scheme powered DSL for scripting 
[05:52:01] <jeaye> :)
[05:52:09] <jeaye> Share the source with us!
[05:52:17] <Denommus> Probably something similar to QML: defining my scene and state transitions on it

[17:13:00] <rsaarelm> If I have struct A {...} and struct B<'t> { aRef: &'t A }, is there a way to create the struct C<'t> { a: ~A, b: ~B<'t> } that owns them both while keeping everything immutable and keeping Rust happy about the lifetimes being right?
[17:14:08] <rsaarelm> I'm trying to create the A and B outside the struct, since B needs to reference the A when it's created, but then I need to move then inside the C struct and not have rustc throw a fit about lifetimes with the reference.
[17:20:44] <photex> morning everyone
[17:20:57] <bjz> rsaarelm: could you do an example in a gist?
[17:20:58] <photex> I just tried to build rust-sdl2, but it's bailing on "extern mod native"
[17:21:05] <cmr> photex: rust version?
[17:21:09] <photex> 0.9
[17:21:25] <cmr> what's the error?
[17:21:33] <photex> error: Package demo depends on native, but I don't know how to find it
[17:21:34] <rsaarelm> bjz: Hold on.
[17:21:42] <cmr> oh, you're using rustpkg?
[17:22:03] <photex> that's what the project makefile uses
[17:22:31] <photex> is that just a deprecated mod?
[17:22:35] <cmr> no.
[17:22:45] <cmr> rustpkg was broken for 0.9 for libnative though
[17:22:56] <photex> I see.
[17:22:57] <cmr> it didn't know to look in the directory libnative was stored.
[17:23:07] <cmr> (it broke more than just libnative, but that's the biggest thing it broke)
[17:23:33] <photex> wow, ok. Should I just be using master instead?
[17:23:41] <cmr> that's recommended, yes.
[17:23:54] <photex> okidoki...

[17:26:09] <cmr> rsaarelm: yeah that's not possible.
[17:26:19] <cmr> lifetimes are tied to scopes, not values.
[17:26:29] <cmr> so you take a reference to `a` in `new`, but then try to return it.
[17:27:11] <cmr> and, to be fair, it's not wrong; a *would* be freed.
[17:27:40] <cmr> you could take the ObjectSystem as an argument to `new` and return a GameState referencing the argument.
[17:28:22] <cmr> (so `fn new<'a>(gs: &'a ObjectSystem) -> GameState<'a> { ... }`)
[17:28:39] <rsaarelm> The idea is that GameState is the thing that ultimately owns a bunch of the system objects, and the system objects have a DAG of references to each other.
[17:28:44] <rsaarelm> I had this working nicely in C++.
[17:29:03] <rsaarelm> Would work nicely if I made the references mutable and nullable, but ew.
[17:29:11] <cmr> ownership + references can only safely provide trees, not DAGs
[17:29:28] <cmr> you'll need Rc to safely do this.
[17:30:24] <cmr> ofc you could just use unsafe code if the GameState actually does own them, and it doesn't allow them to escape.
[17:30:38] <rsaarelm> No, there's only the concrete objects that are in the tree of the GameState -> bunch of *System fields. Then there are weak references between systems which I don't care about since GameState takes care of system lifetimes and is the only thing that creates systems.
[17:31:10] <cmr> right
[17:31:25] <rsaarelm> But since they're DAG, I could do C++ member initialization where I start by creating the system that doesn't refer to anything else, then init the system that refers to that, then the one referring to those two and so on.
[17:31:43] *** Joins: bjustin (bjustin@moz-8FC28563.sierrabravo.net)
[17:32:15] <rsaarelm> But Rust doesn't let me build up a struct in a way where I could refer to fields earlier in the struct that are already initialized when defining ones later in the struct.
[17:32:22] <cmr> not safely, no.
[17:32:30] <cmr> it doesn't allow uninitialized values.
[17:32:42] <cmr> you can use std::unstable::intrinsics::uninit() to create an uninitialized struct.

[17:33:14] <rsaarelm> Hm. Yes.
[17:33:35] <rsaarelm> Black magic is an option, since this is a thing I basically just do in this one place, not all over the code.

[17:34:03] <cmr> it's not particularly black magic, it's equivalent to `SomeType foo;` in C++, sans default constructor.
[17:34:17] <cmr> (so more like `struct some_type_t foo;` in C)
[17:34:31] <rsaarelm> Even better.
[17:35:31] <rsaarelm> I'll look into that, thanks.
[17:35:44] <cmr> np
[17:35:57] <cmr> unsafe code isn't evil, if it's self-contained and can expose a safe interface.

[17:43:52] <rsaarelm> Yeah, I hadn't thought enough about messy unsafe constructors possibly being a fine way to implement things.
[17:49:26] <rsaarelm> Looks like I can't put a reference in one of the half-constructed gamestate's field into another gamestate field without also getting into lifetime problems, despite it all obviously being in the gamestate this time..
