[00:03:05] <DroidLogician> I'm pretty sure I've got this right already, but just to make sure. calling `mem::transmute` on a type that implements `Drop` won't invoke the drop glue, correct?>

[00:05:03] <DroidLogician> I figured as much, just didn't want a hidden implementation detail to bite me in the butt

[00:06:02] <cmr> there's std::mem::forget if that's the only thing you need
[00:06:07] <DroidLogician> it's for a no-op transform, since you can't move out of a struct that implements Drop
[00:06:30] <DroidLogician> the contents are in an `Arc` and I don't want to waste time incrementing the refcount just to decrement it again

[01:41:23] <d3z> I think because Makefile required a capital M.  I remember reading that at one point.
[01:41:27] <theme> DroidLogician, currently, you can't
[01:41:43] <FreeFull> d3z: It doesn't require a capital m
[01:41:50] <DroidLogician> theme: not exactly, you can use `BoxAny` to downcast it to `&'static str`
[01:41:54] <d3z> True, it allows a capital m.
[01:41:57] <FreeFull> d3z: make checks Makefile first, then makefile, then some other names
[01:42:31] <FreeFull> GNU make will check GNUmakefile too

[08:36:53] <triep> right, they are marked with a language item though
[08:37:03] <reem> right now, in the future they won't be
[08:37:04] <Mutabah> reem: How would auto-implementing work there?
[08:37:05] <triep> but they are the pieces needed for implementing safe concurrency in Rust itself
[08:37:33] <triep> sargas: the vector used to be builtin to the compiler, now it's entirely a library type
[08:37:59] <triep> sargas: used to have @mut T  (reference counted, runtime mutation checked pointers) built in

[08:38:27] <triep> @mut user on github is probably happy we don't ping them anymore
[08:38:52] <reem> Mutabah: There is a new type of impl, a default impl: unsafe impl Send for .. { }. This means that types which are made of Send are Send, and negative impls can remove types.
[08:38:53] <sargas> oh man, I bet he is happy

[08:39:47] <sargas> I can't wait for beta to come out, and for std::io to be finished

[12:38:29] <triep> well it doesn't help much since it's not going to be implemented anytime soon
[12:39:21] <kmcguire_> i am okay with just having the Nothing there so i can do ehaustive matching incase something implements every interface
[12:39:35] <kmcguire_> at first it bothered me because i didnt think about doing it
[12:40:11] <kmcguire_> its more like.. something implements everything... later i add another interface.. then it wont compile.. have to go back and change something <-- avoiding that
[12:40:31] <kmcguire_> its more like.. i mean example
[12:41:17] <kmcguire_> triep, if you have any inkling about something that might help you can tell me and i can look into it
[12:41:29] <kmcguire_> i mean no matter how dumb it sounds
[12:41:40] <kmcguire_> it might spur an idea
[12:42:02] <triep> hm I don't know. Your idea is as good as mine
[12:42:22] <triep> I think that enums are useful for closed-world and traits for open-world types

[17:36:42] <jaredonline> If you have a Mutex<Foo>, can you access Foo in a read-only mode w/o locking the Mutex?

I think in many cases it's preferable to iterate over board states and score them, but only store the pattern of moves to get there (since you need those anyway) instead of storing the full board state.

[21:01:32] <Binero> does the ref keyword actually create a pointer or not? 
[21:01:43] <cmr> it does, yes.
[21:01:50] <Binero> Then I'm a bit confused
[21:02:10] <Binero> I have a function which takes a ref name: Type
[21:02:15] <Binero> so it expects a &Type
[21:02:39] <talchas> uh, don't do that
[21:02:44] <talchas> I don't know why that even compiles
[21:02:51] <Binero> o.O
[21:03:00] <Binero> fn panic_unexpected_element(ref name: name::OwnedName, ref event: XmlEvent) {
[21:03:03] <Binero> compiles
[21:03:04] <cmr> talchas: of course it compiles
[21:03:11] <Binero> well it says it expects a &T 
[21:03:16] <talchas> cmr: but it's not going to do anything useful
[21:03:23] <cmr> talchas: the lhs of a : in function arguments is a pattern.
[21:03:24] <talchas> thus it shouldn't :P
[21:03:25] <talchas> yeah
[21:03:36] <Binero> well anyway 
[21:03:38] <cmr> sure it is, you can omit a `let name = &name;` later...
[21:03:40] <cmr> Binero: sounds like a bug.
[21:03:42] <talchas> and I /guess/ if it allows @ patterns it might be usefulish
[21:03:44] <Binero> in a match I have a ref 
[21:03:50] <Binero> which doesn't cause it to become a pointer
[21:03:53] <Binero> and in the function I have a ref
[21:03:55] <cmr> talchas: it lets you take references into a matched value.
[21:03:57] <Binero> which does cause it to become a pointer 
[21:04:19] <talchas> cmr: yeah, the top level ref is just asking for misunderstandings though
[21:04:19] *** Quits: alexchandel (Adium@moz-lgsu1i.hfc.comcastbusiness.net) (Quit: Leaving.)
[21:04:32] <Binero> sorry other way around
[21:04:40] <Binero> inside the function it doesn't become a pointer, inside a match it does
[21:05:02] <Binero> match : XmlEvent::StartElement { ref name, attributes: _, namespace: _} =>
[21:05:08] <Binero> name = &OwnedName
[21:05:18] <Binero> inside the function I also have ref name, and it's just a OwnedName
[21:05:38] <cmr> Binero: again, sounds like a bug.
[21:05:41] <debu> On the postgres github page, it says timestamp is supported optionally; is this something you have to then enable when putting postgres in your cargo.toml?
[21:05:42] <talchas> Binero: so panic_unexpected_element should take OwnedName, and then bind a reference to it

[22:14:08] <bluss> Eq has an optional type parameter now, so it can do the same thing as Equiv did

[22:14:46] <ChrisMorgan> ryanhiebert: therefore, on a HashMap<String, _> you could calculate the hash on a &str for lookup, rather than needing to create a new heap allocation just for a lookup (which would clearly be silly)

[22:17:43] <bluss> but yes, it always produces a bool
[22:17:49] <ryanhiebert> What I'm trying to see about doing is overriding == to return something other than a bool. SQLAlchemy in Python does this, and it makes for some very nice APIs.
[22:17:52] <reem> ChrisMorgan: Sure, but properties are basically just sugar for getters and setters
[22:18:03] <reem> ChrisMorgan: they don't actually have the same semantics as normal =
[22:18:27] <ChrisMorgan> reem: sure, more restricted as I said ☺
[22:18:45] <ryanhiebert> The main problem people came up with for overloading the same way as std::ops is ergonomics. Those traits suck to use compared to `Eq` and `Ord`.
[22:18:47] <talchas> with associated types, it /probably/ wouldn't cause issues besides a bunch of typing I think?

[22:19:59] <ChrisMorgan> Semantically, the name PartialEq would not make sense with a == b => anything other than bool.
[22:20:00] <bluss> can't it be an input type parameter?
[22:20:09] <bluss> with default to bool.
[22:20:14] <ChrisMorgan> bluss: semantically it *is* an output parameter.

[22:20:42] <ryanhiebert> True. My idea was to allow an `Equiv` Type to somehow implement `Eq` and `Ne` (like std::ops) that restrict those traits to be bools and allow us just to implement `Equiv` instead.

[22:29:05] <ryanhiebert> Indeed. Python's overload system is a bit limited because it has to have "r" forms of the overloading, thankfully rust does better.

[22:32:27] <ChrisMorgan> ryanhiebert: I think it’s fair to say that || and && will never be overloadable; with short-circuiting the right hand side needs to be able to be lazily evaluated which would mean that at best instead of an RHS value you’d have an RHS closure.
[22:33:05] <ryanhiebert> The general feeling was that people didn't want to screw with the ergonomics of `Eq` and `Ord`.
[22:33:12] <ryanhiebert> And I agree with that feeling.
[22:33:23] <steveklabnik> ryanhiebert: ahh, sorry, coudln't remember who it was
[22:33:32] <ryanhiebert> ChrisMorgan: I hadn't even considered short-circuit overloads yet.
[22:34:01] <ryanhiebert> But they feel too special case, so I would understand them not being workable.
[22:34:36] <ryanhiebert> In the APIs that I'd work with, the bitwise versions would probably be fine, similar to what had to be done in Python, for the same reasons.

[23:43:48] <enjolras> can i make two traits so that i can't implement one if i implement the other ?

[23:44:41] <mbrubeck> enjolras: The straightforward way to do that would be negative bounds `Trait1: !Trait2` which don't exist yet but have been discussed.
[23:44:54] <mbrubeck> I'm not sure whether there's a more complicated way...
[23:45:32] <enjolras> yeah, i tried the negative bounds but rust wasn't happy

[23:53:04] <mbrubeck> panicbit: But the impl is compiled unconditionally, so it would always error, right?
