[00:22:56] <steveklabnik> WD-40: pong
[00:23:19] <WD-40> steveklabnik: since your a Rubyist, have you seen Crystal ?
[00:23:52] <steveklabnik> i have, i haven't used it
[00:25:10] <WD-40> steveklabnik: technically you have ;)
[00:25:56] <steveklabnik> oh?
[00:26:59] <WD-40> steveklabnik: Well Crystal is basically just Ruby, but compiled :)
[00:27:09] <WD-40> What do you think of it?
[00:27:36] <steveklabnik> ehhhhh 'just' can mean very, very different things
[00:27:45] <steveklabnik> just becuase the syntax is simillar doesn't mean they're similar languages
[00:28:20] <steveklabnik> I don't see why I'd use it over Ruby
[00:28:22] <steveklabnik> basically
[00:28:41] <WD-40> Well, it does solve many points you wrote in your "Rust for Rubyists"
[00:28:41] <steveklabnik> its value proposition is + performance - differnet behavior - community
[00:29:33] <steveklabnik> Ruby is hard to make fast, but that's due to fundamnetal language design decisions
[00:29:40] <steveklabnik> so if you do that, it ends up being a different language
[00:29:57] * steveklabnik shrugs
[00:29:59] <steveklabnik> i don't think it's bad
[00:30:36] <WD-40> steveklabnik: ehh, Crystal syntax is like 93% actual Ruby
[00:30:39] <scott> I don't find syntax is usually much of a factor for me, so Crystal would have to impress in some other way
[00:30:59] <WD-40> scott, what's a factor for you ?
[00:31:05] <steveklabnik> what's the 7%?
[00:31:16] <scott> there's a lot of little systems language in the same space as Crystal, and it doesn't differentiate itself in a huge way
[00:31:48] <scott> WD-40: that's an extremely open ended question
[00:32:07] <reem> steveklabnik: iirc global type inference + checking, efficient ffi, and compiles to native code.
[00:32:10] <WD-40> Design changes in one way to fix Ruby faults, and the others for low-level integration with C

[00:34:31] <reem> keep in mind I know quite little about ruby
[00:34:47] <steveklabnik> yeah. ruby already has really decent ffi

[03:42:21] <lahwran> holy crap I am so much ridiculously more productive in python/twisted than in basically anything else
[03:42:22] <lahwran> ._.
[03:44:47] <Havvy> lahwran:  Even compared to Node.js?
[03:45:18] <lahwran> well I haven't used that
[03:45:34] <lahwran> this isn't a fundamental thing so much as it is a *lot* of practice with python and twisted
[03:45:45] <Havvy> Ah.
[03:46:08] <ELD> lahwran: As much as I try to get into Python, I just can't because I have a hard time reasoning to myself about the type system. I don't do so well with loosely typed languages.
[03:46:18] <lahwran> heh it's not loose by default, thank god
[03:46:23] <lahwran> just dynamic
[03:46:35] * lahwran smashes js in the face with a blunt object
[03:46:58] <lahwran> types in python feel like rust, minus the checking, imo
[03:47:17] <lahwran> someone needs to translate twisted to rust
[03:47:26] <lahwran> or something like it, twisted has a lot of mistakes to shed
[03:47:28] <cmr> except twisted is terrible
[03:47:38] <lahwran> as I was saying
[03:48:17] <Havvy> lahwran:  Are there algebraic types in Python?
[03:48:33] * lahwran snorts
[03:48:35] <lahwran> yes, strings
[03:48:43] <lahwran> this is *python* we're talking about
[03:48:54] <lahwran> your expectations are too high
[03:49:22] <cmr> Python's *class design* might feel somewhat similar to the way Rust is used, but conflating that with their type systems is absurd.
[03:49:29] <lahwran> that's not what I mean
[03:49:55] <lahwran> I mean that because rust has full-on type inference, the way you work with types - that is, almost entirely in your head, very rarely or never actually saying what they are - feels similar
[03:50:14] <lahwran> the actual type systems are, respectively, a type system, and no type system
[03:50:28] <cmr> Python has a type system, it's just dynamic and has very few rules.
[03:50:53] <scott> ML-style type inference usually gets you something that looks like standard dynamic languages
[03:51:01] <lahwran> scott: that is what I meant
[03:51:16] <lahwran> "types in python feel like rust, minus the checking"
[03:51:25] <lahwran> perhaps I could have been more clearerness
[03:51:29] <lahwran> ificationatorable
[03:52:06] <cmr> even with your clarifications I don't feel that, given that I spend most of my time in Rust thinking about how to structure my types to get what I want out of it :)
[03:52:16] <lahwran> hehe
[03:52:26] <cmr> (I've also been doing an absurd amount of generic or type-level things recently...)
[03:52:33] <lahwran> yeah I guess I'm just talking about a specific area of rust
[03:52:39] <lahwran> I have also done some fun things with generics
[03:52:58] <lahwran> rigging cast-from traits to approximate overloading was amusing

[04:02:11] <zwarich> scott: the popular dynamic languages tend to involve a lot of subtyping, and ML (rightly so?) doesn't have any of that outside of the module system
[04:02:41] <scott> zwarich: I only meant it in the very superficial way that you don't have many types written out explicitly
[04:02:57] <zwarich> I find that the biggest annoyance wrt to type-level programming in Rust is the verbose syntax for types
[04:03:07] <scott> unlike 'mainstream' static languages that traditionally require many annotations
[04:03:10] <zwarich> and the distinction between values and references
[04:03:36] <scott> I find <>'s hard to visually pair off
[04:03:47] <scott> they aren't tall enough I think
[04:03:55] <zwarich> yeah <> is just bad syntax
[04:04:09] <zwarich> still disappointed Rust kept it
[04:04:24] <scott> I think I would prefer [] but it's obviously pointless to bikeshed it now
[04:04:24] <Mutabah> zwarich: There wasn't a good alternative afaik
[04:04:51] <scott> I guess arrays and slices make that confusing
[04:04:54] <scott> lots of tradeoffs
[04:05:10] <zwarich> I need to try to finish the proof of my suspicion that Rust is inherently ambiguous :P
[04:05:25] <zwarich> or alternatively, classify the grammar
[04:05:26] <scott> where do suspect an ambiguity?
[04:05:31] <scott> do you*
[04:05:53] <zwarich> scott: something related to > > and >> perhaps
[04:06:03] <Mutabah> zwarich: have you seen my mrustc project?
[04:06:17] <zwarich> Mutabah: nah
[04:06:26] <scott> zwarich: seems unlikely in Rust. there aren't expressions in types
[04:06:32] <scott> could happen in the future
[04:06:50] <zwarich> scott: there's also a good chance that something in the handwritten parser is accidentally doing disambiguation from what you would expect the grammar to be
[04:06:52] <scott> C++ has things like foo<(1>2)> being value
[04:06:55] <scott> valid*
[04:07:02] <zwarich> that's pretty common in handwritten parsers
[04:07:19] <Mutabah> zwarich: mrustc is my rust parser (an alternative implementation)
[04:07:34] <Mutabah> zwarich: That said, it's also hand-crafted, but I was working on a BNF for rust
[04:07:57] <Mutabah> [Might work on that again when I finish this little sprint on mrustc)
[04:08:29] <zwarich> I'm fooling around a lot with error recovery in my parser generator at the moment
[04:09:32] <zwarich> error recovery was such a hot problem in the days of batch processing :P
