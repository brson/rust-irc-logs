[03:44:56] <cmr> it does linking a bit weird right now, so anything using glfw-rs needs to link to glfw explicitly.

[04:02:37] <depp> jsonnull: libnative and libgreen are the 1:1 and M:N threading libraries
[04:02:49] <dbaupp> jsonnull: full explanation: http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/master/guide-runtime.html#implementations-of-the-runtime
[04:03:01] <jsonnull> Ooh, thanks!
[04:04:04] <jsonnull> What's the difference between using one of these libraries versus spawn { }? Sorry, I'm new to all this.
[04:04:21] <dbaupp> nothing
[04:04:31] <dbaupp> spawn calls into libnative or libgreen
[04:04:39] <dbaupp> depending on which context you're in when you call it
[04:04:42] <jsonnull> Brilliant.
[04:05:08] <dbaupp> (i.e. if you're in a libnative task, a default spawn will spawn new libnative ones, if you're in a libgreen one, then you get new libgreen ones.)
[04:05:41] <Amaranth> Ah, the timer is only used for a frame limiter
[04:05:47] * Amaranth comments that bit out
[04:07:03] <Amaranth> Alright apitrace is definitely able to trace calls through gl-rs so something is going wrong with rust-sdl2 making it apparently not give valid function pointers to gl-rs and also make gl-rs not complain about that
[04:07:24] <jsonnull> Is the default still libgreen?
[04:07:33] <dbaupp> for the moment, yes

[05:09:16] <bjz> csherratt: tbh, not personally, but h3r3tic has, along with others
[05:09:51] <bjz> csherratt: have you found some bugs?
[05:15:38] <jsonnull> Would writing a task scheduler and message system that distributes tasks across threads for each processor core using libnative not be the same as spawning tasks with libgreen?
[05:15:56] <cmr> jsonnull: what are you going to use for io?
[05:16:13] <cmr> the biggest driver behind libgreen's design is the limitations of libuv.
[05:16:18] <dbaupp> jsonnull: that's essentially what libgreen is (modulo managing IO etc. too)
[05:17:21] <jsonnull> cmr: I'm not sure I understand the question.
[05:17:57] <cmr> jsonnull: it's relatively simple to write a simple task scheduler with messaging, but when you factor in that you need to do io on some of those threads some of the time, it becomes a lot more complex.
[05:19:49] <csherratt> bjz: the rotation is happening after the translation, which is not what I would expect for a camera.
[05:20:04] <bjz> csherratt: ack
[05:20:28] <bjz> csherratt: could you send an example?
[05:20:56] <jsonnull> cmr: Wouldn't I set an thread affinity for IO so that even with blocking part of the time, other tasks would be effectively using (M-1):N threading.
[05:21:13] <cmr> jsonnull: of course, if you're using blocking io.
[05:21:46] <jsonnull> Is that possible with libgreen, or would that be a good reason to write my own scheduler with libnative?
[05:22:09] <cmr> it's not possible with libgreen, at least not right now, due to its deep ties with libuv.
[05:22:26] <cmr> I think it'd be a good reason to try and *extend* libgreen to gain some freedom in that direction.
[05:23:00] <jsonnull> So if I have blocking io, I could potentially have hangs in my application using libgreen? That's awful.
[05:23:15] <cmr> you don't do blocking io with libgreen, though.
[05:23:30] <cmr> std::io goes through the runtime, which for libgreen handles things correctly.
[05:23:39] <cmr> but that's a libuv implementation detail
[05:23:52] <cmr> the scheduler in libgreen could theoreritically handle non-libuv io just fine.
[05:24:48] <jsonnull> Alright, I see.
[05:29:16] <csherratt> bjz, I'll see what I can do.
[05:29:33] <bjz> csherratt: thank you!
[05:29:53] <bjz> csherratt: I'd love to see what you do with cgmath
[05:29:56] <jsonnull> Would it be possible to use rust-sfml with green, or does the FFI in that module restrict me to using native?
[05:30:09] *** Joins: leroux (leroux@moz-421CF1E4.dsl.bell.ca)
[05:30:50] <Amaranth> jsonnull: You have to use native so you can get sfml calls on the main thread
[05:31:11] <Amaranth> You could also use libgreen to spawn tasks for other things but all interaction with sfml must be on the main thread
[05:31:53] <jsonnull> Amaranth: How would that be done, roughly?
[05:32:15] <jsonnull> Could I have a dedicated native thread and use libgreen with "the rest"?
[05:32:18] <Amaranth> Instead of using the std::task API you'd use native::task and green::task iirc
[05:32:36] <jsonnull> Amaranth: That's awesome.

[05:32:58] <Amaranth> I haven't read the email in a while but it laid it all out
[05:34:05] <Amaranth> Of course I'm not sure what M:N threads are useful for unless you're spawning a _ton_ of really short lived tasks or writing a web server (which is basically the same thing)

[05:34:46] <csherratt> Amaranth: for gamedev they might be useful for doing async logic.
[05:35:37] <jsonnull> Yep, a async game logic.
[05:36:04] <Amaranth> One thing to keep in mind is that M:N threads are cooperatively scheduled
[05:36:10] <jsonnull> What's that?
[05:36:28] <Amaranth> Unless you "block" in an IO call your task will dominate the kernel thread until it completes, shutting out all other tasks
[05:36:37] <csherratt> render, audio ect will all be sync. 
[05:36:38] <Amaranth> Unless you make a call to the scheduler to give up control
[05:37:06] <csherratt> but AI logic, ect that needs quite a bit of independence might be useful.
[05:37:41] <Amaranth> Yeah driving updates to an ECS in parallel seems like it would probably be a good fit for M:N tasks
[05:37:54] <jsonnull> I'm not following, sorry. :/
[05:38:09] <Amaranth> Oh, sorry, ECS = Entity Component System
[05:38:46] <jsonnull> No, before, regarding blocking.
[05:39:19] <Amaranth> Alright, you know how normally your kernel will preempt your program after some time and schedule something else to run?
[05:39:43] <jsonnull> Okay, sure.
[05:39:55] <Amaranth> That doesn't happen with M:N (green) tasks, they own the kernel thread they get run on until they finish
[05:40:12] <jsonnull> When is that a problem? For long tasks?
[05:40:22] <Amaranth> Right
[05:40:40] <Amaranth> Otherwise your M:N threading model collapses to an inefficient 1:1 threading model :)
[05:41:41] <jsonnull> What I'm currently thinking about is having dead time on different cores from running the same tasks repeatedly on a 1:1 model. The idea being that I write a scheduler (or use green) that distributes them a bit better.
[05:41:48] <Amaranth> Calling to IO functions give up control while they're "blocked" (implemented in the runtime as non-blocking IO) but otherwise if you spin up a task calculating prime numbers or something it'll own that thread until you make a call to the scheduler giving up access
[05:42:31] <jsonnull> That makes sense.
[05:43:04] <Amaranth> iirc Go gets around this by putting a wrapper around all function calls that will randomly call the scheduler function before calling the actual function you wanted
[05:43:45] <Amaranth> Even then a long calculation that doesn't involve any function calls or IO would have the same problem
[05:44:05] <csherratt> yeah, Go with blocking IO uses courier threads.
[05:45:01] <h3r3tic> csherratt: here's my camera module done iwth cgmath if you're interested: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/09f7dd551bdaee976fd2
[05:46:28] <jsonnull> So if I called the scheduler at intervals, I'd be fine?
[05:48:05] <Amaranth> Sure, or just don't have long running tasks
[05:48:12] <jsonnull> Perfect.
[05:48:40] <csherratt> h3r3tic: you are manually doing a translate matrix?
