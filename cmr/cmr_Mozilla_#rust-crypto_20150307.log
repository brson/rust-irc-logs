[18:56:52] <Ilari> One would think that it was about the TLS attacks lately (Oh, Mono joins the list of vulernable stacks), nope it is about SNI.
[18:58:57] <Ilari> bascule: Well, the basic problem with both is that encrypting/authenticating with asymmetric key is easy. What is hard is determing what trust to place on the key.
[19:02:53] <Ilari> And in fact, the only other use of X.509 in TLS besides establishing "trust" is transporting host key.

[23:35:17] <Ilari> bascule: Also, have any ideas for TLS guys attempting to do 0RTT? :-)
[23:36:31] <bascule> oh god
[23:36:33] <bascule> don't?
[23:37:23] <bascule> 0RTT seems shaky when done by experts in a de novo protocol
[23:37:29] <bascule> or at least, insanely complicated
[23:37:52] <eternaleye> Personally, I think TNG might have gotten the right idea with their cross-layer negotiation protocol idea
[23:38:39] <eternaleye> If the protection is at the datagram layer, and the negotiation of the semantics isn't sensitive, it can be "first flight" with reduced protections. Then any application data is fully PFS
[23:38:59] <Ilari> Well, unauthenticated one doesn't seem THAT difficult. But try to authenticate, and I really wonder if there is any way that isn't vulernable to either replay or KCI.
[23:39:28] <bascule> eternaleye: Kenton Varda is working on a protocol with 0RTT introductions
[23:39:42] <eternaleye> bascule: Have you read the Tng papers?
[23:39:43] <bascule> I showed him Noise, Axolotl, and MinimaLT in addition to CurveCP
[23:39:49] <bascule> umm, no?
[23:39:49] <eternaleye> bascule: from Yale's dedis group
[23:39:52] <bascule> oh
[23:39:57] <bascule> I have seen that group and Dissent
[23:40:16] <eternaleye> bascule: They're worth a read - splitting up the Transport layer (of OSI) further has some nice ramifications
[23:40:29] <bascule> sure let's switch to SCTP lol
[23:40:39] <Ilari> But even unauthenticated one could be useful for protocol banners and like...
[23:41:25] <eternaleye> bascule: That's actually a big thing
[23:41:30] <eternaleye> bascule: SCTP is undeployable
[23:41:41] <eternaleye> bascule: Tng is basically a framework for making that not the case
[23:41:49] <eternaleye> bascule: For future protocols and such
[23:42:02] <tiffany> the reference implementation of sctp is pretty awful from my experience
[23:42:05] <eternaleye> bascule: (also for having a _sane_ place to put crypto)
[23:42:28] <eternaleye> http://dedis.cs.yale.edu/2009/tng/
[23:42:34] <Ilari> I wondered what happened to IETF TAPS... But then noticed it is a WG now.
[23:43:16] <eternaleye> bascule: Basically, crypto over transport semantics sucks, because of HOL blocking and such. Crypto under the transport layer entirely sucks because... well, IPSEC
[23:43:43] <eternaleye> bascule: And crypto _in_ the transport layer sucks because then you need to create new semantics.
[23:43:51] <Ilari> Basically, there seems to be exactly two deployable "layer-4" protocols: TCP and UDP.
[23:44:24] <eternaleye> bascule: Tng splitting the transport layer into sublayers makes a lot of sense, allowing you the deployability of UDP (or TCP, with minimal stack changes) and the flexibility that's needed.
[23:45:12] <eternaleye> (They have a way of out-of-order delivery that's wire-compatible with TLS over TCP, and then can use that - see their 'Minion' papers)
[23:46:28] <eternaleye> But basically, they split it into 'endpoint layer' (what service are you talking to), 'flow layer' (congestion control), 'isolation layer' (integrity/authenticity/confidentiality), and 'semantics layer' (stream vs datagram, single-channel vs multichannel, etc)
[23:47:11] <eternaleye> UDP is endpoint-layer, DCCP is endpoint layer and flow layer, DTLS over DCCP would be the bottom three layers (as would their out-of-order TLS minion), etc.
[23:47:29] <Ilari> The most basic (insecure! due to some subtle issues) implementation of 0RTT would be to send asymmetrically encrypted (encrypting with Curve25519, sure that's possible) data blob in initial hello.
[23:47:29] <eternaleye> Or you could do a pure-CC protocol over UDP for the bottom two, or whatever
[23:48:25] <eternaleye> Ilari: What about half-ecdhe? Public server key, random client key, and for the reply the server sends a random key and it ratchets up to fully ecdhe?
[23:48:52] <bascule> eternaleye: yeah I mentioned SCTP for the lulz
[23:49:16] <eternaleye> bascule: Sure, but the lulz are kind of saddening, and that's exactly what Tng is trying to fix.
[23:49:25] <bascule> I'll have to look at it
[23:49:39] <bascule> does it actually do anything interesting?
[23:49:48] <eternaleye> bascule: Yes, very much so.
[23:49:52] <bascule> versus QUIC/Noise/CurveCP/MinimaLT
[23:50:00] <bascule> differentiating characteristic?
[23:50:01] <eternaleye> bascule: It's a framework for describing them
[23:50:03] <Ilari> eternaleye: Well, basically half-ecdhe is the way one asymmetrically encrypts using DHFs.
[23:50:09] <eternaleye> bascule: It's not itself a protocol
[23:50:13] <bascule> that's not really selling me on anything
[23:50:16] <bascule> in fact, that's horrifying me
[23:50:32] <eternaleye> bascule: Just read the papers.
[23:50:32] <eternaleye> bascule: They're not long.
[23:50:35] <bascule> heh k
[23:50:44] <bascule> but you seriously can't give me a tl;dr of why I should care?
[23:50:55] <eternaleye> bascule: Basically, it's an attempt to solve the deployability problem for sane primitives.
[23:51:01] <bascule> o_O
[23:51:09] <bascule> still not really helping?
[23:51:18] <bascule> there are protocols built on UDP and others built on TCP
[23:51:26] <bascule> both of them have deployable candidates
[23:51:29] <eternaleye> bascule: Yes, and they have to reinvent a lot of wheels.
[23:51:32] <bascule> they need more standardization work
[23:51:43] <bascule> and this thing... doesn't... somehow?
[23:51:56] <bascule> don't get me wrong Dissent looked cool on the surface
[23:52:00] <eternaleye> bascule: It modularizes some things that really need modularized.
[23:52:06] <bascule> I'm not sure I think DCNETs are really practical
[23:52:09] <eternaleye> bascule: This is unrelated to Dissent.
[23:52:13] <bascule> like my first question is: does it work on mobile?
[23:52:14] <eternaleye> bascule: Completely unconnected.
[23:52:17] <bascule> ok
[23:52:22] <bascule> I guess I should just read the paper
[23:52:35] <bascule> but the fact you can't give me a tl;dr isn't exactly motivating me to like it, heh
[23:52:36] <eternaleye> bascule: It's just part of the same research group, which is for decentralized and distributed systems as a general topic.
[23:53:00] <eternaleye> bascule: Basically, the 'transport layer' conflates too many things.
[23:53:05] <eternaleye> bascule: Tng is an attempt to fix that.
[23:53:19] *** Joins: erickt (erickt@moz-njt.vqi.14.76.IP)
[23:53:30] <bascule> sure, so are like 2 of the 4 protocols I just mentioned?
[23:53:31] <eternaleye> bascule: It's pointing out that the current definition of 'transport layer' sucks ass and isn't very useful
[23:53:39] <bascule> how is it doing that better than QUIC?
[23:53:39] <eternaleye> bascule: No, they aren't.
[23:53:49] <bascule> there are plenty of reasons not to like QUIC
[23:53:50] <eternaleye> bascule: They're new protocols that are _at_ the transport layer.
[23:53:50] <bascule> lol k
[23:53:55] <bascule> wtf
[23:53:59] <bascule> like not TCP or UDP?
[23:54:06] <bascule> weren't you just talking about deployability?
[23:54:07] <eternaleye> bascule: Ugh.
[23:54:08] <eternaleye> No.
[23:54:10] <bascule> lol
[23:54:27] <bascule> either I'm doing a bad job of understanding, or you're doing a bad job of explaining ;)
[23:54:35] <bascule> I should just read the paper and get back to you
[23:54:45] <eternaleye> bascule: Part of it is that it's not especially suited for pithy IRC-length description
[23:54:56] <bascule> so question
[23:54:57] <bascule> TCP
[23:54:58] <bascule> UDP
[23:54:59] <bascule> other
[23:54:59] <eternaleye> bascule: The problems with the _term_ 'transport layer' are deep and ingrained
[23:55:01] <bascule> which one?
[23:55:07] <eternaleye> bascule: 'mu'
[23:55:13] <bascule> it totally reinvents layer 4
[23:55:17] <eternaleye> bascule: Tng is not a protocol.
[23:55:18] <bascule> is that the answer?
[23:55:18] <Ilari> Also, IPv6 is bit screwed up in a way that seemingly makes deploying new "layer-4" protocols difficult, even if the path is supposedly "clean" (e.g. no NAT).
[23:55:24] <eternaleye> bascule: Nor does it reinvent layer 4.
[23:55:35] <bascule> k I'll just read the paper
[23:55:58] <bascule> anyway blah blah blah transport layer is fucked we all know
[23:56:29] <bascule> that is why SSH and SPDY and other such protocols have their own framing/muxing primitives for exposing multiple virtual channels over TCP
[23:56:38] <eternaleye> Precisely.
[23:56:40] <Ilari> Specifically, IPv6 mixes the number space for extension headers and protocols.
[23:56:54] <Ilari> And now pretty much HTTP/2.
[23:57:09] <eternaleye> Anyway, there are a lot of things people do today that break the guarantees of protocols
[23:57:12] <bascule> eternaleye: which paper is it you want me to read exactly?
[23:57:20] <eternaleye> bascule: Lemme check
[23:57:25] <bascule> and really, I'm kinda like CapTP or GTFO ;)
[23:57:29] <Ilari> That it hasn't been copyedited yet hasn't stopped implementations (with final version codes no less).
[23:57:38] <eternaleye> Performance-enhancing proxies break TCP fate-sharing
[23:57:43] <eternaleye> stuff like that
[23:58:00] <eternaleye> By separating out the flow layer, you can terminate that without breaking the semantics layer
[23:58:03] <eternaleye> Which is enforced by the isolation layer
[23:58:27] <tiffany> I'm working on a project using a custom layer over UDP
[23:58:32] <bascule> you're using a lot of words
[23:58:46] <bascule> is there any actual OSI-style taxonomy of what they mean?
[23:58:47] <eternaleye> bascule: Breaking Up the Transport Logjam, workshop paper.
[23:58:51] <eternaleye> bascule: Yes
[23:59:06] <bascule> so like
[23:59:11] <eternaleye> bascule: Basically, they introduce layers 4.1 through 4.4
[23:59:12] <bascule> what isn't QUIC doing that you want?
[23:59:30] <bascule> besides a shitty implementation
[23:59:41] <eternaleye> bascule: No, it's  not
[23:59:52] <eternaleye> (what I want)
[23:59:55] <Ilari> I think WebRTC actually uses SCTP over DTLS over UDP. :-)
[23:59:57] <bascule> because... ?
