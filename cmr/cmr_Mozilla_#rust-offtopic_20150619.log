[00:30:46] <Tiffany> eddyb: are they actually going to show it in this video
[00:30:55] <eddyb> don't think so :/
[00:31:00] <Tiffany> ugh
[00:31:04] <Tiffany> is there somewhere I can see it?
[00:31:16] <cmr> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgakdcEzVwg
[00:31:18] <cmr> yes.
[00:31:26] <cmr> obviously a simulation
[00:31:36] <cmr> since you need them on your face to actually experience it.
[00:32:12] <cmr> I'm not sure if it was live or pre-recorded, or whether they displayed the same thing the hololens would have, or what.
[00:32:51] <eddyb> oh I think I saw a bit of that on the cynical redub
[00:33:32] * WindowsBunny burps
[00:33:55] <eddyb> cmr: is that not properly sync'd?
[00:33:57] <Tiffany> it had to have been live cmr
[00:34:02] <Tiffany> since the guy was saying the stuff on stage
[00:34:08] <Tiffany> well
[00:34:15] <eddyb> or are they moving their mouths weird?
[00:34:18] <Tiffany> it'd have been a lot of work to keep it all lined up, otherwise
[00:34:22] <Tiffany> anyway, I wonder how it's implemented
[00:34:32] <Tiffany> how much do they run off the original minecraft engine, or do they use the xbox engine?
[00:34:39] <Tiffany> that renderer updates chunks really damn fast
[00:34:41] <cmr> Isn't that a let's player too?
[00:34:47] <Tiffany> they must be running it off a super beefy system
[00:34:52] <Tiffany> cmr: who?
[00:34:56] <cmr> the guy in the hololens
[00:35:45] <Havvy> eddyb:  I think it was sarcasm.
[00:36:01] <Tiffany> I don't recognize him, cmr
[00:36:05] <cmr> ok
[00:36:09] <cmr> I thought I recognized the voice.
[00:36:09] <Tiffany> the video lists him as being from Microsoft Studios
[00:37:09] <cmr> it's pretty incredible tech though
[00:37:17] <cmr> fuck the rift and leap motion
[00:37:17] <eddyb> their voices are also quite... emotion-less
[00:37:30] <cmr> eddyb: I mean, obviously. It was staged.
[00:37:37] <cmr> And they're not actors.
[00:37:44] <eddyb> q_q
[00:38:01] <eddyb> get a random youtuber and they might perform better. idk
[00:38:06] <Tiffany> yeah, lydia works at mojang, as a community manager or something
[00:38:24] <Tiffany> and saxs is probably the project manager for the minecraft holo lens project or something

[00:40:27] <eddyb> if I have a regex for a @mozilla.com email, how can I find potential matches?
[00:40:49] <cmr> what, like enumerate the language the regex recognizes?
[00:41:44] <Tiffany> there's some website which dynamically generates a full suite of test cases for any regex you punch in
[00:41:55] <Tiffany> pretty sure
[00:42:10] <eddyb> cmr: no :P
[00:42:24] <eddyb> it's in rust's AUTHORS

[00:52:14] <fmtq> well yeah 
[00:52:22] <fmtq> TPP fast track almost guaranteed to pass too 
[00:52:27] <cmr> that EU comment thing is really bad.
[00:52:42] <fmtq> that's been the status quo in almost every country except the US for years
[00:52:45] <fmtq> even in AU it has been this way 
[00:52:51] <cmr> well AU is a terrible country.
[00:52:57] <cmr> like seriously.
[00:52:58] <fmtq> sure is.
[00:52:59] <cmr> your government sucks.
[00:53:25] <fmtq> repeatedly for all time it has sucked
[00:53:29] <fmtq> it's why I'm fucking off asap 
[00:53:39] <fmtq> but at least we don't have police terrorism 
[00:53:58] <cmr> yet
[00:54:03] <aatch> New Zealand is pretty Ok. At least compared to the other English-speaking countries.
[00:54:07] <cmr> (yeah the US is pretty bad too)
[00:54:18] <fmtq> it'd be really hard to get as fucked as the US police system is 
[00:54:23] <cmr> Really what countries don't have a huge mound of issues though
[00:54:31] <fmtq> particularly since we have state police only, no county policing.
[00:54:34] <cmr> like is there honestly any reason to have hope.
[00:54:45] <fmtq> uh yes 
[00:54:50] <zwarich> cmr: the strong normalization of System F_omega
[00:54:52] <fmtq> these issues didn't just appear 
[00:54:55] <cmr> zwarich: lol.
[00:54:58] <zwarich> that's what lets me get out of bed in the morning
[00:55:01] <fmtq> the Internet gave us the capcity to be aware of ALL OF THEM
[00:55:03] <fmtq> all at the same time 
[00:55:05] <cmr> :P
[00:55:15] <fmtq> the disturbing fact is: things are better now than they have ever been in history.
[00:55:21] <fmtq> and that is a sick and disturbing thought
[00:55:25] <fmtq> because shit is still quite fucked.
[00:55:27] <aatch> The worst we have here is John Key trying to be friends with America, but we're too small for the US to care.

[00:57:01] <fmtq> you idiots and your voting for the conservatives.
[00:57:07] <fmtq> not the Conservatives
[00:57:09] <fmtq> nobody voted for them
[00:57:10] <fmtq> lel
[00:57:25] <aatch> fmtq, you mean National, and I didn't vote for them.
[00:57:41] <fmtq> did you vote for the fat german criminal 
[00:57:51] <aatch> fmtq, fuck no!
[00:58:01] <fmtq> did you vote for his maori friend that he caused to lose

[01:05:03] <eddyb> Bucharest is not on the map
[01:05:06] <fmtq> and Beijing!
[01:05:24] <eddyb> fmtq: they seem relatively correct
[01:05:31] <eddyb> it's just the background which is the wrong scale
[01:05:43] <eddyb> or am I being ignorant here?
[01:05:43] <c74d> …dangit, I misread “Budapest”
[01:05:48] <fmtq> eddyb: I thought that
[01:05:51] <fmtq> but no
[01:06:10] <eddyb> wait, is it the projection?

[01:06:28] <fmtq> no it can't be.
[01:06:38] <fmtq> some are just completely wrong.
[01:06:43] <eddyb> hmpf
[01:06:44] <c74d> it thinks Zürich is in Ukraine, though
[01:06:44] <fmtq> Helsinki is FAAAAR away from wherei s houdl be
[01:07:19] <c74d> Oslo is in Sweden, Helsinki is in Russia…
[01:07:36] <eddyb> are they correct relative to each-other?
[01:07:45] <fmtq> no.
[01:07:56] <fmtq> Madrid is approximately correct for instnace.
[01:08:10] <fmtq> as is barcelona
[01:08:12] <eddyb> I don't expect the distorsion to be uniform
[01:08:27] <fmtq> ...
[01:08:29] <c74d> nope! look at Paris, Geneva, and Brussels
[01:08:34] <eddyb> those two are also the closest ones to the most vertical meridian
[01:08:42] <eddyb> well, porto and lisbon are
[01:08:53] <fmtq> paris is wrongly placed.
[01:08:57] <fmtq> by quite a distance.
[01:09:02] <fmtq> as is geneva
[01:09:08] <fmtq> whereas rome and milan are approximately correct.
[01:09:22] * eddyb scratches his beard
[01:09:43] <fmtq> also.
[01:09:46] <fmtq> amsterdam
[01:09:49] <fmtq> should be immediately above brussels.
[01:09:54] <fmtq> it should not be to the right.

[02:49:09] <ChrisMorgan> XMPPwocky: what would you desire it to be? SVG?
[02:50:21] <XMPPwocky> yep
[02:51:25] <XMPPwocky> i wonder what that howsecureismypassword means by "a desktop PC"
[02:51:39] <XMPPwocky> like, CPU? multi-threaded CPU? GPU? multi-GPU?
[02:52:01] <XMPPwocky> what hash algorithm is that even for
[02:52:24] <Quxxy> An IBM with 386 or compatible Cyrix
[02:52:55] * WindowsBunny drinks the entire bath and then nibbles on Quxxy's ear
[02:53:18] <Quxxy> WindowsBunny: I made a macro that takes my small library's compile time from ~10 seconds to ~5 minutes
[02:53:43] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: nice!
[02:53:47] <aatch> Quxxy, does it generate lots of integer literals?
[02:53:49] <ChrisMorgan> c74d: howsecureismypassword is dealing with characters, but in practice a Unicode password on the web will probably be treated as UTF-8.
[02:54:03] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: Although it would be easier to just have a build.rs that sleeps for 5 minutes
[02:54:05] <Quxxy> aatch: That's an... *oddly specific* thing to ask
[02:54:10] <Quxxy> Yes
[02:54:12] <Quxxy> It does
[02:54:19] <Quxxy> *Why do you ask?*
[02:54:23] <aatch> Quxxy, it *is* relevant though. Since that's probably why.
[02:54:43] <Quxxy> What?  How does generating integer literals blow out the compile time? :S
[02:54:52] <aatch> Quxxy, if you can pin them down to a specific type, your compile times will improve again.
[02:54:56] <niconii> Quxxy: it's a bug with type inference
[02:55:01] <Quxxy> Oooooooooh
[02:55:02] <ChrisMorgan> I should really try an experiment where I set all of my passwords to — and see if they ever get cracked.
[02:55:04] <aatch> Quxxy, quadradic behaviour in type inference.
[02:55:12] <WindowsBunny> Good thing my integer literals don't do type inference
[02:55:17] <aatch> Quxxy, it should be fixed eventually, but until then.
[02:55:27] <Quxxy> Will (1 as u8) suffice?
[02:55:31] <WindowsBunny> except for some of the macroish ones
[02:55:54] <aatch> Quxxy, if you can manage a suffix, that'd probably work best, but that might work well too.
[02:56:18] <Quxxy> I can't do a suffix without adding *more* recursion, and I've already blown the recursion limit

[03:14:55] <Quxxy> It also listed the time in days, hours, seconds, and milliseconds
[03:15:01] <Quxxy> Minutes just seemed the most useful measure :P
[03:15:26] <niconii> ahh
[03:16:34] <aatch> Quxxy, isn't that about the same as before? 0.2 * 60 = 12
[03:17:13] <Quxxy> That's not counting code-gen, because the new expansion has a type error

[12:36:33] <fmtq> Tiffany: you seem to forget it's game servers.
[12:36:43] <fmtq> Games don't matter for security.
[12:37:04] <fmtq> And i know, one simple baseline level of logic would be enough to solve this crap
[12:37:26] <fmtq> They seem to actively prove it doesn't matter by actively working harder to make things insecure lol
[12:38:15] <Tiffany> somewhat amazingly mojang has actually been fixing security vulnerabilities lately
[12:38:20] <Tiffany> they still use incredibly fucked up crypto
[12:38:26] <fmtq> Java!
[12:38:35] <Tiffany> (AES in CFB-8 mode with no IV)
[12:38:48] <Tobba> Tiffany: lol, bad crypto is the least of game server worries, usually
[12:39:01] <Tobba> for example, source still lets you download arbitrary files
[12:39:34] <Tiffany> if you have chosen ciphertext and a decryption oracle you can create a chosen plaintext in a very small number of operations
[12:39:48] <Tiffany> they use no MAC, in case that wasn't clear
[12:40:05] <Tiffany> yeah source is dumb
[12:40:19] <Tobba> better yet, they still let you load arbitrary modules on the client
[12:40:32] <Tobba> but you can't load anything that doesn't end in .dll, which it doesn't let you upload
[12:41:18] <Tobba> ignoring all the massively trivial ways to bypass this
[12:41:30] <Tiffany> there was a security vulnerability in minecraft recently
[12:41:42] <Tiffany> they allowed someone in creative mode to place signs with arbitrary content
[12:41:54] <Tobba> oh dear.
[12:41:59] <Tiffany> this wasn't a problem until they let you put json in signs
[12:42:01] <Tiffany> with like commands
[12:42:03] <Tiffany> that run as op
[12:42:14] <Tiffany> so you can just place a sign to op yourself using a really simple modded client
[12:43:00] <Tiffany> they fixed it almost immediately
[12:43:24] <Tiffany> there's lots of very large minecraft game servers which pull in a bunch of money, so that's important
[12:44:27] <Tiffany> I wonder if someone asks about it if mojang would change their crypto, seeing how they're on a security fix spree
[12:44:38] <Tiffany> I mean, they use bouncycastle
[12:44:57] <Tiffany> oh, but they encrypt the entire TCP stream, instead of individual messages
[12:45:02] <Tiffany> which makes authenticated encryption tricky
[12:45:21] <Tobba> communication with the server is encrypted now?
[12:45:30] <Tiffany> it's been encrypted for a long time

[12:47:22] <Tiffany> it encrypts the previous 16 bytes of ciphertext to generate 1 byte of keystream, which is xored with the next byte
[12:47:29] <Tiffany> it takes a 16 byte IV, which minecraft of course sets to 0
[12:49:12] <Tiffany> about the only reason I can think of for minecraft using CFB-8 is that any bit flips only mangle 16 bytes of plaintext
[12:49:19] <Tiffany> so it recovers from errors

[13:07:20] <Tiffany> and it's still so slow that it's pointless
[13:07:56] <Tiffany> I just checked to make sure and it does operate on ciphertext, tobba
[13:08:15] <Tiffany> it's related to CBC

[13:08:25] <cmr> Tobba: why? plenty of block modes do.
[13:08:41] <Tiffany> instead of having it as input to the block cipher, it's xored with the keystream
[13:08:53] <Tiffany> CFB-8 is then basically changing the block output size to 1 byte and using a sliding window

[13:22:06] <benh> zofrex: if you use $PASSWORD, isn't it at least gonna be visible in /proc while it's used in the command line?
[13:23:22] <zofrex> huh why didn't I think of that
[13:23:32] <zofrex> good point!
[13:23:47] <zofrex> Tiffany: I have no idea. But it did occur to me recently that the odds they didn't screw it up somehow are very low.
[13:24:09] <Tiffany> I don't suppose they document the crypto they use
[13:24:13] <Tiffany> because that would be too honest
[13:24:17] <zofrex> seems like an avenue ripe for exploration
[13:24:20] <zofrex> I doubt it
[13:24:23] <benh> It seems fairly hard to screw up though?
[13:24:31] <Tiffany> you'd be surprised benh
[13:24:39] <Tiffany> people are quite good at fucking up crypto
[13:24:50] <Tiffany> and a lot of crypto libraries still default to ECB
[13:24:51] <benh> you can just send the single key over the same channel a week later!
[13:25:38] <zofrex> "Steam uses 256-bit AES encryption in lots of places throughout the client and within our own servers. It protects your personal cloud data, blocks unauthorized downloads of games, and keeps hackers from capturing your Steam account details or reading your group chat text. (Some of these features use custom protocols similar in principle to SSL/TLS, but adapted for our own needs.)"

[13:26:03] <Tiffany> of course they don't mention which mode they use
[13:26:05] <zofrex> "custom protocols similar in principle to TLS" is the scariest thing I've read all week

[21:22:28] <Tobba> lol fuck you LLVM
[21:23:04] <Tobba> using offset() in this specific position causes it to do behave as if the offset is 0
[21:23:23] <Tobba> *probably* because what I'm doing is technically UB, kind of, ish, but it shouldn't even be able to detect that
[21:23:38] <Tiffany> what are you doing that is UB?
[21:23:55] <Tobba> calling .offset on invalid pointers
[21:24:04] <Tobba> (potentially invalid)
[21:26:17] <Tobba> autoderef is also being fucky as hell
[21:26:53] <cmr> the rules for gepi are extremely strict.
[21:29:23] <Tobba> cmr: I'm not sure how exactly it sniffs up me offseting a null pointer (which appears at runtime) and goes AHA! UB! and proceeds to break the code
[21:29:25] <Tobba> it's a fucking *addition*
[21:30:00] <cmr> Tobba: The rules are not only "can't be null", but also must be in the bounds of the object you are pointing at.
[21:30:30] <Tobba> well yeah
[21:30:40] <Tobba> I'm just amazed it's somehow sniffing up the UB and spawning nasal demons
[21:30:47] <cmr> it's good at what it does :p
[21:30:49] <Tobba> even though it should be *impossible* to spot the UB at compile time
[21:31:08] <cmr> do you have an IR snippet?
[21:31:13] <cmr> I'm curious what it is.
[21:31:30] <Tobba> let me make this work first, but the function is convoluted as hell
[21:31:38] <Tobba> actually it's easily the worst thing in this entire project
[21:31:56] <cmr> lol
[21:32:06] <Tobba> it clips intersecting regions in a memory map
[21:32:07] <c74d> are you writing directly in LLVM assembly?

[21:32:26] <Tobba> it's O(n^2) as fuck, is incredibly hard to reason about and has 5 unique cases
[21:34:10] <cmr> so not trying to trivialize what you're doing but have you considered an interval tree
[21:34:36] <Tobba> without an allocator?
[21:35:01] <cmr> that may be challenging.
[21:35:03] <cmr> carry on
[21:35:05] <cmr> :P
[21:35:26] <Tobba> it'd be way nicer if the intervals were always sorted, but then it would be O(scary)
[21:35:56] <Tobba> so now it just overzealously tests every interval against eachother
