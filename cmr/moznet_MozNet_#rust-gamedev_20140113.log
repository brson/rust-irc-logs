[00:12:43] <csherratt> has anyone come up with a good way to split ownership of the window in glfw?
[00:17:40] *** Joins: samx (sami@moz-D9DA5773.dyn.optonline.net)
[00:18:27] <bjz> csherratt: you mean access it from different tasks?
[00:18:35] <bjz> for example?
[00:18:39] <csherratt> yeah
[00:18:42] <bjz> ie. cloning it
[00:18:44] <bjz> ugh
[00:18:55] <bjz> we would need the comm update
[00:19:03] <bjz> with channels
[00:19:41] <bjz> I will have to get back to that - so many things to do
[00:20:15] <bjz> btw, I added some issues regarding FindGlfw.txt and documenting the process of linking
[00:20:22] <csherratt> is that safe? I imagine there is some shared data in the Window object itself. I know glfw-rs just holds onto a pointer.
[00:21:23] <bjz> glfw allows you to call quite a few of the window functions from other threads
[00:21:42] <bjz> but you would have to handle knowing if the window is destroyed
[00:21:51] <csherratt> hmm
[00:22:26] <bjz> there could be a channel specifically devoted to sending out a message to all the window handles saying 'this is now destroyed'
[00:22:30] <csherratt> the render thread pretty much just needs to be able to make the context current, and do a frame buffer swap.
[00:23:22] *** Quits: samx (sami@moz-D9DA5773.dyn.optonline.net) (Quit: This computer has gone to sleep)
[00:23:48] <bjz> this would also be of use for functions like, 'get_current_context' which I can't currently implement
[00:24:09] <bjz> due to Window having a destructor
[00:24:16] <csherratt> I thought there was some annoyingness with windows when it comes to input handling?
[00:24:35] <bjz> like, callbacks?
[00:25:14] <csherratt> I recall running into it when doing opengl work with SDL
[00:25:32] <csherratt> SDL_pollevents had to be done on the main thread
[00:25:39] <bjz> ah yeah
[00:26:02] <csherratt> well on windows it did. On linux it work right
[00:26:24] <cmr> bjz: r? https://github.com/bjz/noise-rs/pull/5
[00:26:48] <bjz> \o/
[00:27:04] <bjz> should do that for all the libs
[00:27:09] <bjz> :)
[00:27:44] <csherratt> I am thinking of open sourcing my work just so I can use travis. I <3 travis.
[00:27:48] <bjz> heh
[00:27:53] <bjz> it's so good
[00:28:02] <cmr> it's not so good on my netbook
[00:28:09] <bjz> :(
[00:28:15] <cmr> the app is super slow and it assumes a minimum screen width :(
[00:28:53] <csherratt> there is a travis app?
[00:29:13] <cmr> the web app
[00:29:33] <csherratt> ah.
[00:30:28] <csherratt> Things that annoy me. Sites that assume they can be wider then 1024 pixels, and people posing mobile links to reddit.
[00:30:58] <cmr> bjz: so you're basically the most prolific library author right now. what would you want for https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/10041 ?
[00:31:40] <bjz> eh, hardly. I'm always procrastinating P:
[00:31:58] * bjz is so behind with everything
[00:32:01] * cmr is too
[00:33:04] <bjz> will have to think
[00:33:15] <cmr> I accomplished almost nothing over my winter break
[00:33:20] <bjz> but yeah, that would be awesome
[00:33:28] <cmr> nice to relax for once though :p
[00:33:57] <bjz> it would be best not to make it github centric
[00:34:18] <bjz> if possible
[00:39:27] <Skrylar> eh, i don't really think there is good business in sharing windows across channels
[00:40:03] <Skrylar> its common for GUI systems to run the GUI within the master thread, or at least a single thread, and most drawing APIs (DX/GL) require it
[00:42:10] <csherratt> skrylar: yeah. I know, it's just that is such a 90's convention.
[00:54:27] <Skrylar> csherratt: blame the world for using IBM instead of commodore :)
[00:55:00] <bjz> eXene would be a good one to look at: http://alleystoughton.us/eXene/index.html
[00:55:26] <bjz> rust's concurrency model closely mirrors CML
[00:55:36] <bjz> larsberg: do you know much about eXene?
[00:55:42] <Skrylar> <bitter>they're never going to upgrade subsystems in linux that make sense :)</bitter>
[00:56:31] <Skrylar> they had time to rewrite half of X between xfree and xorg, but nobody has time to make wayland work
[00:57:24] <larsberg> bjz: not as much as I'd like - basically just what's in the CML book and a few random tidbits. But John is happy to answer questions on it...
[00:57:30] <csherratt> I thought wayland was making good progress?

[01:03:47] <Skrylar> i think i'm done with sdl for the night... just finished 18 hours of tedious wrapping
[01:05:48] <Skrylar> need to add support for hashmaps to my msgpackv5 lib :\
[01:06:23] <biardjd> anyone tell me how to show rustc where the rsfml crate is hiding?
[01:06:58] <cmr> biardjd: -L
[01:07:22] <biardjd> tried that
[01:11:05] <biardjd> its installed in /usr/local/src/rust-sfml/src/rsfml
[01:11:12] <csherratt> So I think as long as the input is done on thread 1, windows support should be fine :/
[01:11:39] <biardjd> i did rustc -L /usr/local/src/rust-sfml/src/rsfml 
[01:11:46] <biardjd> is that the right directory?
[01:11:53] <csherratt> is the .so file there?
[01:12:06] <biardjd> no
[01:12:33] <csherratt> the -L needs to point to where the .so file was installed to
[01:12:51] <biardjd> i did rustpkg install and that's where it told me it put it ^0^
[01:13:22] <biardjd> i can never remember the syntax for find :(
[01:13:25] <biardjd> I'm so bad a linux
[01:14:15] <canhtak> bjardjd: just build rsfml like this from the rust-sfml folder : rustc src/rsfml/lib.rs
[01:14:18] <csherratt> find <path> -name=<name>
[01:14:23] <canhtak> and move the lib where you want

[01:35:23] <csherratt> what part of it?
[01:35:45] <biardjd> welp, first i manually installed SFML and CSFML
[01:36:21] <biardjd> then i had to come here to figure out i needed to manually build the so file
[01:36:56] <biardjd> then i had to manually download and install libGLEW1.5 because i had 1.8
