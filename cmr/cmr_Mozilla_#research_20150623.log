[00:53:50] <larsberg> nmatsakis: did you see the mail I forwarded to research-team? There is a number and email for ground transport or you can call Andrea if you don't get an answer to your mails.
[00:54:05] <nmatsakis> larsberg: yes, saw it, and I've already been in touch with them
[00:54:11] <nmatsakis> larsberg: thanks tho
[01:10:01] <aturon> Gankro: nrc: FYI, acrichto and i are here, planning to head toward reception shortly
[01:10:26] <Gankro> aturon: Aiming for 7 or earlier?
[01:10:30] <huon> aturon: (et al) isn't the reception at 7?
[01:10:50] <aturon> we figured we'd kind of meander in the direction :)
[01:10:56] <aturon> which hotels are you in?
[01:11:17] <aturon> (we're in pan pacific mountainside)

[01:12:21] <nrc> I'm at ppm too - I think all research employees are
[01:12:35] <nrc> I'm not going to head down till 7 - got a bunch of stuff to do....
[01:13:16] <aturon> huon: Gankro: seems like aiming for 7 makes the most sense
[01:13:49] <Gankro> aturon: I could head over to you guys if you're just hanging out at PPM

[19:00:05] <nrc> it turns out what's for lunch is speaches
[19:00:15] <Gankro> Is it because you have to deal with infinite meetings. You had to make us endure your life?

[19:03:22] <Gankro> noon has come and gone
[19:03:37] <Gankro> Alas I see before me a meeting
[19:03:46] <khuey> there's several more people who are speaking too
[19:04:24] <Gankro> What fresh hell has Mozilla wrought.
[19:04:57] <Gankro> C-can we just leave?
[19:05:29] <nrc> attendance is mandatory
[19:05:53] <nrc> you can't leave until they've implanted the microchip
[19:06:19] <Gankro> Holy shit I think mozilla is stuck in an infinite loop. The main guy keeps pushing meetings into the stream while iterating.
[19:08:47] <edunham> Gankro: wow, you're right
[19:09:06] <edunham> what if we don't "welcome" the next speaker?
[19:09:46] <Gankro> This is why iterator invalidation is illegal

[19:17:13] <khuey> I'm fairly confident this is the last one
[19:17:18] * edunham is quietly dreaming of a corporate culture where it's expected that everyone stands up and walks out at the time the meeting claimed it'd end, regardless of whether the speaker feels done

[19:17:26] <Manishearth> edunham: last time it was an indeterminate amount of talks for an indeterminate amount of time

[19:20:25] <Manishearth> come early, get pizza
[19:20:54] <edunham> Manishearth: nice! and it breaks them out of a potentially infinite pizza-meeting, as well :)
[19:21:26] <Manishearth> what's bad about a potentially infinite pizza meeting?
[19:21:31] <Manishearth> emphasis on pizza
[19:21:41] <Manishearth> when there's pizza the meeting is ignored anyway
