[00:34:54] <SimonSapin> I mean for each combinations

[00:35:09] <SimonSapin> where pseudo-element is none,before,after, etc
[00:35:10] *** Quits: brson (brson@moz-BBE3ABD.mv.mozilla.com) (Ping timeout)

[00:36:36] <SimonSapin> I mean 3 origins * 2 priorities * 5 pseudo-ements (including none) = 30 SelectorMap
[00:36:55] <SimonSapin> possibly
[00:37:01] <SimonSapin> I’m not sure
[00:38:00] <jaeman> What means 3 origin? Why do we need 3 SelectorMaps for origin element?
[00:38:23] <SimonSapin> the three origins are user-agent, author, and user
[00:39:00] <SimonSapin> well, there may be up to 6 when we implement more stuff http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-cascade/#cascading-origins
[00:39:29] <SimonSapin> the two priorities are "!important" and "not !important" (a.k.a. "normal")

[00:41:53] <SimonSapin> Right now in master, Stylist has three PerOriginSelectorMap, for ua, author and user origin
[00:42:07] <SimonSapin> each of which has two SelectorMap
[00:42:16] <SimonSapin> so a total of 6
[00:42:22] <jaeman> Do you mean we need more 30 SelectorMaps for implement pseudo-element?
[00:43:01] <SimonSapin> I’m saying we could add another layer in this pattern: either have 5 Stylists, or have Stylist have 5 of a new thing that has 3 PerOriginSelectorMap
[00:43:19] <SimonSapin> where 5 is the number of supported pseudo-elements + 1
[00:43:34] <jaeman> OK.
[00:43:36] <SimonSapin> so maybe actually 3, with before and after
[00:43:51] <SimonSapin> +1 for the element itself, without any pseudo-element
[00:44:23] *** Joins: eatkinson (eatkinson@moz-C52156BC.dsl.bell.ca)
[00:45:15] <jaeman> Finally, after implementing, we have to match-job for 30 SelectorMaps for each element, isn't it?
[00:46:45] *** Quits: bholley (bholley@moz-BBE3ABD.mv.mozilla.com) (Quit: bholley)
[00:47:23] <SimonSapin> yes, assuming 4 pseudo-elements
[00:48:00] <SimonSapin> so… 18 SelectorMaps (3*3*2) if we start with ::before and ::after
[00:48:20] <SimonSapin> you can think of it as a "bucket sort"
[00:48:39] <jaeman> Do you think this implement is more efficient than that we implemented previously? We are not sure about that?
[00:49:32] <SimonSapin> I don’t know about efficiency, it’s hard to tell without trying it
[00:50:11] <SimonSapin> as I said, this is one approach and "return a big data structure for the style of the element and all of it’s pseudo-elements" is another
[00:51:04] <SimonSapin> I kind of like the "many buckets", but don’t have strong arguments either way
[00:51:25] <SimonSapin> so I recommend doing whatever you find more convenient to use in the rest of the code
[00:51:52] <SimonSapin> only, if you go with "big data structure", use a struct rather than a tuple
[00:52:52] <jaeman> OK. we will try two kind implements, your recommendation and our previous method. And we will compare two methods.
[00:53:39] <patrickkim> SimonSapin : ping 
[00:54:42] <SimonSapin> jaeman: doing both sounds like more work than necessary, I would personally just pick one. But if you want to make and publish both, that’s great

[00:58:38] <patrickkim> is | node.is_element() | ok?
[00:58:42] <pcwalton> yeah, it's fine
[00:58:54] <pcwalton> I still kind of wonder whether that information should be threaded through CSS selector matching so that the Box constructor doesn't have to walk the parent chain
[00:58:57] <pcwalton> but the old code was doing that, so
[00:58:58] <pcwalton> it's fione

[01:09:48] <jack> pcwalton: are typed arena's going to be good for DOM nodes? :)
[01:09:58] <pcwalton> jack: you can't delete from them
[01:09:58] <pcwalton> so no
[01:10:04] <pcwalton> also DOM nodes have to be in the JS heap
[01:10:09] <pcwalton> you can't delete objects in a typed arena
[01:10:13] <jack> hmm
[01:10:14] <pcwalton> they might be useful for the flow tree though.
[01:10:15] <pcwalton> well
[01:10:20] <jack> you can't delete? can't you drop the whole arena?
[01:10:23] <pcwalton> if we make a new type of an arena with a free list
[01:10:29] <pcwalton> you can drop the whole arena but that kills all the nodes
[01:10:36] <jack> flows are immutable though
[01:10:43] <pcwalton> yeah but the flow tree changes as the DOM changes.
[01:10:49] <pcwalton> and flows get reused
[01:10:52] <pcwalton> or rather, they should
[01:10:54] <jack> true

[01:11:11] <pcwalton> tiles could be
[01:11:12] <jack> why are yuo adding them? :) they seem rather specialized
[01:11:16] <pcwalton> the compiler needs them

[01:11:22] <pcwalton> that was my goal here

[01:12:25] <kmc> fwiw I now have my WM configured to float Servo always, and I'm basically fine with that solution
[01:12:38] <zmike> which test is this referencing anyway?
[01:12:48] <zmike> and what do you mean by "float" ?
[01:12:50] <kmc> i don't know if xmonad will honor the min/max hints anyway, for a tiled window
[01:13:18] *** kimundi is now known as zz_kimundi
[01:13:30] <zmike> well if the test is guaranteed to always be a fixed size then it would make sense to set size hints anyway
[01:13:57] <zmike> I would think that a competent wm would abide by them wherever possible
[01:14:12] <kmc> by "float" I mean that xmonad pulls the window out of the tiled layout and lets it overlap other windows in the manner of a "traditional" wm
[01:14:18] <zmike> ah okay
[01:14:24] <kmc> the tests in question are the ones run by "make check-ref"
[01:14:34] <kmc> which involve rendering pairs of html pages to .png files
[01:15:25] <zmike> I see

[04:53:34] <pcwalton> sure
[04:53:49] <patrickkim> <div>
[04:53:53] <patrickkim> <span style="padding:10px;background:gray;border:1px solid red;">
[04:53:57] <patrickkim> asdf
[04:54:01] <patrickkim> <a style="padding:10px;border:2px solid blue;background:yellow">
[04:54:04] <patrickkim> linklinklink
[04:54:08] <patrickkim> </a>
[04:54:10] <patrickkim> </span>
[04:54:13] <patrickkim> </div>
[04:54:31] <patrickkim> this case, "linklinklink" has couple of border
[04:54:57] <patrickkim> but struct Box has only one member for border
[04:55:03] <patrickkim> do you have any idea?
[04:55:31] <pcwalton> hmm, maybe the CSS is not being cascaded properly?
[04:55:58] <patrickkim> i tested with firefox, couple of border is drawed
[04:55:58] <pcwalton> check the ComputedValues coming out of CSS selector matching
[04:56:01] <pcwalton> right
[04:56:03] <pcwalton> it should be cascaded
[04:56:12] <pcwalton> but maybe servo is not cascading the style properly or something
[04:56:19] <patrickkim> yes, style ahas only one border
[04:56:20] *** Quits: maxli (Instantbir@moz-78AD779D.hsd1.ca.comcast.net) (Quit: maxli)
[04:56:38] <patrickkim> after the flow build, inlineflow ( textbox,textbox)
[04:56:42] <patrickkim> is it right?
[04:57:19] <patrickkim> so second textbox should has couple of border or something
[04:58:37] <pcwalton> oh right, I guess that CSS does not cascade that
[04:59:07] <patrickkim> yes, do you have any idea to resolve this case?
[04:59:25] <pcwalton> I think that perhaps struct Box should not have a border field at all and it should go to the style to compute it… but that seems unfortunate for performance because there could be arbitrarily many borders on parent styles.
[05:00:02] <patrickkim> i think the border is stored in box
[05:00:07] <pcwalton> maybe we should have a list of styles that need to be taken into account on the box
[05:00:23] <pcwalton> something like: extra_borders: Option<~[Border]>
[05:00:26] <patrickkim> because, text box can be slpit
[05:00:29] <pcwalton> because usually there is only 0 or 1 border
[05:00:38] <pcwalton> but there may be 2 or more borders
[05:00:41] <pcwalton> but that is the uncommon case
[05:00:44] <patrickkim> ok. pcwalton
[05:00:54] <pcwalton> so for performance it would be good to not allocate the ~[Border] unless there are 2 or more
[05:01:05] <patrickkim> yes.
[05:01:37] <patrickkim> and.. now, <span  style="border:1px">asdf</span>
[05:01:50] <patrickkim> the border in span not used
[05:02:21] <patrickkim> textbox "asdf" has only font style (result of cascade)
[05:02:42] <pcwalton> yeah, I guess we need a border property in the render box
[05:03:02] <patrickkim> where is proper location of
[05:03:20] <patrickkim> load border,margin,padding of parent node of "asdf"?
[05:04:27] <patrickkim> https://github.com/mozilla/servo/blob/master/src/components/main/layout/construct.rs#L417
[05:04:32] <patrickkim> how about this line
[05:04:35] <pcwalton> it'll be in construct.rs
[05:04:48] <pcwalton> yes, that looks like the right place
[05:04:51] <pcwalton> a separate function would be good
[05:05:01] <pcwalton> to avoid making `build_boxes_for_nonreplaced_inline_content` larger
[05:05:13] <pcwalton> I'd call it `propagate_borders()` or something
[05:05:57] <patrickkim> ok pcwalton
[05:06:01] <patrickkim> thank you!
[05:06:06] <pcwalton> no problem, good luck :)

[20:23:22] <jack> so exported fns can be dead?
[20:23:37] <jack> i thought the fact they were exported meant they were live.
[20:24:32] <larsberg> maybe because it's a pub fn in something being compiled as an executable instead of library?
[20:24:43] <kmc> that will do it yeah

[20:25:10] <jack> does anyone have any suggestions? shoul di just dleete the code even though it's sort of an exposed api?
[20:25:27] <jack> or should i annotate these unused methods?
[20:25:49] <larsberg> Can you introduce a debug! call to them? They were meant to be logging methods to dump quadtree-related info anyway...
[20:25:58] <larsberg> assuming they still work after all the refactorings :-)
[20:26:14] <jack> that's true of get_html, but not get_tile_size()
[20:28:01] <jack> i guess i'll delete them. it's not clear to me if they are important.

[23:41:05] <kmc> oh ok
[23:41:15] <kmc> what was the bug?
[23:41:57] <jack> work stealing was not working for some reason
[23:42:10] <jack> so the script task blocked the task forever and the work never got stolen by other threads.
[23:43:04] <jack> right now it should be the case that we have a single pool for everything except that compositing and profiler are in native threads.
