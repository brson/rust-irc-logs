[18:13:07] <bascule> Ilari: seems Trevor Perrin has announced a new version of Noise... again
[18:35:54] <Ilari> Found EKR's WIP branch of TLS 1.3. At least the worst crap from "DH-based key exchange" looks fixed.
[18:41:17] <Ilari> Well, there are so called "configurations". Each has GDH keypair associated. If the private key gets compromised, one can MITM clients trying to use that configuration (visible in ClientHello)...
[18:43:57] <Ilari> And there appears to be no good way to revoke a configuration (it has expiry time, but that's vulernable to client clock).
[18:48:24] <Ilari> Well, it is signaled as TTL, not expiry, so it isn't that vulernable to wrong clock, but time security is crap.

[22:46:58] <eternaleye> bascule: (backlogging the discussion of keybase.io) You really should have linked Tiffany to your post about javascript crypto :P http://tonyarcieri.com/whats-wrong-with-webcrypto
[22:51:48] <Tiffany> bascule: whoa, openssl doesn't support curve25519?
[22:57:55] <cmr> Tiffany: the rfc is still a draft.
[22:58:49] <Tiffany> oh
[22:59:05] <Tiffany> I suppose OpenSSL is first and foremost a TLS library, not a general crypto library
[22:59:21] <eternaleye> Tiffany: Part of the problem is it's neither :P
[22:59:35] <eternaleye> Tiffany: It started as a toy implementation of bignum arithmetic
[22:59:40] <eternaleye> Tiffany: RSA was a _test case_
[22:59:48] <Tiffany> lol what
[23:00:01] <Tiffany> what was it called back then?
[23:00:01] <eternaleye> Yuuuuup.
[23:00:05] <eternaleye> No idea
[23:00:47] <Ilari> https://github.com/letsencrypt/lets-encrypt-preview/wiki/Ciphersuite-guidance ... What a mess.
[23:01:45] <eternaleye> Tiffany: Anyway, my personal opinion of OpenSSL is a flat "do not use"
[23:02:10] <eternaleye> Tiffany: For TLS, I prefer GnuTLS by far (though it too has issues, at least its API isn't horrendously insane)
[23:02:18] <eternaleye> Tiffany: For low-level crypto, Nettle is not bad
[23:03:08] <eternaleye> Tiffany: And if API compatibility with OpenSSL is required, BoringSSL can do, or LibreSSL if you don't want to fight with building BoringSSL outside of Chrome
[23:03:21] <Tiffany> I looked into GnuTLS once and I didn't like its API
[23:03:39] <eternaleye> Tiffany: Out of curiosity, how come?
[23:03:42] <Tiffany> I also examined NSS, which I got very angry as I kept looking and looking for documentation and found none
[23:03:47] <Tiffany> and settled on PolarSSL
[23:04:13] <Tiffany> I don't remember, I think it was because it was also pretty complicated like OpenSSL and at the same time lacks sufficient examples like OpenSSL
[23:04:24] <Tiffany> like, I spent hours trying to find OpenSSL code to show me how it works at a high level
[23:04:32] <Tiffany> and all I found was shitty template after shitty template
[23:04:39] <Tiffany> even IBM's website used some horrifying defaults
[23:04:45] <Tiffany> my usecase was a bit special as well
[23:04:57] <Tiffany> since I was doing a codebase with async IO
[23:05:01] <Tiffany> which OpenSSL makes a nightmare
[23:05:13] <Tiffany> GnuTLS makes slightly less a nightmare, I have no idea how well NSS handles it, and PolarSSL handles it beautifully
[23:06:28] <eternaleye> Personally, I lay a good portion of the blame for terrible TLS apis on the terribleness of the BSD Sockets API
[23:06:44] <eternaleye> It exposes both too much and not enough information
[23:06:58] <Tiffany> well
[23:07:05] <Tiffany> I don't really think so
[23:07:19] <Tiffany> it's not actually that hard to build purely functional networking code
[23:07:29] <eternaleye> Tiffany: It is, however, hard to insert midlayers.
[23:07:39] <eternaleye> Tiffany: Because the BSD sockets API has loads of layering violations.
[23:07:46] <eternaleye> Tiffany: Hence, terrible TLS APIs.
[23:07:57] <Tiffany> midlayers?
[23:08:04] <eternaleye> Tiffany: TLS, for one
[23:08:10] <Tiffany> oh
[23:08:13] <Tiffany> well, sure
[23:08:22] <eternaleye> Tiffany: Or swapping out IPv6 for IPv4
[23:08:37] <Tiffany> I don't feel like BSD sockets being bad is an excuse for libraries to act like frameworks when it comes to networking, though
[23:08:37] <eternaleye> Tiffany: That should _not_ require application-level changes unless you handle raw addresses
[23:08:48] <eternaleye> But layering violations make that not the case
[23:09:09] <Ilari> I once wrote HTTP client using GnuTLS for TLS stack. IIRC, there was something nasty in it, but I don't remember offhand.
[23:09:21] <Tiffany> it's not quite as bad in Rust, since there's Writer and Reader traits
[23:09:55] <Tiffany> still though, I helped develop a transport layer over UDP which is totally pure, you can nest it however you like
[23:10:01] <Tiffany> it just exposes a C++ API and you feed it data
[23:10:29] <Tiffany> then there is a libuv layer which does the IO for you
[23:10:46] <eternaleye> Tiffany: Sure, but it requires a different API from the actual sockets
[23:10:48] <Tiffany> usually you use the libuv layer
[23:10:55] <Tiffany> it makes it easier to unit test
[23:11:00] <Tiffany> well, yeah
[23:11:02] <eternaleye> Tiffany: Because FDs can't be backed by functions
[23:11:16] <eternaleye> Tiffany: Which, again, requires rewriting the application
[23:11:31] <Tiffany> uh
[23:11:34] <eternaleye> Tiffany: That's my objection to the BSD sockets API: It's not even remotely substitutable
[23:11:42] <Tiffany> oh
[23:11:44] <Tiffany> I see what you mean
[23:11:48] <eternaleye> Tiffany: Swapping out different layers inside it, or different implementations, breaks EVERYTHING
[23:12:25] <eternaleye> Tiffany: It _cannot_ be implemented sanely, or even extended, outside the kernel
[23:12:26] <Ilari> The nastyness might just have been the client code being screwed up...
[23:13:14] <Tiffany> so the thing I'm doing is using a different API than BSD, and then hooking it up with glue code?
[23:13:25] <eternaleye> Tiffany: Especially when you get into either using pointers (data type change), integers (might collide with a real FD), or real FDs (setsockopt goes weird if they use the real one by accident; if you use them for actual data then you get FD amplification by 2x-3x)
[23:13:28] <Tiffany> that's the thing I suggest everyone do in lieu of better language-level socket APIs
[23:13:41] <eternaleye> Sure
[23:13:50] <Ilari> Also, TLS has renegotiation, which couples directions. You might be able to get around it by instantly terminating the connection if other side tries to renegotiate.
[23:14:01] <eternaleye> It's just that C should have had a better language-level socket API too :P
[23:14:12] <eternaleye> Especially because of how much networking code _is_ C
[23:14:31] <eternaleye> Because it's in that low-level, speed-critical zone that C dominates
[23:14:40] <Tiffany> uh
[23:14:57] <Tiffany> I guess I'm not used to seeing netcode as speed-critical
[23:15:04] <eternaleye> Tiffany: Believe me, it can be.
[23:15:12] <eternaleye> Tiffany: Look at software SSL termination
[23:15:24] <eternaleye> Tiffany: Its entire job is to operate as close to line rate as possible
[23:15:35] <eternaleye> Tiffany: With network on either side.
