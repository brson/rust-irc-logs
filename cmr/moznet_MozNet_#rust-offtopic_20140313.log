[03:24:52] <ski> or the blog post
[03:25:43] <cmr> ah, Polymorphic Type Inference didn't make it into the list I threw on google docs
[03:26:08] <ski> there's both a PS and a PDF of it
[03:27:30] <cmr> by the blog post do you mean the notation or ezyang's post?
[03:27:42] <ski> the notation thing
[03:27:46] <cmr> ok
[03:33:38] <cmr> " It's generally understood that parentheses are allowed in any language. "
[03:33:44] <cmr> Is this true in practice?
[03:36:21] <cmr> ski: how is the down-arrow in that post read as? I read it as "e evaluates to i", not sure if that's very precise or if there's a better interpretation.
[03:36:30] *** Joins: ChrisMorgan (chris@moz-6AC741CA.static.tpgi.com.au)
[03:47:08] <ski> yes "e evaluates to i" is a fine rough way to think about it
[03:47:20] <ski> "It's generally understood that parentheses are allowed in any language."
[03:47:30] <ski> usually, in PL theory, it's true
[03:47:44] <cmr> swag
[03:48:09] <ski> strictly speaking, grammars deal with words/strings (sequences of symbols/tokens)
[03:48:29] <cmr> yeah I know a bit about parsing.
[03:48:38] <ski> which in case of a programming language corresponds to the *concrete* syntax of the language
[03:49:16] <ski> however, the BNF-like notation used in PLT usually really talk about *abstract* syntax (trees), and hence explicit brackets aren't need
[03:49:19] <ski> ed
[03:49:38] <ski> do you know any functional programming language ?
[03:49:50] <cmr> handful of scheme, spattering of haskell.
[03:50:04] <ski> ok, do you understand basic data types in Haskell ?
[03:50:15] <cmr> scheme I picked up working through the first ~third of sicp, Haskell I've been slowly working through in spare time.
[03:50:27] <cmr> such as Int?
[03:50:38] <ski> like e.g. defining binary trees of integers
[03:50:40] <cmr> yes.
[03:50:45] <ski> ok, fine
[03:50:50] <ski> then, think of
[03:50:57] <ski>   e ::= i
[03:51:04] <ski>       | - e
[03:51:07] <ski>       | e + e
[03:51:35] <ski> as defining abstract syntax trees, like a data type definition
[03:51:48] <ski>   data Expr = Literal Integer
[03:52:02] <ski>             | Negate Expr
[03:52:06] <ski>             | Add Expr Expr
[03:52:17] <cmr> makes sense.
[03:52:19] <ski> in practice, we could write
[03:52:25] <ski>   e ::= lit(i)
[03:52:34] <ski>       | neg(e)
[03:52:39] <ski>       | add(e,e)
[03:52:43] <ski> (and some do)
[03:53:02] <ski> but we usually prefer looking at the "sugared" view above
[03:53:25] <ski> with the understanding that we should insert bracketting wherever needed, for complex expression (trees)
[03:54:25] <ski> iow, we can't say
[03:54:30] <ski>   2 + 3 + - 4
[03:54:35] <ski> we'd have to say
[03:54:46] <ski>   ((2 + 3) + (- 4))
[03:54:51] <ski> e.g., if we mean that
[03:55:31] <ski> well, strictly speaking, perhaps even
[03:55:41] <ski>   (((2) + (3)) + (- (4)))
[03:56:04] <ski> but we quickly decide on the convention that we don't wrap "atomic" subexpressions in brackets
[03:56:44] <ski> quickly followed by the convention that we don't both to wrap the whole expression in brackets either (unless we use it inside some other kind of formula, in which case we might still need those)
[03:56:48] <ski> so, then we'd write
[03:56:53] <ski>   (2 + 3) + (- 4)
[03:57:10] <ski> to describe which abstract syntax tree we mean
[03:57:44] <ski> cmr : makes sense ?
[03:57:48] <cmr> ski: yes, thanks!
[03:58:13] <ski> in short, the BNF-like notation used in PLT (usually) isn't actually about strings (like BNF in grammar normally is about), but rather *trees*
[03:58:45] <ski> and therefore we don't need an explicit case for bracketting
[03:58:58] <ski> because if we draw them as trees, visually, we don't need any brackets
[03:59:43] <ski> we only need them when we want to, unambiguously, represent such a tree in linear text, e.g. like the text in this IRC channel
[04:01:17] <ski> (depending, the person who specifies the language using a BNF like above may also decide on associativity of "operators" in the syntax trees, and on the relative precedence between operators, to avoid having to write another bunch of brackets)
[04:02:09] *** Joins: sunfish (chatzilla@moz-42DA0C69.dsl.dynamic.sonic.net)
[04:02:58] <ski> in we had subtraction, we might agree that if we write `e_0 - e_1 - e_2', then we mean the tree `(e_0 - e_1) - e_2' rather than the tree `e_0 - (e_1 - e_2)' (here which abbrviation convention choice we make, if any, affects the result we get, starting from a not fully bracketted linear portrayal of some expression tree)
[04:04:17] <ski> similarly, we may decide `e_0 + e_1 + e_2' means `(e_0 + e_1) + e_2' rather than `e_0 + (e_1 + e_2)' -- in this case, which choice we make (if any) doesn't affect the result value, starting from a linearized, not-fully-bracketted, expression
[04:05:48] <ski> still, as trees, those two are difference, so we need to distinguish them, because one means something like `add(add(e_0,e_1),e_2)' and the other means `add(e_0,add(e_1,e_2))' and those two abstract syntax trees are distinguishable, even though we intend to evaluate or reduce them to the same ultimate result value
[04:06:24] <ski> cmr : these latter points may be more or less obvious to you. i mention them in case it wasn't fully clear
[04:07:13] <cmr> bjz: I've started a gist: https://gist.github.com/cmr/9521747
[04:07:31] <ski> otherwise, regarding reading papers, i think one of the best ways of learning to read them is to attempt to read them, not initially letting some unclear things stop you from continuing, hopefully getting a gist of what it's about
[04:07:34] <cmr> bjz: want me to promote it to a repo to keep a central resource?
[04:08:31] <ski> that's what i did. i learned to read such papers by attempting to read them. someone mentioned them, on <news:comp.lang.functional> or IRC or <http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/>, and i was curious
[04:09:25] <ski> it took a while before i understood the meaning of the horizontal bar notation used for inference rules, though. someone on usenet explained how to read them : if all the stuff above the line are true, then the stuff below is also true
[04:10:01] <ski> (and by IRC, i mostly mean #haskell here, which was my first IRC channel :)
[04:11:13] <ski> if you happen to know something about logic programming (like Prolog,Mercury,Oz (used in the book CTM),Kanren (thing added to Scheme)), then there's a connection between that and inference rules
[04:11:26] <cmr> nope, never looked at them.
[04:11:43] <ski> basically, one can read inference rules as a logic program, thinking about how it would execute
[04:11:54] <ski> ok, don't worry about it now, then

[06:43:17] <eddyb> cmr: this is kinda related to previous discussion about dropping support for old stuff
[06:43:44] <eddyb> but yeah, phonebloks -> Motorola -> Google
[06:44:08] <tiffany> I'm kind of annoyed with the phonebloks thing
[06:44:20] <tiffany> if it ever actually does surface as a product it probably won't meet people's expectations
[06:44:51] <cmr> I think it's a dumb idea
[06:45:04] <cmr> more power and space just to be able to unplog modules?
[06:45:14] <eddyb> why?
[06:45:16] <cmr> *plug
[06:45:17] <tiffany> the very idea of it itself was pushed around by a designer without qualifications
[06:45:38] <tiffany> the modules will probably be more expensive too
[06:45:51] <eddyb> I liked the direction, not necessarily the presented embodiment
[06:46:00] <tiffany> I'm not sure how you can connect it all together without it being like a puzzle if you don't have some sort of universal bus with a processor embedded in each component
[06:46:10] <tiffany> which is the nuclear solution
[06:46:29] <eddyb> ARM SoCs have almost-universal internal buses
[06:46:44] <eddyb> batteries *already* have microcontrollers in them
[06:46:52] <tiffany> a lot of things have micro controllers in them
[06:47:05] <tiffany> ssd, hdd, battery, usb, thunderbolt, maybe even the display
[06:47:37] <tiffany> there's a lot of things in just one computer you can install linux on which is a really neat thing to think about but it's also pretty inefficient for a phone
[06:47:38] <eddyb> in any case, my ideas are probably more practical, but more into the future
[06:47:49] <eddyb> thus crazier than phonebloks which isn't a bad *experiment*

[06:51:16] <eddyb> just upgrade to nanotech already
[06:51:21] <tiffany> it just seems so silly to try to make a modular phone though
[06:51:47] <eddyb> dat tiny terahertz extra-multi-core
[06:51:49] <tiffany> with how often sockets and RAM interfaces change, and how the idea of upgrading component-at-a-time doesn't help you out much
[06:52:01] <eddyb> Epiphany? that can replace tiny AVRs
[06:52:10] <tiffany> phoneblok's purpose would be better served with cheap, recyclable phones
