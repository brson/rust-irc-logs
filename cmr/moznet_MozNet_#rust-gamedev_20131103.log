[03:21:42] <bjz> rustpkg test tests
[03:22:43] <kvark> lol it by far not compiles
[03:22:46] <kvark> I'll fix it
[03:28:56] <kvark> wanted to talk to you about Clone, while you are here
[03:29:22] <kvark> basically, I see that many structs implement it by deriving the implementation automatically
[03:30:06] <kvark> it would be helpful for me to have it on a higher level, implemented for Array-derived stuff
[03:30:25] <kvark> the implementation is trivial, and is commented out in my latest PR
[03:31:03] <kvark> the question is: do you think the implementation through "build" is going to be slower than the one we have, which is auto-derived from structs?
[03:31:49] <dbaupp> kvark: #[deriving] is as efficient as is possible generically, and, you can't actually write an impl like that
[03:32:05] <dbaupp> (i.e. `impl<A: Bounds> Clone for A { ... }` will never work.)
[03:32:16] <kvark> oh

[03:33:09] <kvark> if this doesn't work then it looks like a hole in the language
[03:33:37] <kvark> because you'd like to be able to implement one interface (Clone) based on the methods of another (Array)
[03:34:18] <dbaupp> what happens when you have something implementing Clone *and* Array by hand
[03:34:36] <kvark> I didn't actually check if it works, or even made the whole project to compile. If it could be done quicky, I'd do it. But it's not, so I wanted to check up with bjz first...
[03:34:45] <dbaupp> or if you have another impl<X: Whatever> Clone for X, and a type that implements both Array and Whatever
[03:34:50] <dbaupp> which Clone impl is chosen?

[11:52:54] <rsaarelm> Is it idiomatic to return complex iterators in an API? Like, say, an object has an internal container, and I want an api that returns an iterator to that container with map and filter applied to it. Trying to figure out how the signatures are supposed to work here...
[11:53:38] <rsaarelm> I don't want to write out the whole std::iter::Map<type,parameter,blob,of,horrors> thing out in my type spec.
[11:54:07] <dbaupp> type NiceName<..> = Horrors<...>; and then your users can just write NiceName if they ever need it
[11:54:16] <dbaupp> `pub type NiceName...` I should say.
[11:55:01] <dbaupp> e.g. std::str defines a pile of aliases: https://github.com/mozilla/rust/blob/master/src/libstd/str.rs#L441-L490
[11:55:58] <rsaarelm> I was thinking more of getting away without specifying the concrete iterator rube goldberg setup to begin with in any declaration, since nobody really cares how the internals are set up, just that the result satisfies given traits.
[11:56:42] <rsaarelm> Whether I use iter::Map or iter::Filter to get my resulting iterator are just implementation details.
[11:56:51] <dbaupp> oh, well, yeah, that's not easy: it's either not returning the iterator at all, or returning an ~Iterator<A> trait object... but that will make it slow, since every .map call is virtualised.
[11:56:58] <dbaupp> *.next
[11:57:18] <dbaupp> (well .map is virtualised too, but .next is the important one.)
[11:58:03] * dbaupp thinks we will need a solution for this, since it is so ridiculously ugly/fragile.
[11:58:52] <rsaarelm> I thought I could maybe use type parameters somehow, like fn return_iterator<T: Iterator<A>>(&self) -> T { return the actual thing here }
[12:00:01] <dbaupp> that's saying "this function can return any type that implements Iterator<A>", *not* "this function returns some specific type that implements Iterator<A> (but I'm not telling you which one)"
[12:00:42] <dbaupp> i.e. the caller can decide which concrete type it wants
[12:02:22] <rsaarelm> Right, so it's box and be slow or bite the bullet and write out the type, and this is a known language problem?
[12:03:48] <rsaarelm> Wait, I just wrote it without declaring the return value, and it built fine. I can do that?
[12:04:00] <rsaarelm> *the return type
[12:04:19] <dbaupp> you mean you wrote it with the generic?
[12:04:53] <dbaupp> (I think it is known... at least, I know it :P ... but I'm not sure if there's much inclination to fix it, and I certainly don't know enough to even begin.)
[12:06:40] <rsaarelm> No, just pub fn return_iterator(&self) /* -> let's skip this part */ { foo.filter.map.whatevs() }
[12:07:36] <dbaupp> then it returns (), which is probably not what you want :P
[12:07:50] <rsaarelm> Ah, right.
[12:07:54] <dbaupp> do you have a semicolon on the last expression?

[14:19:18] <rsaarelm> Just getting "cannot root managed value long enough" when I try to have an API that returns iterators, even for a trivial case.

[16:09:38] <bjz> kvark: hah, now that you mention it... https://github.com/bjz/cgmath-rs/pull/5/files#diff-cfcdfbe14df37b8d03c00442aa634eb2L17
[16:09:39] <bjz> :P
[16:10:43] <kvark> type float = f64; thing?
[16:10:58] <bjz> yeah, should just use f64

[16:14:55] <kvark> although, all the homogeneous stuff asks for a new trait, but it wasn't obvious for me how to implement it, so I just added these methods to structs
[16:18:36] <kimundi> Assuming I just want to start playing around with opengl rust gamedev, would gl-rs + glfw-rs + cgmath-rs be a safe bet?
[16:18:54] <kvark> totally ;)
[16:21:15] <kvark> bjz: apparently, rustpkg is still broken (unexpected)
[16:28:14] <kvark> I'm actually super excited about rust-gamedev in general. Good to know kimundi is joining the team :)
[16:28:51] <bjz> kvark: aye :(
[16:29:34] <bjz> so irritating :(
[16:29:39] <bjz> oh well
[16:29:59] <bjz> bleeding edge stuff is what we signed up for :)
[16:30:45] <bjz> kvark: we might have to think more about how homogeneous coordinates/projective space is handled
[16:30:54] <bjz> for now its workable
[16:31:41] <kvark> bjz: agreed
[16:31:48] <kimundi> kvark: Well, I'd wish I could pump enough time into gamedev ;D
[16:32:10] <kvark> kimundi: get yourself a vacation ;)
[16:32:29] <bjz> kimundi: I would hesitate to call it 'safe', it is definitely still in flux, as with everything to do with rust - but the idea with most of my stuff atm is to make it easier for folks to get up and running
[16:32:54] <kimundi> I'm a University student, I don't get vacations, only coursework :P
[16:33:34] * kvark remembers his university years to be ones full of side-projects and discoveries... unlike now
[16:33:54] <bjz> kimundi: of course, you still need to know some linear algebra and opengl stuff
[16:33:55] <kimundi> bjz: Yeah, that was more the intent of my question anyway. Just wanted to be sure its not a "Oh god NO! Don't use that one!" situation ;)
[16:34:07] <kvark> lol
[16:34:31] <bjz> kimundi: yeah, I've purged lots of my skeletons from my github
[16:34:35] <kimundi> kvark: Well, my main hoby and side project is rust library work... Not much time to actually use it then xD
[16:34:56] <bjz> kimundi: hopefully most are on travis too
[16:35:02] <kimundi> Also, I'm really, reaaally lazy
[16:35:11] <kvark> bjz: why isn't Travis doing tests as well?
[16:35:33] <bjz> kvark: it is for cgmath at least
[16:35:43] <bjz> I implemented it yesterday
[16:35:45] <bjz> :P
[16:35:48] <kvark> but... tests weren't even compiling
[16:35:51] <kvark> ah, I see now
[16:36:07] <bjz> https://travis-ci.org/bjz/cgmath-rs#L208
[16:36:08] <kimundi> Btw I found it amusing that those travis button on the gamedev wiki showed glfw to build and gl to fail, while actually checking them out resulted in the opposite situation
[16:37:19] <bjz> kimundi: yeah it takes a while for them to update
[16:38:15] <bjz> glfw was building fine, then I broke it, and gl was broken, then I fixed it
[16:38:22] <bjz> :P
[16:38:43] <bjz> but all is green now, at least on the travis side
[16:38:54] <bjz> oh wut
[16:39:01] <kimundi> Does it count as breaking if rust changes just made them not compile anymore? ;)
[16:39:05] <bjz> thater are buttons on the wiki now?
[16:39:17] <bjz> hah
[16:39:33] <bjz> kimundi: we hook them into http://hiho.io/rust-ci
[16:39:51] <bjz> kimundi: that rechecks it every day
[16:40:13] <kimundi> I see
[16:40:21] <bjz> kimundi: it also screens pull requests
[16:40:38] <kimundi> Yeah, noticed that.
[16:40:39] <bjz> so I should stop pushing directly to master now :P
[16:40:57] <bjz> I've been a little sloppy in the paster, hah
[16:41:02] <bjz> *past
[16:41:05] <bjz> o
[16:41:08] <bjz> o_o
[16:41:43] <sp3d> haha :)
