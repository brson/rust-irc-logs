[01:37:33] <Layl> ah, on the hematite to-do list?
[01:37:42] <Kingsquee> nah, on mine
[01:37:47] <Layl> ah
[01:38:06] <Layl> I never can quite find decent ways to generate cities
[01:38:30] <Layl> there's just something about generation algorithms that I can't find ways to scale them to certain complexities and precision
[01:39:01] <Layl> it's almost like you want to generate a city by just starting with a bunch of villagers and simulating it for 5000 years
[01:39:08] <Layl> but that's not really doable
[01:40:16] <Kingsquee> coughdorfortcough
[01:40:21] <aatch> Layl, I think it makes more sense to model how settlements grow at a more abstract level.
[01:40:31] <aatch> Kingsquee, just thinking that, heh.
[01:40:53] <Layl> there's a problem with that though
[01:40:58] <Layl> what if you want to generate an infinite city
[01:41:28] <niconii> well, depending on how abstract you wanna go, i mean...
[01:41:34] <Kingsquee> then you just generate a bunch of really big cities that're actually wang tiles
[01:41:36] <niconii> let population = std::f64::INFINITY;
[01:41:36] <aatch> Layl, well then you'll never make it make sense.

[01:44:09] <Layl> I guess the best way to generate a city like that would be to start with a floor plan for a single story of the building

[01:46:30] <Kingsquee> you're gonna get repetition eventually
[01:46:33] <Layl> perhaps the best way to make the game I have in mind is just to have really really really good tools for editing the cities and leave it up to the server owners
[01:46:44] <Kingsquee> you could make the tiles individual rooms, note

[02:34:27] <aatch> In terms of performance, definitely. There's a couple language features that are needed to make it nice to work with for an entire game engine though.
[02:34:32] <Layl> I would say those benchmarks are pretty good keeping in mind the age of Rust compared to C and how many people are writing benchmarks for it
[02:34:48] <Layl> aatch, like what for example?
[02:35:04] <niconii> oh, nice, we got the regex benchmark *way* down
[02:35:16] <niconii> it used to be pretty terrible compared to c
[02:35:18] <Elaine> with room to go too
[02:35:25] <Elaine> that's with a dynamic regex, not static.
[02:35:31] <niconii> oh wow
[02:35:35] <Elaine> (the static engine hasn't received the same work)
[02:35:37] <Layl> static regex is a bit cheating imo
[02:35:50] <aatch> Layl, mostly just inheritance-related stuff. We don't need full C++-level inheritance, but certain code-reuse patterns are difficult to do in Rust.
[02:36:06] <Layl> aatch, egh, I'll be happy if inheritance stays out of rust
[02:36:16] <Peach> have a specific example of those patterns aatch ?
[02:36:28] <WindowsBunny> I can't wait for when the static regex is optimized to be faster than dynamic :P
[02:36:32] <aatch> Peach, the DOM in servo is *the* example.
[02:36:46] <WindowsBunny> Rust will be _the_ language to do regexes in
[02:37:02] <Layl> what does servo need inheritance for in the DOM tree

[02:59:27] <Elaine> SDL doesn't help with 3D

[03:02:10] <Elaine> (I'd argue that SDL doesn't help with 2D either, only hurts, but that's neither here nor there)
[03:02:21] <Layl> there's a serious lack of open source 3D engines
[03:02:32] <Peach> ^
[03:02:36] <WindowsBunny> mostly because 3D is hard
[03:02:38] *** Joins: thlst (thlst@moz-nck.jsk.74.187.IP)
[03:02:48] <Layl> I did make a tiny library for rust that's supposed to be similar to SDL
[03:02:50] <Layl> but also 2D
[03:02:51] <Peach> Which is why I don't get how there's so much resistance to what I'm working on
[03:03:00] <Elaine> there's no resistance
[03:03:04] <WindowsBunny> Peach: Feel free to make a 3D engine
[03:03:07] <Elaine> you should keep doing what you're doing
[03:03:09] <WindowsBunny> I'm just warning you, it's hard :D
[03:03:15] <Layl> Peach, just be aware that you won't get any work done on making a game ;)
[03:03:22] <Peach> ^
[03:03:28] <Peach> That is resistance
[03:03:31] <Peach> It is also a lie
[03:03:38] <aatch> Peach, what is?
[03:03:50] <Layl> it is most certainly not a lie
[03:03:56] <WindowsBunny> 3D game engines are complicated things, that's not a lie

[03:05:14] <Peach> Yes WindowsBunny
[03:05:31] <Peach> The engine is built for a game
[03:05:43] <Layl> I've actually met a nice devteam recently who also made their engine from scratch
[03:05:45] <Peach> and as I make the game I make sure the engine still stays generic
[03:05:58] <Layl> they are 4 people though, with separate gameplay and engine programmers

[03:07:38] <aatch> Peach, skepticism is not resistance.
[03:07:51] <Layl> and skepticism is healthy now and then
[03:07:59] <Peach> I've heard all the "it's too hard/skepticism/it can't be done"  before
[03:08:14] <Peach> but that doesn't stop anything from actually getting made
[03:08:18] <Layl> we're not really saying too hard or can't be done
[03:08:27] <Layl> we're saying you're losing a lot of time by writing your own engine
[03:08:44] <Layl> when someone says "it can't be done" that's hyperbole
[03:08:56] <Layl> they're not literally saying that the laws of nature will prevent you from writing a game engine
[03:09:14] <Peach> well I dunno, you seem to be saying negative stuff without a positive goal to educate me on something new/useful
[03:09:29] <Peach> how am I losing time? You can't verify that existing engines meet my needs
[03:09:50] <Peach> What if what I want, in terms of features code and license doesn't exist?
[03:09:58] <Layl> well, what feature do you need that Unity for example doesn't have
[03:10:05] <Peach> No royalties
[03:10:22] <Peach> permissive source code license
[03:10:24] <Layl> fair enough, what about... hold on gotta google open source game engines
[03:10:34] <aatch> Layl, to be fair, there aren't many.
[03:10:49] <Peach> Also, Layl what I'm really getting at is,
[03:10:57] <Peach> you didn't even ask if I researched already
[03:11:03] <Layl> is Irrlicht still useful?
[03:11:05] <Peach> all the 3D engines and toolkit out there
[03:11:13] <Peach> Nope Irrlicht is really old
[03:11:13] <Layl> what about OGRE?

[03:12:22] <Peach> I know all of those off the top of my head, read their feature lists
[03:12:31] <Peach> I didn't even use google to list those
[03:12:34] <Layl> well, what do you need that OGRE doesn't have?
[03:12:45] <Peach> A non bloated API Layl 
[03:12:56] <Peach> It isn't just a matter of feature, it's also DESIGN
[03:13:04] <Peach> and maintainability 
[03:13:04] <Layl> is the latest version of OGRE still that bloated? huh
[03:13:17] <Layl> I thought they cleaned that up in the latest major version
[03:13:41] <Layl> docs are kind of a pain though
[03:13:45] <Peach> Layl: to be fair, I don't know what experience you have with 3D and existing game engines,
[03:14:07] <Peach> but shallow googling and looking at a feature list isn't really how you verify a game engine
[03:14:14] <Peach> You could ask me
[03:14:24] <Peach> more about why I choose not to use those engines

[03:15:32] <Layl> don't get me wrong there's plenty of good reasons to make your own engine, I would be a hypocrite if I said it's entirely useless
[03:15:59] <Peach> aatch 3D platformer action adventure game
[03:16:39] <Peach> I want it to run at 60+FPS on basically any hardware that supports OpenGL/ES 2.0 or later
[03:17:06] <Peach> And I want the code base to be as small and as few lines as possible
[03:17:06] <aatch> Peach, bah, that doesn't matter! Game first, technical specifications later.
[03:17:56] <Peach> Well, hardware does matter a bit, because if I were targeting high end PCs only, I would have went real time lighting everywhere and that major effects level design and workflow

[03:18:59] <aatch> Peach, still doesn't matter. Your game should exist independent of things like graphics.
[03:19:10] <Elaine> aatch: I can't agree with that.
[03:19:26] <Layl> Elaine, aatch, I'm taking a middle of the road on this
[03:19:28] <aatch> Elaine, the core should. You can't build a game on graphics alone.
[03:19:31] <Elaine> A good 30% of my current game project is the graphics style.
[03:19:48] <Layl> but generally if your gameplay doesn't work at all with just colored blocks, you should rethink your design
[03:19:49] <aatch> Elaine, yeah, and you have 70% of actual game.
[03:19:50] <Elaine> And it informs the rest of the design pretty heavily
[03:20:09] <aatch> Layl, that's more-or-less what I meant.
[03:20:32] <Elaine> That's just not how humans experience games, the visual experience is *so important* to quality.

[03:20:44] <Peach> ^
[03:20:45] <aatch> I get that graphics are an important part, and do influence the game, but you need gameplay first.
[03:20:46] <Layl> Elaine, not saying it isn't
[03:20:56] <Layl> but if your gameplay doesn't work with just colored blocks, you should rethink your design
[03:21:19] <Layl> graphics can have a huge effect on the enjoyment... but if your gameplay doesn't work with- yada yada
[03:22:15] <Peach> so uh, was somebody trying to make a point or ask a question?
[03:22:48] <Layl> Peach, the general point is, gameplay first, graphics comes next
[03:22:52] <aatch> Peach, I was saying that I want to know about your GAME, not your minimum tech specs
[03:23:06] <Layl> unless you're making a purely visual trip game like proteus
[03:23:16] <Kingsquee> Peach: did you try urho?
[03:23:31] <Kingsquee> that's the last engine I tried before deciding to go the hard way
[03:23:43] <Peach> Open world 3D platformer with RPG elements aatch 
[03:24:00] <Layl> Peach, elaborate
[03:24:04] <Layl> give us an elevator pitch
[03:24:07] <Kingsquee> (which doesn't give much to recommend it, but fwiw the best open generic engine I've tried)
[03:24:10] <Peach> light dialog, items, inventory, and levels like super mario galaxy / mario 64
[03:24:48] <Layl> starting to see the picture, like ocarina of time?
[03:24:49] <aatch> Peach, RPG + Light dialog...?
[03:25:13] <Kingsquee> OOT + mario 64 movement = all my money
[03:25:31] <Layl> what does the movement feel like, Peach?
[03:25:55] <Peach> That's essentially what is, like Legend of Zelda overworld and missions with a Mario 64 style control feel
[03:26:44] <Peach> and more platforming areas
[03:27:06] <Kingsquee> Peach: there a name and a place for this thing so I can rss and forget
[03:27:28] <Kingsquee> pls don't make me work
[03:27:45] <Kingsquee> it took me long enough to remember rainworld
[03:28:03] <Layl> Right so these are your important areas, the gameplay of the platforming
[03:28:05] <aatch> Peach, ok, without referencing other games: Why should I play your game?

[03:39:31] <Layl> yea
[03:39:36] <Kingsqueee> why not generate some values serverside and send it with the input
[03:39:44] <Kingsqueee> and have the AI require those to run
[03:39:51] <Kingsqueee> that way it couldn't be predicted by clients
[03:40:02] <Layl> yea but how do you decide what to send and what to keep
[03:40:19] <Kingsqueee> just generate a random number and use it in ai calculations somehow
[03:40:39] <Layl> Hm I guess that's one way, it would still open up wallhacking though

[03:41:04] <Kingsqueee> for that kinda thing I think social techniques are the best

[03:41:32] <Kingsqueee> if anything it's easier

[08:37:32] <tomaka> for example dealing with the alignment of data

[08:37:50] <OmniMancer> clearly the correct thing to do is to write an x86 emulator in compute shader and then run your game on the GPU

[08:38:41] <Binero> That'd be interesting

[08:39:23] <OmniMancer> then run several Qemu's inside the emulator to get to your final arch
[08:39:36] <eerie> hello. i tried to update piston to get rid of the "missing documentation" error, and now I get "this function takes 1 parameter but 2 parameters were supplied" with  "let window = Sdl2Window::new(". is there documentation of the change?
[08:40:02] <tomaka> OmniMancer: then run everything with llvmpipe
[08:40:04] *** Joins: stralsi (silvi_000@moz-bhl.j68.137.89.IP)
[08:40:11] <tomaka> llvmpipe inside virtualbox
[08:40:55] <tomaka> which runs on webassembly
[08:41:49] <OmniMancer> and then the whole thing is just running in a turing machine :P
[08:41:53] <Elaine> probably still faster than this 4-bit microprocessor I have here from 1971...
[08:43:29] <Binero> OmniMancer You should actively swap resources with the RAM to avoid running out of memory

[10:06:42] <fkaa> isn't there support for it already?
[10:07:26] <Elaine> oh, I see a coreaudio module...
[10:07:36] <mindtree> Elaine: its super limited and dodgy
[10:08:59] <mindtree> Elaine: I only got it to the point where I could spawn an audiounit and get an f32 pcm stream going (don't think it supports anything else atm)
[10:09:09] <Elaine> mm
[10:09:27] <mindtree> Elaine: then realised it'd probably be better to do some proper coreaudio bindings first, so started, then other things took priority :(

[22:49:26] <Layl> I am exceptionally concerned at the humble game making bundle
[22:49:50] <Layl> it mostly contains the drag and drop stuff advertising itself with "no programming required!"
[22:50:50] <Pierre_M> it does
[22:51:10] <Pierre_M> and I'm buying it, but it is limited
[22:51:23] <Layl> I don't see anything it contains that I would want
[22:51:32] <Pierre_M> the sprite maker is something i coudl use
[22:51:51] <Pierre_M> I know a few people planning to use rpg maker, and I might end up helping them a bit.
[22:52:07] <Pierre_M> but they don't contain a good way to extend things.
[22:52:26] <Pierre_M> if RPG maker supported loading arbitrary DLL's, I'd probably use it a lot more.
[22:52:27] <Layl> Spriter Pro actually looks pretty neat

[22:52:50] <Layl> iirc RPG maker lets you edit the python code it uses
[22:52:58] <Pierre_M> python yes.
[22:53:07] <Layl> well doesn't python have something to load in DLLs

[22:56:14] <Pierre_M> that is true
[22:56:38] <Layl> I personally think gamemaker is the very best thing to get started with
[22:56:49] <Layl> because it provides an easy progression of difficulty
[22:56:51] <Pierre_M> idk, look for a lot more $1-$10 games that really are all not quite there.

[22:57:06] <Layl> and the abstractness of gamemaker means you actually have to make your own game
[22:57:16] <Pierre_M> true
[22:57:19] <Layl> rather than copypaste assets into the preset game mechanics the program gives you
[22:58:11] <Pierre_M> I'm working with a group of people who are looking at a game from scratch, possibly with hte help of gamemaker, unless i get my act togethre with rust.
[22:58:53] <Pierre_M> 2 people doing story, 1 who can do art, but quite slowly.  A couple others jsut pitching ideas right now.
[22:59:03] <Pierre_M> They probably would have a good chance with game maker, if i weren't there.
[22:59:07] <Layl> honestly that sounds like an unhealthy dev team balance
[22:59:14] <Pierre_M> yeah, i know
[22:59:28] <Pierre_M> the graphics pack in the bundle might get a bit overused by us.

[22:59:38] <Layl> on writing stuff down I mean
[22:59:38] <Pierre_M> not really
[22:59:40] <Layl> good
[22:59:45] <Pierre_M> well, plot and storyline yes
[22:59:49] <Layl> well tell them to stop
[22:59:50] <Layl> right now
[22:59:56] <Pierre_M> but more as just a story, nothing beyond that.
[22:59:58] <Pierre_M> why?
[23:00:06] <Layl> because starting with the story is more often than not a mistake
[23:00:16] <Pierre_M> how do you figure?
[23:00:52] <Layl> because the game mechanics aren't fleshed out yet
[23:01:04] <Layl> there's no prototype, they don't know yet if the game will 'work'
[23:01:39] <Pierre_M> what we have so far is fuzzy enough that it isn't dependent on the mechanics itself yet.
[23:01:46] <Pierre_M> RPG's are a bit more forgiving there IMO.
[23:02:00] <Pierre_M> what we're looking at is designed to be story driven more.
[23:02:38] <Layl> honestly I would advice against it, though I'm not gonna stop you
[23:02:49] <Pierre_M> but until i have code doing things I want, I"m not pushing htem to make everythign concrete, probably stopping after a bare outline
[23:02:58] <Pierre_M> I'll take your advice in minde
[23:03:00] <Layl> problem is often the best story games have mechanics that co-operate with the story
[23:03:01] <Pierre_M> mind*
[23:03:11] <Pierre_M> that is true
[23:03:25] <bvssvni> I recommend finding multiple exit strategies
[23:03:26] <Layl> (see for example, Brothers)

[23:04:07] <bvssvni> yes
[23:04:07] <Layl> this is like the exact opposite of the conversation we had yesterday, heh
[23:04:24] <Layl> or was it earlier today
[23:04:27] <Layl> I don't remember
[23:04:37] <bvssvni> Layl: what was it about?
[23:05:01] <bvssvni> Pierre_M: multiple stages, so if you fail at a later stage at least you have something
[23:05:02] <Layl> bvssvni, someone had an entire engine made from scratch and everything but no game mechanics to explain why someone should play the game
[23:05:20] <Pierre_M> yeah, I get it.  Can't get rid of all the single points of failure, but probably some of them
[23:05:54] <Layl> Pierre_M, this is going to be the most important two words you ever hear in game development:
[23:05:56] <Layl> Fail faster.

[23:08:09] <Layl> alaways
[23:08:15] <Layl> the trick is to fail faster
[23:08:17] <Layl> fail at an early stage
[23:08:18] <Pierre_M> yup
[23:08:27] <Layl> so, unity/gamemaker out a prototype

[23:13:14] <bvssvni> Pierre_M: also, spreadsheets and planning software is of good help
[23:15:02] <bvssvni> Pierre_M: use google docs, then everybody can edit

[23:33:01] <bvssvni> does anyone have the problem that keyboard doesn’t work in Gimp?

[23:36:41] <meh> I'm making the best cube simulator ever http://webm.host/b3987/vid.webm [NSFW if you're not in Japan]
[23:38:00] <bvssvni> meh: that’s brilliant!
[23:38:05] <bvssvni> good night
[23:38:08] *** bvssvni is now known as bvssvni_
[23:38:59] <Layl> I like how mythodical isometric can be done
[23:39:03] <Layl> *methodical

[23:39:42] <Layl> meh, what is this doing beyond cubes?
[23:40:12] <Layl> I friggin love that negative effect on the beam
[23:40:32] <meh> Layl, it's doing the beam, the plasma bullet, and the radius changing plasma bullet
[23:40:38] <meh> and cube, tetrahedron and octahedron
[23:40:53] <meh> still have to pick more 3d shapes to use as ships
[23:43:00] <meh> then wait for the ncollide docs to get updated so I can start making things explode
[23:43:14] <Layl> I really need a new pixel art editor to use
[23:44:55] <meh> does anyone know if there are any pure rust fft libraries around?
[23:46:52] *** Joins: summerlight (summerlight@moz-lb3.6do.193.175.IP)
[23:50:45] <Layl> what would really help with editing is if there were screens that could show abstract concepts for every pixel somehow
[23:50:57] <Layl> like "this color brown is specifically the brown you're using for boxes"
[23:51:06] <Layl> and "this color brown that's exactly the same is what you're using for doors"
