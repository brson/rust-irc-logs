[00:00:46] <eddyb> now I seriously wonder whether Rust can collapse under social pressure...
[00:02:42] <eddyb> I don't see how an immediate solution could form, it's not like Mozilla can upload the expertise of current team/community members to new ones
[00:04:34] <eddyb> I don't even see how this could have been avoided without "fixing" the situation on a scale that's much larger than Rust... maybe if the core team was more diverse from the start or at least was "evolved" to be that way up until one or two years ago

[00:22:37] <eddyb> l1n3n01z: aaaand then what?
[00:23:17] <huon> NB. the teams (especially the moderation team) are designed to solve actual real issues we've had in the past with interactions being very poor
[00:23:24] <huon> (not related to diversity)
[00:24:00] <huon> maybe we should've waited for a bit, but solving those issues is important too
[00:24:14] <l1n3n01z> and then it would have been possible to work with for instance the Berlin group on doing some minimal patching

[00:32:19] <l1n3n01z> it's always an egg and chicken problem until someone decides to actually make the damned ommelette :P
[00:32:28] <huon> that's definitely true
[00:32:45] <niconii> eddyb: "hindsight is 20/20"?
[00:32:47] <huon> unfortunately, the "design" teams can't really take people without experience
[00:33:14] <eddyb> l1n3n01z: the way this would have worked an year or two before 1.0 is there would be either new hires/transfers within Mozilla or new community members and in time they could qualify
[00:33:20] <huon> however, the moderation team could be much improved by more diversity now, even people without Rust experience
[00:33:30] <l1n3n01z> yeah, exactly, huon
[00:33:51] <l1n3n01z> and it seems that you are willing to address it. Re: diversity thread
[00:34:04] <huon> however, as incidents like this show, putting people on teams is *hard*
[00:34:09] <eddyb> huon: you can take people with experience (in other languages, for example) that is not specific to Rust
[00:34:30] <huon> it's easy to put them into emotionally difficult and draining situations
[00:34:57] <eddyb> I wouldn't mind having Haskell or ML experts around
[00:35:00] <huon> risking burning people out, and especially so if they're vulnerable in the community anyway
[00:35:22] <huon> (both the Rust community, and the broader IT community)
[00:35:40] <eddyb> niconii: yes!
[00:35:47] <huon> I say this because at least one person has recently stated that they have no interest in being on any form of leadership team
[00:36:06] <l1n3n01z> wow
[00:36:16] <l1n3n01z> thisi is definitely hard on you guys
[00:36:30] <l1n3n01z> and sucks that it's raining on your parade

[00:36:53] <huon> I'm just trying to use this an example when wrong decisions have been made
[00:37:03] <huon> and yes, it is making me sad that we're hurting people
[00:38:04] <l1n3n01z> but these are excellent suggestions though. Reach out to Rubyists who have been slowly turning their community around
[00:38:05] <huon> I should've used the example in the past of the two contributors who were often very rude in their technical debates
[00:38:16] <huon> (I'm sorry)
[00:38:29] <eddyb> so, last thing before I go to sleep: it's not like I wouldn't contribute to Rust anymore whenever I had the chance. right now the only thing being part of that team does to me is produce guilt of being a young white male
[00:38:54] <l1n3n01z> guilt is not really helpful though :)
[00:39:14] <XMPPwocky> i don't think there's any need to feel guilty? like if you want to actually improve the diversity of the community and/or leadership

[02:54:31] <whipsch> argh
[02:54:51] <Sho> one of the more interesting things is that the protocol limits message buffers to 512 bytes and servers don't bounce back your own messages, so unless your client makes an attempt to split (which involves being variable-width encoding aware and knowing its own hostmask - which can change during the session - so it can account for the preamble as seen on the receiving end) your novella-length messages (like this one) may get cut off unknowingly
[02:54:57] *** Quits: erickt (erickt@moz-njt.vqi.14.76.IP) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[02:55:48] <Twisol> The server tells you what your hostmask is on auth, right? Does it notify you afterwards when it changes?
[02:56:01] <Havvy> Twisol:  Good question. Let me test that.
[02:56:07] <Sho> not in any way that's widely supported
[02:56:24] <Sho> some servers that support the CAPABILITIES extension may support a CAP that allows you to opt into notifications
[02:57:14] <Sho> most servers implement hostmask changes on /others/ as a quit+rejoin cycle, though
[02:57:33] <Twisol> That sounds like a blast...
[02:58:03] <Sho> making a production IRC client is pedagogical, it can teach you a lot about what can go wrong with a tech :)

[03:00:52] <Sho> yeah, CAPABILITIES + the sasl CP
[03:00:52] <Twisol> if I recall, IRC has fun with | being considered either uppercase or lowercase
[03:00:52] <Twisol> I forget what it's the upcase/downcase of.
[03:00:53] <Sho> *CAP
[03:00:58] <Twisol> Sho: I like implementing Telnet for similar reasons
[03:01:20] <Havvy> Twisol:  \
[03:01:20] <Sho> before that, there was no reliable protocol for doing race-free auth before joins, no reliable well to tell success or failure, etc.
[03:01:56] <Twisol> (sorry if my messages bunched up there, I almost timed out again...)
[03:02:06] * Havvy adds SASL to the list of things to look into, since I own the `irc-socket` package on npm (the package manager, not the user)
[03:04:04] * c74d uses both SASL and CertFP on freenode.
[03:04:12] <Twisol> I think I'm specifically having connection issues with irc.mozilla.org. Other connections remain active. :/
[03:04:21] <Sho> Havvy: in practice the only thing really widely supported is SASL PLAIN (freenode's seven had support for DH-BLOWFISH but dropped again because it was dumb, and i don't think anybody actually does ECDSA-NIST256P-CHALLENGE) so it's not hard to add, without extra deps
[03:05:13] <Havvy> Sho:  Good to know.
[03:06:20] <c74d> freenode dropped DH-BLOWFISH? I guess that explains why my SASL authentication to freenode has been failing for I-don't-know-how-long.

[03:30:54] <cmr> why would it be? it's infrequent that you want to import a single external function and extern { } is *not* that big a deal. it's 2 extra braces!

[03:31:08] <npm> eh, alright

[03:31:43] <cmr> I have a pretty high bar for introducing minor features like that. they pile up in complexity.
[03:33:16] <cmr> it's a shame there is no platform from which you can cross-compile to every other platform with rust.

[05:50:35] <cmr> Is anyone familiar with the Android NDK? What is the *actual* implication of chosing an API level. For example, can I just use API level 8 (froyo) and at runtime detect whether it's running 4.3+ (which started GLES3 support)?
[05:50:39] <npm> c74d: lead?
[05:51:15] <Yurume> cmr: yeah, if you want to give a pretty error message and nthing else for others
[05:51:17] <c74d> npm: the chemical element.
[05:51:32] <cmr> Yurume: well, I have a GLES2 and a GLES3 renderer.
[05:51:36] <npm> Layl: I have a business machine Macintosh that was continuously in use from 1996-2012, and the hard drive's still going strong
[05:51:42] <npm> it's tiny, but it works
[05:51:46] <cmr> Yurume: I'm just not sure what chosing the API level actually *does*
[05:51:57] <cmr> (At the NDK level, at least. In the manifest it's obvious)
[05:52:02] <npm> c74d: I don't think you have to worry about that at all?
[05:52:08] <cmr> c74d: building a computer is really just putting things in slots and spinning screws.
[05:52:13] <Yurume> cmr: library linkage I think
[05:52:14] <cmr> nothing to it.
[05:52:23] <npm> I mean, I was taking apart my computer at 7, nobody seemed too worried
[05:52:40] <npm> my lovely little iBook G3
[05:52:52] <cmr> Yurume: like, to an older bionic?
[05:52:53] <c74d> it's in the components
[05:53:19] <Yurume> cmr: well, symbol linkage?
[05:53:21] <c74d> npm: I doubt most people realize computers have toxic stuff in them.
[05:53:39] <npm> c74d: hmm, I guess they do
[05:53:46] <Yurume> if you cannot resolve symbols in the elf loader, you cannot execute the binary at all...
[05:53:55] <npm> although, you don't really have to worry about it at that small of a level
[05:54:08] <npm> just don't ingest anything :P
[05:54:09] <zwarich> npm: if you can take your computer apart, it wasn't designed optimally :D
[05:54:20] <cmr> c74d: I can't think of a single part I bought that RoHS compliant.
[05:54:23] <cmr> like, ever.
[05:54:26] <Yurume> but I am not really sure about WHICH part of API has been changed between different NDK versions
[05:54:29] <cmr> that wasn't*
[05:54:36] <npm> zwarich: my computer currently has its side panel off
[05:54:43] <npm> not for any reason
[05:54:52] <npm> just because I'm too lazy to put it back on
[05:55:03] <npm> also; that sounds really Mac-y
[05:55:22] <c74d> Apple's supposedly phased out brominated fire retardants now, but I doubt that they had in the day of the iBook G3.

[10:15:40] <eddyb> first-class fields
[10:15:54] <eddyb> (could be implemented in Rust as either types or values or both)
[10:16:55] <zwarich> eddyb: the correct approach appears to be based on fragments of monadic second order logic on trees
[10:17:42] <zwarich> but not really possible to integrate into Rust in any way
[10:18:09] <eddyb> one of the few words I understand from there is "monadic"

[10:32:16] <eddyb> is monadic second order logic anything like deforestation?

[12:44:29] <eddyb> Manishearth: the part about including employees that use/contribute to Rust, from other companies, hmm
[12:44:51] <eddyb> Manishearth: isn't that like a committee?
[12:44:53] <Manishearth> eddyb: ?
[12:44:55] <Manishearth> nah
[12:45:07] <Manishearth> we don't become a majority employee thing
[12:45:11] <Manishearth> well, we might, eventually
[12:45:17] <Manishearth> I hope that day never comes :p
[12:45:26] <eddyb> it doesn't seem like a bad thing, necessarily, just not something I expected to happen
[12:45:29] <Manishearth> yeah
[12:45:55] <Manishearth> Well, like I said there a lot of people from all sides (Mozilla, Rust, unaffiliated) have said that Rust should not be a Mozilla thing
[12:46:03] <eddyb> it might be more interesting to replace "company" with "project"
[12:46:35] <Manishearth> and I've heard people say that they expect the Rust team to expand to include other companies too
[12:46:42] <eddyb> represantants of the largest projects using Rust, including in production in companies that profit from it
[12:46:48] <Manishearth> I did too, though I'm surprised it could happen so early
[12:46:48] <Havvy> A Rust foundation like the Node Foundation?
[12:46:51] <eddyb> (but not limited to it)
[12:47:25] <Manishearth> But I got the idea partly from watching the rust release party where 3(!) companies, none of them Skylight, were using Rust
[12:47:32] <Manishearth> which means that there is potential here
[12:47:33] <eddyb> whoa whoa
[12:47:39] <eddyb> I need to finish watching that video
[12:47:45] <Manishearth> yeah watch it
[12:47:46] <eddyb> (phone rebooted after 10min)
[12:48:07] <eddyb> I expected this to happen, just not immediatelly
[12:48:19] <Manishearth> bstrie's talk is amazing
[12:48:21] <Manishearth> same
[12:48:40] <eddyb> Manishearth: thing is, the industry itself is plauged by the same diversity issues
[12:48:52] <Manishearth> also kmc's talk was suprrising o nseeing the topic, and surprising on seeing that the talk actually *happened* in the time it was given
[12:48:55] <Manishearth> sure
[12:49:05] <Manishearth> but I think for some reason both Rust and Mozilla are skewed a bit more than average
[12:49:38] <eddyb> when you become large enough, you have to start caring
[12:49:56] <Manishearth> yep
[12:50:01] <eddyb> preferably you do from the start, but you have less power to fix things then
[12:50:19] <fmtq> it helps to plan for a transition from the beginning
[12:50:29] <Manishearth> bstrie: btw, re: https://np.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/3653tg/diversity_on_the_governance_teams/crbvcz9, look at that user's history

[13:18:16] <Havvy> Manishearth:  From the perspective of a person who doesn't know language A, but does know languages B, C, etc.,, it makes feel people like you are insulting their knowing of B and C and whatever languages the use making them feel bad.
[13:18:49] <Havvy> Others will see it as somebody naive claiming the language can do more than what they think it can.
[13:18:51] <eddyb> Manishearth: borrowck rules are much stricter than they could be, while still enforcing the same !(aliased & mut) imperative
[13:18:58] <Manishearth> Havvy: agreed, removed :)
[13:19:00] <Havvy> And for some naive people they'll think that by using Rust they won't have to think.
[13:19:55] <Havvy> And then when they find a point they get burned for not thinking about it, they write long messy blog posts explaining that Rust sucks because it doesn't do what was promised in another blog post.

[13:28:51] <eddyb> I saw "crust" a month or two ago
[13:30:12] <bluss> crust was obviously a made up fun alternative

[13:30:26] <bluss> :)
[13:30:49] <eddyb> bluss: hmm?
[13:31:01] <eddyb> bluss: crust was a keyword, predating extern "C"
[13:31:25] <bluss> I thought it was obvious it was made up
[13:31:40] <eddyb> bluss: crust wasn't made up
[13:31:46] <bluss> yeah, I was wrong
[13:31:48] <eddyb> alt was match
[13:32:09] <eddyb> new was never a keyword, even though we started preparing for it
[13:32:34] <eddyb> oh and apparently F# and maybe other languages use `box`
[13:32:43] <bluss> what do they do with box
[13:32:59] <eddyb> pretty much the same thing Rust does

[13:38:19] <eddyb> Manishearth: everyone was struggling to find a better alternative to new
[13:38:25] <eddyb> because Path::create *sucked*
[13:38:34] <Manishearth> hah
[13:38:42] <Manishearth> Path::create?
[13:38:48] <bluss> it's great it's not called new. Everyone would be loving to redundantly new everything thn
[13:38:50] <eddyb> yeah, s/new/create happened
[13:39:11] <Manishearth> create for constructors or create for placement new?

[13:41:35] <Manishearth> eddyb: hahaha
[13:41:37] <bluss> Manishearth: you pass by swap without mentioning rust does statically guarantee &mut T don't alias
[13:41:39] <Manishearth> I had the exact same feeling
[13:41:43] <Manishearth> Servo... okay
[13:41:45] <Manishearth> hyper ... okay

[13:42:05] <Manishearth> bluss: fair point
[13:42:21] <bluss> Manishearth: maybe it it's simpler to skip it? but rusties will know
[13:42:28] <Manishearth> bluss: how about
[13:42:36] <Manishearth> > In both cases, when the two references are the same[^1]
[13:42:40] <eddyb> fucking hell
[13:42:44] <Manishearth> with the footnote mentioning that tis isn't possible in Rust
[13:42:56] <eddyb> fn foo(T: type, n: usize, v: &Vec(T, n))
[13:43:00] <Manishearth> heh
[13:43:14] <eddyb> you do know that's the syntax I'm using for my own hypothetical stuff, right?
[13:43:53] <eddyb> is this proof I'm not entirely on the worng track?
[13:44:20] <Manishearth> it means that both you and kmc live in the future
[13:44:21] <Manishearth> shoo
[13:44:27] <eddyb> I also like to compress it, so it would be foo(v: &Vec(T: type, n: usize))
[13:44:30] <Manishearth> go back to your flying cars and let us bang rocks in peace
[13:44:41] <bluss> with that example C has dependent types
[13:44:50] <eddyb> bluss: wat?
[13:45:06] <bluss> it allows void foo(int x, int y[x])
[13:45:10] <bluss> C99
[13:45:25] <eddyb> lel
[13:45:32] <eddyb> I forgot about that
[13:46:08] <bluss> it doesn't matter in practice
[13:46:21] <bluss> also, VLA degraded to optional for implemntations to provide in C11
[13:49:00] <mrmonday> woah, dependently typed Rust?
[13:49:04] <mrmonday> sounds amazing
[13:49:33] <eddyb> hmm
[13:49:41] <eddyb> I have some beef with GADT
[13:49:51] <eddyb> the part where you write the type of the constructor
[13:50:10] <eddyb> and it includes the name of the GADT
[13:50:15] <eddyb> seems kinda redundant
[13:51:46] <Manishearth> published
[13:51:47] <Manishearth> http://manishearth.github.io/blog/2015/05/08/the-problem-with-shared-mutability/
[13:51:56] <eddyb> enum Vec(T: type, N: Nat) { Nil where N == Nat::Zero, Cons(T, Vec(T, M)) where N == Nat::Succ(M) }
[13:52:12] <eddyb> this is what I'd use, maybe with shorter keyword than `where`
[13:52:16] <eddyb> (I kinda like `if`)
[13:53:16] <eddyb> and then Equal actually *makes sense*
[13:53:27] <eddyb> because it would be `Refl if a == b`
[13:56:30] <eddyb> Manishearth: wait, is that MaidSafe?
[13:56:35] <eddyb> I've heard about them before
[13:57:17] <Manishearth> yes

[14:28:56] <Manishearth> It happened on the first day
[14:29:03] <mrmonday> I dunno how effective that'd be for C# -> Rust, I've managed to get a few C type folk to look into it without me ever saying Rust though :p
[14:29:10] <mrmonday> haha
[14:29:36] <Manishearth> There were two projects, one in C++ and one in Java. The other intern in my team said that he doesn't like Java. I asked him why, he's like it's slow
[14:29:40] <Layl> mrmonday, "huh is that a problem in C#?"
[14:29:51] <Manishearth> I first made a variety of arguments as to why in that situation it shouldn't matter
[14:30:15] <Manishearth> (Java being slow shouldn't deter you from working on a project already written in java, it should deter you from choosing it for a new project)

[14:30:38] <Manishearth> (btw I hate java :P)
[14:30:41] <Layl> me too
[14:30:43] <Manishearth> and eventually reached Rust
[14:31:30] <Manishearth> But he wasn't the type of person to really want to pick it up :p
[14:31:51] <Manishearth> I wonder if I could hold a talk her eon it though. Just need to get enough people interested till they ask me
[14:31:56] <mrmonday> Layl: I honestly don't think I could come up with a convincing set of questions/probes for C# -> Rust... C# is pretty solid as languages go
[14:32:06] <Manishearth> yeah
[14:32:16] <Layl> F# was the gateway language for me from C# into Rust
[14:32:31] <mrmonday> other systems languages is fairly easy, since they're mostly unsafe
[14:32:42] <Manishearth> heh
[14:32:49] <Layl> there's plenty of problems with C# which is why I switched to rust from it
[14:32:57] <mrmonday> the dynamically typed languages are either easy or tough, depending on who you're talking to
[14:33:09] <Layl> for one, the GC, as sophisticated and amazing it is as GCs go, still entirely unsuited for anything real time
[14:33:16] <mrmonday> I know a lot of people who won't even consider statically typed languages...
[14:33:40] <eddyb> mrmonday: do you know https://manishearth.github.io/blog/2015/05/08/the-problem-with-shared-mutability/ is 404?
[14:33:47] <eddyb> err
[14:33:49] <Layl> I don't know, I'm kinda feeling with dynamically typed languages like...
[14:33:50] <eddyb> Manishearth: ^^
[14:33:53] <Layl> sure the compiler yells less at you
[14:34:00] <mrmonday> tab complete \o/
[14:34:03] <Layl> but if you're in a situation there where the compiler would yell at you
[14:34:06] <Layl> it's gonna break anyways at runtime
[14:34:11] <Manishearth> eddyb: yeah
[14:34:16] <Manishearth> ed fixing
[14:34:56] <mrmonday> the more the compiler yells at me, the more I typically like the language :p
[14:35:06] <mrmonday> I'm a terrible programmer and I know it

[17:50:43] <whipsch> wow, that is pretty terrible
[17:51:49] <eddyb> it's funny how we still do security by obscurity
[17:52:23] <eddyb> but obscurity from... ourselves. more like lack of knowledge, I guess
[17:52:43] <whipsch> one of my favorite examples of security by obscurity was in a game called runescape
[17:52:49] <eddyb> we *think* quantum crypto works because we cannot explain all the underlying mechanisms
[17:52:56] <whipsch> every update to the game they would rnadomize the order of fields in packets
[17:52:56] <eddyb> security by magic, perhaps?
[17:53:06] <eddyb> whipsch: sounds like something Blizzard does
[17:53:12] <cmr> eddyb: "security by this is the best we think it is"
[17:53:15] <cmr> ie, everything ever done.
[17:53:19] <whipsch> and additionally randomly change 'type's of fields, by that i mean ofset bytes by 128, invert them, do weird endianness things
[17:53:32] <whipsch> annoying but easily defeated
[17:54:12] <whipsch> eddyb: for a long time blizzard only encrypted the first 2 bytes of their packets
[17:54:21] <whipsch> you could just capture say, 100 packets and get the key
[17:54:36] <c74d> eddyb: Rust 1.0 has dependent typing? ó_o Where are you seeing this?

[17:56:58] <eddyb> wait, mircea_popescu is Romanian. and he has a weird Romanian quote on his blog. lel
[17:57:10] <Tiffany> I would rather use a crypto system which is secure against known quantum computing methods than try to shoehorn quantum crypto into existing systems
[17:58:02] <Tiffany> it doesn't sound very practical to build a circuit-switched fiber optic internet just for quantum crypto

[18:23:56] <Twisol> Separate code/data memory regions too.
[18:23:57] <GBGamer> and there are also platforms where void * > void (*)()
[18:24:01] <Twisol> pointers into code memory were fatter
[18:24:04] <GBGamer> I'm fairly certain
[18:24:08] <aji> ah, interesting
[18:24:29] <aji> in that case, consult your libc documentation i guess?
[18:24:54] <GBGamer> so I guess, you have to convert it into an array of bytes
[18:25:02] <aji> seems like an edge case that standard C can't really handle
[18:25:19] <GBGamer> yeah, I was just curious for some reason
[18:25:54] <Twisol> in a way, if you want to print a function pointer, you're going to fall into UB anyway. "print what" is the question - if your pointer contains a code page and an offset, you've got two things to print logically

[18:28:49] <cmr> GBGamer: "yes"
[18:28:53] <cmr> you can do either.
[18:29:15] <GBGamer> If, in your c compiler, you do -lSDL, is it static or dynamic

[18:37:37] <GBGamer> you'd be surprised how much I can take

[23:22:37] <c74d> I don't recall Haskell making any termination guarantees?
[23:23:31] <barosl> c74d, Uh, you mean, the halting problem?
[23:24:02] <c74d> Idris optionally can, and I expect Agda and Coq can, but Haskell allows printing an infinite list, which is trivially non-terminating.
[23:24:15] <cmr> Coq does.

[23:25:31] <cmr> JustAPerson: if you give me your program I can run it through vtune and tell you why.
[23:25:39] <barosl> c74d, Yup, that's true. I'm just annoyed by whether my program is properly terminated or not is determined by the use of an optimization flag...
[23:26:11] <barosl> But this might not be a problem in practice, cause I'll be always using -O2 or more
[23:26:23] <c74d> I was responding more to “<GBGamer> I don't think that's supposed to happen with Haskell”
[23:26:44] <barosl> Ah, he might have said that regarding to the use of the optimization flag
[23:27:03] <cmr> barosl: does it actually never terminate or is just thunking excessively?
[23:27:29] <barosl> cmr, I'm not sure, I've run it for minutes and nothing happens
[23:27:40] <barosl> How do I know that?
[23:28:00] <barosl> Well, if it is generating excessive thunks, memory will be run out
[23:28:22] <barosl> But the memory consumption is pretty stable
[23:28:24] <cmr> barosl: https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/prof-time-options.html might help.
[23:28:28] <cmr> ok, so it's probably not that.
[23:35:17] <barosl> What
[23:35:31] <barosl> It did end, after 4 minutes and 33 seconds pass!
[23:35:44] <barosl> I was wrong, I should have just waited for longer lol
