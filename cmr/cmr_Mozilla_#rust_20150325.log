[00:51:22] <kl4ng> is it because Rc is not threadsafe?
[00:51:46] <mcpherrin> kl4ng: rc is not threadsafe.  You want arc for threadsafe.
[00:51:47] <kmcguire> consider Vec, if you hold two mutable pointers, you could modify it while its iterating, iirc

[04:07:21] <fizzbooze> but i'm using Rust for a school assignment and the protocol is basically already predefined

[04:08:09] <fizzbooze> would transmute be appropriate for this case?

[04:59:16] <bombless> If Rust can call macro with ending bang (without round brackets), the code will look more like Ruby, and I think it's kinda cool.

[05:06:18] <bstrie> bombless: without the round brackets, the parser cannot determine where the macro ends and the rest of the code begins
[05:07:08] <bombless> bstrie: I'll check OpenDelim, if  there's none, I'll call macro.
[05:07:31] <bstrie> fizzbooze: wild guessing here, but I think you stick `#[derive(RustcSerialize)]` on the struct definition to make those methods usable
[05:07:31] <bombless> Don't worry, I'm working on it. Compiling LLVM so it won't be fast...

[05:08:43] <bombless> Oh I see the misunderstanding. I mean if there's no arguments for macro, we can ommit the round brackets, bstrie.
[05:08:48] <bstrie> bombless: the problem isn't knowing when to invoke the macro, the ending bang is enough for that. the problem is when to know when you have reached the end of the macro body

[05:11:27] <bstrie> bombless: I'm guessing that such a syntax cannot be done, because a macro might turn into something that implements the () operator, so you wouldn't know whether you were invoking a macro with empty arguments or whether you were trying to call the result
[05:11:37] <bombless> bstrie: https://gist.github.com/bombless/00a297c58f5bbfd7342e#file-_-rs-L6-L17
[05:11:48] <bstrie> bombless: it *might* be possible if you *require* macros with empty argument lists to omit the brackets
[05:11:54] <FreeFull> "This is a [breaking-change]. When indexing a generic map (hashmap, etc) using the `[]` operator, it is now necessary to borrow explicitly, so change `map[key]` to `map[&key]` (consistent with the `get` routine). However, indexing of string-valued maps with constant strings can now be written `map["abc"]`." Cool

[05:13:08] <bombless> bstrie: Yeah your point is very convincing, I'll think more about that.
[05:13:20] <XMPPwocky> i mean
[05:13:22] <XMPPwocky> not just no arguments
[05:13:29] <XMPPwocky> but without even parens
[05:13:33] <XMPPwocky> foo! vs foo!()

[05:14:21] <bombless> So I guess we can enforce omitting redundant round brackets.
[05:14:31] <hoverbear> Mutliple methods in scope
[05:14:32] <bstrie> XMPPwocky: it does seem quite limited in use
[05:14:47] <bombless> So I'll try do it before beta. Or we may never do that (before 2.0), bstrie.
[05:15:22] <bstrie> bombless: as XMPPwocky points out, there are not many macros that make sense to be called with zero arguments
[05:15:30] <XMPPwocky> bstrie: sure, and everybody uses parens there already

[07:57:54] <mindtree> dougxxx: oh you're totally right, what was I thinking :)
[07:58:00] <dougxxx> vramana: sorry, I'm not sure there's much of a better tutorial out there.
[07:58:25] <dougxxx> I'm planning on writing a 'use rust to write python modules instead of c' tutorial, but everytime I start, things break. :P
[07:58:42] <dougxxx> I figure I'm going to wait at least until the beta is stable.
[07:58:58] <mtsr> vramana: I recommend starting with just gfx-rs or glutin/glium. Honestly that's simpler than using the whole piston stack.
[07:59:16] <mindtree> dougxxx: I'm in a similar boat - once beta drops I'm planning on doing a "Audio and DSP development in Rust" thing

[08:00:12] <mtsr> vramana: Do a basic gameloop yourself, using while. Replace it with generators once you have that down. Use glutin or glfw-rs to create a window. Use gfx-rs or glium for opengl.
[08:00:23] <bombless> I remember there's a lazyfoo tut for rust-sdl2
[08:00:24] <mtsr> Something like that.

[11:04:51] <kmcguire> heres the info on rwlock i had lost, "In the end, from a performance point of view, RW locks should be used only when the average hold times is significant in order to justify the use of this more complex type of lock: for instance, calling a function of unknown latency or issuing an I/O while holding the lock represent good candidates. But the construct will be scalable to N threads, if and only if WRITERS are very infrequent."

[12:20:23] <ChrisMorgan> A week ago, I had two values of a type implementing Deref<Target = Vec<i32>>, and assert_eq!(&*a as *const _, &*b as *const _); worked fine. Now it gives an obscure error “<std macros>:9:3: 9:13 error: unable to infer enough type information about `_`; type annotations required [E0282]” with the span on the *left_val of the assert_eq expansion.
[12:20:47] *** Quits: ineol (ineol@moz-ofnmt7.residence.ens-lyon.fr) (Client exited)
[12:20:55] <ChrisMorgan> As far as I can see, it should know that *a is Vec<i32> so &*a is &Vec<i32> so &*a as *const _ is *const Vec<i32>.
[12:21:05] <ChrisMorgan> But apparently it no longer knows how to draw that conclusion ☹
[12:22:02] <ChrisMorgan> (Sure, it could be *const [i32] as well due to autoderef rules, but in the absence of any reason to come to that conclusion it should go with *const Vec<i32>, right?

[19:04:45] <Dirkson> Compiling a hello world binary with #[start] and #[no_std] results in a ~660kb binary. That seems pretty huge compared to what I'm used to in C. I thought the two bracket thingies would disable the Rust runtime, which I thought must be the majority of the binary, but they don't seem to. Any advice?

[23:54:33] <apoelstra> Dabo: !! that fixed it, thanks 
[23:54:38] <gsingh93> TheDan64: while I didn't find bindings, i did find this: https://github.com/jauhien/iron-kaleidoscope
[23:54:45] <apoelstra> Dabo: yeah, OsRng::new() returns an old_io Error, i'll just unwrap() it for now
[23:54:59] <Dabo> apoelstra, ok, sounds good
[23:55:00] <Dabo> !
[23:55:11] <gsingh93> there's also this issue: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues/644
[23:55:24] <mdinger> also, what happened to iterext and all those methods. i can't find them anymore.
[23:55:35] <apoelstra> Dabo: if you pm me a bitcoin address i'll send you 0.1

[23:55:45] <mdinger> *forgot the ? mark
[23:55:52] <apoelstra> i've been fighting that for hours, i had no idea what to do
[23:55:55] <Dabo> apoelstra, I think the crates.io version that you are now using should be using the new std::io instead of std::old_io as well
[23:56:05] <bluss> mdinger: did it merge with Iterator?
[23:56:06] <Dabo> apoelstra, it's fine, thank you though!

[23:56:52] <TheDan64> gsingh93: yeah, I've been looking at that too. Its pretty comprehensive
[23:57:01] *** Joins: rajat (rajat@moz-emnlcf.ca.comcast.net)
[23:57:45] <Dabo> yeah, the crates.io version of rand OsRand returns std::io::Result<> instead of std::old_io::IoResult<>

[23:58:05] <apoelstra> awesome
[23:58:11] <mdinger> bluss: I'm sorry. I misspoke. it seems it's back. i swore it was missing the other day.

[23:58:35] <mdinger> bluss: maybe it was another `*Ext`.
[23:58:52] <Dabo> yeah, I think rustc could probably have some better error messages for using the in-rustc version of a crate rather than the crates.io one, but I'm glad it's fixed!
[23:59:16] <bluss> mdinger: sliceext is gone. IteratorExt is N-ext
[23:59:22] <bluss> mdinger: I think

[23:59:53] <apoelstra> what's the canonical replacement for x.as_slice() where x is a [u8, ..1000] ?
