[00:02:06] <strcat> pcwalton: I've been wondering if there's a fast block cipher we can use instead of SipHash for integers
[00:02:20] * strcat shrugs
[00:02:22] <pcwalton> I want to make it so you can implement your own hash, for one
[00:02:34] <pcwalton> we need to reform the coherence check.
[00:02:37] <strcat> it'd be nice to still maintain the guarantee provided by SipHash
[00:02:45] <pcwalton> well, for winning benchmarks
[00:02:48] <strcat> yeah
[00:02:51] <strcat> but I mean as a default
[00:02:55] <pcwalton> right
[00:02:58] <strcat> but without being as slow as SipHash
[00:03:02] <pcwalton> I'm open to new ones
[00:03:07] <strcat> it's too bad this isn't a more active area of research :(
[00:03:22] <pcwalton> write to djb and say "give me a hash" :)
[00:03:29] <strcat> almost any block cipher would work for integers because we don't need compression
[00:03:36] <strcat> just 64-bit -> 64-bit
[00:03:38] <pcwalton> yeah

[00:04:56] <dbaupp> default type parameters would be neat for custom hashes; struct HashMap<K,V, H=RustDefaultHash> { ... }
[00:05:15] <pcwalton> I figured you'd just newtype the key for a custom hash.
[00:05:29] <strcat> yeah that's how C++ does hashes, allocators and even comparison functions for trees
[00:05:48] <strcat> we need newtype deriving
[00:06:01] <strcat> #[deriving(ArbitraryTrait, ArbitraryTrait2)] struct Foo(int)
[00:06:10] <strcat> otherwise they can be really painful in generic code
[00:06:13] <pcwalton> have to be careful to make it sound
[00:06:37] <strcat> hm, why would it be unsound?
[00:06:47] <pcwalton> all I know is that it's unsound in Haskell
[00:07:06] <pcwalton> you can use generalized newtype deriving to perform arbitrary casts
[00:07:09] <dbaupp> also, deriving would need to not be a macro.
[00:07:24] *** Quits: TimAbraldes (quassel@125EF623.B2666F0E.66399531.IP) (Input/output error)
[00:07:30] <pcwalton> the nice thing about it being a macro is that it ensures soundness
[00:07:32] <pcwalton> since it won't compile otherwise
[00:07:35] <pcwalton> in Haskell they messed it up
[00:07:44] <pcwalton> so now you can totally break the type system with generalized newtype deriving
[00:08:11] <pcwalton> nmatsakis: addressed your comment about forget
[00:08:17] <dbaupp> or, we'd have to write something like #[deriving(ArbitraryTrait("fn method_signature(&self, x: int) -> Foo"))] which is pretty horrible.

[00:13:14] <nmatsakis> pcwalton: and that will just fall out of the changes
[00:13:25] <pcwalton> yes
[00:14:02] <nmatsakis> that's neat

[00:14:24] <pcwalton> well &mut ain't IC
[00:14:27] <nmatsakis> right

[00:15:31] <pcwalton> not &mut.
[00:15:31] <nmatsakis> not &mut
[00:15:38] <strcat> ah right

[00:16:16] <aatch> heh, according to my timestamps, pcwalton and nmatsakis said that at the exact same time :D

[02:14:47] <Eridius> jack: since you've mentioned tup earlier, maybe you know the answer to this. Why does tup require FUSE?
[02:15:24] <jack> Eridius: it watches what you use to build something. It's like a magic --dep-info
[02:15:35] <jack> it also watches outputs so it can detect builds that break parallelism
[02:15:49] <Eridius> o_O that's.. interesting. I thought FUSE created new filesystems though. How does it watch an existing one?
[02:15:56] <jack> FUSE is how they implement that (though they are soon switching to dyamic library loading trickery instead)
[02:16:16] <jack> it exposes a filesytem to rustc or gcc that is backed by a proxy to the real one that can see what it's doing.
[02:17:43] <jack> Just to give you an example of its awesomeness, my lua function for building rust with tup reads lib.rs to grep the pkgid and generate the build rules. Tup automatically figures out that if you change lib.rs it needs to reparse the Tup rules.

[02:18:04] <Eridius> O_o
[02:18:14] <jack> In CMake i have to use a hack to express that dependency
[02:18:32] <jack> make has no cache, so I suspect you'd have to do that work on every invocation of make
[02:18:42] <Eridius> it sounds like if dependencies change, you have to build before it realizes that dependencies have changed. Is that not problematic?
[02:19:10] <Eridius> well, the "cache" would be something like foo.d files, which depend on the source file that you parse to generate them
[02:19:14] <jack> if you added a dependency you must have changed lib.rs or something it already knows about to add it
[02:19:14] <Eridius> (in make)
[02:19:34] <jack> otherwise the compiler wouldn't know about it :)
[02:19:41] <Eridius> jack: not necessarily. Think Go, where adding a new file to the folder adds it to the build even if nothing else necessarily references that file
[02:19:49] <Eridius> because Go builds all the files in the folder
[02:19:50] <jack> That's not true for Rust.
[02:19:56] <Eridius> right, but I'm speaking generically
[02:20:24] <jack> Yeah, you have a point in that case. Doing --dep-info for go isn't needed I suppose because find . -name '*.go' is accurate.
[02:20:44] <Eridius> foo: $(wildcard *.go)
[02:20:46] <jack> well, modulo things like include! and include_str! (assuming something like that exists in go)
[02:21:16] <Eridius>  /me isn't aware of any analogs to include! and include_str! in Go
[02:21:19] <ChrisMorgan> Eridius: that ain't recursive
[02:21:36] <Eridius> ChrisMorgan: Go isn't recursive. Subfolders are separate packages, that need to be imported to be relevant

[02:22:59] <Eridius> $(shell echo **/*.rs) ;)
[02:23:03] <jack> That's a lot of work to avoid find :)
[02:23:29] <ChrisMorgan> Eridius: that won't work consistently—the shell may not support **
[02:24:05] <ChrisMorgan> jack: but it'll work for GNU make anywhere, while using shell find depends on coreutils.
[02:24:17] <Eridius> ChrisMorgan: yeah it wasn't a serious suggestion
[02:24:22] <ChrisMorgan> On Windows in particular that may be a problem.
[02:24:28] <jack> ChrisMorgan: I know ;)
[02:24:49] <ChrisMorgan> Eridius: I don't think bash supports **, and it's the default for normal Linux and Mac OS X distributions
[02:25:35] <Eridius> ChrisMorgan: Bash 4.x does, if you turn on an option. Which is kinda stupid

[05:31:53] <strcat> now it's not going to be a PITA to do anything

[05:32:03] <strcat> eddyb: why not? ;p
[05:32:16] <strcat> eddyb: you can define malloc/free/realloc now
[05:32:18] <strcat> and rust has LTO
[05:32:23] <eddyb> unless you can have "weak symbols" in crates
[05:32:30] <eddyb> which would be awesome
[05:32:37] <strcat> eddyb: it will let you define malloc/free/realloc yourself
[05:32:44] <eddyb> yes, I know
[05:32:56] <eddyb> but I'd want to be able to "inject" rust things into a crate I'm using
[05:33:15] <eddyb> I realized weak symbols are probably the way to go (with LTO, ofc)
[05:33:32] <eddyb> oh, let's not forget to open a mopad for my thoughts
[05:34:18] <strcat> eddyb: you don't really need weak symbols
[05:34:32] <strcat> eddyb: just define malloc in your crate
[05:34:36] <strcat> and it will Just Work afaik
[05:34:43] <eddyb> yes, because it's an import
[05:34:56] <eddyb> but I'm talking about replacing things in a crate
[05:35:02] <strcat> oh
[05:35:16] <strcat> anyway allocators are still far from working
[05:35:26] <strcat> I'm thinking about just removing what I started on for now until it can actually work ;\
[05:35:27] *** Joins: pnkfelix (pnkfelix@moz-43495417.fbx.proxad.net)
[05:35:55] <eddyb> like, imagine working with std (which uses rustuv by default) and then adding the rust-rt-native crate, which replaces the runtime stuff in std with itself
[05:36:34] <eddyb> I've also thought about redefining lang items, but that's trickier (and with less prior work)
[05:37:05] <strcat> lots of frontend issues left to fix though
[05:37:14] <strcat> need a relocation-model switch
[05:37:20] <strcat> to turn off PIE
[05:37:25] <eddyb> sure, it's just a crazy awesome idea
[05:37:27] <strcat> and need a way to disable the segmented stack stuff
[05:37:51] <eddyb> like that byte-wise information waste profiler thing from last night
[05:37:53] <strcat> LLVM needs an equivalent to gcc's -fcheck-stack
[05:38:10] <eddyb> strcat: rust toggles it via the C API?
[05:38:34] <strcat> segmented stacks you mean?
[05:38:41] <eddyb> yeah

[07:22:35] <sfackler> acrichto: i've been thinking about schemes to get syntax extensions externally loadable, and it seems like there's a bit of an awkward ordering issue
[07:22:51] <acrichto> sfackler: what've you been thinking of?
[07:23:16] <sfackler> ideally, we'd just pull the external crate/lib resolution step to just before expansion, but what happens if a macro defines an extern mod?
[07:23:30] <sfackler> we could forbid that, or repeatedly resolve and expand until it converges
[07:23:36] <sfackler> but both of those seem kind of hacky
[07:23:47] <acrichto> I have thought of that before, and I'm more than ok just saying that extern mods after expansion are discarded
[07:23:57] <sfackler> that's what I was thinking as well
[07:23:58] <acrichto> others may have different opinions though]
[07:24:08] <acrichto> the other possible idea is that crates for syntax extensions are specified differently
[07:24:18] <acrichto> b/c a syntax extension needs to link against libstd
[07:24:20] <acrichto> libsyntax*
[07:24:23] <acrichto> and librustc
[07:24:26] <acrichto> but the program may not want that
[07:24:34] <sfackler> yeah
[07:24:34] <dbaupp> not necessarily librustc
[07:24:35] <acrichto> so it probably doesn't want to use extern mod to find the syntax extension
[07:24:42] <dbaupp> (since all the current ones don't use librustc.)
[07:24:51] <acrichto> ah yeah expansion is entirely libsyntax
[07:25:15] <sfackler> so theoretically the entire dependency on libsyntax should be able to be optimized out, right?
[07:25:25] <acrichto> by the linker?
[07:25:29] <sfackler> I guess
[07:25:32] <acrichto> sadly no
[07:25:43] <acrichto> libsyntax has exported symbols, so if you link to it yoiu'll link to it
[07:25:50] <acrichto> it'll be a dynamic dep in an executable as well
[07:25:58] <acrichto> I *think* that it would be able to run without it b/c it never uses it
[07:26:08] <acrichto> but it seems like a smell, b/c we'd definitely add rpath things and whatnot
[07:26:21] <sfackler> maybe it should be a different thing than extern mod then
[07:26:44] <acrichto> I'm not sure if it warrants its own syntax or if it should be just an attribute
[07:26:49] <sfackler> yeah
[07:26:54] <sfackler> #[compile_only] or something
[07:26:56] <acrichto> seems kinda odd to be just an attribute, but doesn't seem like a good enough use case for a whole new form of syntax
[07:27:05] <acrichto> #[syntax_extension(foo)]
[07:27:11] <acrichto> as a crate attribute
[07:27:18] <sfackler> that could work too
[07:27:21] <dbaupp> having a macro keyword would make exporting macros nicer, and would allow `extern macro foo;` to load them.
[07:27:36] <dbaupp> (i.e. we could write `pub macro foo ...;` rather than something weird.)
[07:27:39] <acrichto> although I think 'extern mod' as the "external crate" syntax is changing
[07:27:53] <acrichto> something about `crate` being the populare keywords
[07:28:00] <acrichto> so good at spelling
[07:28:09] <sfackler> so it'd be "extern crate"?
[07:28:21] <acrichto> I think we're dropping extern
[07:28:26] <acrichto> or at least that was the idea

[07:29:01] <acrichto> not a lot of progress on it just yet
[07:29:09] <sfackler> so it'd just be "crate extra;"?

[07:30:11] <sfackler> how about "crate! foo;" for a syntax extension crate!? /s
[07:30:51] <acrichto> oh now there's an interesting idea
[07:30:59] <acrichto> using macros to load macros
[07:31:11] <acrichto> basically how macro_rules! works right now
[07:31:20] <acrichto> that actually sounds very appropriate
[07:31:23] <acrichto> as in the right thing to do
[07:33:14] <sfackler> does syntax::ext::expand::expand_crate run multiple passes then?
[07:33:29] <sfackler> it seems like it'd have to do one to get macro definitions and another to expand, right?
[07:33:53] <acrichto> hm why would it need multiple passes?
[07:34:01] <acrichto> it would follow the same scoping rules as macros right now, no?
[07:34:13] <acrichto> crate!(..) == many macro_rules! bundled together
[07:34:35] <sfackler> yeah
[07:34:39] <acrichto> it basically just hands the current context to an external crate, which registers things
[07:36:04] <acrichto> oh I guess it couldn't use the existing filesearch infrastructure though
[07:36:06] <sfackler> I kind of with that it could allow librustc to do the crate load though
[07:36:07] <sfackler> yeah
[07:36:11] <acrichto> unless it were refactored to libmetadata

[07:36:56] <acrichto> yeah
[07:37:29] <sfackler> it seems like that'd actually require an enormous refactor of librustc and libsyntax
[07:37:51] <sfackler> ext has to be pulled out of syntax, metadata has to be pulled out of rustc, middle will probably have to come out as well
[07:38:10] <acrichto> well ext could stay in libsyntax, right?
[07:38:18] <acrichto> it's just libmetadata that needs to move from rustc into libsyntax
[07:38:25] <acrichto> at least for reachability
[07:38:46] <sfackler> iirc libmetadata depends on a bunch of random stuff throughout middle
[07:38:53] <sfackler> i was poking around last night
[07:39:10] <acrichto> oh hm maybe it would be a very large effort
[07:39:21] <sfackler> it's something that really should be done
[07:39:33] <acrichto> crate!(...) is the best idea I've heard for loading them in awhile though
[07:39:42] <sfackler> an alternative would be for the driver to provide a callback that syntax can use to load crates until that refactor
[07:40:00] <acrichto> that would work as a stopgap at least
[07:40:33] <sfackler> yeah
[07:40:58] <sfackler> i'm considering working on that big refactor over winter break, depending on how awful it will be
[07:41:36] <acrichto> lol you would be a brave man to take that on
[07:41:50] <acrichto> and we would be forever in your debt
[07:43:06] <sfackler> btw, was metadata::cstore written before methods existed or something? it's written in a kind of weird C style with free functions
[07:44:09] <acrichto> I imagine those are some of the oldest portions of the compiler
[07:46:57] <sfackler> cooleo, g2g
[07:47:51] <strcat> acrichto: we talked about macros for loading macros at some point
[07:49:03] <strcat> it turned into a bikeshed on what it should be called
[07:49:10] <strcat> macro_load! vs. macro_use! and whatever else ;p
[07:49:15] <acrichto> huh, must have missed that
[07:49:31] <acrichto> I'm glad we reached the same conclusion!
[07:49:31] <strcat> it was in #rust a month ago
[07:51:14] <acrichto> omg there are so many @-boxes in the rpass suite

[07:52:21] <acrichto> yeah
[07:52:32] <acrichto> once fns turned out to be ok
[07:52:38] <strcat> can you fix the heap alloc lints while you're at it? ;p
[07:52:46] <acrichto> they only check for types as well?
[07:53:02] <strcat> no, let me remember what's wrong with them
[07:53:25] <acrichto> hm I only see check_heap_{type, item}
[07:53:28] <acrichto> no check_heap_expr ...
[07:53:46] <strcat> well and they don't check for traits, proc, vectors
[07:54:01] <acrichto> proc?
[07:54:02] <acrichto> oh
[07:54:17] <acrichto> traits/vectors would all be caught by check_heap_expr
[07:54:25] <acrichto> eh, I may as well fix it while I'm at it
[07:54:30] <acrichto> is there a bug associated with this?
[07:55:44] <strcat> although it's questionable whether those lints are useful
[07:55:47] <strcat> acrichto: hm, maybe
[07:55:55] <strcat> I remember reporting one for vectors
[07:56:32] <acrichto> oh wait there is a check_heap_expr
[07:57:08] <ktt3ja> what happened here? bors doesn't say which test fail: https://github.com/mozilla/rust/commit/54e11796aedecbf98eba5cb1626e88228472839d#commitcomment-4841399
[07:57:40] <cmr> ktt3ja: looks like your build got interrupted :(
[07:57:54] <acrichto> new bot configuration and it appears it's actually blocking builds
[07:58:42] <ktt3ja> oh
[08:00:36] <strcat> the heap alloc ones desperately need an effects system

[12:23:03] <eddyb> ChrisMorgan: I want it badly only because it's a serious perf fix that took a couple minutes (and the main change is one line). but a couple of days later, it's still waiting

[12:57:03] <eddyb> nmatsakis: uhm... type Foo<..T> doesn't declare T as tuply, it captures multiple type params into one tuple. my example isn't bogus, and it works with my PR, *I think*. but it's kinda limited to type, because only there it's expanded before typeck
[12:58:47] <eddyb> nmatsakis: your changes make it wrong, since you're missing "expando", it should be like this: AppendTuple<..PrependTuple<..Tuple<B>, A>, C> => (A, B, C)
[13:00:35] <eddyb> nmatsakis: your "normalized" thing makes it worse than it already is, IMO. though I've thought about <(..T)> which would work like <T> but with the "tuply" constaint. that's one of the ways you can implement clone: impl<Head: Clone, (..Tail): Clone> - the Tail tuple has the Clone bound
[13:02:08] <eddyb> nmatsakis: I feel like there's some mis-communication going on, so I won't comment until we're both in IRC to discuss this a little

[14:17:08] <nmatsakis> eddyb: I'm here. A couple of thoughts:
[14:17:29] <nmatsakis> eddyb: 1. I think there is no way we can r+ this PR until we hvae a more complete design that has been hashed out and discussed at a meeting. It's a pretty major user-visible change to the type system with potentially large ramifications.
[14:17:48] <eddyb> I agree with that
[14:17:58] <eddyb> (even though I may not like the implications)
[14:18:18] *** Joins: w3lcome (Mibbit@moz-E9ABA59E.home.otenet.gr)
[14:18:42] <nmatsakis> eddyb: 2. I'll re-read what you wrote again. I think I may prefer my interpretation :) but of course that's the purpose of having fleshed out designs, so we can debate the specifics and alternatives.
[14:19:19] <nmatsakis> eddyb: also, not sure what you meant by "stealth commented"
[14:19:47] <eddyb> there's certain ways you can expand from my original design, but allowing to pass a tuple or multiple parameters is a bad idea, you're denying several use cases
[14:19:53] <eddyb> nmatsakis: just that I didn't see it :)
[14:19:57] <nmatsakis> ah ok :)
[14:20:00] <eddyb> and you didn't ping me on IRC
[14:20:25] <eddyb> dbaupp: this made it worse than it was before my fix :( http://huonw.github.io/isrustfastyet/mem/#aa4455e,820271d
[14:20:55] <dbaupp> eddyb: yes
[14:21:04] <eddyb> is that just for the snapshots, or is, let's say, rustc-stage1 unaffected?
[14:21:30] <nmatsakis> eddyb: I'm not sure that I'm denying use casees so much as enabling them. As I said, let's flesh it out. Best is probably to add comments to the issue, I think, with examples you think ought to work and so on
[14:22:12] <eddyb> nmatsakis: well, is Fn<(A, B), R> a function with two arguments or a tuple one?
[14:22:13] <dbaupp> eddyb: I don't know; it looks like it's all in the linker (possibly caused by these lines: https://github.com/mozilla/rust/commit/820271df1c3d7899460c0fa25c1a7cf74d45d431#diff-5bb596c9f589759bef3b0b31f5505d2eR319 )
[14:23:04] <eddyb> oh, so it's for everyone?
[14:23:37] <eddyb> haha, this is so derpy http://huonw.github.io/isrustfastyet/mem/#f817ed3,29ca435
[14:24:00] <eddyb> that square thing
[14:24:11] <cmr> zoom in
[14:24:30] <eddyb> omg
[14:24:39] <cmr> each of them is a single lib
[14:24:44] <cmr> (all in the linker)
[14:25:10] <eddyb> and this is a fluke http://huonw.github.io/isrustfastyet/mem/#29ca435,ad292ac
[14:25:33] <eddyb> unless there was a snapshot in here http://huonw.github.io/isrustfastyet/mem/#29ca435,ad292ac,f817ed3
[14:26:07] <eddyb> this is just wrong http://huonw.github.io/isrustfastyet/mem/#3c399f6,0d9c0c9
[14:26:45] <eddyb> the memory usage is unrelated to the PRs after that point
[14:26:53] <dbaupp> it's not entirely deterministic
[14:27:08] <dbaupp> (it == memory usage and the recording of it.)
[14:27:44] <eddyb> it's quite random since static linking/LTO
[14:28:02] <eddyb> measure some entropy if you want to :P
[14:28:13] <cmr> well the recordnig of it is as accurate as the kernel gives me
[14:29:34] <dbaupp> but, e.g., the timings change each run

[18:56:48] <brson> 1) servo may be using timers on the spidermonkey thread or the ui thread, and the spidermonkey thread for now at least needs to be not a green thread
[18:57:05] <brson> 2) i'm not sure whether spidermonkey depends on thread-local data or not
[18:57:49] <brson> the eventual plan for the js task is to make it a green thread so that it has fast message passing, but spidermokney is blocking, so when we do that we need to dynamically expand the work-stealing pool
[18:58:19] <brson> *if* spidermonkey depends on thread-local data then we either need to modify it to not do that or pin it to a specific scheduler
[18:58:51] <cmr> acrichto: the comments you've left scattered about in rustdoc's html rendering are hilarious
[18:59:11] <brson> cmr: link?
[18:59:13] <cmr> sec
[18:59:17] * brson love cheeky comments

[19:00:03] <cmr> brson: https://github.com/mozilla/rust/blob/master/src/librustdoc/html/render.rs#L379
[19:00:06] <acrichto> brson: they're all failing on the android bot which bors is then failing the whole PR for
[19:00:30] <acrichto> brson: also so in the future we're going to want a green scheduler which onlyhas one task which can block?
[19:00:40] <acrichto> b/c 1:1 threads have fast message passing now
[19:00:49] <acrichto> at least as fast as mutexes/cvars can do

[19:03:40] <brson> acrichto: no i don't think we will want a green scheduler that only has one task since we have 1:1 tasks, but we *may* want to be able to pin green tasks to a single scheduler (while allowing other tasks to run on that scheduler)
[19:03:45] <brson> i'm not sure
[19:04:23] <brson> jdm: does spidermonkey use thread-local data?
[19:04:30] <jdm> brson: yes
[19:04:45] <jdm> at least, it certainly has in the past
[19:04:49] <acrichto> brson: I suppose, this is gonna be really hard to expose in a std api though b/c 1:1 has no conept of pinning
[19:05:11] <brson> acrichto: it can be private for servo
[19:05:15] <brson> if we have to
[19:05:26] <acrichto> I suppose you can pin a thread to an os cpu
[19:05:38] <acrichto> the only concern I know of is for homing
[19:05:48] <acrichto> otherwise this is entirely a libgreen concern
[19:05:52] <brson> we also have the ability to modify spidermonkey. we'll have to figure out what the tradeoffs are
[19:06:22] <brson> for now though spidermokney has to be on an os thread though so it's not an immediate concern
[19:06:46] <acrichto> hm, I can remove a fair bit of code if we don't have the notion of a task home
[19:06:52] <acrichto> should I leave it all in for now or remove it?
[19:07:24] <brson> if it's not hard to maintain i think it would be prudent to leave it in, port servo to not use it, then remove it
[19:07:32] <brson> there may be complications
[19:07:59] <acrichto> hm, ok I think I may leave it in
[19:08:05] <acrichto> I will add lots of libgreen tests for it
[19:08:12] <acrichto> but you will not be able to actually exercise the code at all
[19:08:16] <acrichto> outside of libgreen

[20:23:05] * acrichto wants to write net bindings for libnative
[20:26:10] <Eridius> hrm, why is select() in its own mod instead of in std::comm?
[20:26:27] <acrichto> b/c I didn't want to clutter up std::comm
[20:27:07] <Eridius> also it looks like select() requires a Port, not a GenericPort.
[20:27:34] <acrichto> you're going off my pull request, right?
[20:27:58] <Eridius> no I'm looking at current docs
[20:28:06] <acrichto> ah, then nevermind then
[20:28:15] * Eridius is trying to figure out how to deal with the absence of linked task failure when task failure needs to be detected while listening on a port
[20:28:39] <Eridius> I was hoping I could select() the port and the TaskFuturePort, but TaskFuturePort isn't select-able
[20:28:47] <Eridius> s/TaskFuturePort/TaskResultPort/
[20:30:07] <Eridius> I'm hoping that if I use a regular Port/Chan combo, the taks failure destroys the Chan which closes the Port. But I don't see how that would work if I needed SharedChan
[20:32:47] <acrichto> brson: looks like bors is still killing pull requests
