[00:01:50] <fmtq> niconii: that's ® again
[00:02:17] <fmtq> also depends on jurisdiction and category of trademark
[00:02:20] <fmtq> and what the mark itself is
[00:02:26] <Tiffany> the vast, vast majority of bugs with this codebase to date have been deletion-unsafe linked list iteration
[00:02:27] <fmtq> TM law is stupid as fuck
[00:02:39] <Tiffany> like, any time there's some kind of fucked up data desync, or memory-related crash of any kind
[00:02:41] <Tiffany> that's what it was
[00:02:46] <niconii> lovely
[00:03:02] <Tiffany> and there's not really any macros defined for common linked list ops
[00:03:07] <Tiffany> they're just halfassedly done wherever
[00:03:21] <Tiffany> I set those up, but transitioning the codebase is something to be done slowly
[00:04:26] <Tiffany> I would like to use a less insane hashing algorithm too
[00:04:41] <Tiffany> there's only one bcrypt impl I know of though
[00:04:46] <Tiffany> and I don't like it
[00:05:03] <Tiffany> it's literally meant to be used as part of the OS's crypt() function
[00:05:07] <Tiffany> and I think it is, on a few platforms
[00:05:18] <Tiffany> it's distributed as a tarball, rather than as a repository
[00:05:21] <niconii> (kinda reminds me of this codebase i'm porting; all of the stack operations are just done manually by shifting the stack pointer around)
[00:05:55] <Tiffany> I'd also like to replace the serialization which is currently batshit
[00:06:01] <Tiffany> so like
[00:06:10] <Tiffany> usually, and I do mean 'usually'
[00:06:18] <Tiffany> the file format is key<tab>value
[00:06:25] <Tiffany> and strings are ~ terminated
[00:06:29] <Tiffany> not zero terminated, mind you
[00:06:31] <Tiffany> ~ terminated
[00:06:37] <Tiffany> you can't use ~ in any string that is saved to disk
[00:06:58] <niconii> nice
[00:07:03] <Tiffany> and then, depending on what code is parsing the file, $ is a sort of record separator
[00:07:11] <Tiffany> on its own line
[00:07:23] <Tiffany> there are no abstractions for parsing this format
[00:07:31] <Tiffany> literally everything that saves files to disk implements the format by itself
[00:07:42] <niconii> wow
[00:07:43] <Tiffany> there are a few convenience functions, like fread_number and fread_string
[00:07:55] <Tiffany> but that's it
[00:08:03] <FreeFull> Well, DOS had $ terminated strings
[00:08:43] <Tiffany> I tried to switch to sqlite for one isolated subsystem but I got caught up writing my own ORM
[00:08:50] <Tiffany> and got rather overwhelmed
[00:10:53] <Tiffany> an sql database is definitely the way to go
[00:10:58] <Tiffany> but dealing with raw sqlite is awful
[00:11:09] <Tiffany> like, you don't get useful error messages
[00:11:14] <Tiffany> it returns error codes
[00:11:20] <Tiffany> which translate to extremely vague strings
[00:11:22] <Tiffany> like constraint failure
[00:11:24] <Tiffany> or syntax error
[00:11:34] <Tiffany> they mean basically nothing
[00:12:08] <Tiffany> it would hammer the crap out of the disk too

[00:14:38] <fmtq> meteorjs exists.
[00:14:38] <lahwran> are you just being an idiot to be an idiot?
[00:14:40] <Tiffany> was how hard it would be to rip out the SQL engine from sqlite
[00:14:46] <Tiffany> and build something based on capn proto on top
[00:14:47] <fmtq> couchdb exists
[00:14:49] <fmtq> mongodb exists
[00:14:52] <fmtq> what does this offer that they don't?
[00:14:59] <Tiffany> all of the good parts of sqlite
[00:15:00] <lahwran> it's mongodb that works
[00:15:02] <Tiffany> with none of the bad parts
[00:15:16] <lahwran> mongodb is well known for being badly designed with no improvement in sight
[00:15:27] <Tiffany> seeing how it has such thoroughly tested mechanisms for maintaining indexes and tables and paging and ACID transactions
[00:15:42] <lahwran> but since you don't seem to be open to actual discussion and just want to hate things, I'm not going to try to convince you
[00:15:54] <lahwran> Tiffany++
[00:16:16] <Tiffany> someone in #rust-crypto also wanted to build a database with rows based on capn proto structs
[00:16:42] <Tiffany> doing the actual database in capn proto wouldn't be very useful though
[00:17:00] <Tiffany> since you can never free anything
[00:17:03] <lahwran> well, cap'n proto is specifically designed to be used as both the storage and runtime format
[00:17:07] <Tiffany> without rewriting the file
[00:17:17] <lahwran> sorry?
[00:17:31] <Tiffany> capn proto message builders
[00:17:41] <Tiffany> structs can only be created, not destroyed
[00:17:52] <Tiffany> at least, in the current implementation
[00:17:57] <lahwran> um what
[00:18:06] <Tiffany> it uses a bump allocator
[00:18:22] <lahwran> wait in ram?
[00:18:28] <lahwran> I thought we were talking on disk
[00:18:44] <Tiffany> capn proto message buffers are not specific to memory or disk
[00:18:47] <Tiffany> you could do them in an mmap
[00:18:53] <lahwran> I'm lost
[00:19:04] <lahwran> I thought we were talking about a database
[00:19:17] <Tiffany> you can't use capn proto to write the database itself
[00:19:18] <lahwran> a typical construction of a database is to store the database content on disk
[00:19:20] <Tiffany> only individual rows
[00:19:22] <lahwran> oh
[00:19:34] <lahwran> yes, that seems reasonable

[06:29:57] <ChrisMorgan> It is helpful if you understand what it all is, but you may well only need to know the expansion of n choose 2.

[06:47:08] <eddyb> eeek that notation looks ugly
[06:47:13] <theme> eddyb, are you sure that's O(k)?
[06:47:17] <eddyb> (n-k+1...n).product() * (1...k).product()
[06:47:20] <eddyb> theme: at worst
[06:47:21] * theme doesn't think that looks Ok
[06:47:24] <eddyb> LOL
[06:47:36] <eddyb> erm, that should be a division
[06:47:53] <eddyb> I am not too clear on why it's always an integer
[06:48:04] <theme> eddyb, did you mean O(n!)?
[06:48:15] <eddyb> no?
[06:48:39] <JustAPerson> O(n!)
[06:48:41] <JustAPerson> the horror
[06:48:54] <eddyb> I should've said "you can do it in at most 2*k multiplications"
[06:48:56] <ChrisMorgan> O(n!) is close enough to O(∞)
[06:49:18] <eddyb> oh, derp, the product of k consecutive numbers are divisible by k
[06:49:24] <eddyb> (because at least one of them is a multiple of k)
[06:49:30] <JustAPerson> for values of n>69, pretty sure it is on f64s :3
[06:49:45] <eddyb> and also divisible by anything smaller than k
[06:50:26] <ChrisMorgan> eddyb: wouldn’t it be O(n), for k < n?
[06:50:33] <eddyb> ChrisMorgan: why?
[06:50:37] <eddyb> ChrisMorgan: you never need to compute n!
[06:50:45] <eddyb> doing so is pretty dumb
[06:50:49] <ChrisMorgan> (s/for/because/ to clarify my ambiguity.)
[06:50:55] <ChrisMorgan> Oh, of course.
[06:51:16] <eddyb> it's a highschool junior level trick
[06:51:51] <eddyb> (at least in our education system's math curriculum)
[06:51:58] * ChrisMorgan was just forgetting the intricacies of dealing with binomials that he learned more than five years ago
[06:52:12] * ChrisMorgan hasn’t needed to use that sort of maths much since then
[06:52:53] *** Joins: fkaa (tundmatu@moz-501od2.business.telia.com)
[06:53:21] <eddyb> okay, so, there's a way to compute binomial coefficients that fit in a given integer size even if n! doesn't fit
[06:53:36] <eddyb> even if n!/(n-k)! doesn't fit
[06:54:58] <eddyb> wait, I can't seem to do it without saving k bits somewhere
[06:55:48] <c74d> the quantity of possible pairs of (one element from a set of `n` elements) and (one element from a set of `m` elements) is simply `n × m`, right?
[06:56:07] <eddyb> c74d: yeah, but that includes duplicates
[06:56:25] <c74d> hm?
[06:56:33] <eddyb> wait, no
[06:56:42] <eddyb> that's a cartesian product
[06:57:37] <c74d> oh, this is assuming that the two sets don't share any elements.
[06:58:20] <eddyb> ChrisMorgan: the trick being to find distinct multiples of each of 1...k in n-k+1...n and divide the latter value before multiplying it into the accumulator
[06:58:22] <theme> eddyb, C(n, k) = C(n-1, k-1) + C(n-1, k-1)
[06:58:38] <theme> for k != 0 and k != n and n != 0
[06:58:43] <eddyb> theme: oh, that thing
[06:59:01] <eddyb> theme: how many additions does it require?
[06:59:05] <eddyb> c74d: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_product
[06:59:09] <theme> eddyb, O(n^2)
[06:59:20] <eddyb> c74d: where tuples come from
[06:59:33] <eddyb> theme: I think I can do it in O(k) with k bits of state
[06:59:38] <theme> not going to be a lot if the result is going to fit in u64
[06:59:59] <theme> eddyb, are you sure the big-O is right?
[07:00:12] <eddyb> wait wait
[07:00:21] <theme> wait, nvm
[07:00:37] <eddyb> the naive approach I was thinking of is O(k^2) with k bits of state
[07:00:37] * theme thinks about bignums and factoring numbers
[07:00:49] <eddyb> but you can probably use a k-sized sieve to do this
[07:00:49] <theme> maybe store the prime factors?
[07:00:50] <c74d> eddyb: oh, I was only thinking of ‘×’ as “multiplication X”.
[07:01:03] <c74d> (oops?)
[07:01:10] <eddyb> c74d: you can multiply sets
[07:01:58] <c74d> …although that looks like exactly what I meant, more technically-put.

[12:31:39] <ChrisMorgan> And that makes me think of the Chrome-only web system that I was working on a year ago that crashed the graphics driver on my old laptop (this was a few days before my new laptop was due to arrive).

[12:32:12] <huon> nice
[12:32:16] <ChrisMorgan> It didn’t crash it in Firefox, but it also kinda didn’t work properly there…

[15:22:25] <eddyb> Tiffany: was there a pointless debate about what is and what isn't a memristor?
[15:22:58] <Tiffany> probably because people are still fruitlessly arguing whether they break the laws of thermodynamics
[15:23:09] <Tiffany> and, well
[15:23:18] <Tiffany> I have yet to see anyone present a viable way to mass manufacture the things

[18:14:49] <Astrum|Lap> speaking of, I need to check out how Elm is doing
[18:14:50] <cmr> I think they should render into a buffer to be composited by the host application.
[18:15:03] <Tiffany> have you seen what doom 3 does for UI, cmr?

[18:15:22] <cmr> I hve not.
[18:15:31] <Tiffany> http://simonschreibt.de/gat/gat-doom-3-hdui/
[18:15:57] <Tiffany> I am going to do this in my own UI library, I think
[18:16:05] <Astrum|Lap> cmr: into a buffer on the host (CPU)?
[18:16:12] <Tiffany> harfbuzz is just as amenable to doing layout on quads in 3D space as it is to pixels on CPU-side compositing
[18:16:41] <cmr> Astrum|Lap: into a buffer wherever; either on the host or a mapped texture.
[18:17:01] <Astrum|Lap> it has to go to the GPU regardless tbh
[18:17:02] <eddyb> grrrrr
[18:17:05] <eddyb> error: cannot infer an appropriate lifetime for lifetime parameter `'a` due to conflicting requirements
[18:17:08] <eddyb> fuck you too, regionck
[18:17:20] <cmr> sure, rendering into a mapped texture is totally fine.
[18:17:32] <Astrum|Lap> that's awesome, Tiffany 
[18:18:12] <Tiffany> one thing I'm wondering about is how high resolution the glyph textures should be
[18:18:35] <Tiffany> presumably you want to use 1-bit textures because of the built-in interpolation, so that saves a lot of space for resolution
[18:19:31] <Tiffany> I suppose 64x64 would be okay
[18:19:43] <Tiffany> a texture array of the 96 ascii printables would be 50 kilobytes
[18:20:04] <Tiffany> even 256x256 would be under a megabyte
[18:20:21] <Tiffany> dealing with languages like japanese and chinese massively inflate the GPU memory used though
[18:20:27] <Astrum|Lap> ugh, I wish I had time to work on some of this stuff
[18:20:34] <cmr> build the glyph map dynamically
[18:20:40] <cmr> don't load characters that aren't rendered
[18:20:45] <Tiffany> well that much is obvious
[18:20:56] <Tiffany> but how many characters do you expect to see in a typical scene?
[18:20:56] <cmr> so I'm not sure why it's an issue?
[18:20:56] <eddyb> I would build a texture per codepage
[18:21:03] <Tiffany> in japanese, there are about 3000 commonly used kanji
[18:21:06] <Tiffany> in chinese it's even worse
[18:21:16] <eddyb> so that you don't even need to switch the texture when working with ASCII
[18:21:25] <Tiffany> oh
[18:21:33] <Tiffany> 3000 256x256 glyphs is only 24 megabytes
[18:21:34] <Tiffany> nevermind
[18:21:44] <Astrum|Lap> we live in the future, we have lots of memory =P
[18:22:01] <Tiffany> I'd use a TEXTURE_2D_ARRAY
[18:22:16] <Tiffany> although the glyphs will be of varying sizes
[18:22:21] <eddyb> and you can hope that adjacent glyphs are from the same codepage
[18:22:34] <eddyb> Tiffany: there's metrics for that, if you don't mind some wasted space
[18:22:59] <Tiffany> the state switching overhead of a texture per glyph or per codebase would be kind of dumb
[18:23:06] <Tiffany> you need to be able to batch it

[18:23:19] <fkaa> signed distance fields perhaps?
[18:23:21] <fkaa> those are fun
[18:23:27] <Tiffany> holy fuck
[18:23:40] <Tiffany> this document would have been so much more useful when I first started doing text rendering
[18:23:55] <cmr> (https://www.valvesoftware.com/publications/2007/SIGGRAPH2007_AlphaTestedMagnification.pdf is the distance field paper)
[18:24:00] <Tiffany> I hate how even when good documentation exists, you can never find it
[18:24:06] <fkaa> how big is freetype?
[18:24:26] <cmr> I dunno, freetype's website is pretty navigable IMO...
[18:24:35] <eddyb> I used google :P
[18:26:04] <eddyb> fkaa: huh, this is cool
[18:26:07] <Tiffany> I have developed a habit of avoiding tutorials
[18:26:10] <Tiffany> because they're usually really awful
[18:26:33] <Tiffany> this doesn't even feel like it should be called a tutorial
[18:26:45] <eddyb> no it should not
[18:27:17] <eddyb> grrr mibbit is stupid
[18:27:31] <eddyb> it opened the PDF in Google Docs :|
[18:28:19] <GaryOak_> chrome
[18:32:35] <Lurkin> You know, learning rust on it's own is damn near impossible as a complete noob.  But if you use the book alongside some of the c or c++ tutorials it makes more sense.  
[18:32:43] <Lurkin> What kind of wall am I going to  hit learning rust this way?
[18:34:27] <Lurkin> So far I figured that it all generates asm and machine code, and that all ends up being mostly the same really, but when the website says "rust does these things better" I have no frame of reference to compare what it's actually doing better.
[18:34:48] <bluss_> using C++ tutorial to learn Rust? I hope that's not needed
[18:34:57] <Lurkin> eddyb ^ That last sentence is a good example of using "really" unnecessarily.
[18:34:59] <Lurkin> More C.
[18:35:06] <Tiffany> I don't think you can really appreciate why rust is the way it is without learning C++
[18:35:17] <Tiffany> I certainly didn't
[18:35:53] <cmr> I don't think I would have
[18:36:04] <cmr> but I've been doing C longer than I've been doing anything else, so...
[18:36:12] <cmr> (with a spattering of C++)
[18:37:11] <Lurkin> bluss yesterday I compiled my first thing it was a driver for a stupid chip I needed to use.
[18:37:20] <Hannibal_Smith> Lurkin, a good C++ book can teach you C++ without prior knowloadge of C
[18:37:34] <Hannibal_Smith> So I can't see why Rust will need some knowloadge of C++
[18:37:35] <Lurkin> So if you have more experience than me then you probably won't need to do what I did.
[18:37:54] <Lurkin> So I'm going about this in an acceptable fashion?
[18:38:23] <cmr> I feel like it's reasonable.
[18:38:25] <Hannibal_Smith> IMHO Lurkin the real problem is that C++ community had some really capable people investing times in writing some really good books
[18:38:31] <fmtq> I don't know C++
[18:38:39] <cmr> Getting systems knowledge needs to come from *somewhere*, and the book doesn't have everything.
[18:38:40] <Hannibal_Smith> The book is a good start
[18:38:41] <fmtq> I did it at university but that was under duress 
[18:39:03] <fmtq> C is enough 
[18:39:12] <Hannibal_Smith> But hardly is comparable to real great books like http://www.stroustrup.com/programming.html
[18:39:29] <fmtq> peh books
[18:39:33] * fmtq shoots a book 
[18:40:03] <Hannibal_Smith> IMHO you can't learn C++ without a good book
[18:40:04] <Lurkin> IMO the hardest part about rust and the book isnt the lack of information but a lack of understanding where/what the information means in the scope of the problem you are trying to solve.
[18:40:11] <Tiffany> I've been doing C for years cmr
[18:40:18] <Tiffany> I started doing C++ a bit after getting into rust
[18:40:31] <fmtq> void* sadface = new_sadface();
[18:40:36] <Hannibal_Smith> Lurkin, yes that is why books like the one I passed before
[18:40:40] <Hannibal_Smith> Are cleary better
[18:40:54] <Hannibal_Smith> And as is normal, Rust lacks
[18:41:00] <Astrum|Lap> Hannibal_Smith: I'd say learning C++ well is difficult regardless
[18:41:02] <cmr> C was the first language I "really learned", I quit learning python at first because it stood in the way of understanding how the computer works.
[18:41:14] <fmtq> haha
[18:41:16] <Tiffany> lua was the first language I really learned
[18:41:17] <Astrum|Lap> books help, but you really need to work with someone who knows the language
[18:41:19] <fmtq> I did it in reverse.
[18:41:26] <Astrum|Lap> beyond that you will make horrible mistakes and not even know it

[18:45:04] <fmtq> some assfuckmcdouche just sat on the chair behind me
[18:45:07] <Astrum|Lap> she rambled on for like an hour
[18:45:07] <fmtq> and it's pressing up against mine
[18:45:10] <fmtq> so I moved forward, AND HE MOVED IT BACK
[18:45:14] <fmtq> SO IT WOULD PRESS AGAINST IT AGAIN
[18:45:17] <fmtq> WHO DOES THAT
[18:45:23] <Lurkin> SOCIALIZED SPACE!
[18:45:29] <fmtq> communist chairing
[18:45:38] <fmtq> now some fucking kid is staring at me
[18:45:40] <fmtq> that's just not the done thing here 
[18:45:44] <fmtq> I ought to stare back 
[18:45:52] <Lurkin> Do what I do.
[18:45:52] <fmtq> that's probably considered even more fucked up in Sweden 
[18:46:00] <Lurkin> Look at him and say with a serious face "Are you fucking stupid?"
[18:46:03] <Lurkin> Be calm.
[18:46:10] <fmtq> this is Sweden 
[18:46:13] <fmtq> I have no idea where you are from 
[18:46:22] <fmtq> but if you did this here, they might just politely answer yes.
[18:46:24] <fmtq> and continue
[18:46:35] <Lurkin> You can't break eye contact.
[18:46:44] <Lurkin> Shame that motherfucker into giving up his chair space.
[18:46:57] <fkaa> why are there so many swedes here
[18:46:58] <fmtq> you are how American?
[18:47:10] <fmtq> I am not a Swede
[18:47:14] <fmtq> I just happen to be _in_ Sweden
[18:47:24] <fmtq> hence my flashy style and inability to keep glass out of my feet
[18:47:54] <Lurkin> How american?  Like on a scale of 1/Murica?
[18:48:21] <Lurkin> I'm like 86% about 'Murica.
[18:48:22] <Astrum|Lap> best scale ever
[18:48:42] <bluss_> Anything over 10% murica is unhealthy
[18:48:46] <Lurkin> I love this country, I love the people, even the stupid ones, I can't fn stand the federal gov't.
[18:49:01] <Lurkin> I'm a Statesman pure and simple.
[18:49:19] <fmtq> so you're an idiot
[18:49:22] <fmtq> understood
[18:49:38] <Lurkin> I think you don't understand what it means to be about a state.
[18:49:44] <Lurkin> There's 50 of them in America.
[18:49:51] <Astrum|Lap> 50.5
[18:49:57] <Lurkin> Fair enough Astrum|Lap 
[18:49:58] <fmtq> a rounding error of states
[18:50:16] <Lurkin> No Puerto Rico is on it's way in.
[18:50:24] <Astrum|Lap> well...
[18:50:25] <fmtq> it voted against statehood
[18:50:30] <fmtq> in a referendum
[18:50:31] <fmtq> a year ago.
[18:50:38] <fmtq> tell me more about the US 
[18:50:42] <bluss_> It seems it would only be right to have it be a state
[18:50:47] <bluss_> but it's not my issue, I'm from
[18:51:03] <bluss_> SWEDEN föck ja
[18:51:10] <fmtq> secret Dane
[18:51:26] <eddyb> > IMHO you can't learn C++ without a good book
[18:51:27] <bluss_> hehe
[18:51:29] <Lurkin> It's still a US territory, it's only a matter of time.
[18:51:45] <fmtq> Lurkin: the Philippines was a US territory.
[18:51:53] <Astrum|Lap> fmtq: I don't really keep up with puerto rico
[18:51:59] <eddyb> fiction is cool. programming from books? get real :P
[18:52:04] <fmtq> Astrum|Lap: you didn't start this, so you're fine.
[18:52:06] <Astrum|Lap> but I haven't heard of them rejecting statehood
[18:52:14] *** Joins: swgillespie (swgillespie@moz-1i5.3un.220.167.IP)
[18:52:16] <Lurkin> Start this?
[18:52:31] <fmtq> oh wait, you're right 
[18:52:40] <fmtq> it did vote for statehood
[18:52:47] <fmtq> there were two questions
[18:52:49] <Astrum|Lap> it passed in 2012
[18:53:02] <fmtq> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rican_status_referendum,_2012
[18:53:03] <fmtq> yeah 
[18:53:07] <Astrum|Lap> so it's 50.5, because we haven't really said okay
[18:53:07] <fmtq> I'm not so good at time lapse 
[18:53:16] <Hannibal_Smith> eddyb, how would you start learning C++?
[18:53:17] <fmtq> yes 
[18:53:24] <fmtq> The governor-elect Alejandro García Padilla of the Popular Democratic Party (PPD) and several other leaders who favor the present status had recommended voting "Yes" to the first question, and leaving the second question blank as a protest to what they said was "an anti-democratic process" and "a trap".[5]
[18:53:35] <fmtq> IT'S A TRAP 
[18:53:46] <Astrum|Lap> lol
[18:54:21] <GaryOak_> At this point in history, I wouldn't join the United States
[18:54:31] <eddyb> Hannibal_Smith: I learned C++ by playing with one of the more expansive hobby OSes out there (mostly a kernel, really)
[18:54:48] <eddyb> not sure if there are IRC logs of me back then, but it went something like "eww all those ::"
[18:54:55] <Astrum|Lap> GaryOak_: ehhh....
[18:55:00] <Astrum|Lap> we're still a wealthy country
[18:55:10] <eddyb> Astrum|Lap: who do you think you're fooling :P?
[18:55:12] <Lurkin> We're not just wealthy, we're about to go through another industrial revolution.
[18:55:15] <Astrum|Lap> and globalization is a pretty good consolidating force
[18:55:33] <Astrum|Lap> (war is too...)
[18:55:38] <eddyb> you have some wealthy people and corporations, but the country is fucked
[18:55:48] <fmtq> even the Crimean referendum was more straightforward the Puerto Rico's
[18:55:49] <GaryOak_> Business Owners are wealthy, everyone else is not
[18:55:54] <fmtq> than* 
[18:55:54] <Astrum|Lap> eddyb: no, our country is still quite wealthy
[18:56:07] <fmtq> but keep up the narrative of democracy yeah yeah 
[18:56:13] <Astrum|Lap> there definitely is a growing wealth inequality problem
[18:56:17] <fmtq> GaryOak_: corporatism fuck yeah
[18:56:22] <fmtq> corporatism by defintiion is fascism :D
[18:56:39] <Astrum|Lap> but overall we have plenty of money
[18:56:46] <Astrum|Lap> especially if you compare us to puerto rico
[18:56:55] <Lurkin> Plenty of money, plenty of opportunity to grow, and plenty of will to do so.
[18:56:55] <Astrum|Lap> who, from my understanding, is considerably poorer
[18:57:00] <fmtq> did you just compare the entire US 
[18:57:01] <GaryOak_> yeah our poverty and crumbling infrastructure show that to be clear :P
[18:57:02] <fmtq> to PR
[18:57:10] <fmtq> a country that isn't a country 
[18:57:26] <Astrum|Lap> fmtq: well I was talking about PR becoming a state
[18:57:31] <Astrum|Lap> so... yeah, pretty relevant
[18:57:39] <Lurkin> GaryOak_, where I'm from we're about to start the biggest construction project in the last 10 years.
[18:57:44] <fmtq> "The US economy is strong than this rotting tomato in the sun." 
[18:57:49] <fmtq> ergh 
[18:57:54] <fmtq> can't even type with glass lodged in my foot 
[18:58:02] <fmtq> y u do dis glass
[18:58:15] <Tiffany> to spite you for stepping on it?
[18:58:22] <Lurkin> The federal gov't is the reason the country is f'd right now.
[18:58:23] <Astrum|Lap> GaryOak_ said PR shouldn't join, I said we are wealthy and PR is not, I would still join if I were PR
[18:59:18] <Astrum|Lap> I'm not saying the US is great or anything
[18:59:19] <GaryOak_> I don't know Puerto Rico's situation, so I can't comment, but if I was a sovereign nation I would not join the US
[18:59:25] <Lurkin> A lot of it has to do with gerrymandering and the fact that nobody votes for congress or senate, and the electoral college makes it so that iowa florida and I think massachusets have chosen the executive office since reagan.
[18:59:28] <Astrum|Lap> I'd classify my opinions as... extreme...
[18:59:42] <Astrum|Lap> GaryOak_: they're not sovereign
[18:59:56] <GaryOak_> Then they should escape!
[19:00:02] <Astrum|Lap> escape to where?
[19:00:12] <eddyb> deep space
[19:00:19] <GaryOak_> haha
[19:02:22] <Astrum|Lap> anyway, doesn't really matter I suppose
[19:04:22] <Lurkin> Someday we will roll as "Earth"
[19:04:37] <GaryOak_> as the last man dies in a bunker
[19:04:47] <GaryOak_> or woman if you like
[19:04:58] <Lurkin> Man you guys like to hate America and are pessimistic as hell.
[19:04:58] <GaryOak_> or human if you're into that
[19:05:15] <Astrum|Lap> Lurkin: you probably don't want to know my opinion on democracy then, hehe
[19:05:34] <Lurkin> I'm a libertarian Astrum|Lap, democracy doesn't work.
[19:05:52] <Astrum|Lap> democratic republic
[19:05:53] <Astrum|Lap> whatever
[19:06:01] <GaryOak_> I'm a socialist, democracy works, capitalism doesn't
[19:06:33] <Astrum|Lap> actually I've changed my opinion on democracy fairly recently
[19:06:38] <fmtq> haha
[19:06:40] <Astrum|Lap> I like questioning my beliefs constantly
[19:06:40] * fmtq popcorn
[19:07:01] <fmtq> Astrum|Lap: have you ever left America
[19:07:09] <Lurkin> fmtq have you ever been?
[19:07:12] <Astrum|Lap> fmtq: yes
[19:07:20] <Astrum|Lap> albiet to mexico...
[19:07:20] <fmtq> Astrum|Lap: Canada does count only a little 
[19:07:23] <fmtq> haha 
[19:07:30] <fmtq> Mexico, the non-functioning state
[19:07:46] <fmtq> such cartel 
[19:07:49] <Astrum|Lap> my qualms with democracy run a lot deeper than this country
[19:07:52] <Lurkin> Dude's never even been stateside Astrum|Lap, this conversation is more pointless than it usually is.
[19:08:08] <Astrum|Lap> meh, I don't mind
[19:08:13] <niconii> i was a libertarian once, back when i was like... 16
[19:08:16] <fmtq> people actually say "stateside"?
[19:08:26] <fmtq> why
[19:08:39] <Astrum|Lap> niconii: what made you change your mind if I may ask
[19:08:43] <Tiffany> freedomside
[19:08:53] <niconii> stopped giving a shit about politics
[19:08:53] <Astrum|Lap> ^
[19:08:53] <fmtq> silverside 
[19:08:56] <Astrum|Lap> much better, Tiffany 
[19:09:03] <Astrum|Lap> niconii: that'll do it, hehe
[19:09:14] <GaryOak_> Frenchfryside
[19:09:15] <Lurkin> That's as libertarian as it gets niconii.
[19:09:19] <Tiffany> I'm a libertarian
[19:09:47] <fmtq> which is a meaningless term like most lower-cased political terms
[19:10:00] <Astrum|Lap> lower-cased?
[19:10:01] <GaryOak_> I see a lot of devs identify as libertarian
[19:10:02] <Astrum|Lap> oh
[19:10:05] <Astrum|Lap> nm
[19:10:06] <Tiffany> it's not meaningless
[19:10:21] <fmtq> it has a disambiguation page longer than all of its definitions
[19:10:25] <Tiffany> just kind of fuzzy
[19:10:40] <Lurkin> It means I have a gun and I expect you have a gun so we'll be polite to eachother because when it comes down to it we will both ensure we have our right to live breathe and worship as we see fit.
[19:10:51] <Lurkin> That's libertarian.
[19:10:59] <Lurkin> To ensure your own rights.
[19:11:09] <GaryOak_> I see it as, "I have a gun, why don't you have a gun?"
[19:11:13] <niconii> eesh
[19:11:14] <Astrum|Lap> personally I just think opinions are overrated (yes, I see the hypocracy)
[19:11:26] <fmtq> antisocialism
[19:11:26] <eddyb> Lurkin: isn't that MAD?
[19:11:32] <Tiffany> the disambiguation page for libertarianism is not very long, actually
[19:11:39] <fmtq> Tiffany: it was a metaphor.
[19:11:48] <fmtq> don't go to wikipedia for academic political science
[19:11:52] <fmtq> it goes very downhill very fast
[19:11:53] <Lurkin> No it's not eddyb, it's learning from your mistakes.  All war is MAD.
[19:12:01] <Tiffany> do you expect political terms to mean the same thing between countries?
[19:12:12] <fmtq> but quite simply, libertarian has a popular meaning in the US that doesn't map to the rest of the world
[19:12:21] <fmtq> but that's changing now, as everything Americanises.
[19:12:21] <Lurkin> fmtq you've never even been here.
[19:12:25] <niconii> Lurkin: yeahhh i'm anti-guns in general
[19:12:33] *** Quits: spider-mario (spidermario@moz-coblcf.fbx.proxad.net) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[19:12:33] <Tiffany> what does it mean outside the US?
[19:12:34] <GaryOak_> The problem with libertarianism is "I'm a well off white person, why aren't you?"
[19:12:46] <fmtq> Tiffany: it depends.
[19:12:47] <niconii> Lurkin: whatever your definition of libertarianism is, it's not what i agree with
[19:12:48] <Lurkin> niconii I would be anti guns if nobody ever had a gun or weapon, but since they exist...the cat's out of the bag.
[19:12:50] <fmtq> like liberalism.
[19:12:54] <Tiffany> niconii: the thing about being anti-guns is that it usually means being anti-guns-for-people-who-aren't-criminals-or-police
[19:13:03] <Lurkin> +1 Tiffany 
[19:13:08] <fmtq> liberalism usually refers to either economic liberalism or neoliberalism (both considered right wing) 
[19:13:16] <fmtq> whereas it's considered left wing in the US
[19:13:35] <fmtq> libertarianism is a category of several doctrines, some which are left and some that are right.
[19:13:37] <Lurkin> If you can ensure the destruction of all arms niconii I would be anti weapon too.
[19:13:56] <Lurkin> Please tell me more fmtq, can you summarize wiki for us?
[19:14:09] <niconii> Tiffany: the thing about being pro-guns is it ignores the fact that anywhere else, gun violence is not a big issue
[19:14:18] <GaryOak_> We should have a corpatism vs populism in the US, but instead we talk about guns 
[19:14:27] <fmtq> Chomsky defines social libertarianism as anarchy, his preferred style of existence 
[19:14:34] <fmtq> which is like parallel to the common definition in the US 
[19:14:42] <fmtq> so even within the US there's different strains of thought.
[19:14:50] <Lurkin> The thing about being antiguns niconii is you are ignoring that guns already exist.  You ignore evidence that lack of guns just means higher stabbings.
[19:15:00] <niconii> Tiffany: well, besides mexico. but that's because they get guns from us
[19:15:03] <fmtq> guns isn't even a problem. It's stupid people.
[19:15:09] <fmtq> and a culture that makes holding a gun "cool" 
[19:15:14] <Tiffany> why are you splitting things up left and right fmtq
[19:15:14] <Lurkin> Guns are a tool, bad people will always have guns, criminals will always have guns, why shouldn't the everyday citizen? 
[19:15:25] <Tiffany> libertarianism is beyond your one dimensional political model
[19:15:32] <fmtq> Tiffany: because that's how American politics is polarised.
[19:15:38] <Lurkin> Because he doesn't know anything about this country beyond /r/politics and /pol/ from his armchair
[19:15:49] <Astrum|Lap> bleh, only thing I'll say about guns is the fact that suicide makes up a large portion of gun deaths
[19:16:02] <Tiffany> niconii: is gun violence a big issue here?
[19:16:11] <Tiffany> there are statistics from the CDC about how most people die
[19:16:13] <Lurkin> If it wasn't guns might it be pills instead Astrum|Lap?
[19:16:16] <Tiffany> most people die from heart disease, not guns
[19:16:19] <Tiffany> ban heart disease!
[19:16:24] <Tiffany> and from car accidents
[19:16:25] <Tiffany> ban cars!
[19:16:26] * fmtq returns to popcorn
[19:16:29] <Astrum|Lap> Lurkin: might be, I'd say we should focus on mental health
[19:16:34] <Astrum|Lap> you know... help people
[19:16:36] <Lurkin> I agree completely Astrum|Lap!
[19:16:37] <eddyb> Astrum|Lap: gimme some
[19:16:45] <Lurkin> I support socialized healthcare and infrastructure.
[19:17:03] <Lurkin> But that's it, and welfare but I'm personally working on eliminating a need for foodstamps.
[19:17:13] <Tiffany> http://www.cdc.gov/injury/wisqars/pdf/leading_causes_of_death_by_age_group_2012-a.pdf
[19:17:30] <eddyb> Astrum|Lap: "don't go MAD"
[19:17:43] <Tiffany> welfare is hard
[19:17:48] <Astrum|Lap> eddyb: what?
[19:18:00] <eddyb> BAD PUN
[19:18:01] <eddyb> that's what
[19:18:06] <Tiffany> if you add cutoff points where people stop getting social benefits, it presents a ceiling
[19:18:13] <Lurkin> I don't worry about welfare queens, we make way too much money to worry about the little bit of money we spend on it.
[19:18:17] <Tiffany> you end up having to deny a $2k bonus because it would kill your foodstamps
[19:18:25] <Tiffany> uh
[19:18:39] <Tiffany> social security and healthcare together compromise literally just under 50% of the US's 3.4 trillion dollar national budget
[19:18:48] <eddyb> I thought basic income was the magical solution :P
[19:18:52] <eddyb> ohai http://makezine.com/2015/05/07/next-thing-co-releases-worlds-first-9-computer/
[19:18:55] <Tiffany> I like UBI, eddyb
[19:18:57] <Tiffany> but it's hard
[19:19:00] <Tiffany> it's a logistical nightmare to setup
[19:19:03] <Lurkin> Social security and healthcare are subsidizing PROFITABLE businesses.
[19:19:05] <Tiffany> like, in order to provide UBI to the US
[19:19:08] <Tiffany> you need $2.9 trillion dollars a year
[19:19:18] <fmtq> negative income tax is the easiest model 
[19:19:21] <Tiffany> and you can't just use the existing tax source
[19:19:27] <Tiffany> because iirc most of it comes from income tax
[19:20:01] <Astrum|Lap> I find most dividing issues in american politics are pretty silly and are indicators of underlying issues
[19:20:03] * GaryOak_ yells States should be responsible for their own people!
[19:20:16] <Lurkin> Tiffany, do you think/agree that healthcare is mostly expensive because of insurance?
[19:20:29] <Tiffany> I haven't looked into the details of what makes healthcare expensive
[19:20:35] <Tiffany> but I do know that it has a ridiculous amount of inefficiency
[19:20:40] <Lurkin> My woman is Type 1 diabetic.
[19:20:42] <Tiffany> because other countries get better healthcare with far less
[19:20:50] <fmtq> [21:19] <Astrum|Lap> I find most dividing issues in american politics are pretty silly and are indicators of underlying issues
[19:20:56] <GaryOak_> Doctor's have to pay liability insurance, so insurance companies win on both ends

[19:29:13] <Tiffany> eddyb: something I realised about the US economy recently is how a lot of it would probably dry up under UBI
[19:29:20] <Tiffany> more than 2/3 of the jobs in the US are in the services industry
[19:29:46] <Lurkin> 2/3's of jobs can be automated...ouch.
[19:29:49] <Tiffany> a lot of people would quit their jobs at mcdonalds, and a lot of people would start living off of UBI instead of working, so less people would be going to restaurants
[19:30:10] <eddyb> OMG America could live healthily
[19:30:15] <eddyb> WHAT A FUCKING DISASTER
[19:30:17] <fmtq> ^5
[19:30:18] <Tiffany> undesirable but necessary jobs like garbage disposal would have wage increases
[19:30:26] <bluss_> UBI is universal basic income.. ahh
[19:30:39] <bluss_> Tiffany: UBI is only for citizens?
[19:30:44] <aji> http://is.gd/okBeaN hahaha going on 24th hour awake and this is hilarious
[19:30:45] <Tiffany> but undesirable yet unnecessary jobs like manning grocery stores, restaurant employees, cashiers, and so on, they'd all dry up
[19:30:49] <Tiffany> and it's not exactly unexpected
[19:30:54] <Lurkin> UBI is a bad idea, what needs to happen is folks need to reduce their dependance on currency.
[19:31:03] <Tiffany> during recessions, a lot of these jobs dry up as well
[19:31:13] <Tiffany> during the 2008 recession, the unemployment rate hit 11%
[19:31:17] <bluss_> I've found this problematic, I don't want even more difference between citizens and non-citizens (like UAE)
[19:31:18] <Tiffany> it's at 9% now
[19:31:22] <Tiffany> it was 4 or 5% before
[19:31:30] <WindowsBunny> UBI?
[19:31:34] <Tiffany> note that unemployment doesn't go up over time
[19:31:35] <Lurkin> Mincome WindowsBunny 
[19:31:37] <Tiffany> it goes up around recessions
[19:31:47] <Tiffany> there was a nasty one in the early 80s that was worse than the 2008 recession
[19:31:56] <WindowsBunny> Lurkin: Oh, one of those things similar to the Basic Income Guarantee
[19:32:26] <Lurkin> Yeah, it's a joke, look how well gov't managed social security.
[19:32:33] <Tiffany> that means producing nationalised services for everything lurkin
[19:32:37] <Tiffany> and those tend to work out poorly
[19:32:44] <Lurkin> We already have that Tiffany 
[19:32:49] <Tiffany> no we don't
[19:32:50] <WindowsBunny> You have to realize, those jobs are going to wash away anyway
[19:32:55] <WindowsBunny> a lot of jobs will wash away
[19:32:57] <WindowsBunny> due to robots!
[19:33:18] <Lurkin> Yes we do, we allow gov't sanctioned monopolies to exist such as energy companies for electricity.
[19:33:21] <Tiffany> we have many utility companies, several internet service providers, and very many grocery stores, farms, and so on
[19:33:32] <eddyb> WindowsBunny: ohai did you see the numbers?
[19:33:33] <Tiffany> they're regulated, but they aren't outright owned by the government
[19:33:40] <Lurkin> The difference being?
[19:33:41] <WindowsBunny> eddyb: Which numbers?
[19:34:01] <Tiffany> we have more than one of them
[19:34:05] <eddyb> WindowsBunny: you can emulate a human brain in the same space as a medium pizza
[19:34:10] <Tiffany> and there is still the meekest hint of competition
[19:34:12] <Lurkin> That have gov't sanctioned price fixing.
[19:34:14] <WindowsBunny> eddyb: neat!
[19:34:54] <Tiffany> is there government sanctioned price fixing and monopolies on farms?
[19:34:57] <Tiffany> or grocery stores?
[19:35:02] <Tiffany> because there weren't, last I checked
[19:35:03] <Lurkin> On farms sort of.
[19:35:09] <Tiffany> sure, there's shit like monsanto
[19:35:15] <eddyb> WindowsBunny: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9501119
[19:35:21] <Lurkin> Uhh, corn is subsidised by the gov't more than anything else in this country.
[19:35:48] <Tiffany> being subsidised isn't the same as having the government run every industry necessary to providing subsistence for the population
[19:35:55] <Tiffany> like, the magnitude of what you're suggesting
[19:36:22] <Lurkin> The market is controlled by the government how is it that much further of a jump to demand they produce x amount of goods?
[19:36:54] <Lurkin> They already to it with corn subsidies.  Corn is our greatest weapon, we use it to destabilize foreign economies with cheap goods.
[19:37:07] <Lurkin> Ala the "Americanization" fmtq was talking about earlier.
[19:37:10] <eddyb> hahahahahaha
[19:37:13] <GaryOak_> and sugar subsidies, and most agriculture
[19:37:23] <eddyb> if you've seen Interstellar, you know what's coming
[19:37:35] <Tiffany> I haven't seen interstellar
[19:37:40] <eddyb> goddamit Tiffany 
[19:37:41] <Tiffany> it's not on netflix and I don't feel like pirating it
[19:37:43] <cmr> It's a good movie, one of my favorites at this point.
[19:37:51] <Lurkin> In a capitalistic society there is not much difference between gov't operated and gov't subsidized industry.
[19:37:57] <GaryOak_> Global warming will kill Agriculture! #bioterrorism
[19:37:59] <cmr> The premise is a bit weak and the science is lol but it's a good movie.
[19:37:59] <Lurkin> I haven't seen it either.
[19:38:28] <Tiffany> government operated industry has no incentive to innovate
[19:38:35] <Tiffany> government subsidized industry at least has some
[19:38:45] <Lurkin> Infrastructure doesn't require innovation it requires stability.
[19:38:49] <eddyb> how about
[19:38:51] <Lurkin> Private sector does the innovation.
[19:38:55] <GaryOak_> free-market has no incentive other than making money
[19:38:58] <eddyb> people are fucking bored out of their minds?
[19:39:19] <Tiffany> would private sector farming still exist when in every product they get undercut by government operated farms?
[19:39:27] <Lurkin> It doesn't.
[19:39:35] <cmr> excuse me?
[19:39:41] <Tiffany> garyoak: you don't just magically make money
[19:39:43] <cmr> Of course it exists.
[19:39:54] <Tiffany> you have to do something to make money
[19:39:58] <cmr> Almost all the vegetables I eat are from local, private farms.
[19:40:02] <Lurkin> Find me a private corn farm that either doesn't get gov't money for it's corn
[19:40:08] <cmr> ok, they don't grow corn, sure.
[19:40:10] <Lurkin> That's not the same thing cmr
[19:40:15] <GaryOak_> Tiffany: that's debatable, fiat currency
[19:40:16] <Lurkin> Produce isn't grain
[19:40:27] <Lurkin> cmr that localization is the future of food production.
[19:40:33] <Tiffany> garyoak: pick an industry and go make a profitable business
[19:40:48] <Tiffany> you have to innovate in order to compete in a market
[19:40:56] <Tiffany> well, usually
[19:41:03] <Tiffany> not always
[19:41:05] <GaryOak_> I'm not saying you don't have to innovate to make money
[19:41:27] <Lurkin> You have to compete if supply is greater than demand.
[19:41:29] *** Quits: bluss_ (bluss@moz-ec5o68.cust.bredbandsbolaget.se) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[19:41:39] <Tiffany> if you can do something that makes you money, it is incentivised by the free market
[19:41:47] <Lurkin> I mean demand is greater than supply.
[19:41:53] <Tiffany> innovation can get you on top of the competition, and make you money
[19:41:59] <Tiffany> therefore, innovation is incentivised by the free market
[19:42:02] <Lurkin> You don't have to be on top to make money.
[19:42:12] <Lurkin> You have to make more than 54k a year to beat the mean income in the US.
[19:42:30] <Lurkin> Making 55k a year puts you in the top 2% of wealth in the world assuming no debt.
[19:42:34] <Astrum|Lap> woo, I'm average!
[19:42:48] <Lurkin> And rich comparatively!
[19:42:56] <Astrum|Lap> nah, I have student loans

[19:43:53] <Astrum|Lap> but meh
[19:45:13] <Lurkin> There is so much new technology and software to be built and played with right now.  Never has the bar been lower to do something great.
[19:45:28] <Astrum|Lap> ehhhhhh
[19:45:41] <Tiffany> depends on what you're trying to do
[19:45:48] <Tiffany> if you're trying to start a telecom, you're fucked royally
[19:46:04] <Tiffany> I'd say it's between $5 and $10 billion to make a telecom startup
[19:46:23] <Lurkin> You have to build up to that kind of moolah.
[19:46:36] <Astrum|Lap> well let's be honest, Tiffany, nobody wants better telecoms, otherwise the market would provide!
[19:46:37] * Astrum|Lap runs
[19:46:38] <GaryOak_> AT&T and Comcast didn't spring up over night
[19:46:55] <Tiffany> AT&T sprung up before all the regulations were in place
[19:46:59] <Tiffany> in fact, it's the source of most of them
[19:47:05] <Lurkin> If you make a telecom technology worth actually having you bet your ass somebody would buy it.
[19:47:43] <GaryOak_> What happened to that streaming TV service Aereo?
[19:47:48] <Tiffany> American Telephone and Telegraph, est. 1885
[19:47:56] <Lurkin> Shut down by the gov't.
[19:48:07] <Lurkin> Their "Extra long antenna" argument didn't hold up.

[19:50:02] <Lurkin> And it's all about the cell towers now.
[19:50:04] <Tiffany> well, shut down by court order after losing a lawsuit to "American Broadcasting Companies, Inc.", not exactly by the government
[19:50:15] <Lurkin> "Court order"
[19:51:31] <Tiffany> that is a really strenuous association you're making
[19:52:07] <Lurkin> What?
[19:52:20] <Lurkin> ABC brings the complaint, the judge rules, the judge is part of the...government.
[19:52:21] <Tiffany> if they hadn't been sued, the government would not have done anything
[19:52:29] <Tiffany> they were upholding the enforcement of the judgement of the courts
[19:52:58] <Tiffany> when your video gets deleted off of youtube because it's a pirated copy of a song, you don't say the government shut down your video
[19:53:07] <Tiffany> you say that youtube deleted it, or that the company that owns the song took it down

[19:54:01] <Lurkin> There is no way to say the government did not enable ABC or whoever with DMCA legislation.
[19:54:14] <Tiffany> enabling is not the same as doing
[19:54:22] <Tiffany> ABC were the ones who initiated the action
[19:54:39] <Tiffany> if the government had done it, the case would have been "US v. Aereo, Inc."
[19:54:47] <Tiffany> not "American Broadcasting Cos. v. Aereo, Inc."
[19:55:14] <Lurkin> The judge could have thrown the case out of court.
[19:55:29] <Tiffany> the judge enabled the result, they did not do initiate it
[19:55:48] <Lurkin> They did initiate it, they created the initial law the complaint was addressing in the first place.

[19:57:10] <Tiffany> so say someone decides to rob a bank because their friend was willing to launder the money afterwards, and they only robbed the bank because this option was opened up
[19:57:17] <Tiffany> the resulting case would be a criminal conspiracy against both
[19:57:28] <Tiffany> the one who offered to launder the money would not be accused of robbing a bank, the both of them would
[19:57:37] *** Joins: larhat1 (Adium@moz-tb1ulb.cable.virginm.net)
[19:57:39] <Tiffany> and the one who robbed the bank is the one who actually committed the crime
[19:57:54] <Lurkin> This is different, this is physical theft not IP law.
[19:58:01] <Tiffany> it was an analogy
[19:58:09] <Tiffany> enabling is not the same as doing
[19:58:42] <Lurkin> Umm....ok you can be right this time, but you can't bring a compliant unless somebody is doing something illegal...which is defined by the government.
[19:58:56] <Tiffany> besides, saying that every time someone loses a lawsuit that "the government did it" is uselessly vague
[19:59:18] <Tiffany> like, what good does it say to say the government did it?
[19:59:25] <Lurkin> Dude
[19:59:26] <Tiffany> it doesn't really say anything meaningful
[19:59:46] <Tiffany> you might as well just drop government altogether
[19:59:48] <Tiffany> say "they did it"

[20:05:00] <Tiffany> like, I tried navigating the BLS website to find out how the ratio of services sector jobs to other kinds of jobs has changed over time

[20:05:12] <Tiffany> and worse, I couldn't find raw datasets to produce such a chart

[20:05:47] <Tiffany> I've found posts on tumblr which show these pretty charts and citations and everything

[20:06:44] <eddyb> I had two 'a connected
[20:07:08] <eddyb> and I guess it makes sense why it didn't work, because reborrowing is shallow and I had these two references in a tuple

[20:13:04] <cmr> that doesn't even count as a channel
[20:13:10] <cmr> it's only used for pasting links during triage meetings.
[20:13:16] <bluss> Astrum|Lap: pointing out fallacious arguments sounds like it belongs in #-politics
[20:13:59] <Tiffany> no true rustie
[20:14:07] <Lurkin> So the best thing to do is to have most of everything as a global variable right?  Just keep packign them in there up top?

[20:54:15] <bluss> why didn't the doctor just take a scalpel and get it out?
[20:54:19] <bluss> lazy
[20:54:44] <cmr> or a chainsaw or something
[20:54:46] <fmtq> because he suggested that it would do more harm than good
[20:54:52] <fmtq> the hole in my foot is <1mm
[20:55:01] <fmtq> it just hurts disproportionately due to placement
