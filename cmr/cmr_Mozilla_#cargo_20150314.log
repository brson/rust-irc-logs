[06:28:56] <Dabo> How hard would it be to have build.rs generate a full cargo crate, and have the current crate depend on it?
[06:29:49] <Dabo> I could have build.rs generate it in some static location, like generated-dependencies/, but if it would be possible to generate a full crate with Cargo.toml in a sub-folder of $OUT_DIR, then depend on it dynamically, that'd be pretty great

[06:56:38] <huon> Dabo: what are you trying to do?
[06:57:22] <huon> its possible to generate all the content of a crate, and the main file is just a single include!("...")
[06:58:19] <Dabo> huon, I'm generating code which may have additional crates.io dependencies, which my binary doesn't directly depend on
[06:59:43] <Dabo> if there was a way to at compile time add dependencies, that would work too
[07:00:04] <huon> ah
[07:00:39] <huon> AFAIK, you just have to the deps in your main Cargo.toml at the moment
[07:00:45] <Dabo> ok :/
[07:02:22] <Dabo> I'd like to do this just to be able to have people add a self-contained "plugin" file to the repository, then build.rs would be able to generate a Cargo.toml with any dependencies the plugin has (defined in comments), and add the plugin as a dependency - code to run it could be included with include!(), but allowing plugins to have dependencies separately would be nice
[07:02:28] <huon> makes sense
[07:02:53] <huon> filing an issue against rust-lang/cargo would be a reasonable way to make progress :)
[07:03:05] <Dabo> ok, will do!
[07:03:22] <Dabo> I'm not what exactly sure the best way to implement it would be, but I'll make an issue anyways xD

[08:09:52] <Ilari> frogmella: 'mount' should show it (if it does not have entry for '/home', then take the entry for '/'.
[08:10:30] <Ilari> frogmella: Signature mismatch... I presume that means the packfile is corrupt too.
[08:11:28] <frogmella> well i think i will set up new VM
[08:11:35] <frogmella> thanx for your time
[08:11:58] <frogmella> but one question - should i uninstall rust every time i get nightly?
[08:12:20] <Ilari> frogmella: The nightly installer should uninstall the previous version.
[08:12:37] <frogmella> ah ok, thank you again
[08:13:11] <Ilari> frogmella: This doesn't look like old version not uninstalled properly. This looks most likely like data corruption.
[08:15:04] <Ilari> frogmella: For some reason the local copy of index repo is corrupted. Could be that libgit2 wrote corrupt data or the data has gotten corrupted afterwards.
[08:18:40] <frogmella> heh fixed with by deleting registry
[08:18:52] <frogmella> after your brilliant post about data corruption
[08:18:54] <frogmella> ^^
[08:20:16] <frogmella> what is this registry thing exactly?
[08:20:44] <frogmella> all repos for rust dependencies
[08:20:46] <Ilari> frogmella: Contains some metadata about crate versions (like checksums).
[08:20:54] <Ilari> frogmella: For crates.io
[08:21:24] <frogmella> hehe, now i know what to do if something bad happens
[08:21:29] <frogmella> just delete registry and reinstall
[08:21:50] <Ilari> frogmella: Well, no need to reinstall if registry is corrupt.
[08:22:06] <frogmella> ah, true, just cargo update
[08:22:09] <frogmella> or build
[08:24:51] <Ilari> Here cargo takes about a second to rebuild the index (index deleted first).
[08:25:35] <frogmella> well, i must say rust have great community
[08:25:41] <frogmella> here on irc
[08:25:47] <frogmella> every time i ask i get help
[08:26:06] <Ilari> Looks like the packfile is ~3.7MB.

[19:19:56] <psd_> when I run |cargo test|, it first builds the packages and tries to execute the tests on the binaries, right? 
[19:22:14] <Ilari> psd_: AFAIK, The internal tests and tests/*.rs stuff.
[19:24:06] <psd_> Ilari, are you talking about which tests are run?
[19:25:07] <Ilari> psd_: Yeah.
[19:26:43] <psd_> Ilari, I was actually trying to add a release argument to the cargo test command, (#691). I am unable to figure out where should I enable optimization for testing.
[19:27:06] <psd_> isn't testing with release argument just the same as testing on release build?

[19:29:46] <Ilari> Should be the same, except integration tests (the tests/*.rs) need to be built too (of course at release profile).

[19:37:13] <psd_> Ilari, Okay, thanks :)
[19:41:45] <Ilari> Also, is there a command to build just the library and any examples, but not tests? It seems that 'cargo build' doesn't do examples, and 'cargo test' does tests too?

[19:44:40] <psd_> Ilari, sorry, I don't know :)
[19:47:03] <Ilari> Help for 'cargo build' has '--lib', which means "build only library". But even without it, examples don't look to be built.
