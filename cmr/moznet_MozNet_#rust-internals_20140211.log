[00:45:32] <aepsil0n> would this be feasible technically?
[00:45:33] <cmr> acrichto: it *never* gave stacks back out?
[00:45:40] <acrichto> brson: schedulers hold on to something around 10 stacks, and the theory is that they're used to allocate new stacks, but a small bug never handed the stacks back out

[01:26:25] <vadimcn> acrichto: regarding compiler-rt, after reading discussions on llvm-dev last week, I think it might be prudent to try to figure out what is the roadmap for it
[01:26:40] <vadimcn> there was talk about changing its' build system and whatnot
[01:26:48] <cmr> I hope they do
[01:26:55] <cmr> LLVM's build system is incomprehensible
[01:27:25] <vadimcn> also, somebody suggested that libunwind should be moved from cxxabi to compiler-rt, which would be great for us
[01:27:31] <acrichto> vadimcn: oh dear, 
[01:27:35] <acrichto> libunwind, yay!
[01:27:41] <acrichto> we can't build cxxabi at all
[01:27:58] <acrichto> vadimcn: so I found out just now that building compiler-rt is blazingly fast
[01:28:06] <acrichto> I don't think we need to worry *too* much about upstreaming patches
[01:28:12] <acrichto> I'd be comfortable merging now, that is
[01:28:28] <acrichto> I still think that we need to link all programs to it by default like with using morestack
[01:28:42] <vadimcn> without libunwind in it we'd be still dependent on libgcc
[01:28:51] <acrichto> it's just a whole bunch of stub functions, there's no need for it to be dynamic
[01:28:54] <vadimcn> except on OSX maybe
[01:29:00] <acrichto> only for libgcc_s, right?
[01:29:08] <acrichto> we wouldn't actually be using libgcc at all (in theory)
[01:29:22] <acrichto> libgcc_s would probably use libgcc, but we wouldn't have a direct need for libgcc
[01:29:27] <vadimcn> we'd be using libunwind implementation inside it 
[01:29:39] <acrichto> that's just libgcc_s though, and yeah we'd have to keep using that
[01:29:57] <acrichto> vadimcn: you may be able to include https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/12031 as well
[01:30:03] <acrichto> that will prevent using linking to libgcc with the linker
[01:30:25] <acrichto> it failed due to not finding things inside of compiler-rt I believe, but if we use our own compiler-rt that's fine
[01:30:30] <acrichto> or at least I think it should be
[01:30:57] <acrichto> for comparison clang on osx links to libclang_rt.osx.a which I assume has compiler-rt inside of it
[01:31:07] <vadimcn> whaddayamean "just libgcc_s"?
[01:31:24] <acrichto> libgcc_s is the one that has the libunwind symbols
[01:31:30] <acrichto> (or so I am led to believe)
[01:31:37] <vadimcn> it has the rest of libgcc too
[01:31:51] <acrichto> that's just an unfortunate dependency though
[01:32:04] <acrichto> we're not directly depending on it at all once we're using compiler-rt
[01:32:51] <vadimcn> not sure I understand your definition of "directly depending" :)
[01:33:30] <vadimcn> for example of windows we'd need to ship libgss_s_dw1-1.dll with Rust binaries
[01:33:47] <acrichto> I'm not considering that libgcc, though
[01:34:02] <vadimcn> what is "libgcc" then?
[01:34:16] <acrichto> oh I would consider that to be the libgcc.dll itself
[01:34:23] <acrichto> I think of libgcc != libgcc_s
[01:35:17] <vadimcn> I thought that libgcc_s.{so|dll} is just a shared version of libgcc.a
[01:35:33] <acrichto> if that's true, then all I'm saying is moot
[01:35:42] <vadimcn> at least on Windows this is the case
[01:36:02] <acrichto> regardless, I agree that we need a dependency on libgcc_s for unwinding
[01:36:10] <acrichto> but that doesn't mean that we need a dynamic dependency on libcompiler-rt
[01:36:56] <vadimcn> ok, if you think it's worth it, let's merge it
[01:37:29] <vadimcn> I can add -lcompiler-rt in link.rs
[01:37:46] <acrichto> I was playing around and I came up with https://gist.github.com/alexcrichton/8927784
[01:38:02] <acrichto> we'll need to start distributing it through installations and whatnot
[01:38:08] <acrichto> basically treat it the same way as libmorestack
[01:39:32] <vadimcn> sounds fine
[01:40:33] <vadimcn> I suspect it'll need work to make it compile on OSX and 64-bit platforms
[01:40:46] <acrichto> it compiled as-is on osx for me
[01:40:51] <acrichto> osx 64 bit
[01:40:56] <acrichto> lemme check 32-bit osx
[01:41:57] <acrichto> vadimcn: yeah builds just fine on 32-bit osx
[01:41:59] <acrichto> (amazingly)
[01:42:05] <vadimcn> huh
[01:42:19] <vadimcn> ok, do you want me to apply your patch on top of my PR?
[01:42:31] <acrichto> nah just squash it in to some previous commits
[01:42:37] <acrichto> no need to retain authorship or anything
[01:42:51] <acrichto> huh, apparently it provides gcc_personality_v0
[01:43:00] <vadimcn> it does
[01:43:50] <acrichto> could you try adding https://github.com/alexcrichton/rust/commit/b37700ccc2c1e8b806a407857c66cddb2fe84dbe on top of these commits as well?
[01:44:11] <acrichto> I suspect it will start working once we provide libcompiler-rt
[01:44:16] <acrichto> but I could be wrong (easy to peel off)
[01:44:22] <vadimcn> ok
[01:44:43] <vadimcn> On a related note, do we want to make a private fork of libunwind too?   Or should I try to lobby for its' inclusion in compiler-rt?
[01:45:28] <acrichto> I was never able to build libunwind on windows, so that's our first step
[01:45:34] <acrichto> inclusion in compiler-rt would be amazing though
[01:46:15] <brson> what's in our compiler-rt fork?

[04:39:50] <sfackler> acrichto: ping
[04:45:14] <acrichto> sfackler: pong
[04:46:13] <sfackler> I've been looking into that phase(syntax) segfault i mentioned a couple of days ago and it's getting pretty weird
[04:46:26] <sfackler> it appears to only happen to a rust install built by homebrew
[04:46:36] <sfackler> which I assume actually means a rust install that lives behind symlinks
[04:46:51] <sfackler> do you have any idea what why that would be?
[04:47:10] <sfackler> the rustc::metadata debug logging seems to be finding the right crates
[04:47:27] <acrichto> whoa that's weird
[04:47:34] <acrichto> I haven't heard of anything related to that
[04:47:56] <sfackler> yeah
[04:48:14] <sfackler> it's also bizzare that dlopen (appears) to be returning success, but the macros are never registered
[04:48:43] <sfackler> and the segfault happens in some anonymous function in the task infrastructure
[04:48:48] <sfackler> maybe at task exit @ cleanup?
[04:49:03] <acrichto> sfackler: you're sure that homebrew isn't picking up a local rust installation?
[04:49:25] <acrichto> I forget, but what was the backtrace agai?
[04:49:26] <acrichto> again*?
[04:49:28] <sfackler> doesn't seem like it

[04:52:19] <acrichto> sfackler: that is a tiny backtrace
[04:52:25] <acrichto> does it run ud2?
[04:52:29] <acrichto> what's the instruction it points at?
[04:53:55] <sfackler> 0x1000a2243: movq  (%rax), %rax
[04:54:13] <sfackler> ud2?
[04:54:59] <acrichto> ud2 is what llvm lowers intrinsics::abort to
[04:55:05] <acrichto> it's some undefined instruction in x86
[04:55:12] <acrichto> that's highly suspicious
[04:55:20] <acrichto> the module is never unloaded, right?
[04:55:57] <sfackler> it's unloaded when its definitions exit scope
[04:56:09] <acrichto> that sounds suspicious
[04:56:26] <acrichto> is this a fancy syntax extension?
[04:56:28] <sfackler> I initially leaked the libraries, but that seemed a bit sad
[04:56:28] <sfackler> yeah
[04:56:37] <sfackler> https://github.com/sfackler/rust-phf
[04:56:37] <acrichto> I don't think you can safely unload
[04:56:46] <acrichto> b/c things like the tydesc are stored in the crate you dlopen
[04:56:53] <acrichto> and once you dlclose the tydesc disappears
[04:57:07] <acrichto> and if it's a Gc'd thing with a cycle it'll attempt to read the tydesc when the task exits
[04:57:23] <acrichto> same idea if you store anything in local_data
[04:57:48] <sfackler> I'll make that change, but I think there's a deeper issue
[04:58:01] <sfackler> since the phf_macro doesn't end up being registered
[04:58:12] <sfackler> so it's like the macro registrar function is never called (properly)
[04:58:19] <acrichto> hm, that's weird
[04:58:37] <acrichto> so this dies before the extension even runs?
[04:59:28] <sfackler> nope, 1 sec
[04:59:43] <sfackler> https://github.com/sfackler/rust-postgres/issues/29#issuecomment-34496813
[05:00:14] <sfackler> it gets all the way past the expansion phase until the task fails due to the errors
[05:00:23] <acrichto> oh!
[05:00:36] <acrichto> the libsyntax the compiler is using is different from the libsyntax you're linking against
[05:00:51] <acrichto> this is the stage1/stage2 problem
[05:00:54] <acrichto> I think
[05:01:25] <acrichto> the libsyntax you're linking to is generated by the stage2 compiler, while the libsyntax the stage2 compiler is using was generated by the stage1 compiler
[05:01:42] <acrichto> which could in theory have subtle differences
[05:01:51] <acrichto> I forget exactly why, but that may be related to this problem
[05:01:58] <sfackler> true, but the same would be true for a non-homebrew build
[05:03:47] <sfackler> speaking of that, how painful would it be to change the rustc binary to use the stage2 libs? it'd remove the need to have 2 sets in the install
[05:04:10] <acrichto> not too painful I don't think
[05:04:24] <acrichto> in theory you just want to install the stage3 compiler with the stage2 libs
[05:04:30] <acrichto> and then everything that everyone uses is the same
[05:04:34] <sfackler> right
[05:04:46] <sfackler> or regigger the build order so the stage2 compiler uses the stage2 libs
[05:04:59] <acrichto> what generates the stage2 libs?

[11:13:58] <eddyb> can someone send https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/12162 to try?
[11:14:27] <eddyb> I guess I'll run a few run-pass tests myself, to see if nothing is seriously broken
[11:14:39] <eddyb> why is it compiling stage2 libsyntax?

[11:15:33] <eddyb> I don't remember it doing that before, when running make rustc-stage1
[11:16:44] <eddyb> lol, libfourcc
[11:16:48] <flaper87> :P
[11:19:04] <flaper87> eddyb: re libsyntax, it did that before, IIRC
[11:19:21] <eddyb> only libfourcc needs it
[11:19:26] <flaper87> stage2 should be your workspace compiled with stage1 which contains your changes but hasn't been compiled with those changes
[11:19:32] <flaper87> oh mmh
[11:19:42] <flaper87> got what you mean
[11:19:57] <flaper87> why does libfourcc depends on it?
[11:20:00] <flaper87> depend*
[11:20:11] <eddyb> because it's a syntax extension
[11:20:22] <flaper87> ah right

[19:17:54] <larsberg> eddyb: I was 50/50 on logging the pizza administrivia vs. giving my hands a rest, but thought azita deserved a shout-out for ensuring the pizza happens :-)

[19:19:19] <eddyb> I was so waiting on that to use it all over rustc
[19:19:38] <eddyb> and yes, I do like it in ES6

[19:20:18] <flaper87> eddyb: yeah, I was reading that :P
[19:20:20] <acrichto> eddyb: I'd recommend talking to dherman or pcwalton about it, they had the hygiene concerns
[19:21:03] <nmatsakis> I should clarify: I don't think there are actual concerns that it will mess up *hygiene*
[19:21:18] <nmatsakis> more that it *feels* surprising
[19:21:27] <nmatsakis> but I don't think there is a technical problem,
[19:21:31] <nmatsakis> it's an expansion that happens very early
[19:21:46] <nmatsakis> flaper87: what was decided was to impose rule on static *values* not *types,
[19:21:50] <bjz> what does the "oxidize:" chatter in the makefile refer to?
[19:22:01] <nmatsakis> flaper87: but also to use an analogous rule for the expression in fixed-length vector like [None, ..5]
[19:22:03] <acrichto> bjz: compile_and_link => oxidize

[19:23:22] <acrichto> that can't be copyable though?

[19:23:44] <nmatsakis> really this is a sloppy form of refinement types

[20:48:57] <mrmonday> alright, awaiting approval
[20:50:28] <cmr> Eridius: so what do you think the problem is?
[20:51:00] <Eridius> cmr: somehow the parent id for Packet isn't making it into allPaths. Personally, I think that since Packet is private it should be completely ignored, except the drop() method is making it into the index, referencing the missing parent id
[20:51:31] <Eridius> on a related note, if you loop at ops::Drop, it lists Packet (and a few other un-hyperlinked entries which I assume are also private). That seems like a bug too, since private things should be elided completely from documentation
[20:51:39] <Eridius> the wrinkle is, of course, public re-exports
[20:53:22] <cmr> hrm
[20:53:33] <cmr> we should be getting the reexport list from rustc
[20:53:39] <cmr> see passes.rs:84
[20:53:41] <Eridius> I'm ignoring that part at the moment
[20:53:55] <Eridius> it would be nice to remove those private implementors from the list, but that's a separate issue

[21:06:33] <cmr> the build system has changed a lot since I've last manually benched.
[21:06:48] <cmr> the amount of CFG_* environment variables is annoying.

[21:07:16] <eibwen> how are closures passed?
[21:07:31] <eddyb> eibwen: (fn(*env, ..args), *env)
[21:08:10] <eibwen> so I could call a closure-taking function from my C code by using that scheme?
[21:08:25] <eibwen> I mean like
[21:08:37] <eddyb> you can use a C function and an env pointer as a closure
[21:08:39] <eibwen> void (*fn)(void *userdata, ..args);
[21:08:45] <eddyb> yeah, that pattern
[21:08:56] <eibwen> k, useful
[21:09:13] <eibwen> I guess that's not considered stable at all?
[21:09:22] <eddyb> though don't expect the calling convention to be compatible
[21:09:43] <eibwen> oh right
[21:09:47] <eddyb> and there's no extern "C" || in Rust

[21:12:06] <eibwen> cmr: is that the compiler?
[21:12:23] <cmr> eibwen: yes, rustc compiling librustc.
[21:12:40] <cmr> eibwen: same data that feeds http://huonw.github.io/isrustfastyet/mem/
[21:13:33] <eibwen> llvm is pretty nice with memory apparantly :)
[21:13:45] <cmr> well
[21:13:52] <cmr> my current hypothesis on why that happens
[21:13:58] <cmr> because it's different when using jemalloc
[21:14:06] <cmr> is that glibc isn't releasing its pages back to the kernel
[21:14:18] <cmr> but librustc is using more memory than LLVM could be
[21:14:29] <cmr> so it just reuses the already-allocated-from-kernel pages
[21:14:37] <cmr> thus the flat line.,
[21:14:51] <eibwen> ah
[21:15:11] <eibwen> glibc doesn't release its memory?..
[21:15:28] <cmr> I have no idea how glibc's allocator works :P
[21:15:34] <flaper87> lol
[21:15:53] <cmr> but that's my hypothesis, given the hundreds of memory graphs I've looked yet.

[21:40:37] <nmatsakis> this PR from eddyb is interesting; in particular the treatment of path iterables. What a pain. I wonder how...worthwhile it all is
[21:40:53] <nmatsakis> that is, the PR makes sense, but I wonder if there's a better way to handle the PathIter thing
[21:41:45] <nmatsakis> I also fear the interaction with my PR for #6801 
[21:42:03] <nmatsakis> I found that lazy iterators are sometimes a pain point
[21:42:13] <nmatsakis> since they claim the data that they touch during the whole iteration,
[21:42:14] <nmatsakis> so if you do:
[21:42:21] <nmatsakis> foo.iter().map(f1).map(f2).map(f3)
[21:42:30] <nmatsakis> then f1 and f2 and f3 can't touch the same data
[21:42:57] <nmatsakis> so I suspect a lot of those PathIters will wind up having to be collect()'d...
[21:43:01] <nmatsakis> hmm..
[21:43:04] <nmatsakis> guess I should put this on the PR

[21:53:51] <acrichto> 2x compliation speedup!
[21:53:52] <Luqman> acrichto: r? https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/12192
[21:54:34] <flaper87> nmatsakis: do you have any input for https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/3742 ?
[21:54:38] <Eridius> acrichto: rustdoc is incorrectly indexing trait implementations on private structs
[21:54:50] <acrichto> Luqman: oh dear sorry about that, I should have cleaned that up
[21:55:07] <acrichto> Eridius: I'd believe that
[21:55:22] <Eridius> acrichto: if you try to search for "dr", "dro", "drop", "eq", "ne", etc you get javascript exceptions that breaks the search
[21:55:33] <Eridius> acrichto: the search index contains those methods but the parents they reference are not in allPaths
[21:55:42] <acrichto> oh huh, I never understood where those exceptions came from
[21:55:45] <Eridius> I just can't figure out why. Surely the struct had to be folded over to get onto the parent stack, so why is it missing from allPaths?
[21:55:47] <nmatsakis> flaper87: I have a fairly concrete plan
[21:55:49] <acrichto> I just knew that something was being indexed that shouldn't
[21:55:53] <nmatsakis> flaper87: but I need to write it up!
[21:56:08] <acrichto> Eridius: all I ever figured out was that something was being indexed that shouldn't, I never figured out what though
[21:56:11] <flaper87> nmatsakis: ok, then I'll just triage it and metion that
[21:56:11] <nmatsakis> flaper87: if you're interested in tackling, I'd be happy to do so --
[21:56:15] <nmatsakis> flaper87: ok :)
[21:56:16] <flaper87> nmatsakis: I AM!
[21:56:18] <flaper87> :D
[21:56:32] <Eridius> acrichto: well, I'd like to fix it, but I'm having trouble tracking down exactly how it's happening
[21:56:50] <flaper87> nmatsakis: I've the feeling you're starting to know me very well :D
[21:57:00] <acrichto> Eridius: the indexing all happens as part of html/render.rs, it's all in the initial part of doc generation
[21:57:04] <Eridius> ooh, actually, the parent stack for a trait impl uses the .for_ field. The struct itself isn't what's adjusting it
[21:57:07] <Eridius> acrichto: yes that's where I'm looking
[21:57:13] <Eridius> I bet the struct is being removed in clean
[21:57:24] <Eridius> but the impl is left alone, with a valid .for_ that references a valid ResolvedPath
[21:57:33] <cmr> ahhh
[21:57:36] <cmr> that sounds plausible.
[21:57:36] <flaper87> nmatsakis: I'll triage it for now, complete my work on for the static issue which is a real pain and then get back to it

[22:16:06] <acrichto> yeah
[22:16:17] <acrichto> we just merge rust/master into rust/snap-stage3
[22:16:25] <acrichto> and the bots go and create a bunch of snapshots
[22:16:35] <acrichto> we then register the snapshots by hashes and update all code and land the snapshots as a commit

[22:17:07] *** nrc is now known as nrc|afk
[22:17:51] <Eridius> acrichto: I feel like DocFolder needs some way to record the ids of all items that are removed, and then impls for those items can be stripped in an unskippable pass at the end, but I don't know how to do that
[22:18:48] <acrichto> Eridius: the stripping logic is pretty sketchy as-is, but I would imagine that stripping impls whose for_ has been stripped should be fairly simpl
[22:19:03] <Eridius> acrichto: the question is how to record that the for_ was stripped
[22:19:27] <Eridius> acrichto: for private items, I'm trying something right now that should work, because we can check if the for_ is in exported items
[22:19:39] <Eridius> but testing to see if something was stripped in an arbitrary pass? I don't know
[22:19:45] <acrichto> shouldn't it just be the same computation?
[22:19:51] <sfackler> Eridius: keep in mind that some stuff ends up in exported items that shouldn't
[22:19:55] <sfackler> like private traits
[22:20:07] <Eridius> acrichto: how do I check if the for_ struct was marked up with #[doc(hidden)] when I'm not looking at that particular Item?
[22:20:21] <Eridius> sfackler: checking exported items is how private structs are stripped
[22:21:20] <acrichto> you could take a two-pass approach
[22:21:25] <acrichto> strip all types then strip all impls
[22:21:32] <Eridius> acrichto: again, the question is how to record which types we stripped
[22:21:51] <acrichto> a hash set?
[22:21:53] <acrichto> a list?
[22:21:54] <Eridius> I mean, a two-pass approach within the strip-hidden is doable
[22:22:21] <Eridius> the problem is .fold_item() is implemented in a trait, not on a struct. Where do we keep the set, and where do we put the logic that checks to see if the item was stripped?
[22:23:04] <acrichto> there's a whole bunch of hashmaps all over the place
[22:23:09] <Eridius> maybe I'll just fix strip_hidden to use a two-pass approach internally
[22:23:12] <acrichto> just put a borrowed reference into the struct that impls the trait
[22:23:21] <Eridius> I just thought it would be great if we could do the two-pass approach across all passes
