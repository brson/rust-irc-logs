[03:01:22] <Peach> Oh my

[03:01:51] <Peach> not a "fetch and merge" button
[03:02:01] <c74d> ah, you're using some GUI layer on top of Git
[03:02:20] <Peach> so "pull" is what I probably want?
[03:02:30] <Peach> It says "pull 2 commits ahead"
[03:02:32] <aatch> Peach, Ah, well "fetch" is just "pull down the refs from <place>". Which refs depends on a number of settings.
[03:03:40] <Peach> so "pull" does the magic
[03:05:00] <c74d> Peach: I'd say pull should be fine for a clear beginner using a Git GUI, unless you're interested in diving into learning how the underlying Git model works.
[03:05:44] <aatch> Peach, well, "magic", it just does `git merge <remote-ref>`, it's mostly that fetch+merge is pretty common.
[03:06:10] * Peach is always scared of learning the underlying workings of anything made by Linus Torvald
[03:06:50] <c74d> The normal "pull", which is "fetch and merge", 'merges' the "histories", or "streams of development
[03:06:51] <aatch> I personally only use fetch directly when working with a branch from somebody else's repo on a project. I don't want to add it as a remote, so I just fetch what I want, checkout FETCH_HEAD then create a new branch from there.
[03:07:43] <c74d> The normal "pull", which is "fetch and merge", 'merges' the "histories", or "streams of development" that have diverged in your local repository and the pulled-from repository, while leaving it clear that they were separate streams of development.
[03:08:59] <c74d> The "pull --rebase" that gets mentioned instead effectively "inserts" the new commits from the pulled-from repository into your local history, such that they come before your local new commits.

[03:19:00] <aatch> Peach, it's not generally a good idea to take what Linus says in these kinds of things too seriously.
[03:19:48] <Peach> Things could be userfriendlier, and the programmers/expert who think "complex is good" probably misunderstand what userfriendly really is. Software could be made powerful without being dumbed down

[03:21:45] <aatch> Peach, the main thing though is that it's easier to make something complex and hard-to-use, then build something simple on top of it, than try to do it the other way around.
[03:23:02] <Peach> aatch: if course, making something easy to use requires extra effort
[03:23:18] <Peach> extra effort that a lot of people skimp out on

[03:27:13] <niconii> Peach: nope
[03:28:15] <c74d> Peach: no, forking is making your own copy of someone's repository; branching is creating a new stream of development that "branches" off from another stream of development.

[03:29:11] <Peach> I am collecting all your words and making it a reference for future use
[03:29:39] <niconii> in this case forking is more a github/bitbucket/what-have-you concept than a git one
[03:30:26] <niconii> or maybe a better way to put it, it's when you clone a git repository, but then make the upstream be a repository connected to your own account, rather than the original one
[03:30:32] * aatch imagines Peach brushing up words with a dustpan & brush and tipping them into a little zip-lock bag.
[03:31:11] <c74d> Peach: the official Git CLI program is generally recommended over the third-party GUIs, but if GUIs are what you like, SmartGit is reputed by #git (or was, last I was active there) to be the one good Git GUI.

[05:44:49] <Peach> I first started programming when I was 10

[17:21:51] <Astraea> well, the actual problem is I need to store data
[17:22:13] <Astraea> can't do it on the embedded device, 2K isn't enough
[17:22:28] <Astraea> can't do it on a database (the sane way), that would cost money

[17:29:58] <Astraea> well that's the issue, zofrex 
[17:30:13] <Astraea> I mean yeah, it might be able to pull the data for a bit
[17:30:20] <Astraea> but data is absolutely going to be lost
[17:30:49] <Astraea> like I said, the sane answer is a database... in fact that's the best answer
[17:32:08] <Astraea> zofrex: you're also probably referring to background fetch, which as far as I can tell I don't really have control over when it fetches exactly
[17:38:10] *** Joins: Peach (Fancy3D@moz-500.6lb.246.96.IP)
[17:38:50] <ytain> Astraea you can keep the pulling of data from sensors in the background if you make your app a music player (which means accessing the microphone or the audio output)
[17:39:25] <Astraea> ytain: and I'm guessing it won't get accepted into the app store if I do that =P
[17:39:27] <ytain> but then the app won't be accepted at the store
[17:39:42] <Peach> Does an iPad count sas "embedded programming" ?
[17:39:48] <Astraea> no, Peach 
[17:39:52] <ytain> but the xcode 7 allows anyone to compile the app and put on their own device
[17:40:05] <Astraea> really? that's cool
[17:40:15] <Astraea> anyway, the iOS/Android apps are part of a larger product
[17:40:21] <Astraea> so they have to make it into the app store
[17:40:27] <ytain> with no need to pay for the fees for developer account to be published onto the store
[17:40:47] <ytain> well you are out of luck then
[17:41:01] <Astraea> ugh, I hate my job
[17:41:34] <Astraea> 12 bits per sample, I need some timestamp information, 2048 bytes to work with...
[17:42:14] <ytain> the longest a regular app can stay in the background is 10min unless it is killed by the iOS to make space for another app (in case of iDevices with very low memory)
[17:42:18] *** Quits: pcwalton (pcwalton@moz-nh2.o1i.216.216.IP) (Client exited)
[17:42:31] <Astraea> that was changed to 3 minutes in iOS 8
[17:42:36] <ytain> I see
[17:42:56] <Astraea> though I don't know if that limit exists for background fetch
[17:43:31] <Astraea> apparently background fetch tries to do predictive fetching though, so it fetches updates before you usually open the app
[17:43:47] <Astraea> which isn't helpful if I'm trying to not lose data and use a phone as a DB...
[17:44:19] <Astraea> project requirements: "Do everything wrong, circumvent all best practices, disregard laws of reality"
[17:45:13] <ytain> another way is to save to db locally on ios device and when it can connect to the server just push all the fetched data and empty the db
[17:45:40] <ytain> i wouldn't suggest sqlite for that if it is in case of fetching large datasets
[17:45:41] <Astraea> I don't care about storing all the data on the iOS device honestly
[17:46:09] <Astraea> I can probably get by with 1MB or two
[17:46:22] <ytain> what is the embedded device? an in house device?
[17:46:39] <Astraea> and if I had a server I'd be using that from the device
[17:46:47] <Astraea> yeah, it goes in a house
[17:47:31] <Astraea> if you're curious, we're using particle.io
[17:47:45] <Astraea> the photon (well, the p0/p1 or whatever on our own custom circuit)
[17:50:45] <ytain> does the dev kit have any examples about fetching of data?
[17:51:11] <Astraea> well the device uses their cloud service
[17:51:13] <ytain> in regard to amount of data that can be stored on the device
[17:51:15] <Astraea> it's actually pretty neat
[17:51:31] <Astraea> well, the device itself has 1MB of flash, 128K RAM
[17:51:44] <ytain> aha ok, no idea how to suggest a solution
[17:51:56] <Astraea> oh, I'm in the same boat
[17:52:17] <Astraea> I was just told we needed to hit the price-per-unit mark the client requested
[17:52:34] <Astraea> and apparently my statement that the product won't even work isn't as important as the price-per-unit...
[17:52:47] <Astraea> welcome to my job =P
[17:53:40] <dfockler> don't worry, it'll be your fault when it fails, regardless of what you say to anyone
[17:54:26] <Astraea> I know =(
[17:54:57] <ytain> can you run your own cloud server for that in house device?
[17:55:24] <Astraea> no
[17:55:35] <Astraea> the client doesn't want to run any server whatsoever
[17:55:46] <Astraea> the particle.io cloud is included in the price of the modules
[17:55:49] <Astraea> that's all they're willing to pay
[17:55:50] <ytain> I see
[17:56:13] <ytain> the one other way is to capture the calls to the particle.io in the wireless router
[17:56:30] <ytain> and redirect the data to an in house server
[17:56:39] <Astraea> so I'll probably end up getting like... 512K of SPI flash to put on the board
[17:56:45] <ytain> the IoT are not usually serverless
[17:56:55] <Astraea> we'll have to worry about write wear, but... oh well
[17:57:01] <Astraea> no in house server
[17:57:10] <Astraea> literally no servers at all
[17:57:15] <ytain> I see
[17:57:20] <Astraea> yeah
[17:57:36] <ytain> the IoT are meant to communicate with a server, that's how their firmware are written
[17:57:47] <Astraea> well it'll communicate with the particle.io servers
[17:57:53] <Astraea> but their servers don't allow you to store data
[17:58:15] <Astraea> you can expose functions, variables, and events through their servers
[17:58:41] <Astraea> but some iOS/android/etc device has to actually get the data at some point
[18:00:28] <ytain> https://github.com/spark/firmware there you can remove the requirement for connecting to the cloud server
[18:00:44] <Astraea> well no, we need that
[18:01:10] <Astraea> so their servers are okay, it's rolled into the cost of the p0/p1 modules
[18:01:25] <ytain> well your client says no server
[18:01:42] <Astraea> I don't think they were being that literal =P
[18:01:49] <Astraea> no servers that they have to worry about
[18:02:04] <Astraea> as in, no server they control
[18:02:49] <ytain> aha ok
[18:02:58] <ytain> well then expand the storage
[18:03:37] <Astraea> that's the only option I have really
[18:04:01] <Astraea> and since we take samples at least once a minute, I'm sure the flash will go bad quite quickly, heh

[18:53:07] <benh> i was previously under the impression that using source control is a very good idea but that not everybody was necessarily on board
[18:53:40] <benh> would you say it'd be particularly hard to find a random software company that's not using source control if you went out and looked
[18:54:12] <Elaine> no, probably not: look for small companies that deal only locally, preferably in Microsoft Office automation or similar.
[18:54:30] <benh> that's sorta our situation too
[18:55:06] <Elaine> I imagine internal "IT" programming jobs at smallerish companies are also very ad-hoc.
[18:57:21] <awe> Working without source control would be so painful.

[19:46:53] <Elaine> If you don't already understand how it works, it can be quite opaque.
[19:46:59] <Elaine> But understanding how it works is not hard.
[19:47:34] <eddyb> macros are uglier than modules
[19:48:03] <Elaine> I don't count the macro system as part of the language.
[19:48:16] <Elaine> Not really, at least.

[19:51:16] <Elaine> Peach: in its niche, Rust (plus future Rust extensions that are being worked on) is seems pretty close to a local optimum if you compare speed of writing code, code clarity, expressiveness, and performance.
[19:51:55] <Peach> Can you describe Rust's niche?
[19:52:09] <Peach> I'm pretty sure it's different than the niche I'm looking for
[19:52:20] <Elaine> Safe systems programming through intelligent abstraction boundaries.
[19:52:43] <Peach> The language that Rust replaces in its niche is?
[19:52:48] <Elaine> C++
[19:52:53] <eddyb> https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1184#issuecomment-123460263 nerdsnipe'd
[19:53:30] <mrmonday> things being a bit ugly is hardly a big mistake though, it's not like the kind of mistakes you'd identify with C or C++
[19:53:35] <eddyb> arguably D as well, although D has a GC and a different approach to metaprogramming than C++
[19:53:40] <Elaine> It's been said that "D is for C++ people who like C++, Rust is for C++ people who don't like C++"
[19:53:52] <fkaa> hehe

[19:54:35] <Elaine> eddyb: D doesn't require a GC.
[19:54:48] <eddyb> I heard it started working better without one
[19:54:58] <mrmonday> half of its features don't work without GC
[19:55:01] <fkaa> i took a peek at a macro once
[19:55:05] <eddyb> is it like Nim?
[19:55:06] <Elaine> The GC gives you automatically-managed memory safety, you still get manual memory management where you want it.
[19:55:10] <fkaa> it wasn't rust ;_;
[19:55:18] <mrmonday> and you can't use most of the standard library either without GC (though they're finally working on that...)
[19:55:30] <eddyb> mrmonday: yeah, that's the bit of news I've heard recently
[19:55:41] <Peach> I can't stand D

[19:55:56] <mrmonday> they introduced an @nogc attribute, which guarantees the function doesn't allocate
[19:56:02] <Elaine> benh: send a PR!
[19:56:07] <benh> oh right
[19:56:17] <Peach> I want a safe version C++ with syntax as simple as Javascript - is there anything out there like that?
[19:56:24] <zofrex> Rust
[19:56:33] <Peach> "as simple as javascript"
[19:56:54] <zofrex> rust at its best has BETTER syntax than javascript
[19:57:02] <Peach> but it's not simpler
[19:57:04] <mrmonday> so now your function signatures can be auto foo(T)(T t) immutable @safe @nothrow pure @nogc @iveprobablymissedsome; :3
[19:57:40] <zofrex> https://github.com/FGRibreau/if-exp look at this! look at it and weep!
[19:57:41] <Elaine> Peach: so first you need to figure out how you want to get safety.
[19:57:42] <mrmonday> I wonder if they ever fixed that thing where you could have redundant and/or conflicting attributes
[19:58:11] <zofrex> also it was really hard to find that. Google has decided that "expressions" and "statements" are equivalent words when searching the web now. not helpful when you're a programmer.

[19:59:17] <Peach> I want a language for both experts and beginners that focuses on performance and safety. A simple syntax that has minimal punctuation, and it's hard to make a mistake that breaks code in terms of memory leaking / null deref
[19:59:28] <Peach> and no garbage data
[19:59:37] <Peach> (Does rust have garbage data in safe code?)
[19:59:41] <Elaine> (no)
[19:59:46] <eddyb> uninitialized memory? no
[20:00:06] <Elaine> Those constraints are SO INCREDIBLY CHALLENGING to satisfy.
[20:00:21] <Elaine> Rust focuses on performance and safety, but actually balancing those two issues is so complex that beginners can't do it.
[20:00:29] <eddyb> certain variations of heartbleed would be prevented by Rust. other, crazier forms, would require unsafe code
[20:00:33] <Elaine> (And it errs on the side of explicit rather than implicit)
[20:01:11] <Elaine> The other way probably lies array and stack languages.
[20:01:12] <Peach> I wish I had papers or more info on why those constraints are challenging to satisfy
[20:01:28] <eddyb> Peach: it's how the universe works, really
[20:01:40] <Elaine> but beginners and experts alike won't be able to understand those, if they haven't been exposed to the paradigm ;)
[20:01:45] <eddyb> having your cake and eating it, too, is very uncommon
[20:02:06] <Peach> come on eddyb , you really think that for now till the end of time there won't be any significant advance in computer programming's ease of use? :P
[20:02:08] <benh> I enjoy Rust but I can see myself defaulting to D for programs where I can afford the GC just so I can avoid all the noise around my types :(
[20:02:24] <Peach> Binary to ASM to C was a nice jump
[20:02:50] <Peach> there can be another that abstracts things even more while keeping performance optimal
[20:02:51] <Elaine> Peach: oh there certainly will, but allowing experts to code high-performance systems is almost certainly going to always be at a different level of abstraction that what the beginners are using.
[20:02:56] <eddyb> unless you already have genius solutions to at least one hard problem, you're going to have a hard time getting anywhere past state of the art
[20:02:59] <eddyb> Peach: oh I am not saying that
[20:03:18] <eddyb> Peach: but you need a lot more work than one human can handle in their spare time
[20:03:23] <Elaine> The flexibility you need in creating performant abstractions is counter to the simplicity beginners want.
[20:03:26] <eddyb> until the singularity, of course
[20:03:57] <eddyb> graydon's Rust is pretty much extinct
[20:04:08] <Peach> Elaine: flexibility in performant abstracts is *counter* to simplicity? Can you list examples?
[20:04:17] <Elaine> Write a simple language for expressing compute kernels on the GPU and SIMD, that would be a good first step.
[20:04:20] <benh> eddyb: someone should go and fork a really old rust :P
[20:04:22] <niconii> usability will continue to improve, but binary -> asm -> C isn't a great example imo
[20:04:23] <eddyb> but he started something and he got other people on board
[20:04:26] <Peach> Because I think even rust does have some performant abstracts that I'm talking about,
[20:04:31] <Peach> like array litterals
[20:04:37] <Peach> that's super simple
[20:04:56] <eddyb> Elaine: DSLs are awesome
[20:04:58] <Elaine> Peach: Ok, now let's say I want to let literals of some form create rope data structures.
[20:05:27] <Elaine> Peach: How do you integrate user-defined literals in a way that experts can use them to do all sorts of crazy things, but they don't blow beginner's heads off?
[20:05:49] <Peach> Hmm, well I don
[20:05:54] <benh> embed macros into the language but only enable the macro definition syntax after you get the "spend 10,000 hours in rust" achievement
[20:06:02] <niconii> the reason there was a leap from machine code to assembly, and assembly to compilers, is because of early hardware constraints
[20:06:03] <Peach> 't see how user defined literals are conceptually too hard
[20:06:13] <Peach> 1000ms = 1s  
[20:06:15] <Elaine> How do you *interact* with them, at a language level.
[20:06:17] <Peach> (as an example)
[20:06:22] <niconii> it's hard to have assembly when there physically isn't enough memory in your computer to have an assembler
[20:06:26] <Peach> if you were doing time,
[20:06:29] <Elaine> How do I write a thing that defines a new literal?
[20:06:51] <niconii> or if all you have is a bunch of leds for an interface
[20:06:54] <Elaine> niconii: btw was that line editor challenge 1k or 4k?
[20:07:02] <Elaine> I think it was 1k
[20:07:02] <niconii> Elaine: 1k
[20:07:05] <Elaine> k

[20:07:45] <eddyb> Peach: if I seem overly critical, it's because I've been where you are right now for a few years. I learnt a few things, here and there, but the most important one is that it's very easy to underestimate a challenge
[20:08:08] <Elaine> Peach: Chisel is a good example as well of the power a language wants, in terms of expressing DSLs.
[20:08:18] <Elaine> A complete hardware definition language, in pure Scala.
[20:08:24] <Elaine> No magic!
[20:08:47] <Elaine> eddyb: like P = NP? :P
[20:08:50] <eddyb> so instead of saying "it should be fairly easy", I need to remember to sketch a solution. if I don't try, I won't find even large gaping holes in my plan
[20:09:16] <eddyb> Elaine: hey now, that was a learning experience
[20:09:21] * Elaine remembers an eddyb quote like "dammit, I hit P = NP everywhere I go"
[20:09:45] <eddyb> maybe it was pointless, but I built a system to hold hundreds of thousands of nodes of a boolean DAG
[20:10:14] <eddyb> with really efficient allocation and substitution
[20:11:17] <Peach> <Elaine> How do I write a thing that defines a new literal?  - Well you make a language where all types can use protocol style functions and you treat suffixes like a member function,
[20:11:28] <Peach> so, for example,
[20:11:38] <zofrex> it's really, really easy to propose individual solutions to individual problems in language design
[20:11:58] <eddyb> zofrex: and have 0 orthogonality :D?
[20:12:03] <zofrex> it's not until you actually try to implement the compiler (or interpreter) that you being to realise how those solutions interact in unexpected, unpredictable and 'emergent' ways

[20:12:15] <eddyb> you say it like it's alive or something
[20:12:35] <eddyb> use a neural network as a type system
[20:12:38] <Peach> extend type Int64:  suffix ms() { return conversion of value };
[20:12:39] <Elaine> eddyb: you say that like dynamical systems aren't :P
[20:13:10] <dfockler> neural net your program to provide the correct output
[20:13:17] <Elaine> Peach: what about moving beyond suffixes? What if I want to encode terms in propositional logic directly, converting them into some sort of graph?
[20:13:25] <Peach> I mean it's hard to come up with a generic solution *on the spot* but user defined litterals don't seem beginner unfriendly to me Elaine 
[20:13:52] <Peach> A language that advanced,
[20:13:58] <eddyb> Elaine: I should shut up given that C++ lets you hook into compiler state via template instantiation and constexprs
[20:14:07] <Peach> would require a good IDE upfront with intelligent code completion and code lookup Elaine 
[20:14:54] <Elaine> Ah, yet another axis of complexity: The complexity of the tools needed to work with a system, the complexity of creating those tools, and the complexity of users customizing them.
[20:14:59] <Peach> Essentially to get to the next level of coding, the programming language would have to be majorly supplemented by a high level IDE and compiler that integrate together to be beginner freidnly
[20:15:14] <Elaine> (the "tooling" dimensions)
[20:15:38] <eddyb> I've been bit by the ideal of smart tools
[20:15:44] <scott> Rust made design decisions that on the surface make the language look worse but underneath make it easier to write tools for Rust, e.g. by making parsing simpler
[20:15:53] <Elaine> Your programming environment, to be simple, ought to have a complete manual in less than 50 pages.
[20:15:53] <eddyb> well, I've made certain specialized tools that were arguably state of the art
[20:15:58] <scott> e.g. the foo::<T> instead of foo<T> syntax in expressions
[20:16:10] <Peach> But tooling is *seriously* underlooked in programming language
[20:16:11] <eddyb> scott: s/simpler/deterministic/
[20:16:16] <eddyb> Peach: it's not that
[20:16:25] <eddyb> tooling is *seriously* hard stuff
[20:16:28] <scott> It's important to design the language such that tooling is easy to write
[20:16:33] <Elaine> Peach: no, it's not underlooked.
[20:16:34] <scott> C++ makes it very very hard to write good tools
[20:16:39] <Elaine> Peach: it's a multibillion dollar industry.
[20:16:45] <Peach> oh

[20:21:22] <Peach> such a niche, a project like that is completely outside my domain
[20:21:33] <Peach> so I can't appreciate it
[20:21:38] <scott> I wonder if the style guide should state whether => () or => {} is preferred in match arms.
[20:21:55] <Astraea> ugh
[20:22:00] <Elaine> scott: () is only allowed if you're parenthesizing an expression or constructing a tuple...
[20:22:04] <scott> I tend to go with {} because I can slightly more quickly turn it into { stmt; }
[20:22:07] <Astraea> style guides are silly
[20:22:12] <Elaine> you don't need to parenthesize it if the former.
[20:22:15] <Elaine> the latter is just an expression
[20:22:20] <Elaine> so, {}, clearly!
[20:22:23] <Elaine> just by occam's razor
[20:22:56] <scott> Elaine: I'm confused. I mean match foo { bar => () } vs match foo { bar => {} }
[20:23:07] <Elaine> oh, for empty?
[20:23:09] <scott> For a branch that does nothing
[20:24:24] <niconii> i've pretty much only seen {} used for that
[20:26:49] <scott> Also what do people feel about `=> break` vs `=> { break; }` (or any other diverging expression)
[20:27:31] <niconii> i personally use `=> break`
[20:27:33] <scott> I go with the former since it's pretty clear regardless even if the semantics of using the value of a diverging expression is a little weird.
[20:29:18] <Astraea> oh man... I am thinking about using UB on a microcontroller
[20:29:21] <Astraea> someone stop me! hehe
[20:29:23] <Peach> Now that CS data structures are widely known, what about making a compiler that is aware of most data structures so it can handle code better? I know that sounds absurd but think about that possibility
[20:29:43] <Astraea> CS data structures have been widely known for decades
[20:30:08] <Peach> Yes, and modern compilers are still rarely aware of them
[20:30:11] <Elaine> Peach: that's what LLVM started out as
[20:30:14] <Elaine> turns out it's impossible.
[20:30:25] <Elaine> Lattner's MS thesis was about doing that.
[20:30:29] <Peach> is there a keyword I can search for
[20:30:35] <Peach> Oh lattners MS theses
[20:30:43] <Elaine> http://llvm.org/pubs/2002-12-LattnerMSThesis.html
[20:31:43] <scott> So the difference between modern LLVM and that idea is that they gave up on having type information for the most part?
[20:31:48] <Elaine> see the earlier publications on http://llvm.org/pubs/
[20:31:52] <Elaine> scott: not necessarily...
[20:31:53] <fkaa> Astraea: what is UB good for?
[20:32:09] <Astraea> fkaa: well in the C world I'm pretty sure everything is UB
[20:32:12] <scott> I heard they were ditching pointer types for a since 'ptr' type
[20:32:21] <Astraea> but no, I was thinking about using unions improperly
[20:32:45] <fkaa> there ought to be some "undefined behavior sort"
[20:32:53] <fkaa> for when you need O(UB)
[20:33:02] <scott> They still have ints and floats and vectors and structures, but nothing that high-level
[20:33:17] <Astraea> or I guess it's implementation defined rather
[20:34:25] <Elaine> Peach: I'm sorry, I was thinking of his PhD thesis, http://llvm.org/pubs/2005-05-04-LattnerPHDThesis.html
[20:34:32] <Elaine> the MS thesis was the one that was actually useful to me at the time ;)
[20:34:49] <scott> Astraea: Are you doing something like the union { int x; float f; } u; u.x = 42; float f = u.f; trick?
[20:34:54] <Peach> Oh cool that's exactly what I was thing of
[20:35:08] <scott> I never got a satisfying answer about the right way to do something like that. I think was with memcpy
[20:35:56] <Peach> Buy Elaine - it's difficult with the languages he's using because C/C++ aren't made with high level abstractions in mind,
[20:36:11] <Elaine> Peach: it all operates on LLVM IR directly.
[20:36:12] <Peach> what if you had a language designed with a compiler to recognize high level data structures?
[20:36:17] <Peach> Oh hmmm
[20:36:20] <Astraea> scott: more or less, yeah
[20:36:36] <Elaine> (http://llvm.org/pubs/2005-TR-DSAEvaluation.html)
[20:37:13] <scott> Astraea: At least the union trick is implementation-defined like you said, so you only have to check with your compilers

[21:00:27] <Elaine> Peach: more challenging to parse, less consistent, uglier.
[21:00:30] <fkaa> oh
[21:00:41] <Tiffany> probably better to not say it's ugly
[21:00:48] <Tiffany> because people will argue over that
[21:01:03] <Peach> fn native_glue_name(n:int, pass_task:bool) -> str 
[21:01:07] <Peach> the :   
[21:01:27] <Elaine> the style is to use spaces after the :
[21:01:27] <fkaa> coming from java/c++ i prefer the : actually
[21:01:28] <Peach> to me that's just syntax noise, I like space cause it's cleaner
[21:01:33] <Tiffany> I didn't know rust ever had C-style declaration syntax
[21:01:40] <Tiffany> that must have been before I showed up
[21:01:49] <niconii> yeah, i'm surprised too
[21:01:51] <Elaine> It's not cleaner, since you have no visual separation between the pattern and the type.
[21:01:57] <Tiffany> yeah, rust 0.1
[21:02:00] <Peach> what about  (n: large::scoped::type,  
[21:02:02] <Tiffany> I joined around 0.3
[21:02:07] <Tiffany> right when classes were being removed
[21:02:23] <niconii> heh, i started using rust *way* after that
[21:02:30] <niconii> around the first alpha
[21:02:31] <fkaa> i peeked in at 0.11 and started using it at release
[21:02:41] <Peach> types are patterns? Can a type be an arbitrary expression?
[21:02:48] <niconii> or i guess more like 0.11, yeah
[21:02:51] <Elaine> Types aren't patterns, those "variable names" are patterns.
[21:03:02] <Elaine> fn foo((a, b): (T, U)) for example
[21:03:05] <Elaine> destructs a tuple
[21:03:10] <Tiffany> I didn't use rust until 0.4
[21:03:13] <Elaine> all irrefutable (can't-fail) patterns are allowed
[21:03:17] <niconii> i saw rust back when it was way early on, but i really didn't like how the language looked at the time
[21:03:19] <Tiffany> and didn't write anything of significance until I made that skybox generator
[21:03:25] <fkaa> wat, you can destruct tuples in the function signature?
[21:03:25] <Elaine> in Haskell, for example, all patterns are allowed.
[21:03:27] <Tiffany> I don't remember what version of rust that skybox generator is written against
[21:03:33] <niconii> so i never looked into it until much later
[21:03:34] <Elaine> fkaa: you can destruct any structure
[21:03:37] <Elaine> Tiffany: 0.7
[21:03:39] <Elaine> or 0.8
[21:03:41] <fkaa> :()
[21:04:01] <Tiffany> you remember it?
[21:04:03] <Elaine> yes
[21:04:15] <Peach> How can you take advantage of the variable names being patterns? Can the programmer do crazy things with passing around a tuple to define a function signature?
[21:04:30] <Tiffany> wow, last updated september 27, 2013
[21:04:43] <Tiffany> post .rc looks like
[21:05:53] <niconii> .rc?
[21:06:01] <fkaa> eddyb: yeah, definitely a fuzzer :p https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glslang/issues/27
[21:06:01] <Elaine> "crate file"
[21:06:16] <Elaine> a long time ago, .rc files were a different languge used to describe build metadata etc.
[21:06:28] <Tiffany> there was a while where they were the same language but the convention was still there
[21:06:28] <Elaine> then it became just a normal rust file with attributes that rustpkg knew how to understand
[21:06:30] <Elaine> now it's just lib.rs
[21:06:33] <Tiffany> yeah
[21:06:39] <niconii> ahh
[21:06:43] <eddyb> fkaa: stalker
[21:06:55] <fkaa> i get notified >.>
[21:07:36] <Tiffany> fkaa: pfff, you sure about that?
[21:07:49] <Tiffany> maybe someone just uses really long preprocessor arguments
[21:08:08] <Elaine> look at the other bugs they opened in the past hour
[21:08:37] <eddyb> would be nice if they mentioned the tool they're using
[21:08:47] <Elaine> why, it's not relevant to the bug report :P
[21:08:57] <fkaa> Tiffany: https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glslang/issues/created_by/xorgy
[21:09:25] <Tiffany> okay, I guess they're probably using a fuzzer
[21:09:34] <Tiffany> I was mostly being silly
[21:09:45] <fkaa> cheaters!!
[21:10:11] <Tiffany> I should probably try running fuzzers against some of my projects
[21:10:33] <Elaine> I was contemplating font stack vulnerabilities today
[21:10:36] <Elaine> esp. given web fonts.
[21:10:51] <Elaine> there was a flurry of freetype CVEs released in feb
[21:11:33] <Tiffany> I'm pretty sure that my noise impl will currently crash against malicious input
[21:11:42] <Tiffany> I'm mostly concerned with it working at the moment
[21:11:46] <fkaa> how do fuzzers work?
[21:11:51] <fkaa> pass any possible char combination?
[21:12:03] <Tiffany> that'd be too slow, most of the good fuzzers seem to take adaptive approaches
[21:12:04] <Elaine> fkaa: they use smart heuristics to explore branches in the program.
[21:12:06] <Tiffany> trying to cover all possible branches
[21:12:33] <Elaine> afl-lop has good writeups, given its recency and good results.
[21:12:50] <fkaa> sounds like a flop
[21:13:13] <Elaine> erm, just afl, it's afl-fuzz.
[21:13:14] <eddyb> Elaine: afl-lop?
[21:13:15] <Elaine> http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/
[21:13:19] <eddyb> lol
[21:13:39] <Elaine> <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Fuzzy_Lop>
[21:13:55] <eddyb> afl requires instrumentation, either via compiler plugins (clang, rustc) or via emulation (qemu, pretty powerful)
[21:14:08] <Elaine> eddyb: the compiler plugins aren't strictly necessary.
[21:14:11] <Elaine> you can do it on machine code.
[21:14:24] <eddyb> without emulation?
[21:14:30] <eddyb> well, "emulation" is a bad word
[21:14:34] <eddyb> virtualization?
[21:14:43] <Elaine> it's the same instrumentation it does on the output of the compilers.
[21:15:13] <eddyb> that's what I said
[21:15:25] <eddyb> instrumentation via compiler plugins or instrumentation via "emulation"
[21:15:30] <Elaine> That's not emulation.
[21:15:34] <Elaine> You don't need to use qemu
[21:15:37] <Elaine> it doesn't need to be dynamic.
[21:15:47] <eddyb> is it a newer thing?
[21:15:50] <Elaine> you can instrument the machine code directly.
[21:15:52] <Elaine> no
[21:15:55] <Elaine> it's just not documented :P
[21:15:57] <eddyb> :|
[21:15:59] <Elaine> but it's pretty easy to do
[21:16:09] <Elaine> the instrumentation is primitive, you can do it by hand even
[21:16:11] <eddyb> why on earth does the qemu mode exist at all if there's a way to do it on machine code?
[21:16:21] <eddyb> also, does it work with self-modifying code?
[21:16:43] <Elaine> no, not really, and it's very fragile.
[21:17:01] <Elaine> need to rewrite IP-relative offsets etc.

[21:22:05] <Elaine> eddyb: me neither, that's why I do it :P

[21:22:28] <Elaine> I always really wanted to draw or paint but I didn't have the gumption to stick to it.
[21:22:34] <Elaine> and I wasn't good at it to start with
[21:23:06] <eddyb> I daydream a lot but that doesn't count
[21:23:14] <niconii> i'd probably be a lot better at art if it was something i did on a regular basis

[21:27:56] <Elaine> you may find writings about the Cyclone language informative.
[21:28:32] <scott> I have no idea how lifetimes should be taught
[21:28:44] <scott> For me they were really weird and confusing until suddenly they were really easy

[21:30:50] <Elaine> no
[21:31:17] <Elaine> I mean, I've written some docs in my time
[21:31:23] <Elaine> almost all of it has probably been rewritten by now

[22:02:40] <eddyb> scott: this is pretty much an engineering uni
[22:02:44] <scott> Ah
[22:03:05] <eddyb> the faculty (college?) is "engineering in foreign languages"
[22:03:12] <scott> My CS department is in a massive glob college called Arts & Science, separate from the Engineering college
[22:03:25] <eddyb> it's pretty small compared to ACS and ETTI
[22:03:40] <scott> I don't know those acronyms
[22:03:53] <eddyb> ACS is automatics, CS & systems engineering, which has also has CTI
[22:04:13] <eddyb> scott: ofc, I'm exmplaining them now. just want to use acronyms because
[22:04:18] <Peach> does anyone else dream of and write ideas about a perfect programming language(for one's own use case), or is it just me?

[23:31:37] <Elaine> eddyb: I think gcc can only do better instruction scheduling in response to PGO.
[23:31:48] <eddyb> aww
[23:32:10] <eddyb> I guess specialization would require more than a simple profile

[23:42:51] <Elaine> you can even mix msvc code with it: http://clang.llvm.org/docs/MSVCCompatibility.html

[23:46:41] <Peach> Elaine: I'm making a toolkit compiles C code with clang - the end user doesn't have to directly work with clang,
[23:46:49] <Peach> is clang too large to include in a download?
[23:47:03] <Peach> **not a toolkit I mean an IDE
[23:47:29] <Elaine> not really.
[23:48:24] <Peach> I want to make it an easy unified setup that's cross platform for Mac and Windows
[23:48:40] <Peach> with C, is the ABI compatible at all across OS's Elaine ?
[23:48:55] <Elaine> no
[23:48:59] <Elaine> not in the slightest.
[23:49:18] <Peach> so each OS has a completely different ABI regardless of architecture
[23:49:27] <Elaine> yes

[23:50:50] <Peach> Elaine: how ABI compatible is C ABI between linux distros?
[23:51:09] <Elaine> 100%
[23:51:15] <Elaine> assuming both distros use glibc
[23:51:22] <Elaine> (almost all do; all mainstream do)
[23:51:36] <Elaine> of course, glibc is only forward compatible, not backwards compatible.
[23:51:56] <Elaine> so you can't use a binary compiled against a new glibc/kernel on an old glibc/kernel
[23:52:12] <Peach> awesome
[23:52:28] <Peach> Ok, so when a user builds a static C library, that static library will only useable for the OS they built on
[23:52:42] <Elaine> yes.
[23:52:46] <Peach> in the case of linux, it works across distros,
[23:53:04] <Peach> but you can't compile static C lib on linux and have it work on Mac nor Windows
[23:53:16] <Elaine> you can.
[23:53:22] <Elaine> by cross compiling.
[23:53:43] <Elaine> but it won't *run* on more than one platform.
