[04:58:30] <Havvy> There's polymorphism.

[04:58:52] <reem> I'd call generics polymorphism personally
[04:59:00] <frangio> i meant something like runtime polymorphism
[04:59:08] <Havvy> Runtime polymorphism is trait objects.
[04:59:09] <reem> ah, then yes, trait objects
[04:59:15] <Havvy> There's also the Any type.
[04:59:19] <Dirkson> reem: Thanks for the earlier suggestion : ) I find iron really tempting, by the way. I've always wanted to make something like drupal, but high performance. Iron seems like it could provide an extremely solid, performant way to do that. (Unless I really misunderstand what it's for. Which I might.)
[04:59:45] <reem> Ya, you could do that
[05:00:33] <XMPPwocky> is drupal actually intense on the app side itself, or does it just hit the DB a lot

[07:12:37] <FreeFull> Rust has some types like that
[07:13:04] *** darkowlzz is now known as darkowlzz|afk
[07:13:37] <tyoverby_> In D it is a specific pattern.  IE, you can do it to any type simply by not having the return type of a function be visible from outside the module
[07:14:02] <mindtree> FreeFull: the difference being they are both "types that can not be named" and "types that can not be returned" haha
[07:14:17] <tyoverby_> Apparently it is used in D to force the users of an API to use type inference so that the library authors can change the the implementation without breaking user code

[07:16:06] <bstrie> tyoverby_: that's also the point of the proposed rust feature
[07:16:13] <bstrie> or at least one of the points
[07:16:28] <tyoverby_> bstrie: I thought the main point was that some function signatures are impossible to write
[07:16:29] <bstrie> you can return an iterator today, but it's gross and forces your api consumer to rely on implementation details
[07:16:44] <mindtree> bstrie: there are some that cannot be returned though
[07:16:58] <tyoverby_> like an iterator that `map`s using an owned closure
[07:17:00] <bstrie> tyoverby_: if you do `-> impl Iterator`, all that you are allowed to do with that returned value is whatever the Iterator trait allows
[07:17:08] <tyoverby_> yeah, for sure
[07:17:15] <bstrie> today you must return a concrete type, which lets you do anything that type allows
[07:17:33] <Mutabah> bstrie: That syntax being raised again? No RFC yet?
[07:17:34] <bstrie> which is strictly greater

[07:20:12] <Mutabah> bstrie: Somehow make it possible to represent an unsized closure type in source (e.g. as a generic of a tuple representing the state)

[07:20:14] *** Joins: daniel-s (daniel-s@moz-upmq06.monash.edu.au)

[07:20:20] <Mutabah> Sorry, random thinking
[07:20:43] <tyoverby_> That would be interesting mindtree
[07:21:07] <tyoverby_> something like `struct Foo { it: impl Iter<Item=A>}`

[07:25:20] <Mutabah> bstrie: Sorry, it's random thinking, probably has some huge hurdles, and would be solving the same problem as ->impl
[07:25:29] <tyoverby_> but the most imporant difference between closures is the code that they run
[07:25:59] <nathan7> and that's part of their type
[07:26:19] <nathan7> so, yeah, that wouldn't work at all
[07:28:31] <bstrie> I suppose it could be possible to optimize for the common case, and say that if your closure doesn't close over anything at all then it can stand in as just a plain `fn`
[07:28:32] *** Joins: khades1 (Thunderbird@moz-08k.3vk.74.212.IP)

[10:00:51] <ruabmbua> But thanks. I will have to use the heap for the big data array, and split the processing into multiple parts, to save stack space because of the context.

[10:01:05] <sp3d> hm, could you allocate a huge chunk beforehand in .data to avoid a kernel roundtrip?
[10:01:06] <eddyb> how many times I have to say this: not implementing Copy doesn't fix bloody anything
[10:01:18] <sp3d> (disclaimer: I haven't read the backlog)
[10:01:20] <eddyb> sp3d: pointless
[10:01:47] <eddyb> it's not like it takes ages
[10:01:51] <sp3d> fair
[10:02:13] <sp3d> amortized over the time of actually using any allocation of such large size you're probably completely right
[10:02:15] <eddyb> you shouldn't be able to measure it next to initialization of that memory
[10:02:16] <ruabmbua> I only need to allocate it one time. Would not be a problem for the kernel.
[10:02:52] <ruabmbua> Also I think the loader will take exactly the same time on initializing the .data section.
[10:02:59] <ruabmbua> Does not make a big difference.
[10:03:05] <eddyb> pretty much, yes
[10:03:23] <sp3d> you'd avoid jank or whatnot, at least... but yeah

[10:06:47] <Thiez> what's up with the 'trivial cast' lint btw? I'm trying to cast a &mut T to a *mut T, but the lint warns. But I can either use `as *mut _` or explicitly annotate the type (`let mut p : *mut _ = ...`), and I much prefer the former

[10:07:06] <Thiez> is there any point to that?

[12:05:32] <libfud> so, I have a struct Program (something like tv, rather than for computers). One of the fields is tags, which I think might best be done with a struct, with options for fields like director, cast, album or track number

[12:11:32] <libfud> wait, so you *can* iterate through the fields of a struct?

[12:12:15] <libfud> oh, I misunderstood

[12:12:55] <lyxia> But because it's an option you can use it as an iterator if you are doing nothing when it's None.
[12:13:26] <libfud> http://is.gd/daa2iZ
[12:14:10] <libfud> so it'd be something like
[12:14:15] *** darkowlzz|afk is now known as darkowlzz
[12:14:45] <libfud> ah, maybe I don't understand.
[12:15:05] <lyxia> Overall I don't have any idea to really shorten the code either :/
[12:15:23] <libfud> I suppose I could also say if self.foo.is_some(), unwrap it, but that seems really inelegant compared to the pattern matching
[12:15:39] <libfud> I think the macro I wrote is as good as it's going to get
[12:16:33] <libfud> on the bright side though, I pretty much just have boilerplate like this to push out and then I'll be at a stage where I can create structs from expressions and vice versa
[12:16:41] <libfud> and then it'd just be a matter of building the gui around it

[14:22:24] <Ilari> derelm: I have written code that deals with closures in a box. I had to put some casts in, as otherwise I get type mismatch errors. Dunno what exactly is going on in your case, sorry.
[14:22:33] <enjolras> the fact this is a FnMut is infered
[14:23:02] <enjolras> there were a syntax |&mut: &mut x : &mut T | to tell it was an FnMut
[14:23:07] <enjolras> but it's deprecated :/
[14:23:17] <derelm> that's a lot of &mut there
[14:23:18] <enjolras> the compiler is supposed to infer that itself now
[14:23:34] <enjolras> derelm: right, but you can write it | x : &mut T | if you prefer
[14:24:03] <derelm> ok so i am basically trying the right thing...
[14:24:05] <enjolras> in this case, x will be an &mut, in the other case x is derefed (i guess it won't even compile actually the first case)

[20:58:00] <phaylon> erickt: ah, so basically the deserializer isn't always available?
[20:58:07] <phaylon> haven't yet fully wrapped my head around serde
[20:58:10] <ELD> In an impl block, I keep getting an error about the use of an undeclared lifetime. With the enum, I explicitly annotated the lifetime, so why's it think it's undeclared in the impl block?
[20:58:13] <erickt> phaylon: so one approach for doing this is that Error::* returns a dummy location and Deserializer.visit_* could update it with the real location
[20:58:24] <jalmeida> Maybe it's  cargo issue..

[21:01:20] <kimundi> ELD: In an enum definition, the enum Foo<'foo> explicitly defines the lifetime parameter. In a impl block, Foo<'foo> _uses_ a lifetime parameter: "implement for Foo<'foo>". So, there you actually need to define _what_ 'foo to apply to, which can happen with generic impl blocks: impl<'foo> Foo<'foo> "For all 'foo, impl Foo<'foo> as ..."

[22:54:59] <Dirkson> So Rust makes all variables immutable by default. I would assume that this means that most immutable variables aren't actually put onto the stack in the compiled code, and thus there shouldn't be any performance implications for a function that uses 10 variables where it could have used 1. Does that seems right? Here's an example to make what I'm talking about clearer:
[22:55:01] <Dirkson> http://pastebin.com/kqNAegq1
[22:55:45] <burntsushi> erickt: yeah, my work-around for that is to transform a tag into two data items: its tag number and the underlying data. that way, a decodable impl has to read the tag number and can fail if it's the wrong tag.
[22:55:46] <Dirkson> (I haven't tried benchmarking myself, because I kinda suspect the rust compiler is smart enough to see through my little contrived examples :) )
[22:55:58] <burntsushi> erickt: the "type name" matching doesn't actually occur in the decoder anywhere... i think.
[22:56:14] <burntsushi> erickt: but there is a small amount of it in the encoder, but it's limited to types defined inside the `cbor` crate.

[22:56:32] <burntsushi> erickt: so i think user tags shouldn't suffer from the collision problem.
[22:56:34] <tiffany> dirkson: llvm can, at least when optimisation is enabled, fold such expressions at compile-time into more optimal code
[22:57:15] <tiffany> my suggestion would be to write code whatever way is clearest, and not worry about it until it is actually a performance problem, and even then, making sure to profile before changing anything
[22:57:16] <erickt> burntsushi: oh? Interesting.
[22:57:44] <tiffany> dirkson: llvm is smart enough to fold all of those functions into the same optimal form, also

[23:02:59] <Dirkson> tiffany: That's a good question. I'm coming from C, but if llvm knows how to optimize all three examples, then equivalent C code I've written shouldn't have performance differences. Possibly just a generalized distrust of the language, which is a pretty healthy trait for a C coder to have : )
[23:03:28] <tiffany> maybe in the 80s it was, but not anymore now that compilers are really good at optimisation

[23:03:52] <tomleb> burntsushi: Oh right
[23:04:10] <tiffany> I was trying to come up with a cute example on play.rust-lang.org but I have to actually jump through hoops to keep llvm from just entirely const folding the functions

[23:04:28] <Dirkson> tiffany: Oh, that's cool, actually! : )
[23:04:35] <c74d> Dirkson: LLVM actually has an optimization pass that turns “ten assignments to a mutable variable” into “ten new immutable variables”.
[23:04:39] <tiffany> if they aren't used, they won't even be included in the final output; if they are passed a constant number, they will just be replaced by the result
[23:04:46] <rovar> where is iter() defined for Vec?
[23:04:58] <tiffany> the only way to get llvm to actually optimise the function instead is to feed it user input - something it doesn't know at compile-time
