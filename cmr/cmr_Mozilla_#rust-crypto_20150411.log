[01:50:11] <eternaleye> bascule: BTW, going back to our conversation yesterday, while DHT's difficulties with Sybil attacks and such are relevant for LISP, Mobile IP, etc, they're decidedly less relevant for HIP because HIP's mappings are verifiable
[01:51:11] <eternaleye> bascule: Because a HIT in HIP is deterministically derived from the pubkey - so if and only if you can complete a HIP key exchange to that IP for that HIT, the mapping is valid
[01:52:01] <eternaleye> bascule: So at worst, a Sibyl attack could impose denial of service, which can be done in easier ways with those resources.
[02:01:57] <Ilari> Hah, LISP actually splits the hard stuff (LtP lookup) into its own part, with kind of "API" for the easy part (tunneling) to talk to it. Kinda makes sense to do it that way.
[02:03:14] <Ilari> ... Specifically, those two parts communicate over IP.
[02:03:34] <mcpherrin> LISP is kinda cool
[02:04:16] <mcpherrin> That kind of stuff is possibly the future of netwokring
[02:04:53] <c74d3> okay, so this is something other than LISP the family of programming languages?
[02:04:55] <mcpherrin> Especially since it doesn't need core internet changes, or endpoint network stack changes!
[02:05:09] <mcpherrin> c74d3: that's Lisp, not LISP
[02:05:10] <mcpherrin> https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6830
[02:05:23] <mcpherrin> Locator ID seperation protocol
[02:05:32] <c74d3> it's LISP commonly enough
[02:05:49] <mcpherrin> As a Lisp and LISP nerd, I disagree ;p
[02:06:00] <mcpherrin> (But when you write network code in Lisp, you have to distinguish)
[02:06:12] <c74d3> (though I do normally smell it “Lisp”)
[02:06:15] <c74d3> *spell
[02:06:25] <mcpherrin> Anyways, the basic problem is that we use IP addresses to both locate an endpoint, and to identify it
[02:06:47] <mcpherrin> So if you move somewhere else in the network, you have to change your IP so you can still be located, but your ID has changed
[02:07:39] <mcpherrin> So what you really want is an "Endpoint Identifier" that say, identifies a particular computer or user
[02:07:47] <mcpherrin> and a "routing locator" that tells you where to send the packets
[02:08:18] <c74d3> makes sense
[02:08:19] <mcpherrin> You could potentially think of DNS names & IP addresses like this, but they're designed to mostly be static
[02:08:23] <c74d3> (to be clear, I didn't mean “it's so common a mistake that it shouldn't be considered a mistake”)
[02:09:05] <mcpherrin> I'm not going to get uppity over somebody spelling the language as LISP ;p
[02:11:31] <eternaleye> Ilari: HIP splits it up too, though differently - or rather, HIP specifies the tunneling, and there are separate docs for mapping HITs to IPs to use with HIP, which rely on HIP's verifiability
[02:12:18] <eternaleye> Ilari: They've specified an RR, and there's also a DHT-based one using OpenDHT
[02:13:30] <eternaleye> Ilari: There's also an opportunistic mode, where you connect to an IP with an all-zeroes HIT, and that basically behaves like the "default" on SNI - it picks whichever preconfigured "default" HIT it has to reply with.
[02:14:15] <eternaleye> mcpherrin: Have you looked at HIP?
[02:14:56] <mcpherrin> eternaleye: vaguely
[02:16:11] <eternaleye> mcpherrin: It solves the namespace collision issue by way of using a specific v6 block for the identities, mapping them to (v4 _or_ v6) locators, running a key exchange between the two, and then setting up an IPSEC BEET association between them.
[02:17:02] <mcpherrin> eternaleye: right.  My understanding is that it's an endpoint thing, whereas LISP is transparent to both the endpoints and the "core" network, so they're not super comparable
[02:17:07] <eternaleye> mcpherrin: And on modern systems (Linux since 2.6.29, Windows and Mac as well) it can (and has been) be implemented as a userspace keying daemon with no kernel or app changes.
[02:17:30] <mcpherrin> eternaleye: interesting; I didn't realize it was that un-invasive
[02:17:36] <mcpherrin> I'll check it out in more detail
[02:18:42] <eternaleye> mcpherrin: Also, one could easily set up a gateway such that remote HITs are treated as simple v6 addresses  on the LAN
[02:18:49] <eternaleye> mcpherrin: And just let the gateway handle HIP
[02:19:26] <mcpherrin> eternaleye: Yeah, it sounds like it.  I'll try to whip up an impl for work :P
[02:19:31] <eternaleye> mcpherrin: All that requires is that the gateway allocate a unique HIT for each local (non-HIP) endpoint.
[02:19:44] <eternaleye> mcpherrin: Check out http://hipl.hiit.fi
[02:19:51] <eternaleye> mcpherrin: Also, check the WG
[02:20:07] <eternaleye> mcpherrin: They're finishing up HIPv2
[02:20:10] <mcpherrin> But I'm drunk and I've spent all day debugging IP routing so I'm going to go think abouyt not-networks
[02:20:20] <eternaleye> mcpherrin: Because they wanted to revise after deployment testing
[02:20:25] <mcpherrin> That can be a "Monday" thing to worry about
[02:20:29] <mcpherrin> looks cool though
[02:20:41] <eternaleye> mcpherrin: Two of the drafts are already in the RFC Editor's queue :D
[02:21:26] <eternaleye> mcpherrin: Here, have a WG link: https://tools.ietf.org/wg/hip
[02:21:33] <Ilari> Well, on Linux, all sorts of crazy networking stuff has been done as userspace task. To the point where in one IETF WG meeting "X requires kernelspace changes"... "No, we have software doing X without kernelspace changes".
[02:21:54] <eternaleye> Ilari: Well, OpenHIP implemented it on Windows, Mac, _and_ Linux in one codebase.
[02:22:05] <eternaleye> Ilari: Without kernel changes.
[02:22:15] <eternaleye> Ilari: Because the only thing it needs from the kernel is a bit of IPSEC
[02:22:43] <Ilari> And the X there involved messing with TCP...
[02:22:44] <eternaleye> Ilari: (and the ability to bogart a couple packets to userspace)
[02:23:03] <eternaleye> Sadly, OpenHIP seems kind of dormant
[02:23:09] <eternaleye> but HIPL is slightly more lively
[02:23:49] <Ilari> Well, virtual ethernet links where the other end is in userspace is nothing new.
[02:24:22] <eternaleye> Ilari: Neither end is in userspace.
[02:25:17] <Ilari> And then there are similar links at IP level, and all manner of other "punt packets to userspace" stuff.
[02:25:39] <eternaleye> Ilari: The idea is that the user opens a socket with the HIT as the ipv6 addr, a catchall firewall rule snarfs it for the daemon, the daemon does a mapping, a key exchange, sets up a BEET tunnel, and then adds a tighter firewall rule to send that one HIT's traffic over the tunnel
[02:25:50] <eternaleye> And possibly reinject the packet
[02:25:59] <eternaleye> (though since IP is best-effort, that's not required)
[02:26:37] <eternaleye> Ilari: Then, the steady-state has no userspace involvement at all
[02:26:52] <eternaleye> Ilari: (aside from rekeying once in a while)
[02:29:25] <eternaleye> Ilari: So when I say "can be implemented entirely in userspace" I don't mean some "do all the work in userspace and say it works" bs
[02:29:50] <eternaleye> Ilari: I mean "You can get full speed without kernel changes because it was designed to reuse existing machinery"
[02:35:41] <Ilari> Looks like the LISP dataplane is designed to be implementable in hardware.

[04:16:47] <eternaleye> bascule: There's always the (admittedly performance-costing) option of DHT updates requiring the uploader sign the (update, storing-node) tuple
[04:17:15] <eternaleye> bascule: It works so long as nodes only upload data that is both about their own identity (and thus bound to their key), and the data is verifiable
[04:17:27] <eternaleye> bascule: But for HIP, that's all true.
[04:20:49] <eternaleye> bascule: Also, the way Kademlia self-structures in favor of long-lived nodes helps avoid Sybil attacks to a degree
[04:21:14] <eternaleye> bascule: It's a (crude) reputation system in its own right
[04:32:25] <eternaleye> Argh. Paul Lambert's mails always have horrendously broken quoting.

[05:02:03] <bascule> eternaleye: securing everything with keys doesn't help
[05:02:29] <bascule> you can generate a cluster of public keys around something you want to DoS if creating nodes in the DHT is easy
[05:02:59] <bascule> route all your lookups there. oops, <thing you want to DoS> isn't available, sorry
[05:03:18] <bascule> gotta solve the Sybil problem or DHTs don't work
[05:03:33] <bascule> also this attack has happened in practice many times
[05:06:12] <eternaleye> bascule: No, my point is that when the purpose of the DHT is mapping from the keys to the addresses, you can use the standard Kademlia routing algorithm to approach it, verifying the signed steps at each point
[05:06:35] <bascule> sure, then you hit the big hostile DoS cluster and...
[05:06:52] <eternaleye> bascule: And since a kademlia node can only possess a nearness hop by having contacted the owner of the node ID, you can guarantee liveness.
[05:07:23] <eternaleye> bascule: No, I mean that if you're trying to reach a HIT, and are using HITs as DHT node IDs, the whole routing algorithm can be made to form a signature chain.

[05:26:09] <eternaleye> ^^^ THIS IS NOT A MEMORY HOG
[05:26:33] <eternaleye> taryn: RSS is how much actual memory it is occupying that isn't shared with anything else
[05:26:43] <eternaleye> taryn: shr is shared pages - libraries and such, that other programs also loaded
[05:26:56] <eternaleye> taryn: Virt is how much *address space* it is using
[05:27:39] <eternaleye> taryn: You may notice that if you run Wine, it has something like 3 gigs or more of Virt, even on a 256mb machine with no swap
[05:27:48] <eternaleye> taryn: That's because it counts mmapped files and such
[05:28:00] <taryn> eternaleye: nah, it gets bad sometimes

[05:39:15] <eternaleye> taryn: As well as voting on the result
[05:39:52] <eternaleye> taryn: So they negotiate a leader, and that leader proposes the messages to be logged. If it matches what the others saw, then they also vote for it.
[05:40:00] <eternaleye> taryn: Once a quorum is reached, every logger saves.
[05:40:21] <eternaleye> taryn: As long as more than half of the listeners are up, it keeps logging seamlessly
[05:40:53] <taryn> eternaleye: aye, but I'd rather keep the same nick

[05:43:02] <eternaleye> taryn: Running a better protocol, and having the servers also offer legacy IRC access to clients
[05:43:15] <eternaleye> taryn: But that requires the servers change

[18:35:55] <tiffany> where does the use of the term sybil come from?
[18:36:23] <tiffany> a bunch of fake nodes in byzantine agreement does not exactly sound like greek women with prophetic powers
[18:37:12] <tiffany> ah
[18:37:19] <tiffany> is it a reference to the book of the same name?
[18:37:52] <tiffany> oh, yeah, it is
[18:38:10] <tiffany> it's ridiculous how many google search term swaps I had to do just to get the wikipedia page on sybil attack
[18:39:25] <eternaleye> tiffany: Huh, my first try was 'sybil attack network' (sans quotes), which worked perfectly
[18:39:41] <tiffany> sybil attack was the last search I tried
[18:39:49] <eternaleye> Mm
[18:46:18] <tiffany> I don't quite understand the quorum slices described in the scp paper
[18:48:59] <bascule> tiffany: the movie, I thought
[18:49:06] <bascule> but I guess there's a book too?
[18:49:20] <bascule> I should watch that movie. Apparently it heavily inspired one of my favorite bands (Tears for Fears)
[18:49:30] <bascule> who literally named one of their albums "Songs From The Big Chair"
[18:49:34] <bascule> after the chair in the movie
[18:51:35] <tiffany> so everyone agrees on which nodes are the most trusted, and then they are the ones which carries out transactions?
[18:51:47] <eternaleye> tiffany: Basically, node N will accept any slice S from the set of its quorum slices \blackboard S as a quorum
[18:52:02] <eternaleye> tiffany: However, each node in N does the same
[18:52:18] <eternaleye> tiffany: So the network quorum is the union of slices transitively
[18:53:29] <eternaleye> Er, node in S
[18:55:46] <eternaleye> tiffany: the result is that you have a list of possible network quorums, by basically taking a sort of transitive-powerset 
[18:58:30] <tiffany> what do the quorums do?
[18:58:33] <eternaleye> tiffany: it may help if you reverse the arrows
[18:59:32] <eternaleye> tiffany: standard voting terminology, a motion can't pass without a quorum of voters
[19:00:56] <eternaleye> tiffany: if A has slices (B, C) and (D, E), it will report success if _all_ nodes in _any one_ slice report success
[19:01:21] <tiffany> ah
[19:01:43] <eternaleye> tiffany: but B and C may have similar preconditions
[19:02:26] <eternaleye> tiffany: basically, it's disjunctive normal form
[19:03:08] <eternaleye> where each term is a reference to another DNF expression

[19:29:09] <tiffany> ooh, does scp perform no IO on its own?
[19:29:12] <tiffany> the implementation, rather
[19:29:36] <tiffany> it doesn't even tie itself up with a wire format
[19:29:38] <tiffany> I love this already
[19:34:49] <tiffany> I don't have a full understanding of scp yet but I don't see anything I don't like about it so far
[19:35:11] <tiffany> I will probably end up using this for something someday
[19:37:55] <bascule> yeah, sounds awesome
[19:38:50] <bascule> lol Facebook:
[19:38:51] <bascule> • x * 105 files
[19:38:52] <bascule> • y * 107 LoC
[19:38:55] <bascule> err
[19:38:59] <bascule> that's 10^5 and 10^7
[19:39:07] <bascule> and PHP code

[19:40:42] <bascule> heh
[19:42:24] <tiffany> they sure do make it abundantly clear
[19:42:34] <bascule> I love that naming convention
[19:43:04] <tiffany> what's the naming convention based on?
[19:45:14] <mcpherrin> there was a newsgroup, alt.barney.dinosaur.die.die.die
[19:45:43] <mcpherrin> Dunno if that's the origin or what.  Before my time :)

[19:50:58] <tiffany> oh
[19:51:09] <tiffany> so "diediedie" is a literal name and not some 3 identifiers that had to be filled in
[19:52:10] <mcpherrin> there was also alt.ensign.wesley.die.die.die

[19:55:07] <kmc> alt.simpsons.die.bart.die?

[21:23:18] <Ilari> Lol, idea to show warnings on unencrypted submit is "awesome"? I remember web browsers used to do that, and it was pretty universally turned off.
[21:26:50] <tiffany> like, forms?
[21:31:31] <Ilari> Yeah.
[21:31:55] <tiffany> I vaguely remember seeing that in IE or something
[21:38:27] <c74d3> I recall that being in Firefox, back when I used Firefox.
[21:41:26] <Ilari> Yeah, it was in web browsers back then. Seemingly gotten removed entierely since.
[22:13:38] <kmc> one time I was checking in at the airport and the kiosk popped up the warning about unencrypted form data

[23:12:18] <Dcoder> it's one thing to say it's extremely hard to accomplish
[23:12:29] <Dcoder> it's another to say it's flat-out impossible -- that's dishinest
[23:40:42] <Ilari> Well, it is likely so hard as to be infeasible.
[23:46:32] <Ilari> Just because something is in theory possible doesn't mean it is practical.
