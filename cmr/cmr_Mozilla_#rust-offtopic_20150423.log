[00:04:26] <huon> bstrie: that's what my blog is
[00:04:31] <huon> essentially: https://github.com/huonw/huonw.github.io/tree/master/_posts
[00:04:55] <huon> you require jekyll configuration in the repo, but there's absolutely no need to have jekyll installed locally
[00:05:57] <huon> github pages runs jekyll itself to render that into HTML
[00:09:29] <huon> point being: uploading markdown works fine, whatever issues you're having with the online editor are probably unrelated
[00:13:04] <bstrie> huon: that looks perfect, I have no idea why github hasn't given me the full directory structure like I was expecting there

[01:03:44] * bstrie forks huon's blog to avoid having to install jekyll just to set up directories
[01:03:55] * ChrisMorgan declines to use github.io
[01:04:26] <huon> bstrie: there's a lot of crap in it
[01:04:35] <huon> be warned :P
[01:04:53] * ChrisMorgan uses hyde in his blog, somewhat hacked about; python-only which is better than being stuck using ruby stuff
[01:05:21] <huon> instead you're stuck using python stuff ;P
[01:06:44] <ChrisMorgan> I’ve added features like inline code highlighting (which practically *no one* has), the ability to <mark> sections of syntax-highlighted code with «…». That’s how http://chrismorgan.info/blog/rust-fizzbuzz.html ends up so nice ☺
[01:06:48] <bstrie> at least python stuff comes installed, so there's a *chance*, however small, that it works without having to install garbage :)
[01:07:12] <bstrie> ChrisMorgan: I think your blog looks very nice, now rewrite the generator in rust and we'll talk :)
[01:07:39] <ChrisMorgan> Oh, and I’m using my own fork of pygments with up-to-date Rust highlighting, see https://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/pygments-main/pull-request/423/generally-improve-rust-highlighting
[01:08:25] * ChrisMorgan is strongly contemplating changing his website’s body font-family to Crimson Text
[01:08:45] <bstrie> yeah, the ubuntu font is my one criticism :P
[01:09:06] <bstrie> it's just too "generic open-sourcey"
[01:09:56] <ChrisMorgan> I’ll keep Ubuntu Mono for the code, but in recent years I’ve steadily headed towards going serif for body text.
[01:11:00] <ChrisMorgan> My résumé uses Crimson Text to good effect. But then my résumé is not exactly a typical résumé. For starters, it’s HTML.

[01:34:17] <bstrie> better to close down my Jane Austen-themed blog
[01:34:47] <barosl> In Korea there's a joke that serif is used to express being serious, and sans-serif for others
[01:35:31] <barosl> I guess that's because we use sans-serif more widely?

[05:28:37] <barosl> By the way, it is interesting that the font definition is written in plain text format
[05:28:56] <ChrisMorgan> What, you want it to be XML? 😛
[05:29:20] <barosl> Nah, I thought they were in binary format
[05:29:26] <barosl> Is .sdf the default format of fontforge?
[05:29:35] <barosl> .sfd*
[05:29:42] <barosl> Google says it's Spline Font Database
[05:29:50] <ChrisMorgan> Yeah, it’s FontForge’s native format.
[05:30:04] <ChrisMorgan> Why should they be binary, frankly?
[05:30:07] <barosl> "Its native Spline Font Database format (.sfd file name extension) is text-based"
[05:30:09] <barosl> It seems so
[05:30:36] * ChrisMorgan likes how searching for .sfd on DuckDuckGo shows FontForge’s official website first
[05:30:40] <barosl> Hmm, yeah, there's no special reasons. Maybe the bitmap font data made me think so?
[05:30:54] <ChrisMorgan> No one uses bitmap fonts any more.
[05:31:09] <barosl> We Koreans do, unfortunately (sigh)
[05:31:22] <ChrisMorgan> Oh yeah, I forgot about that.
[05:31:28] <barosl> Many many sites in South Korea still utilize bitmap fonts tremendously
[05:32:01] <barosl> And because of that, I cannot be used to the new generation of pure vector-based fonts...
[05:32:14] <barosl> They still look "new" to me

[05:34:14] <eddyb> there's no lockstep iteration, $name is deeply repeating :|
[05:34:21] <cmr> The only bitmap fonts I've used were in my terminal, when I had a crap display, both in DPI and resolution, and wanted a small but good looking font.
[05:34:36] <Tobba> also fuck all vector formats and their ridiculous rules for if a pixel should be filled or not
[05:34:52] <cmr> eh?
[05:34:54] <Tobba> the only way to render that sanely is either to triangulate or solve a cubic equation for every pixel

[05:36:30] <Tobba> true
[05:36:53] <Tobba> I still need to finish my TTF renderer
[05:37:08] <niconii> Tobba: that was an era where you could still get operating systems on sets of floppies
[05:37:10] <Tobba> I guess I'll use the triangulation method instead
[05:37:36] <Tobba> niconii: I'm still aiming to fit my OS on a floppy, just because
[05:37:58] <niconii> Tobba: sounds fun :)
[05:38:15] <Tobba> I managed to pull out the points correctly etc
[05:38:20] <Tobba> then I ran into filling that stuff
[05:38:35] <Tobba> bezier/bezier curve intersection to figure out what parts are actually filled is hell on earth
[05:38:55] <Tobba> so the alternative is to trace a line for every pixel
[05:39:01] <eddyb> .... what? http://is.gd/sL3zXv
[05:39:39] <Tobba> which needs you to solve a quadratic equation for every curve at every pixel (unless I can come up with some better way)
[05:39:43] <eddyb> and this is lockstep http://is.gd/yoGpOJ
[05:40:11] <barosl> Macros are... so magical...
[05:40:18] <eddyb> so I guess it's just stupid
[05:40:42] <eddyb> time to transpose my table... ugh this is going to hurt
[05:42:28] <barosl> http://fontforge.github.io/en-US/
[05:42:48] <barosl> lol, the fontforge website is so fancy, compared to the motif-based look and feel of the application
[05:44:14] <cmr> oh wow, that website has been updated a lot
[05:44:16] <cmr> and moved to github!
[05:44:53] <cmr> but yeah, the UI beauty to usefulness ratio of fontforge is higher than any other program I've ever used.
[05:45:43] <Tobba> I downloaded it and tried it
[05:45:51] <Tobba> they have a custom open window which doesn't let me get onto my F: drive
[05:45:53] <Tobba> 10/10
[05:46:55] <cmr> s/higher/lower/
[05:47:02] <cmr> fractions are hard
[05:47:27] <ChrisMorgan> Tobba: that reminds me of how I can’t access my website through SFTP in the file manager I have on my phone, because it opens to the root of the shared server, /home is not listable and it doesn’t let you type in a path to go to.
[05:47:30] <Tobba> so the UI looks like crap but is usable?
[05:47:41] <barosl> cmr, I actually doubted my English interpretation skill after reading your sentence :P
[05:47:56] <cmr> no, the UI looks like crap and it's not super usable, but it's a super useful program
[05:48:08] <barosl> "Did A-to-B mean B/A? I thought it was A/B" was my thought
[05:48:34] <ChrisMorgan> “I don’t know why you need fontforge to edit your font, it’s plain text so you can just use vim if fontforge is too hard to use!”

[05:49:36] <barosl> Is there anybody who modifies XPM using Vim?
[05:49:56] <cmr> I have in the past.
[05:50:00] <barosl> It actually shows you a visualization, so... it's definitely possible
[05:50:03] <cmr> although it wasn't vim, I think it was nano.
[05:50:24] <barosl> Urgh, in that case it would be a bit harder, as you don't get a visual representation
[05:50:30] * cmr was building a linux from scratch system and had not built nano yet
[05:50:34] <cmr> s/nano/vim
[05:50:43] * cmr goes back to code, clearly cannot talk today
[05:51:09] <ChrisMorgan> Always fun: open /usr/share/pixmaps/*.xpm in gVim
[05:51:19] <Tobba> I kinda wish svg files were binary
[05:51:24] <Tobba> but only kind of
[05:51:34] <barosl> Would that increase rendering performance?
[05:51:40] <Tobba> probably not.
[05:51:46] <Tobba> but it'd make them easier to read and smaller
[05:51:52] <Tobba> well. for a computer to read, anyways
[05:52:09] <ChrisMorgan> It’d also make tweaking them by hand harder.
[05:52:18] <Tobba> actually just some alternative binary form would be convenient
[05:52:40] <barosl> I've always thought text formats are better, but after the emergence of HTTP/2, my mind changed a bit
[05:53:26] <Tobba> I've always liked binary over text formats because I always end up being the one writing the parser
[05:53:50] <barosl> I thought Google's SPDY was an obsessive step to squeeze the last bit of performance... But hell, it finally became a standard named HTTP/2!
[05:54:05] <ChrisMorgan> … and it’s still just as horrid in many ways.
[05:54:21] <ChrisMorgan> Multiplexing shouldn’t need to be implemented below TCP.
[05:55:20] * ChrisMorgan bemoans how SCTP didn’t take off
[05:55:59] <barosl> Oh, so SCTP was an attemp to replace TCP

[05:58:38] <barosl> ChrisMorgan, Interestingly, Google's QUIC also tries to multiplex things... So if Google uses QUIC/SPDY(HTTP/2) at the same time, there would be two entities that try to multiplex data...
[05:59:16] <cmr> I think sandstorm is pretty promising.
[06:00:24] <ChrisMorgan> barosl: QUIC sits on UDP and provides most of what SCTP already provided in a way that’s necessarily a little slower; I don’t think it offers anything beyond that, either.
[06:01:24] <barosl> ChrisMorgan, I've heard about SCTP today for the first time, but Wikipedia says it can also be implemented on top of UDP... Now I'm curious what's the point of QUIC
[06:02:04] <barosl> QUIC mandates TLS, so that might be the reason

[09:35:17] <Zoxc> cmr: How is symbol tables handled in Rust's AST? Is it just a map from Name to NodeId?
[09:36:26] <cmr> Zoxc: it's a bit more complicated than that. there's no single entity you would be able to say "that's the symbol table"
[09:37:06] <Zoxc> I usually have a symbol table in each scope with a pointer to it's parent
[09:38:16] <cmr> name resolution happens in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/librustc_resolve/lib.rs
[09:38:30] <cmr> it's... complicated. I don't think anyone understands it anymore.
[09:40:38] <cmr> scattered throughout the compiler, but mostly concentrated in the tcx, there are various maps from DefIds or NodeIds to other stuff, which taken altogether could be considered the symbol table.
[09:41:50] <Zoxc> So you think Name -> NodeId maps and then a NodeId -> &Item map would be a good way to go for an AST?
[09:43:34] <cmr> I wouldn't store names at all in the AST, and rustc doesn't (for the most part)
[09:45:39] <Zoxc> I stole the interner from rustc and use basically the same Name type =P
[09:47:04] <Zoxc> The NodeId -> &Item map would freeze the AST. So that might get in trouble with macros and #[derive] things

[09:53:53] <cmr> Zoxc: there's a separate map from nodeid -> type

[13:09:07] <tiffany> it's actually happened accidentally a few times in the past
[13:09:18] <tiffany> due to bugs in the client, or upgrading the clients
[13:09:33] <tiffany> usually one of them is defective and is quickly orphaned
[13:10:10] <tiffany> I think the thing about the 51% attack is that you want to break the network into two halves with each half of the user base
[13:10:16] <tiffany> instead of just yourself and then everyone else splitting apart
[13:10:35] <tiffany> so you have to own enough of the network to be able to sever most if not all of the connections between each half you wish to split off
[13:10:48] <tiffany> and once you've down that, you can go and double-spend bitcoins to your heart's delight
[13:11:17] <tiffany> I don't think you actually need 51% of the network in order to do this
[13:11:24] <eddyb> ugh, that
[13:11:36] <eddyb> *that's less than useful for what I was thinking
[13:12:37] <eddyb> tiffany: basically, a system which can be subverted by an agreement between 50%+1 peers *by design*
[13:13:43] <tiffany> bitcoin has a lot of near-insurmountable design flaws
[13:14:59] <eddyb> (I've been pondering about a practical way to implement the "abolish and begin anew" procedure of The Social Contract)
[13:15:57] <tiffany> so, bitcoin does consensus by proof of work
[13:16:01] <tiffany> but stellar does consensus by voting
[13:16:11] <tiffany> that might be more up your alley
[13:16:14] <eddyb> I need to look at stellar again
[13:16:34] <tiffany> one thing they had noted is that you can use the consensus algorithm to run votes on whether or not to upgrade the protocol of the network
[13:16:36] <eddyb> "voting" doesn't sound fancy enough
[13:16:50] <eddyb> tiffany: but what would do the upgrade?
[13:17:25] <tiffany> the users, or maybe something built into the client
[13:17:44] <eddyb> voting gives you faux democracy
[13:17:48] <tiffany> every time there's a new incompatible bitcoin client version it's a bit of a nightmare to get everyone to upgrade
[13:17:58] <Tobba> does stellar use proof of stake?
[13:18:02] <tiffany> no
[13:18:02] <Tobba> or does it do something else to deal with sibyls
[13:18:17] <tiffany> federated byzantine agreement
[13:18:42] <tiffany> it deals with sibyls in a way that I do not entirely understand
[13:18:49] <Tobba> yeah I don't uh

[13:34:47] <Tobba> ignoring the problem of routing and the latency stacking up, getting enough wireless bandwidth...
[13:35:25] <Tobba> to increase bandwidth you'd have to decrease the transmission radius of each node, to stop them from interfering

[13:37:26] <tiffany> so much interference
[13:38:01] <eddyb> hmm
[13:38:04] <Tobba> also with a bazillion of nodes you need to efficiently coordinate the routing so that everything gets evenly distributed over every node
[13:38:13] <eddyb> so what if you had something *very* dumb?

[13:39:20] <Tobba> (I got bored)
[13:39:36] <eddyb> so you have this rectangle of perfectly arranged nodes and they all know about the configuration they're in
[13:39:54] <eddyb> each message is prefixed with a list of directions to take
[13:40:57] <eddyb> you're then struggling for bandwidth because there's not enough distribution of the network capacity (each route is the most direct one)
[13:40:59] <Tobba> then the more nodes, the more bandwidth you waste
[13:41:41] <eddyb> hmm
[13:41:48] <eddyb> I was wrong about the list of directions
[13:41:57] <eddyb> effectively, it's just a x and y delta
[13:42:51] <Tobba> you could try grouping collections of nearby nodes together
[13:42:58] <Tobba> so you just route based on those groups first hand
[13:42:58] <eddyb> how do you do dumb routing on that, while being better than doing thing?
[13:43:01] <Tobba> and then within that group
[13:43:35] <eddyb> now I'm tempted to write an optimizer
[13:43:55] <eddyb> given a node and (dx, dy), pick a direction
[13:44:20] <eddyb> it should never go back whence it came, so you have only 3 possible choices

[13:46:57] <Tobba> well
[13:47:23] <eddyb> I wish we had algorithm reduction tools, with data dependency tracking and whatnot
[13:47:31] <Tobba> if you take every possible route (that doesn't have any loops in it)
[13:47:38] <Tobba> you should randomly pick one, weighted by how good it is
[13:47:45] <Tobba> that should help you distribute traffic across nodes

[17:28:17] *** Quits: pcwalton (pcwalton@moz-6kjabm.ca.comcast.net) (Client exited)
[17:28:20] <WindowsBunny> whenever you install an app, it comes with all its dependencies bundled
[17:28:24] <simukis> WindowsBunny: so, what’s the point of using shared libraries in windows, if you’re shipping your own anyway
[17:28:39] <WindowsBunny> People typically avoid shared libraries on windows
[17:29:01] <Hannibal_Smith> simukis, what MS is proposing for managing dependency with .Net and C++ is called NuGet
[17:29:12] <WindowsBunny> Hannibal_Smith: But that's only for the build system
[17:29:20] <simukis> As far as I remember each install came with a bundle of dlls anyway.
[17:29:35] <simukis> I know of no project other than glibc which cannot be linked to statically
[17:29:52] <WindowsBunny> simukis: lgpl libraries
[17:30:04] <WindowsBunny> commercial software + lgpl library = required dynamic linking
[17:30:27] <simukis> hmm, fair point.
[17:30:50] <simukis> openssl is 3-clause BSD though
[17:30:51] <WindowsBunny> simukis: also closed source libraries
[17:30:55] <simukis> 4-clause
[17:31:07] <simukis> WindowsBunny: link those statically
[17:31:27] <WindowsBunny> closed source libraries are typically distributed as DLLs
[17:31:37] <simukis> demand your distributor to provide `.lib`s or whatever static library equivalent on windows is
[17:31:39] <WindowsBunny> because if it is static it has to be built with the same CRT and same settings as the application
[17:31:43] <WindowsBunny> otherwise pain occurs
[17:31:54] <simukis> now the question then again is why would one do that?
[17:32:13] <WindowsBunny> and since the CRT changes with each version of VS
[17:32:16] <simukis> no, you don’t have to build static library with same settings, same CRT, maybe
[17:32:22] <WindowsBunny> closed source libraries just give you a DLL and deal with it
[17:32:45] <simukis> then again, openssl is opensource anyway
[17:32:48] <WindowsBunny> well some settings have to be the same
[17:32:55] <WindowsBunny> and if openssl is dynamically linked, I dunno
[17:33:07] <WindowsBunny> guess its just a personal preference of the dev team
[17:33:21] <WindowsBunny> simukis: Its actually because building openssl on windows
[17:33:24] <WindowsBunny> is a royal pain and a half
[17:33:44] <WindowsBunny> Did I mention openssl doesn't support being built by VS?
[17:34:22] <simukis> WindowsBunny: still distributing one .rlib is much saner than distributing a .dll *and* a .rlib, both of which are prone to wrong pathes, duplication and whatnot
[17:34:36] <WindowsBunny> When a library has to be built by mingw, and your application is built by VS
[17:34:41] <WindowsBunny> you have no choice but to link dynamically
[17:35:04] <WindowsBunny> I agree that static linking is nicer than dynamic linking
[17:35:06] <simukis> in rust there’s no distinction
[17:35:18] <simukis> because it is rust+llvm, not rust+gcc or rust+vc
[17:35:37] <simukis> also, do really these microsoft guys have absolutely no ABI stability on the libc of all things?
[17:35:59] <WindowsBunny> the ABI breaks between each CRT version
[17:36:14] <simukis> that’s disappointing
[17:36:18] <WindowsBunny> I believe they recently moved to a new model
[17:36:33] <WindowsBunny> where one core part of the CRT has a stable ABI

[20:24:38] <Lurkin> I think I get a bit of a buzz whenever I find a new source of information that is complete and perfect in every way.
[20:25:48] <Lurkin> I mean I guess that's subjective, but when you find a source of docs that answer a question you've had or explains better than what you were hoping for or links to the next logical procession of things, I just get goosebumps like cray.
[20:26:11] <XMPPwocky> i always forget you have to write out full template parameters in C++
[20:29:20] <scott> XMPPwocky: in what sense / as opposed to what?
[20:29:41] <XMPPwocky> scott: inference / elision
[20:29:55] <XMPPwocky> i.e std::make_unique<SomeType>(foo)
[20:30:19] <scott> you can leave them out on functions in some cases (but never on classes/types)
[20:30:36] <scott> C++ inference is probably not strong enough to let you leave it out on make_unique
[20:30:56] <XMPPwocky> reading http://bromeon.ch/articles/raii.html
[20:33:07] <scott> afaik C++ will never infer the type of something based on where it's used (ie. what its return value must be to fit) which is what you need to make std::unique_ptr<T> x = std::make_unique(y); work
[20:33:30] <scott> at least auto x = std::make_unique<T>(y); avoids typing the type twice

[21:15:32] <bstrie> I like that recent blog post on rust vs C++ by a boost developer who was like "honestly I don't think rust even has type inference"
[21:15:44] <WindowsBunny> bstrie: link?
[21:15:55] <bstrie> to C++ developers, apparently type inference means `auto` as a return type from your function...
[21:16:44] <bstrie> WindowsBunny: https://plus.google.com/+nialldouglas/posts/AXFJRSM8u2t
[21:16:50] <bstrie> was it that post? I think so...
[21:17:21] <WindowsBunny> bstrie: I like Rust's explicit type signatures with inference everywhere else
[21:17:31] <WindowsBunny> bstrie: However, I really hope we get abstract return types soon
[21:17:40] <WindowsBunny> -> impl Fn() would be so kickass
[21:17:46] <scott> C++ doesn't even call auto return types inference. it usually gets labelled "return type deduction"
[21:18:02] <scott> since it does't do anything resembling type inference
[21:18:08] <bstrie> I like "deduction" there
[21:18:37] <scott> actually auto in general in C++ doesn't do inference
[21:18:39] * WindowsBunny deducts five points from bstrie
[21:18:41] <bstrie> as terminology to disambiguate between type inference on a HM-scale and the simple right-hand-side type inference that auto does
[21:21:16] <scott> -> impl return types seem really cool
[21:21:44] <barosl> I thought C++ does Hindley-Milner inference
[21:21:53] <barosl> `auto`, I mean
[21:21:58] <scott> I'm 99% sure it doesn't
[21:22:16] <barosl> Is it difficult to adopt Hindley-Milner in C++?
[21:22:17] <niconii> okay they're complaining about what all they have to do to swap two variables but
[21:22:22] <scott> it just takes the type of the RHS (extremely locally) plus a couple rules with references
[21:22:29] <niconii> all they have to do is std::mem::swap(&mut a, &mut b)
[21:22:41] <niconii> none of this let x = &mut a; stuff is necessary at all
[21:22:48] <barosl> +Block scoping
[21:22:55] <niconii> right
[21:22:56] <scott> yeah the poster didn't have a great understanding of Rust
[21:23:05] <scott> at least in that area
[21:23:05] <barosl> But that was understandable, as I also did something like that when I first learned Rust
[21:23:07] <bstrie> `auto multiply (int x, int y) -> int;` <-- holy crap, I didn't realize this was legal C++ syntax
[21:23:18] <scott> welcome to C++11
[21:23:32] <barosl> Uh, what does ` -> int` do while `auto` is there
[21:23:34] <bstrie> I thought we were being trendsetters with the return-type arrow
[21:24:00] <scott> barosl: identical to the normal int multiply(int x, int y) declaration
[21:24:00] <WindowsBunny> barosl: That's how you specify trailing return types
[21:24:06] <WindowsBunny> you need to put auto first
[21:24:10] <barosl> Ooooh
[21:24:16] <barosl> Perfect
[21:24:19] <scott> the point of trailing return types is bringing the arguments in scope for things like decltype
[21:24:21] <WindowsBunny> you can leave out the -> part, in which case you force C++ to deduce the return type for you
[21:24:47] <bstrie> barosl: http://www.cprogramming.com/c++11/c++11-auto-decltype-return-value-after-function.html
[21:25:00] <bstrie> barosl: that gives an example where auto and the arrow make a declaration a little nicer
[21:25:06] <scott> template<typename T, typename U> auto add(T t, U u) -> decltype(t + u) { return t + u; }
[21:26:07] <scott> Rust for scale: fn add<T, U>(t: T, u: U) -> T::Output where T: Add<U> { t + u }
[21:26:18] <barosl> "Because the return value goes at the end of the function, instead of before it, you don't need to add the class scope."
[21:26:20] <barosl> Uhm, what?
[21:26:55] <barosl> That's... odd. So the compiler cannot extract the class scope before looking at `Person::`
[21:27:04] <bstrie> fun syntax fact: Go uses `name type` syntax instead of C's `type name` or Rust's `name: type`, but rob pike's earlier languages used `name: type` and this was the reason for `:=` to denote inferred types
[21:28:51] <barosl> Oh, and decltype inside `-> ...` can also utilize the parameters passed to the function. Cool

[21:29:03] <barosl> I really have to learn C++11
[21:29:23] <scott> C++14 lets you have auto return type without a trailing return
[21:29:30] <barosl> int& foo();
[21:29:30] <barosl> auto bar = foo(); // int
[21:29:30] <barosl> auto& baz = foo(); // int&

[21:29:57] <scott> auto takes the RHS type and strips the references off it, basically

[21:30:12] <WindowsBunny> decltype(auto) bah = foo(); // int&
[21:30:21] <WindowsBunny> :D
[21:30:32] <scott> decltype(auto) takes it more literally (and is C++14 iirc?)
[21:30:34] <barosl> What the hell is `decltype(auto)`
[21:30:41] <barosl> What can you infer from auto
[21:30:45] <WindowsBunny> lol, you C++ scrubs
[21:30:46] <scott> it's what you probably expected auto to be
[21:31:02] *** Joins: Kingsquee (kingsley@moz-qq7ns6.bchsia.telus.net)
[21:31:06] <scott> decltype(auto) x = expr; is roughly like decltype(expr) x = expr; I think
[21:31:12] <scott> maybe exactly like, but I'm not sure
[21:31:16] <barosl> Bah
[21:31:43] <scott> my coworker tells me there's some oddities with decltype(auto), too, but I forget what they are
[21:32:11] <barosl> int* foo();
[21:32:12] <barosl> auto p_bar = foo(); // int*
[21:32:12] <barosl> auto *p_baz = foo(); // int*
[21:32:17] <barosl> These are more amusing
[21:32:26] <barosl> In this case the compiler actually ignores *
[21:32:29] <scott> the last one surprises me
[21:32:47] <barosl> Two things to memorize already
[21:33:23] <scott> it's incredible how much sense Rust makes in comparison
[21:33:34] <niconii> y'know, i've been programming for about 10 years now, but i never actually bothered to learn c++
[21:33:41] <barosl> And the author ends the article with:
[21:33:43] <scott> the inference is more global yet still more understandable in Rust
[21:33:43] <niconii> starting to think that was probably a good move
[21:33:44] <barosl> "Overall, it feels quite natural and normal, and it follows the normal type inference rules of templates in C++."
[21:33:48] <barosl> O...k
[21:34:03] <barosl> I'm not quite natural yet
[21:34:32] <scott> "it feels quite natural and normal" - things that can't possibly be describing C++
[21:34:54] <barosl> niconii, C++ was my first programming language, so I'm feeling somewhat love and hatred towards it
[21:35:09] <WindowsBunny> C++ is what I used all the time until Rust took over my life
[21:35:21] <scott> I learned C++ out of a kind of morbid curiosity and self-challenge
[21:35:35] <scott> so many weird details and interacting misfeatures
[21:35:36] <barosl> Actually I really learned C++ even before being aware of C
[21:36:08] <barosl> So I hadn't known about printf/scanf until 3-4 years passed after the time I first learned C++
[21:36:33] <scott> heh, as bad as printf is, I often reach for it instead of cout in C++
[21:36:44] <niconii> i don't even remember what my first real programming language was tbh
[21:37:01] <barosl> scott, Yeah, that's what I thought when I first knew the existence of printf. It was so magical and convenient!
[21:37:19] <WindowsBunny> even though printf is super unsafe
[21:37:25] <barosl> +scanf, which is damn too hell wonderful
[21:37:32] <barosl> Before that I parsed the string myself
[21:37:51] <WindowsBunny> scanf is a simpler version of regex
[21:38:07] <niconii> but i do know that my very first experience programming was a pretty limited scripting language called ZZT-OOP
[21:38:19] <niconii> which was part of a text-mode DOS game called ZZT
[21:38:25] <barosl> Huh
[21:38:41] <niconii> it let you make your own games and stuff... very *primitive* games, mind you, but
[21:38:44] <scott> the first code I looked at seriously was probably morrowind scripting code
[21:38:53] <barosl> Thinking of that, I can imagine some Wow player learning programming for the first time with Lua...
[21:39:14] <scott> one of my favourite memories was finding a 'while' loop and having no idea what it meant
[21:39:18] <niconii> i honestly don't know what came after that, though
[21:39:33] <scott> 'if' was easy, but these were scripts that potentially ran once per frame. they rarely had loops
[21:39:36] <niconii> some vague period where i picked up C and ruby at some point
[21:39:43] <niconii> but i knew how to program before that
[21:40:25] <bstrie> barosl: there are kids today learning how to program by building redstone circuits in minecraft :P
[21:40:38] <niconii> i don't even think i *know* what programming languages i know, what the hell
[21:40:42] <bstrie> we might be raising a generation of really great electrical engineers
[21:40:56] <barosl> Cool, they owe to notch for that
[21:41:25] <scott> I built a thing using a latch thingy in minecraft from designs on the wiki without ever really understanding why it worked
[21:42:24] <scott> there are mods that let you script things in-game with lua or forth

[21:43:43] <niconii> when did i learn how to program

[21:45:18] <scott> I never read programming books, at least not fully, so it's hard to point at something and say that's how I learned language X
[21:46:04] <scott> my first main language was Ruby which as far as I can tell I learned by reading a million sucky blog posts, using and abusing the REPL, and synthesizing all the bits in my head somehow
[21:46:37] <scott> the same thing happened with C and C++, although I read part of a book for C++ since it's not so easy to just figure it out on your own
[21:46:51] <niconii> yeah, i didn't read books on programming either, so it's pretty vague for me
[21:47:23] <scott> Rust I've mostly learned by sitting in IRC and seeing what kind of problems people run into. already knowing C++, Haskell, Ruby, and others helps a lot, too
