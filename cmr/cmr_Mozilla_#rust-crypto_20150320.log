[16:28:07] *** Joins: eternaleye (eternaleye@moz-5fh.ehi.245.50.IP)
[16:29:09] <Ilari> "We will have an update on curves," -- About CFRG agenda for next week.
[16:33:07] <Ilari> BTW, at least one of the Firefox hacks on Pwn2own involved abusing code that should not be there in releases.
[16:35:30] * bascule tries to figure out how to initialize a const byte array from a byte string o_O
[16:35:52] <bascule> hahaha yeah Ilari that was hilarious
[16:36:08] <bascule> the I_HATE_SECURITY_AND_WANT_MY_COMPUTER_TO_GET_OWNED setting or whatever?
[16:37:11] <Ilari> Yeah, something like that.
[16:41:02] <tiffany> security.turn_off_all_security_so_that_viruses_can_take_over_this_computer
[16:41:16] <tiffany> it's apparently used as part of their testsuite
[16:41:44] <tiffany> they want to keep it in because when you have arbitrary memory read/write with enough granularity to change preferences, removing this option is not going to stop you
[16:42:17] <tiffany> the pwn2own exploit probably used it either because it was funny or because it was readily available
[16:43:15] <Ilari> Stuff like that can make exploitation much easier.
[16:43:24] <tiffany> maybe
[16:43:49] <tiffany> is there anything to stop you, with memory read/write, from setting your own javascript context to a higher privilege level instead, though?
[16:44:08] <tiffany> even this option is too obviously named to social engineer someone into enabling it, as well
[16:44:30] <tiffany> well
[16:44:32] <tiffany> I take that back
[16:45:08] <Ilari> Actually, setting your javascript to higher privilege level might not be exactly easy.
[16:45:47] <tiffany> I guess so
[16:45:53] <tiffany> I don't really know how it works in firefox
[16:46:12] <tiffany> I do know that the exploit turns on that option, and then uses enablePrivilege
[16:46:18] <tiffany> which is, from the sound of it, deprecated
[16:46:42] <Ilari> The problem being that the internal APIs don't even exist in web page javascript context, so one would have to first get them "mapped" somehow.
[16:46:59] <tiffany> yeah
[16:47:06] <tiffany> that's what enablePrivilege is for
[16:48:20] <tiffany> I'm not really sure of any way to reasonably remove that pref without breaking their test suite
[16:48:35] <tiffany> some people suggested controlling it by environment variable, but that doesn't do you much good
[16:49:07] <tiffany> you still end up with a bool floating about somewhere that can be overwritten by arbitrary memory read/write
[16:49:17] *** Joins: gsingh93 (gulshan@moz-3fu4am.mi.comcast.net)
[16:50:45] <tiffany> turning it off in release builds means they can't run the test suite on release builds
[16:50:59] <tiffany> and I'm not sure it'd be a good idea to have two release builds, one with the pref and one without
[16:51:54] *** Joins: brson (brson@moz-cfhap5.mtv2.mozilla.com)
[16:52:18] <tiffany> oh
[16:52:29] <tiffany> it looks like the pref is only needed for enablePrivilege, and not for SpecialPowers
[16:52:37] <tiffany> and they've transitioned most of the tests to SpecialPowers
[16:57:28] <tiffany> oh
[16:57:38] <tiffany> apparently SpecialPowers requires that pref to be set
[16:59:10] <tiffany> this is kind of a difficult predicament
[16:59:33] <tiffany> if you make it a compile-time setting, it makes it impossible to test the code you're actually shipping to users
[16:59:49] <tiffany> but if you make it a runtime option, there is nothing to stop someone from smashing the value and turning it on for users
[17:00:15] <tiffany> I suppose you could read it from a file which is mapped as read-only?
[17:02:22] <bascule> ugh
[17:02:28] <bascule> tried to switch to bytestrings for this stuff
[17:02:37] <bascule> note: the compiler unexpectedly panicked. this is a bug.
[17:02:39] <bascule> woop
[17:02:44] <Ilari> Yay, ICE.
[17:03:04] <eternaleye> ICE, ICE, baby.
[17:03:51] <Ilari> tiffany: Or have it read-only page.
[17:30:24] <Ilari> Okay, what could possibly go wrong with feature that lets https site redefine how requests to it work? :-)
[17:35:20] <Ilari> And since there is no EV pinning, unless site deploys HPKP, one can use DV cert from essentially some random shady CA to get around all browser warnings (and thus HSTS).
[17:37:19] <Ilari> And thanks to browser features, if you connect to maliscous site under given https:// URL even once, you are fucked.
[17:42:36] <Ilari> Now, consider the number of ad servers that don't have HPKP are on numerious sites + amount of "trusted" CAs...
[17:43:19] <Ilari> Security? What security?
