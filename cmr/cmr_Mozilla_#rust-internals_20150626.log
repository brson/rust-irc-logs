[00:56:38] <blaenk> ey fools what's that one syntax feature called where if you have fn hehe(t: u32, blah: &str) you can then do someu32.hehe("what")
[00:56:48] <blaenk> I thought it was called UFCS in other languages no?
[00:56:55] <sfackler> yeah
[00:57:02] <blaenk> thanks sfackler <3
[00:57:04] <sfackler> in D I believe
[00:57:12] <blaenk> wish we had that, but i dont understand the possible problems that may cause, if any
[00:57:13] <blaenk> would be so nice
[00:57:21] <blaenk> especially for working with typemap/anymap structures
[01:03:34] <Manishearth> eddyb: r? blog draft https://gist.github.com/Manishearth/16c2dac09bdaafc3d6d1
[01:04:09] <eddyb> blaenk: if it requires importing, it's like anonymous traits
[01:04:30] <eddyb> I would rather have it interact with `impl` in some way
[01:05:38] <eddyb> Manishearth: looks good
[01:05:47] <eddyb> I didn't know about the reentrance guard part of it
[01:06:02] <blaenk> you can't just do impl SomeExternalType { blah } right? cause I don't remember. I think they call that being an open type or not? idk
[01:06:03] <eddyb> I wonder if our Once has issues with that
[01:06:20] <Manishearth> eddyb: its all magical
[01:06:31] <eddyb> blaenk: the question is "in which contexts does it apply?"
[01:06:42] <blaenk> yeah
[01:06:42] <Manishearth> eddyb: I'm not yet quite sure how the  LLVM one works on non-apple platforms (not sure how to check)
[01:06:44] <eddyb> blaenk: if it's same-crate, sure. or even just same-module (forbid pub)
[01:07:02] <eddyb> Manishearth: what do you mean?
[01:07:05] <Manishearth> eddyb: the reentrance guard is optional btw
[01:07:12] <blaenk> mainly I would love it for when it's a separate crate, someone else's type you want to expand. preferably a way to be explicit about it, like we currently have with traits
[01:07:17] <eddyb> because C++ has UB and no "safe code"
[01:07:18] <blaenk> so people don't get surprised by things that get added
[01:07:33] <Manishearth> eddyb: https://github.com/llvm-mirror/libcxxabi/blob/master/src/cxa_guard.cpp#L188

[01:08:26] <Manishearth> eddyb: https://github.com/llvm-mirror/libcxxabi/blob/master/src/cxa_guard.cpp#L216
[01:08:31] <Manishearth> tats the ifdef im talking about
[01:08:34] <Manishearth> *thats
[01:08:35] <eddyb> oh
[01:08:40] <Manishearth> I was able to verify the behavior on Apple
[01:09:01] <Manishearth> but clang uses libstdc++ on my machine so I don't know how to verify it on !Apple
[01:09:09] <Manishearth> and the behavior is different
[01:09:16] <eddyb> huh
[01:09:24] <Manishearth> and I suspect a soundness bug there but I'm not sure
[01:09:39] <eddyb> what distro uses libstdc++ with clang?
[01:09:48] <Manishearth> I'm probabl wrong about soundness
[01:09:57] <Manishearth> eddyb: can't I just tell clang to use libcxxabi?
[01:10:23] <eddyb> even if you can, it's tricky
[01:10:30] <Manishearth> bah
[01:10:33] <eddyb> -nostdlibs + a dozen -l flags IIRC
[01:10:41] <eddyb> Manishearth: so what distro does that?
[01:11:02] <Manishearth> *shrug*
[01:11:12] <eddyb> you don't know what distro you're using?
[01:11:36] <Manishearth> I'm on ubuntu
[01:11:44] <eddyb> that's odd, let me check
[01:12:01] <Manishearth> ubuntus clang uses libstdc++. On OSX it uses these libs.
[01:13:05] <Manishearth> I'm not sure why that ifdef exists in the first place, I'm pretty sure an alternative to pthread_mach_thread_np exists on linux
[01:13:22] <eddyb> oh, lol, it's not enabled by default because it's not exactly perfectly usable
[01:13:31] <eddyb> clang++ -stdlib=libc++ helloworld.cpp -nodefaultlibs -lc++ -lc++abi -lm -lc -lgcc_s -lgcc
[01:13:54] <eddyb> Manishearth: from http://libcxx.llvm.org/
[01:14:21] <Manishearth> there's no iostream now 
[01:14:41] <eddyb> make sure you actually have the libs installed
[01:14:46] <Manishearth> oh
[01:14:47] <Manishearth> bah

[02:18:28] <ChrisMorgan> Hmm, actually it doesn’t even need #[prelude_import] after all the convolution required to make it work…
[02:20:05] <ChrisMorgan> It’d be so much simpler if the “variants” of the flags struct were in their own little scope.
[02:20:53] <eddyb> ChrisMorgan: which is what the in-tree version does (via associated constants)
[02:21:40] <ChrisMorgan> Can you glob import associated constants?
[02:22:03] <eddyb> you can't import them at all, not yet
[02:22:33] <ChrisMorgan> Well, that wouldn’t work then.
[02:23:30] <eddyb> gonna make resolve even nastier (at least it doesn't need to look them up, just record the fact that they're partial... hmm... tempted to implement that :D)
[02:25:20] <eddyb> though with globs, that's a breaking change
[02:25:35] <eddyb> because you'd be importing every single method ever into scope
[02:26:33] <eddyb> unless we get the new glob semantics, which themselves might be a breaking change (zz_kimundi should know more)
[02:26:39] <ChrisMorgan> eddyb: what if there was a way to say “I just want to import the constants from this”, like `use Type::*const;` instead of `use Type::*;`? :P
[02:26:59] <ChrisMorgan> Hmm, I do need #[prelude_import] after all for maximal generality…
[02:27:17] <ChrisMorgan> And #[prelude_import] is in stable Rust, so I can happily use it?
[02:27:55] <eddyb> what does that even do?

[02:28:50] <eddyb> ChrisMorgan: what the heck does that do?
[02:28:50] <ChrisMorgan> Hmm… looks like maybe I can do without #[prelude_import] after all.
[02:29:03] <ChrisMorgan> eddyb: its usage is #[prelude_import] use std::prelude::v1::*;

[02:29:12] <ChrisMorgan> eddyb: it imports the things but allows them to be shadowed.
[02:29:38] <eddyb> yeah but its use in the compiler doesn't require it to be stable
[02:30:00] <ChrisMorgan> eddyb: I can write #[prelude_import] and get the same results, so it’s stable.
[02:30:16] <eddyb> and I'm saying the fact that it's stable looks like a mistake
[02:30:30] <eddyb> there have to be some good reasons for such a hack to be stable
[02:31:17] * ChrisMorgan is smirking to himself as he declares it stable de facto, knowing that it’s rather unlikely to be stable de jure.

[02:32:34] <ChrisMorgan> I hope no one is *actually* using it.
[02:32:41] <eddyb> crap
[02:32:47] <eddyb> ChrisMorgan: it's order-dependent
[02:32:53] <ChrisMorgan> Naturally.
[02:32:57] <eddyb> this means it's broken
[02:33:15] <eddyb> and if we ever fix globs, code depending on this broken order dependency is going to break
[02:33:16] <ChrisMorgan> As soon as such shadowing fanciness enters into the mix, it’s *got* to be order dependent.
[02:33:22] <eddyb> ChrisMorgan: no
[02:33:25] <ChrisMorgan> No?
[02:33:28] <eddyb> there's a "simple" solution
[02:33:47] <eddyb> if something is provided by more than one glob, you have to explicitely import it
[02:34:10] <eddyb> AFAIK that has been the plan waiting to happen
[02:34:30] <eddyb> but now we have to emulate #[prelude_import]
[02:35:13] <ChrisMorgan> Meh, it should be even less controversial than changing &Box<Trait + ???>.
[02:35:24] <eddyb> mark it as a bugfix
[02:35:41] <eddyb> but really, this went for 2 releases without being gated
[02:35:41] <ChrisMorgan> Quite. And it’s never documented anywhere, whereas the other was.

[04:19:08] <eddyb> krax: wait, what do you mean by "flex"?
[04:19:36] <eddyb> what is the actual triple you need?
[04:19:47] <krax> arm-arago-linux-gnueabi
[04:20:19] <eddyb> what is "arago"?
[04:20:40] <krax> by flex i mean the flexable target spec *.json file you can drop in your project which rustc will pick up
[04:21:24] <krax> a manufacturer of arm chips my company uses
[04:21:24] <eddyb> you'd have to modify src/librustc_back to know what "arago" is *or* have a spec JSON somewhere
[04:21:44] <eddyb> I don't know what the best way to do this is (cc acrichto)
[04:23:33] <krax> looks like i could extract out whats in librustc_back/target/arm_unknown_linux_gnueabi.rs into a json file. Is there anything anywhere that defines what those json files should look like?

[18:27:26] <pcwalton> eddyb_: oh, sweet
[18:27:34] <pcwalton> I'll check again then!
[18:27:38] <pcwalton> with that new patch
[18:27:49] <pcwalton> I'm testing a change to get FastISel to do i1
[18:27:54] <pcwalton> so then it'll just be switch & invoke
[18:29:15] <eddyb_> you have to pick a simple implementation strategy, no?
[18:30:02] <eddyb_> maybe jump table iff values form a contiguous range, if/else chaining otherwise
[18:30:39] <eddyb_> or is that too smart for FastISel?
[18:31:21] <pcwalton> eddyb_: just if/else chain
[18:31:29] <pcwalton> no need for anything smart

[21:23:50] <edunham> asked the author of Buildbot whether the slaves reveal their IP addresses in some organized way, and he said not to his knowledge :/

[21:59:25] <blaenk> hey acrichto when you're not busy I'm curious about something in toml-rs, like the Parser and FromStr define type Err = Vec<ParserError>, which prevents one from doing something like try!(something.parse()) or more generally, propagating the error, since it's not just one error but multiple
[21:59:59] <blaenk> and I don't think you can impl Error for Vec<ParserError> cause of coherence or whatever that is, so perhaps a newtype that contains the vec?

[22:18:02] <blaenk> that allows me to propagate the parse error if there is one

[22:24:14] <blaenk> what do you guys think about opt.map(|o| var = o); vs if let Some(o) = opt { var = o }
[22:24:27] <blaenk> I like the first one using map cause it's much more concise, but I'm pretty sure it would be slower no
[22:24:52] *** Quits: mermitrexx (Mibbit@moz-hu6.nja.252.72.IP) (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
[22:25:11] <bluss> slower? I think it should be just the same
[22:25:16] <blaenk> ooo
[22:25:39] <bluss> you give llvm more to do by using closures, but when it's done it should be inlined and compile to thee same thing
[22:25:47] <blaenk> oooooooo
[22:25:53] <blaenk> I was thinking the closure adn the call to map

[22:30:58] <blaenk> is there a way to annotate `From::from` to specify the target type
[22:31:11] <steveklabnik> let x: i32 = From::from(54);
[22:31:13] <steveklabnik> or
[22:31:20] <steveklabnik> From::from::<i32>(whatever)
[22:31:30] <acrichto> blaenk: yeah that part of the API of toml-rs I wasn't ever super happy with unfortunately
[22:31:31] <blaenk> yeaaah, I want to annotate the From::from. will try the second
[22:31:48] <blaenk> acrichto: it's not a problem I was just wondering if I was doing it right or what
[22:32:11] <acrichto> blaenk: yeah it's just bad api design on my part :P
[22:32:16] <blaenk> I'll let it pass
[22:32:31] <blaenk> you get a couple thousand passes from working on so many packages
[22:33:01] <blaenk> I don't think you can annotate From::from but maybe I'm doing it wrong
[22:33:05] <blaenk> will query playbot
[22:34:21] <blaenk> acrichto: but do you think we should do that then, introduce some type that wraps the vec of errors? in toml-rs? or is it a thing that you don't want to mess with to not break code etc
[22:34:37] <blaenk> I guess I just typically expect to be able to try!/propagate an Err

[22:34:57] <acrichto> blaenk: for now I'd prefer to keep the interface stable, but if I were to release a new major version that'd be one of the first things I'd fix
[22:34:58] <blaenk> but it's not a difficult thing to just do what I'm saying on my end I guess
[22:35:04] <acrichto> probably just something which packaged up a bunch of other errors
[22:35:13] <blaenk> yeah, not a big deal
[22:41:31] <blaenk> I wonder if it'd be convenient to have free-fns for converting. like you could have from::<F, T>(from: F) -> T. then you can for example do things like map_err(from::<_, MyError>)
[22:41:33] <blaenk> idk
[22:42:25] <blaenk> and an into one too, I remember that was something some people wanted, to be able to annotate Into::into but I think you can't? idr. so you'd have into::<T>(whatever)
[22:42:35] <blaenk> actually in that case you'd just do whatever.into() :)
[22:42:42] <bluss> blaenk: use i32::from. Does it have any From impls though?
[22:42:43] <blaenk> but to pass it as a hof
[22:43:04] <blaenk> but can you do something like i32::from::<ToType> ?

[22:43:21] <blaenk> I see
[22:43:24] <blaenk> will try that :D
[22:43:31] <bluss> and you can't do that. You can do  <ToType as From>::from
