[17:53:19] <wycats> that is a +1 for those not on irccloud
[17:53:46] <acrichto> lol
[18:05:53] <steveklabnik> hehe
[18:05:58] <steveklabnik> it printed in the right font for me
[18:20:56] <brson> acrichto: +1
[18:21:32] <acrichto> brson: also as a heads up I've turned on gating for MSVC bootstraps on cargo and rust builds
[18:21:38] <acrichto> cargo actually gates on tests, but rustc doesn't gate on tests just yet
[18:21:52] <brson> acrichto: cool!
[18:22:13] <acrichto> we also had our first 32-bit MSVC nightlies last night
[18:22:31] <acrichto> and as of this morning all rust-lang crates have CI set up for 32/64 msvc
[18:22:34] <acrichto> + 32 mingw
[18:22:44] <acrichto> and I'd set up 64 mingw if we could but appveyor doesn't have msys2 :(
[18:57:15] <nrc> acrichto: do it
[19:03:26] <Gankro> brson: If I do a multirust override --copy-local do I need to build rustc or configure with certain flags (rpath?)

[20:04:49] <edunham> acrichto: why is crates.io using zerigo for DNS?
[20:33:09] <acrichto> edunham: to get SSL working on the apex domain (crates.io) with heroku we needed a special ANAME record
[20:33:12] <acrichto> which not all registrars support
[20:33:25] <acrichto> namely the one we bought crates.io through (gandi I think?) doesn't support this
[20:33:36] <acrichto> so we needed an alternative, and zerigo is bundled with heroku automatically, so I opted to choose that
[20:33:48] <acrichto> if a registrar has an ANAME record, though, we can use it
[20:33:53] <acrichto> no other fundamental reason to user zerigo
[20:34:23] <edunham> acrichto: ok, cool
[20:37:07] * edunham documents that
[20:49:45] <brson> Gankro: the dynamic linking problem is probably https://github.com/brson/multirust/issues/43
[20:49:55] <brson> it's a bug it rustc's `-C rpath` implementation for OS X
[20:50:02] <brson> most likely
[21:34:38] <Gankro> brson: thanks!

[22:08:08] <nrc> edunham: so, I was thinking a bit about moving some of the bots I host over to 'official' servers. Highfive seems like the best place to start. Did you have much of a play with your instance of it? Do you think its a good idea? How high priority is it for you? And how can I help?
[22:08:16] <nrc> sorry, so many questions....
[22:10:35] <Gankro> nrc: should have gone for: how can I ask you any more questions?
[22:14:06] <edunham> nrc: Yes, highfive would be a good first move. No, I haven't gotten super far in setting up a clone. Yes, I think it's a good idea to host it on Rust servers. Currently it's medium priority, low urgency, but I don't know of any blockers. How you can help is being around for me to pester you with questions when I try to set up a copy from scratch, correct and merge the ensuing doc PRs, and eventually get me a copy of any files that aren't in the re
[22:18:01] <nrc> OK, sounds good. It's not a priority for me - I don't mind hosting it or anything, but it is probably the 'right' thing to do to move it. Feel free to ping me whenever about whatever :-) I don't mind giving you access to my server if it would help, but the config is not very sophisticated, so that will probably be the least of your worries.
[22:22:10] <edunham> I wouldn't mind having the perms and knowledge to kick the service if it falls over, but doesn't seem to do so very often if at all

[22:27:53] <nrc> Yeah, it's hosted by digital ocean, so its pretty reliable. There is no running server, each request starts a new highfive instance, so it never 'crashes'
[22:28:19] <nrc> triage bot is more of an issue in that respect, in that it is a long running server and so can fall over
[22:28:55] <nrc> but it doesn't seem to do it very often
