[01:39:49] <bstrie> this &mut self method is calling a method self, inside a for loop, which is inside another for loop, and yet the borrow lasts until the end of the function

[05:34:09] <sfackler> pnkfelix: this pr is supposed to unblock nightlies: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/25719
[05:35:39] <pnkfelix> sfackler: i meant more that buildbot seems potentially wedged on gh25706
[05:35:39] <[o__o]> Remove error diagnostics uniqueness check and .json generation.: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/25706
[05:35:46] <sfackler> oh
[05:35:50] <sfackler> not sure about that
[05:36:32] <sfackler> all the tests passed so we can probably force merge it
[05:36:41] <sfackler> not sure if thatll un-bork homu
[05:36:57] <Manishearth> sfackler: want to review the #[derive] change?
[05:37:03] <Manishearth> makes stuff faster
[05:37:07] <sfackler> ?
[05:37:10] <sfackler> link
[05:37:21] <Manishearth> https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/25710
[05:38:13] <sfackler> lgtm
[05:38:48] <Manishearth> oh, you're a quick reviewer
[05:38:56] <Manishearth> obviously, you should also review https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/25168 :P
[05:39:22] <sfackler> there wasn't much in that pr to review :P
[05:39:33] <pnkfelix> hmm my reading of http://buildbot.rust-lang.org/console?branch=auto&refresh=15 was that there were exceptions ... but the waterfall does make it seem like tests passed... 
[05:40:28] <sfackler> weird
[05:41:42] <pnkfelix> maybe its because of auto-win-msvc-64-opt being purple ?  (every time I think I understand buildbot's rendering, I get thrown for a loop...)
[05:42:02] <pnkfelix> no wait that's cant be required
[05:43:21] <pnkfelix> okay well, lets force merge and see if homu deals with it

[05:48:11] <Manishearth> pnkfelix: musl/msvc/bitrig are tier 2
[05:48:22] <Manishearth> the world was meantto be broken
[05:48:49] <pnkfelix> Manishearth: is there some way to tell from buildbot's rendering which columns are tier2 and which are tier1 ?
[05:48:57] <Manishearth> nope
[05:49:12] <Manishearth> you can look at the buildbot config to see what builders cause failures
[05:49:17] <pnkfelix> Manishearth: that is too bad.  seems like an obvious feature-request...

[09:28:47] <bstrie> it's kind of silly that I can't do `"foo"[2]`, but I can do `"foo"[2..2]`
[09:29:48] <Mutabah> bstrie: Not really, the way Index is implemented you can't return a value
[09:30:00] <Mutabah> bstrie: So, the former would have to return a byte (not a char)
[09:30:09] <bluss> you can't do "foo"[2] though
[09:30:13] <eddyb> bstrie: string indexing is useless
[09:30:16] <bluss> we don't have indexing on strings :)
[09:30:28] <bstrie> eddyb: not if you're trying to compare favorably to python scripts :P

[09:30:39] <bstrie> I'm doing norvig's famous spelling corrector right now
[09:30:50] <bstrie> also, I can guarantee it's ascii, so there
[09:30:52] <eddyb> I have never seen a single valid usecase of string indexing in my entire life
[09:30:58] <eddyb> bstrie: then it's not a String

[09:32:59] <eddyb> you can do indexing with Vec<u8> just fine

[09:34:01] <eddyb> fun
[09:35:28] <eddyb> looks pretty inefficient, too
[09:36:11] <eddyb> bstrie: this is the only part that does indexing AFAICT    splits     = [(word[:i], word[i:]) for i in range(len(word) + 1)]
[09:36:38] <Mutabah> eddyb: two lines down
[09:36:40] <bstrie> eddyb: all the lines below
[09:36:52] <eddyb> oh, right
[09:37:07] <eddyb> for some reason I was hoping it was using that array
[09:37:32] <bstrie> Mutabah: I don't know what you mean by "do streaming" but if you can show me a prettier way of translating "a + b[1] + b[0] + b[2:]" then I'll use it

[09:43:47] <eddyb> this would be done best with a generator

[10:17:06] <bstrie> eddyb: the point of known([word]) is probably because he's short-circuiting

[10:17:37] <bstrie> not sure, in python

[16:14:23] <GolDDranks> Hi, I'd like to have a little help with the rustc source code. I'm fiddling with the librustc_resolve. When resolving expressions (in fn resolve_expr, and in this case, when expr.node is ExprPath), where are the local generic type names stored? Are they available?
[16:15:03] <eddyb> GolDDranks: what are you trying to do?
[16:15:09] *** Joins: eerie (eerie@moz-s5i4j9.red.bezeqint.net)

[16:16:33] <eddyb> (unless you want to do something with the type parameters in the path. still, sounds more like a typeck problem than a resolve one)
[16:19:02] <GolDDranks> eddyb: I'm trying to improve an error message. It says "error: unresolved name `T`", but it could add something along the lines of "Note: There exists a type called `T`, but you can't use a type name here!"

[16:24:10] <GolDDranks> Well I had a typo like let a = [T; 10] where I meant to type let a : [T; 10], and the error was a bit unhelpful. The resolve_path returns None on the T, even though it searches from TypeNS.
