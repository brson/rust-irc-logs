[16:39:01] <austincheney> my second attempt is uploading now
[16:39:32] <austincheney> i am not sure how the page addressing or the color scheme on hover is defined for your original search, so i have not incorporated that yet
[16:39:55] <austincheney> i am also removing duplicates provided that the record has the same name, path, and type

[16:45:35] <cmr> austincheney: what am I looking at? Improved search?
[16:45:44] <cmr> oh wow
[16:45:47] <cmr> vastly improved
[16:46:33] <cmr> austincheney: great work!
[16:47:14] <dbaupp> <3 people making the documentation awesome
[19:07:44] <austincheney> two big items that are still incomplete
[19:07:58] <austincheney> 1) color code items by some criteria
[19:08:38] <austincheney> 2) link items to pages..... for those that have pages (unless they are all planned to have pages) and how that addressing works relative to the path property in the data
[19:08:44] <austincheney> thanks for the comments
