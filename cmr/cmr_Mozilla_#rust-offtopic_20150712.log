[04:13:02] <Havvy> Oh, there's already a factoid for that.
[04:13:49] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: DecryptMessage decrypts the message in place and requires a single contiguous buffer
[04:14:21] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: and if the message I give it isn't big enough, it just tells me to get more, and I have to read more to make an even larger buffer
[04:14:34] <Quxxy> :|
[04:15:33] <Quxxy> That seems like a... rather unpleasant design
[04:17:35] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: If at any point DecryptMessage returns SEC_I_RENEGOTIATE I have to renegotiate the connection
[04:18:04] <WindowsBunny> which means several back and forths during which I have to block other threads from reading/writing to my schannel stream

[09:13:51] <WindowsBunny> it has nearly everything you could want in an ide D:
[09:14:05] <Quxxy> WindowsBunny: I saw that the OneGet repo has an open issue for integration with lang-specific package managers, with Cargo on the list
[09:14:07] <Manishearth> yeah actually I find VS to be one of the best IDEs I've used
[09:14:17] <Quxxy> I reckon it'd be pretty funny if the first PM to get native Cargo support was for Windows
[09:14:18] <Manishearth> the only downside is that it is heavy and only works on windoze
[09:14:49] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: how do they intend to get native cargo support for a PM?
[09:15:02] <WindowsBunny> Manishearth: Hey, it's lighter than Atom :P
[09:15:18] <Quxxy> OneGet's a meta package manager; it doesn't actually do the package managing, it has plugins for other package managers
[09:15:46] <WindowsBunny> ah, so you'd use oneget, which would in turn call cargo?
[09:15:51] <WindowsBunny> or something?
[09:16:02] <WindowsBunny> it would manage your cargo.toml?
[09:16:11] <Manishearth> WindowsBunny: lol I hate atom
[09:16:13] <Quxxy> So the idea would be to have a Cargo provider that lets you do (I forget the cmd name): Install-Package some-crate-name
[09:16:20] <Manishearth> it's like Sublime, but sooo slow
[09:16:43] <Quxxy> WindowsBunny: I imagine it'd be for binaries and ffi libraries
[09:16:49] <Quxxy> *i.e.* just for use *outside* of Cargo

[09:18:45] <WindowsBunny> regular VS is the only way to go
[09:18:57] <Manishearth> Quxxy: the first time I tried atom its linux support was broken and it needed npn and then it compiled npm with npm and did some shady shit

[09:21:31] *** Joins: Kingsquee (kingsley@moz-k72lip.bchsia.telus.net)
[09:21:37] <Manishearth> Quxxy: oh
[09:21:52] <Manishearth> you're supposed to use a new tab for that, but I get what you mean
[09:21:54] <WindowsBunny> fkaa: But I'd rather use VisualRust with regular VS
[09:21:54] <Manishearth> gitsavvy does that
[09:21:55] <Quxxy> Manishearth: Specifically, I wanted something that let me search the Unicode database
[09:21:57] <Manishearth> Quxxy: wait
[09:22:03] <Manishearth> Quxxy: you can fire up a prompt
[09:22:05] <fkaa> i've never likes VS
[09:22:09] <Quxxy> So I could just (key combo), type the name, select the character
[09:22:10] <Manishearth> Quxxy: one sec
[09:22:23] <Manishearth> Quxxy: GitSavvy fires up a prompt for commit messages
[09:22:25] *** Quits: adu (ajr@moz-99ult9.md.comcast.net) (Client exited)
[09:22:27] <Manishearth> quick commit
[09:22:31] <Quxxy> Except, and I checked, the drop-down has some pathological performance problems with lists beyond a certain length
[09:22:49] <Quxxy> *And* you have no control over the search logic
[09:22:58] <Quxxy> So you can't do things like provide synonyms without having multiple entries
[09:23:08] <Manishearth> ah
[09:23:09] <Quxxy> The docs were already "don't put too much stuff in this list"
[09:23:11] <Quxxy> Like I said
[09:23:36] <Quxxy> Like I said
[09:23:39] <Quxxy> Damnit
[09:23:44] <Quxxy> And now I've lost what I was typing
[09:23:53] <Quxxy> TLDR: all the workarounds suck ass
[09:25:38] <Quxxy> So Win10 is almost to RTM... and mouse scrolling is still broken
[09:26:36] <Quxxy> I'm really getting sick of this trend of big tech companies completely fucking up basic interface things in their rush to turn every computer into a bloody iPad
[09:27:17] <Manishearth> Quxxy: I'm surprised. Microsoft these days seems *very much* into UX
[09:27:21] <Manishearth> at least here
[09:27:26] <Manishearth> don't know what the Win team does
[09:27:43] <Manishearth> like, UX folks have a lot of importance
[09:28:09] <Quxxy> All I know is that horizontal scroll is borked, and vertical scrolling is *almost* unusable
[09:28:23] <Quxxy> From where I'm sitting, Microsoft has just stopped giving a shit about desktop usability *completely*
[09:28:24] <Manishearth> want me to file a bug? ;p
[09:28:31] <Quxxy> I already did
[09:28:32] <Quxxy> Repeatedly
[09:28:39] <Manishearth> Quxxy: where?
[09:28:47] <Quxxy> The Feedback app thing in W10 TP
[09:28:57] <Quxxy> And I up-voted all other relevant feedback, too
[09:28:59] <Manishearth> haha lol no I'm talking about filing a bug in their bug tracker
[09:29:02] <Quxxy> Like a good unpaid tester :P
[09:29:05] <Manishearth> the actual bug tracker
[09:29:07] <Manishearth> that people read
[09:29:27] <Quxxy> Oh, you don't want to give me any sort of conduit to *that*
[09:29:35] <Quxxy> I'd fucking *flood* the thing :P
[09:29:46] <Quxxy> Oh and Music is now re-re-re-adding all my music
[09:30:06] <Quxxy> I swear, 7 is going to end up being my XP
[09:31:27] <Quxxy> Since you brought it up: every metro app I can think to try this in is interpreting horizontal mouse scrolling as page up/page down, even in horizontal or dual-scrolling contexts
[09:32:07] <Quxxy> And at least Edge and a few others (I stopped keeping track) seem to be trying to apply some wacky sort of kinetic acceleration to scrolling that causes the wheel, the content and the scroll bar to *never* be in sync
[09:32:31] <Quxxy> Like, the page will scroll down one tick, then suddenly fly down a few more, stall while the page reloads (in a VM, so I don't blame them for *that*), then skip down to the end
[09:33:00] <Quxxy> It's literally the worst scrolling behaviour I've ever seen in my life
[09:33:17] <Manishearth> Quxxy: see, the conduit would be me, and I'm not going to go on a bug-filing spree :p
[09:33:33] <Quxxy> I might end up flooding *you* :P
[09:33:44] <Quxxy> "Hey, Manis, I got more complaints about Windows 10!"
[09:33:51] <Quxxy> "Oh god, it's *this* asshole again; hide, hide!"
[09:34:07] <Manishearth> I'll only have access to the tracker for another week, so .. .:p
[09:36:06] <Quxxy> Aaaand the VS Community 2015 RC installer crashes on launch
[09:36:11] <Quxxy> Guess I'm not testing *that*
[09:37:46] <amstrad> Quxxy: of course its not going to work if you are on OSX
[09:37:57] <Quxxy> <_<
[09:37:59] <Quxxy> >_>
[09:38:02] <Quxxy> I'm... *not*
[09:38:25] <Quxxy> I wouldn't touch a mac without a biohazard suit
[09:38:40] <fkaa> hehe
[09:39:06] <amstrad> Quxxy: thou has earned thy respect with such flagrant disregard to OSX
[09:39:31] <fkaa> apple is pretty horrible
[09:39:38] * eddyb peeks his nose in the channel
[09:39:39] <amstrad> pretty much
[09:39:45] <eddyb> smells of OS war
[09:39:46] <Quxxy> HAHAHA
[09:39:55] <Quxxy> I can't even uninstall VS 2013 because the *uninstaller* crashes
[09:40:06] <eddyb> Quxxy: oh I think I had that issue in 2010 or something
[09:40:18] <fkaa> eddyb: i don't think anyone can argue how bad apple is
[09:40:31] <amstrad> Quxxy: one does not simply "uninstall" visual studio
[09:40:32] <eddyb> though I do not believe I still have the windows installation with the half-installed VS
[09:41:45] <Manishearth> Quxxy: I'm still surprised that more than half of Mozilla uses osx
[09:42:27] <Quxxy> They're all hipsters that want to be able to *say* they use UNIX, but aren't hard-core enough to deal with a horrible UI :P
[09:42:31] <amstrad> i never understood why so many moved to OSX
[09:43:07] <bluss> Quxxy: yup
[09:43:08] <amstrad> might as well run windows and virtualize linux
[09:43:10] <Quxxy> That or they're just plain hipsters and want to be *seen* to use an Apple
[09:43:30] <WindowsBunny> I just use Windows because I can play any game I feel like
[09:43:40] <WindowsBunny> and things typically just work
[09:43:41] <Manishearth> Quxxy: aren't we a bit too far in the futurew for apple to be considered hipster?
[09:43:47] <amstrad> Quxxy: i was always of the opinion that Apple's slick marketing stuff would only appeal to the "non technical" minded out there
[09:43:56] <Quxxy> *Real* programmers either harden up and use a proper UNIX, or admit they really just don't have the intestinal fortitude for it and use Windows where at least they have games
[09:43:59] <amstrad> how wrong i was
[09:44:07] <bluss> oops /me is seen to use apple all the time although exclusively with linux
[09:44:33] <WindowsBunny> I can't be bothered spending a significant part of my life learning *nix
[09:44:36] <Quxxy> bluss: Buying it for the hardware is a cop-out, but an understandable one
[09:44:51] <Quxxy> I don't mind the UNIX shell, but the UIs are all just horrible
[09:44:59] <amstrad> WindowsBunny: you only need learn the unix shell and vim
[09:45:03] <bluss> finding a good laptop is hard
[09:45:10] <Quxxy> bluss: Exactly
[09:45:24] <amstrad> clearly, the unix shell is a better UI experience than any X window UI out there
[09:45:27] <WindowsBunny> amstrad: Yep, that'll take too long
[09:45:44] <bluss> I don't know why you keep talking about Unix Quxxy, this is the age of Linux
[09:45:46] <amstrad> WindowsBunny: well, you kinda wind up using it at some point
[09:45:47] <bluss> unix is dead
[09:46:03] <WindowsBunny> amstrad: the extend of my shell usage is git + cargo
[09:46:07] <WindowsBunny> *extent
[09:46:20] <WindowsBunny> and I'd prefer to keep it at that
[09:46:23] <amstrad> WindowsBunny: i look at linux is a tiny little OS host i  run network services on
[09:46:27] <Manishearth> bluss: thiiiinkpaaaaaaaaad
[09:46:31] <Manishearth> thiiiiiinkpaaaaaaaad
[09:46:40] <amstrad> so, windows boots up several little OS instances
[09:46:42] <WindowsBunny> amstrad: I'm actually okay with having linux servers to run stuff on
[09:46:47] * Manishearth has a thinkpad and it hasn't given me linux problems yet
[09:46:58] * bluss googles thiiiiiinkpaaaaaaaad
[09:46:59] <amstrad> WindowsBunny: me too, some stuff just runs better on linux
[09:47:25] <Manishearth> I got some microsoft employees to admit that linux would be more useful for their work
[09:47:28] <Manishearth> checkmate
[09:47:29] <bluss> Manishearth: I'll have to order one without spyware
[09:47:33] <WindowsBunny> amstrad: well mainly because Windows Nano Server still isn't a stable released thing yet
[09:47:36] <Manishearth> bluss: thinkpads don't
[09:47:52] <amstrad> WindowsBunny: nothing wrong with linux really
[09:47:55] <Manishearth> bluss: I'm talking about linux laptops. not windows spyware laptops
[09:48:05] <Quxxy> Update: Music was *still* not finished re-re-re-adding my music... and just crashed instead
[09:48:11] <amstrad> i would go as far to say, i actually "like" linux
[09:48:25] <WindowsBunny> amstrad: I'd like to try out Windows Nano Server if only so that I can create applications to use it that use winapi :P
[09:48:29] <Manishearth> bluss: but the lenovo craziness never touched even windos thinkpads -- thinkpads are sort of a dev thing and they don't want to mess with that
[09:48:36] <WindowsBunny> Because I'd rather use winapi than have to deal with posix
[09:48:45] <bluss> Manishearth: they messed with their reputation
[09:48:46] <amstrad> WindowsBunny: do you .net?
[09:49:01] <Quxxy> WindowsBunny: I more or less just want to be able to replace conhost :P
[09:49:15] <amstrad> .net really is a ace platform, the best imo
[09:49:27] <Quxxy> Give me that, and a skin that isn't egregiously awful like the current Windows 10 one, and I'll be pretty much good
[09:49:36] <amstrad> as soon as microsoft launches corefx 1.0, the world will be a lot better
[09:49:46] <Manishearth> bluss: yeah
[09:50:18] * amstrad notes how rare it is to be surrounded by developers that "dont" scoff at the mention of Microsoft
[09:50:20] <WindowsBunny> amstrad: I don't .net
[09:50:37] <Quxxy> *sigh* whelp, I think my Win 10 adventures are just futile tonight
[09:50:42] <fkaa> corefx?
[09:50:47] * Quxxy shuts down VM
[09:50:55] <fkaa> sounds like java :)
[09:50:57] <amstrad> fkaa: .net core, its a cross platform implementation of .net
[09:51:04] <fkaa> ah
[09:51:12] <amstrad> fkaa: does away with mono
[09:51:17] <fkaa> haven't heard much of crossplatform stuff since they announced it
[09:51:18] <amstrad> (at last)
[09:51:32] <Quxxy> I wonder if MS didn't wait *too long* to release it, though
[09:51:46] <amstrad> only 15 years
[09:52:00] <amstrad> Quxxy: no one likes using Mono really
[09:52:01] <Quxxy> I remember when Mono first started, quite a few people were big on the idea of a newer VM that could supplant Java
[09:52:09] <fkaa> amstrad: is there a way to get it now? tried googling but came up with nothing
[09:52:13] <Quxxy> *I* was rather taken with the idea
[09:52:17] <Quxxy> I stopped giving a shit years ago
[09:52:22] <amstrad> fkaa: yes, you can get it now
[09:52:34] <amstrad> fkaa: its not complete, they still need to add the networking libraries
[09:52:47] <amstrad> there is no udp/tcp socket support
[09:52:54] <amstrad> which has been holding off
[09:52:59] <amstrad> *been/me
[09:53:44] <amstrad> the corefx stuff is very similar to nodejs development, you can see microsoft looked at the whole mobile thing with npm, and want to apply that concept to .net assemblies
[09:53:54] <amstrad> mobile/module
[09:54:57] <amstrad> they do away with vsproj files for managing C# source, and opt to scan a directory tree for source files
[09:55:05] <amstrad> so, thats nice and cross platform
[09:56:36] <amstrad> fkaa: in the end, you will be able to get a standalone executable you can port to different systems, that standalone contains the entirety of .net, the GC and mscorlib, you build it for each OS, the end result is .net based application that are both portable and don't rely on having some managed runtime installed
[09:57:09] <fkaa> \o/
[09:57:10] <amstrad> your code however is still distributed as .net assemblies (they are not native compiled)
[09:57:39] <amstrad> but there is some work being done with .net native, its unrelated to corefx from what i can tell
[09:58:07] * amstrad knows all about .nets
[09:58:50] <fkaa> hehe
[09:58:56] <fkaa> so where can i get it?
[09:59:00] <Quxxy> It'd be fun if MS added a region system to .NET
[09:59:03] <fkaa> you've got me hooked
[09:59:03] <Quxxy> Then Rust could target it :3
[09:59:57] <amstrad> Quxxy: i have been meaning to try Rust written dll's interoping with .net, should be trivial 
[10:00:14] <Quxxy> amstrad: Should indeed; Rust would basically just look like C
[10:01:29] <amstrad> fkaa: http://dotnet.github.io/core/
[10:02:11] <amstrad> very easy to get running
[10:02:22] <amstrad> Quxxy: if only i could drive rust
[10:03:30] <amstrad> i havent really got a use for Rust, outside of some kernel space stuff, Rust feels a bit too impractical for the majority of usecases id like to apply it
[10:03:33] <amstrad> imo
[10:04:26] <WindowsBunny> amstrad: I actually have a friend trying to write a Rust DLL to invoke from C#
[10:04:33] <WindowsBunny> It's also his first time using Rust....
[10:04:40] <amstrad> WindowsBunny: what does the DLL do?
[10:05:06] <WindowsBunny> amstrad: Parse a large binary file into a big structure and provide an api to get data from it?
[10:05:27] <amstrad> WindowsBunny: any reason why he wouldn't just use .net for that?
[10:05:27] <WindowsBunny> Apparently C# was burning way too much memory to do the equivalent thing
[10:05:42] <amstrad> ah yeah, many allocations are a killer in .net
[10:06:05] <Quxxy> Does C# still allocate in order to do a foreach over an array?
[10:06:12] <WindowsBunny> Really he'd do the whole thing in Rust but there's no easy GUI system in Rust yet :P
[10:06:22] <amstrad> Quxxy: not that im aware of
[10:06:51] <Quxxy> I lost a *lot* of faith in C# when I ran into that; I was coming from D and expected stuff like that to just do the "sane" thing
[10:07:11] <amstrad> Quxxy: high freqency allocation is a problem in .net
[10:07:58] <amstrad> i was writing a little network proxy in C#, and each packet read needed to be passed off to other things, it was hard to clean up all the memory allocated along the way
[10:08:03] <fkaa> but you have a lot more control over the allocations compared to say java, afaik
[10:08:09] <fkaa> correct me if i'm wrong
[10:08:13] <WindowsBunny> fkaa: Well you can use struct instead of class
[10:08:32] <WindowsBunny> so you get a value type instead of a reference type
[10:08:41] <WindowsBunny> But that's the extent of it really
[10:08:42] <amstrad> it would be cool to get a borrow checker built into Roslyn
[10:08:47] <Quxxy> It was one of the things I liked about D: it had a GC, but you could totally go behind its back and just delete stuff, or whack temporary allocations on the stack
[10:09:06] <Quxxy> ... and then they went and killed that because it was "unsafe"... despite the whole *language* being unsafe *rolls eyes*
[10:09:38] <WindowsBunny> I dislike D because it relied so much on having a GC
[10:09:38] <Quxxy> You know, I should start taking a shot every time I think of something about D that pissed me off... I might actually learn to drink that way :P
[10:09:46] <Quxxy> WindowsBunny: Not if you used Tango
[10:09:54] <Quxxy> ... until Andrei helped *kill* Tango
[10:10:02] <Quxxy> ... I'm gonna go find some Scotch or something...
[10:10:02] <amstrad> the problem with Rust im having is that, despite me bending over backwards to write a safe thread schedular thing at the lower levels of the application, Rust cares not i have done all the "safety bits", and mandates i still implement Send / Sync for everything
[10:10:56] <amstrad> in C#, you spend all your time writing that stuff, so it would be nice to have concurrent safety primitives that are validated by the compiler where you need that stuff
[10:11:10] <amstrad> C# doesn't have that
[10:11:15] <amstrad> wish it did
[10:11:43] <amstrad> another thing about rust is there is no clear approach to tackle event driven programming
[10:12:00] <fkaa> amstrad: corefx depends on mono?
[10:12:17] <amstrad> fkaa: nah, tho some of the build stuff does atm
[10:12:24] <fkaa> http://puu.sh/iWe2E/3e12d0f650.png
[10:12:45] <amstrad> fkaa: its for some of the build stuff
[10:12:48] <amstrad> its temporary
[10:12:49] <fkaa> gotcha
[10:13:35] <amstrad> lets say i wanted to write a IRC client in Rust, it would be pretty much impossible to do that in a intuitive fashion, especially compared with other langauges
[10:13:57] <amstrad> lets say i have a stdio stream (read and write) and a tcp stream (read and write)
[10:14:08] <amstrad> tcpin -> stdout
[10:14:15] <amstrad> stdin -> tcpout
[10:14:27] <amstrad> ^ implementing a simple pipe here in Rust, impossible
[10:14:41] <kimundi> amstrad: Hm, in theory if you have a threadsafety mechanism that works independent from Send/Sync, you should be able to define an API that does not require them to function. Of course, if you use std lib thread building blocks for it you need to abstract away those traits, but I'm having trouble imagining how they get in the way apart from that...
[10:14:49] <amstrad> well, not impossible, just extraordinarily difficult
[10:15:16] <amstrad> kimundi: im probably doing it wrong
[10:16:39] <amstrad> kimundi: i don't know, Rust "feels" more equipped at writing synchronous but parallel programs, but feels the wrong choice for concurrent message passing like systems
[10:17:13] <amstrad> and its the latter that i was looking for some wins with Rust, all i have found is many hours of pain and suffering :(
[10:17:39] <kimundi> Is this something better libraries could fix?
[10:17:48] <amstrad> kimundi: mio?
[10:18:20] <amstrad> not sure to be honest, i would imagine it would be difficult to do the kind of message passing orchestration one would need ... even with mio
[10:18:21] <kimundi> Dunno, just generally do you think this is a issue of the language, or just of the libraries you have aviable?
[10:18:47] <amstrad> kimundi: umm, bit of both really
[10:19:15] <kimundi> What are the language problem you are seeing?
[10:19:25] <amstrad> well, put another way, some common design patterns written up by the community, and contrasted with other languages would be helpful
[10:19:56] <kimundi> Sure, but stuff like that takes time to be figured out
[10:19:58] <amstrad> kimundi: well, ownership gets in the way mostly
[10:20:08] <amstrad> kimundi: haha, yeah, its a puzzle
[10:20:28] <amstrad> let stream = IOStream::create("some file path");
[10:20:47] <amstrad> stream.read(|data| { stream.pause() });
[10:20:54] <amstrad> stream.begin();
[10:21:01] <kimundi> amstrad: Does it get in the way in the sense that you just want a garbage collected pointer where you don't have to think about it sometimes?
[10:21:09] <amstrad> ^ problems with ownership right there
[10:21:39] <amstrad> kimundi: no, i don't think that gets in the way
[10:21:45] <kimundi> sec, haveto read up on what those methods actually do
[10:21:57] <amstrad> kimundi: i just made it up
[10:22:06] <amstrad> so don't worry about it :D
[10:22:08] <kimundi> ah, what would they do then/what would be the issue?
[10:22:54] <amstrad> in that example, the stream has "read" some data, which fires the closure...in that closure, we want to pause the stream, such that no more data is read until that data has been processed in some way
[10:23:44] <amstrad> when the data is ready to be read again, we might call stream.resume() to have the stream read some more data
[10:23:54] <amstrad> the problem is, this pattern is disallowed in Rust
[10:24:11] <kimundi> Why do you think its disallowed?
[10:24:18] <amstrad> ownership
[10:24:27] <eddyb> you may be confusing the pattern with the simplest encoding of the pattern
[10:24:32] <amstrad> stream is "moved" into the closure, and cannot be moved out again
[10:24:35] <kimundi> Nothing in what you described has any limitations in that regard :)
[10:25:04] <kimundi> amstrad: Only if paused() would take self by value
[10:25:20] <eddyb> for a simplistic encoding it might be impossible to prove memory safety
[10:25:25] <kimundi> amstrad: If paused() takes self by &mut self, it would abe a reference, but an borrw check error
[10:25:33] <eddyb> I guess Rust has the same issue there as Idris
[10:25:34] <kimundi> if it took &self and used internal mutability it would work+
[10:25:56] <amstrad> kimundi: its not that at all, ill have to write up a exemple
[10:26:01] <kimundi> if IOStream would be copy, say becuase it used a still hypotheical garbage collected pointer on the inside, it would work as well
[10:26:02] <eddyb> stream.read(|data| { stream.pause() });
[10:26:06] <eddyb> that is usually written
[10:26:09] *** Quits: niconii (nicole@moz-cc4pm9.frgo.qwest.net) (Quit: leaving)
[10:26:11] <eddyb> stream.read(|stream, data| { stream.pause() });
[10:26:17] <amstrad> ^
[10:26:26] <amstrad> that latter makes a bit more sense
[10:26:29] <eddyb> that way you can actually pass &mut Self or whatever down to the closure
[10:26:39] <amstrad> eddyb: yeah, thats one approach
[10:26:49] <eddyb> it's the most commonly used one IME
[10:26:53] <fkaa> visual code is atom in disguise right?
[10:26:55] <amstrad> the other was, instead of passing a "stream" id pass a handle
[10:27:11] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: I just had an awesome idea for how to make a memory mapped file API
[10:27:15] <fkaa> hogging all my memory :(
[10:27:20] <amstrad> eddyb: by pasing the handle, i could "request" a borrow of the underlying stream
[10:27:29] <eddyb> so RefCell?
[10:27:41] <amstrad> internally you mean?
[10:27:52] <eddyb> yeah or just &RefCell<Stream>
[10:27:57] <amstrad> yeah
[10:28:10] <eddyb> if you can pass &mut down to a closure, it's preferred
[10:28:12] <eddyb> no runtime overhead
[10:28:17] <kimundi> or even &RefCell<&mut Stream> if you don't want the STream to be owned
[10:28:25] <WindowsBunny> Layl: how's your super rust registry winapi adventure funtimes?
[10:28:27] <kimundi> (does that work?)
[10:28:36] <Layl> WindowsBunny, horrible
[10:28:42] <amstrad> eddyb: but even doing this, it was quite clumsy to code, least i found things that way
[10:29:07] <amstrad> so much so, i had to take a rest from Rust or else risk losing my mind >_>
[10:29:26] <amstrad> it was just "that bad"
[10:29:46] <amstrad> to be fair, having a rest from it often lets the braincells gel for a while
[10:30:13] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: ha, oh man another case of winapi being superior to posix
[10:30:15] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: https://users.rust-lang.org/t/function-std-fs-set-file-times-cant-set-only-accessed-or-modified-time/1960/3?u=retep998
[10:30:19] <amstrad> probably have another go in a month or two (or at least until someone with a bigger brain than mine comes along and offers up some patterns)
[10:30:23] <eddyb> I don't recall dealing with pointers and inheritance in C++ being easier
[10:30:37] <WindowsBunny> apparently posix has no way to set only _one_ of the file times in an atomic manner
[10:31:00] <eddyb> heck, even ES6 was hurting at times
[10:31:50] <eddyb> amstrad: aww, I was hoping you were going to say "in a day or two"
[10:31:50] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: just like posix/linux apparently have no way to atomically copy files with all associated permissions and metadata https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/26933
[10:32:17] <amstrad> one thing i would like to see in a new "practical" language for the modern programmer would be some combination of nodejs (single threaded, callback centric) and the ability to invoke a thread pool
[10:32:32] <amstrad> node doesn't do threads
[10:32:40] <amstrad> (unless you cound fibres)
[10:32:46] <amstrad> also, "javascript" >_>
[10:32:58] <WindowsBunny> amstrad: winapi has awesome thread pools
[10:33:14] <amstrad> i really like that "all things" are automatically synchronized with some main thread
[10:33:14] <WindowsBunny> one of these days I'll write a library that lets you use the full power of rust thread pools and events and callbacks
[10:33:37] <amstrad> and, i really like the idea of being able to spawn threads and yield the results back on the main thread
[10:33:38] <eddyb> callbacks? seriously?
[10:33:48] <amstrad> eddyb: its a means to a end
[10:34:07] <eddyb> not a decent one by any measure
[10:34:10] <amstrad> i mean higher order functions
[10:34:18] <eddyb> you might as well use blocking I/O
[10:34:42] <amstrad> eddyb: registering a callback to fire on some io complete is good
[10:34:50] <eddyb> amstrad: it's also expensive
[10:35:09] <amstrad> for IO, its acceptably quick
[10:35:14] <eddyb> no it's not
[10:35:27] <eddyb> amstrad: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactor_pattern
[10:35:28] <amstrad> processing 64k vs a callback
[10:35:29] <amstrad> ?
[10:35:40] <amstrad> eddyb: yeah, i like the reactor pattern
[10:35:45] <amstrad> i like it a lot
[10:35:55] <eddyb> you don't do the reactor pattern with callbacks :P
[10:36:12] <amstrad> eddyb: you react with callbacks 
[10:36:24] <amstrad> look at Rx for example
[10:36:44] <amstrad> or even the node api's are basically reactive 
[10:37:02] <eddyb> node.js is not high perf
[10:37:32] <eddyb> I believe nginx uses the Reactor pattern with events
[10:37:36] <amstrad> they default to CPS callbacks for all their low level things, but that does preclude the ability to write higher level abstractions over the top, like Promise<T> or Stream<T> (with stream T being the reactive stream thing)
[10:38:13] <amstrad> the biggest issue with all of it, is that with callbacks, you literally throw a callstack out the window
[10:38:35] <amstrad> so, you kinda need Promise<T>, Task<T> (C#) or Future<T> implementations to provide some sanity there
[10:38:46] <eddyb> speaking of...
[10:38:58] <eddyb> I was playing with a design https://gist.github.com/eddyb/822c658190ccf18058db
[10:39:03] <amstrad> and ultimately, you get quite a nice, intuitive programming model, i really really like it actually 
[10:39:52] <amstrad> eddyb: https://gist.github.com/eddyb/822c658190ccf18058db#file-await-rs-L275
[10:39:56] <amstrad> pretty interesting

[10:40:29] <amstrad> eddyb: its acceptably quick, thats all i can say about it really
[10:40:43] <eddyb> amstrad: it *allocates*
[10:40:54] <eddyb> and does virtual calls
[10:40:56] <amstrad> eddyb: it may do

[10:41:43] <eddyb> I'm trying to find a cool lib I've seen a demo of
[10:41:49] <eddyb> (streams on top of mio)
[10:42:02] <eddyb> kimundi: lol
[10:42:15] <amstrad> eddyb: really, tho, you have to weight up the cost and effort required with any approach, and for me at least, i find CPS highly practical, and easily understood by most developers
[10:42:21] <eddyb> kimundi: that's like my &mut T -> &Cell<T> except heavier
[10:42:25] <kimundi> eddyb: It kibnda recuced itself to something trivial once I decided to use a macro for initialization :P
[10:42:51] <kimundi> eddyb: Hah, you're right
[10:42:59] <eddyb> amstrad: I expect more developers to understand structured control flow (async/await) than CPS
[10:43:00] <amstrad> eddyb: CPS however, on its own is rather limited, and sometimes a state machine is going to give you more goodness
[10:43:15] <amstrad> eddyb: familiar with async/await?
[10:43:25] <eddyb> amstrad: that's what is in that gist
[10:43:49] <amstrad> eddyb: publish it as a library
[10:43:53] <eddyb> built on top of multiple-input yield/return-output generators
[10:43:54] <amstrad> hell, id use it :D
[10:44:01] <eddyb> amstrad: once MIR is in the compiler
[10:44:16] <eddyb> then we can implement generators in the language without much pain
[10:44:29] <amstrad> eddyb: its good to know Rust is still evolving
[10:44:35] <eddyb> even yield+ -> yield needs compiler support
[10:44:46] <eddyb> because it has to pass-through every possible input type
[10:44:51] <amstrad> all this stuff on the bleeding edge of Rust is "well above" me tbh

[10:45:05] <amstrad> i literally can't see the forest for the trees
[10:45:48] <eddyb> amstrad: just look at the revisions of that gist
[10:45:58] <amstrad> eddyb: things like fn copy(src: &Path, dst: &Path) -> impl Async<Output = ()> 
[10:46:08] <eddyb> that signature is not valid today
[10:46:11] <amstrad> i did not know you could return a impl
[10:46:27] <eddyb> that's anonymous return types
[10:46:35] <amstrad> eddyb: i figured yeah
[10:46:36] <eddyb> planned but not implemented yet
[10:46:55] <eddyb> I'm abusing it as a hypothetical notation for generator signatures
[10:47:22] <eddyb> the compiler would create an object which implements Async<Output = ()>
[10:47:35] <amstrad> eddyb: you know, what would really push Rust forward, and make the language more palletable to a wider audience would be these kinds of software abstractions that make using Rust more sane than it currently is. 
[10:47:38] <kimundi> eddyb: what would "yield+" do?
[10:47:48] <eddyb> kimundi: yield* from ES6
[10:48:03] <amstrad> eddyb: software abstractions with blogs, many many many blogs
[10:48:14] <amstrad> and examples, and stack exchanges and more blogs
[10:48:27] <eddyb> kimundi: drains a generator, yielding each element
[10:48:33] <kimundi> eddyb: Got a link? googling "yield*" does not lead to useful results for me :P
[10:48:36] <amstrad> it would be nice to read blogs that contrast Rust with other "known" things
[10:48:54] <amstrad> http://pscheidl.cz/index.php/blog/4-iterating-concurrently-over-large-vectors-in-rust
[10:48:54] <eddyb> kimundi: because my flavor of generators can also return a value on completion, that's what you get from yield+
[10:48:58] <kimundi> eddyb: Ah, so iterated yielding?
[10:49:04] <amstrad> http://huonw.github.io/blog/2015/05/defaulting-to-thread-safety/
[10:49:31] <eddyb> kimundi: yeah, but...
[10:49:42] <eddyb> since there's input values, those are passed through to the sub-generator
[10:51:30] <kimundi> eddyb: Hm... I don't really follow that...
[10:52:17] <eddyb> kimundi: the sub-generator gets to handle all input into the generator
[10:54:25] <kimundi> eddyb: Sorry, I meant I don't really understand what your proposed system does in general, so details to aspects for it don't help me right now. Do you have an writeup somewhere?
[10:54:41] <kimundi> :)
[10:54:50] <eddyb> no
[10:54:56] <eddyb> it was iteratively built
[10:55:15] <eddyb> kimundi: you can look at the Iterator impl to get a clue as to how it needs to be constrained to behave as an iterator
[10:55:25] <eddyb> these generators are much more powerful though :P
[10:56:02] <eddyb> kimundi: not sure this can be described without a graph

[10:58:44] *** ChanServ sets mode: +o huon
[10:59:34] <eddyb> kimundi: so, in this case, io::Async<Output = ()> constrains the generator to a few things
[11:00:52] <eddyb> there are 3 entry points (Generator::next(&mut g, input)) with input types: (), io::Result<Vec<u8>>, io::Result<fs::Metadata>
[11:01:30] <eddyb> all of those Generator::next impls return Yield::Value(io::Action) | Yield::Return(io::Result<()>)
[11:02:17] <eddyb> each `x = yield a;` in the function can have x be one of the input types, and `a` has to always be io::Action
[11:02:59] <kimundi> I'm currently trying to understand what all those TpyeId stuff is needed for...
[11:03:02] <eddyb> oh
[11:03:08] <eddyb> kimundi: that's because I can't use where clauses
[11:03:18] <eddyb> or rather, specialization
[11:03:48] <eddyb> kimundi: it's supposed to accept () or the type it's meant to produce
[11:03:59] <eddyb> I should rename Atom to Mirror
[11:04:20] <eddyb> bu that's still vague
[11:04:55] <kimundi> So the core of all of this is fn next(&mut self, _: Input) -> Yield<Self::Value, Self::Return>, right?
[11:05:08] <eddyb> yeah
[11:05:24] <eddyb> generators here are a superset of iterators
[11:05:27] <kimundi> What would a "Return" cause in general?
[11:05:39] <eddyb> it's the end
[11:05:44] <eddyb> like None from Iterator::next
[11:06:19] <kimundi> ah okay, so you can iterate while giving new data in each loop, and then end it with a different result once you are done
[11:06:23] <eddyb> but it can hold a value (like io::Result<()> to indicate failure or success. or just an io::Result<T> for some data-producing I/O function)
[11:06:26] <eddyb> kimundi: yupp
[11:06:29] <kimundi> okay
[11:07:11] <eddyb> if I manually write the 3 impls needed to desugar `copy`, it should compile on 1.0
[11:07:16] <eddyb> but it's a PITA
[11:08:04] *** Quits: nerdopoly (nerdopoly@moz-2rocl5.range86-143.btcentralplus.com) (Quit: leaving)

[11:09:42] <benh> how do you get the benchmark game do give you the completely unrepresentative page where it compares all languages to each other across all benchmarks?
[11:09:43] <kimundi> eddyb: what does a single yield desugar to?
[11:12:14] <eddyb> kimundi: yield x returns Yield::Value(x) from the current Generator::next impl
[11:12:24] <eddyb> return x returns Yield::Return(x)
[11:13:27] <kimundi> eddyb: ah okay, so just a second kind of exit point
[11:13:50] * kimundi wants to make sure he doe not misunderstand this stuff
[11:18:03] <eddyb> kimundi: and earlier I meant the 3 Generator impls obtained by desugaring "copy"
[11:18:30] <eddyb> it wouldn't be that bad except yield+ has a nasty desugaring
[11:19:32] <eddyb> maybe I need to rethink Atom, it's wasteful right now
[11:19:43] <kimundi> ah, yeah. I missed the fact that copy() itself is a generator impl earlier when I asked that :)
[11:20:44] <eddyb> that's the whole point!
[11:20:45] <eddyb> :D
[11:21:24] <eddyb> the most annoying bit right now, after solving polymorphism, is that initial use of () as input to start the generator
[11:21:55] <kimundi> Hm, If I see it right your fn->generator desugaring only really interacts at the yield and return points with the Gnerator traits, right?
[11:21:56] <eddyb> because otherwise creating the generator would have to give you the first yield/return alongside the generator itself
[11:22:19] <eddyb> kimundi: and the CFG is transformed into a state machine
[11:22:26] <eddyb> though this is a terrible example for that :P
[11:22:44] <kimundi> of course
[11:23:52] <eddyb> await! needs to use yield+ to allow calling arbitrary async fn's
[11:23:57] <eddyb> not just those primitives
[11:24:38] <kimundi> I'm just wondering if a hypothetical implementation of the state machine transformation could be defined in a generic way. In the sense that you can specialze the transformation for the Generator traits to return Self::Value, while eg also supporting it for the Iterator traits to return Some
[11:25:08] <eddyb> kimundi: that's what the Iterator impl is for
[11:25:15] <kimundi> And whether that is something that could be user facing for custom stuff
[11:25:31] <kimundi> eddyb: Right, your way would be adapter variant
[11:25:32] <eddyb> Yield<T, ()> is isomorphic to Option<T>
[11:25:48] <kimundi> where there is one build-in transformation
[11:26:49] <eddyb> supporting -> impl Iterator<Item = T> as a shorthand for -> impl Generator<(), Value = T, Return = ()> would be fine with me
[11:28:21] <eddyb> kimundi: I wish LLVM would remove dead fields
[11:28:30] <eddyb> but it can't really do structural optimizations :(
[11:28:59] <eddyb> I can't think of a clean way to handle the first element specially
[11:30:23] <eddyb> kimundi: oh
[11:30:46] <eddyb> maybe something like IntoIterator
[11:31:03] <eddyb> IntoGenerator which returns the first element and the rest
[11:31:29] <eddyb> and so can optimize for the case where the rest is zero-sized
[11:33:40] <kimundi> eddyb: Does yield action in your example evaluate to a () or to some other type?
[11:33:59] * kimundi is not sure 
[11:34:18] <kimundi> err, in your gist
[11:35:23] <eddyb> kimundi: no
[11:35:52] <eddyb> kimundi: the result of yield is the value that is passed into the generator as input in the next iteration
[11:36:15] <eddyb> kimundi: it has to be a statically determined type, one of the input types exposed in the -> impl interface
[11:38:10] <kimundi> eddyb: Not sure I understand - so the type changes in each loop iteration?
[11:38:34] <kimundi> I'm talking about line 61
[11:38:58] <kimundi> (Btw, you have a typo in line 277 - you probably wanted a "Write" there)
[11:39:41] <kimundi> ((And imo the macros there for definin gthe methods make the gist hard to understand :P))
[11:39:55] <eddyb> kimundi: the type changes between yield points, they don't change in time
[11:40:13] <eddyb> or your yield points could expect the same input type, in which case it's a more regular generator
[11:40:54] <kimundi> Does the yield in line 61 always evaluate to () in that location?
[11:41:08] <eddyb> no
[11:41:11] <eddyb> kimundi: read the comment
[11:41:20] <eddyb> that code won't compile like that
[11:42:44] <kimundi> I've still trouble imagining how what values of what type flow through this
[11:43:14] <eddyb> kimundi: polymorphic pass-through, as in, each of the Generator impls will pass its input down
[11:43:29] <eddyb> if I redesign it, that won't be necessary in *this* example but it's still supported
[11:43:47] <kimundi> what kind of input of what type?
[11:43:53] <eddyb> of any type
[11:44:09] <eddyb> kimundi: if you have a "call stack" of generators nested with yield+
[11:44:25] <eddyb> .next(input) can trickle down to the deepest one
[11:44:43] <eddyb> for all supported types
[11:45:17] <eddyb> let me try IntoGenerator, should be nicer after that
[11:45:46] <kimundi> I don't see how your yield+ desugaring has something todo with nesting, I only see looping :(
[11:46:09] <eddyb> kimundi: it's flat_map
[11:46:11] <eddyb> if that helps
[11:46:20] <eddyb> you know how you can nest flat_map?
[11:46:29] <eddyb> in this case it's just one level
[11:47:03] <eddyb> it took me days to get that gist in that state, it's hard to write examples for this stuff :P
[11:48:19] <kimundi> Hm... getting back to the type question, I don't understand how "line 54: read.next(())" and "line 61: read.next(yield action)" makes sense if the type is different
[11:48:37] <eddyb> kimundi: two different impls of Generator::next
[11:48:43] <kimundi> but its the same value?
[11:48:58] <eddyb> what is?
[11:49:01] <kimundi> read
[11:49:05] <eddyb> yeah
[11:49:24] <eddyb> let me put it this way: both read.next(()) and read.next(Ok(vec![])) work
[11:50:03] <eddyb> and lets say I do let g = copy(a, b);
[11:50:06] <Manishearth> eddyb: I smell something similar to rust-sessions
[11:50:23] <Manishearth> eddyb: is the generator supposed to be able to emit and accept different types?
[11:50:31] <eddyb> Manishearth: its type doesn't change
[11:50:43] <Manishearth> if so, rust-sessions has a model using session types for maintaining a protocol across channels
[11:50:59] <eddyb> I know, not sure it's applicable to arbitrary state machines
[11:51:08] <Manishearth> a model which can be easily extended to a generator which has an execution path "yield int, then yield bool , then accept Result, ..."
[11:51:19] <Manishearth> eddyb: seems to be, though you need some Peano in there
[11:51:24] <eddyb> lol
[11:51:26] <eddyb> no thanks
[11:51:33] <eddyb> Manishearth: it probably doesn't even nest well
[11:51:37] <Manishearth> eddyb: https://github.com/Munksgaard/session-types
[11:51:43] <Manishearth> there's a whole bit on nesting
[11:51:54] <Manishearth>  but type signatures get complicated
[11:52:09] <Manishearth> there's an associated paper on this but it isn't public yet; I'll bug them to put up a preprint
[11:52:12] <eddyb> not worth it then
[11:52:25] <eddyb> Manishearth: keep in mind the user doesn't feed the generator
[11:52:29] <Manishearth> eddyb: well, if we're implementing gneerators in the compiler, we can hide away these types :)
[11:52:40] <Manishearth> eddyb: oh, one way only? simplified greatly
[11:52:41] <eddyb> a Reactor does
[11:52:49] <eddyb> and that's library code
[11:52:50] <Manishearth> but you mentioned read.next(Ok(vec))
[11:53:02] <eddyb> Manishearth: that's just to exemplify what types can be passed in
[11:53:13] <eddyb> the value comes from some Reactor
[11:53:13] <Manishearth> how would that be built on top of an existing oneway generator?
[11:53:27] <eddyb> I didn't finish my example above :P
[11:53:30] <eddyb> let g = copy(a, b);
[11:53:44] <eddyb> g.next(()), g.next(Ok(vec![])), g.next(Ok(fs::Metadata {...})), g.next(Err(io::Error::whatever(...))) are all valid
[11:54:01] <eddyb> actually, the last one needs a type hint
[11:54:08] <eddyb> it could be either for the Vec<u8> input or the Metadata one
[11:54:41] <eddyb> Manishearth: https://gist.github.com/eddyb/822c658190ccf18058db#file-await-rs-L207-L219
[11:58:01] <eddyb> Manishearth: so you know SEME?
[11:58:10] <eddyb> after desugaring, generators are MEME
[11:58:11] <Manishearth> SEME? no
[11:58:17] <eddyb> single-entry multiple-exit
[11:58:20] <Manishearth> oh okay
[11:58:24] <Manishearth> yeah
[11:58:31] <eddyb> MEME generators
[11:58:32] <eddyb> lel
[11:58:38] <Manishearth> haha
[11:58:45] <eddyb> I am so using that for a RFC name
[11:58:48] <eddyb> if I ever end up writing it
[11:59:04] <eddyb> the design is non-trivial but so close to maximally expressive
[11:59:56] <Manishearth> eddyb: is this Async thing basically the same run-async-stuff-and-wait-for-results-without-callback-hell that generators+promises gets you in JS?
[12:00:21] <Manishearth> oh I see an await macro
[12:00:22] <Manishearth> yes it is
[12:00:24] <Manishearth> nice
[12:00:24] <eddyb> Manishearth: the design is similar to ES6 generators, yes
[12:00:31] <eddyb> yield+ is yield* from there
[12:00:39] <eddyb> Manishearth: except... `return` also does something
[12:00:45] <eddyb> not sure if ES6 has a "final result"
[12:00:55] <eddyb> I guess it has exceptions
[12:01:01] <eddyb> for the same role
[12:01:09] <Manishearth> yeah
[12:01:28] <Manishearth> isan't yield* the same as yeild?
[12:01:32] <eddyb> no
[12:01:34] <Manishearth> yield
[12:01:34] <Manishearth> whatever
[12:01:43] <Manishearth> oh right
[12:01:44] <eddyb> it yields all elements of a sub-generator
[12:01:50] <Manishearth> got it
[12:02:03] <Manishearth> haven't used ES6 in a while and they messed up the stars at one point iirc
[12:03:49] <eddyb> oh ffs
[12:04:11] <eddyb> phantom types suck now q_q
[12:06:13] <Manishearth> eddyb: ?
[12:07:04] <eddyb> having to add PhantomData
[12:09:13] <eddyb> oh wow, found another typo
[12:15:11] <Manishearth> eddyb: how do you intend to implement these generators? Extend internal closure support to both closures and generators?
[12:15:14] <fkaa> what are they for?
[12:15:16] <fkaa> i've seen them here and there
[12:28:00] <Manishearth> fkaa: generators? They're like closures that  can pause
[12:28:05] <Manishearth> but better
[12:28:13] <fkaa> phantomdata
[12:28:45] <Manishearth> Oh, why does phantomdata exist?
[12:28:51] <Manishearth> hints the compiler about variance
[12:29:05] <Manishearth> So if you want to implement your own &mut T
[12:30:02] <Manishearth> you would use struct RefMut<'a> {ptr: *mut T, marker: PhantomData<&'a mut ()>}, and 'a would be invariant
[12:30:11] <Manishearth> etc
[12:36:17] <FreeFull> Hm, why isn't rust-lang.org available over https?
[12:36:24] <eddyb> Manishearth: nothing to do with closures
[12:38:35] <kimundi> eddyb: Well, the generation of the state machines could be made with a closure expression as well
[12:38:47] <kimundi> Manishearth: Though in thise case this would be a variant of a fn item
[12:39:47] <Manishearth> eddyb: I mean that closures could be treated as generators
[12:40:21] <Manishearth> internally
[12:40:32] <Manishearth> they are, after all, just stupider generators
[12:44:21] <Manishearth> fkaa: http://cglab.ca/~abeinges/blah/turpl/_book/lifetime-misc.html
[12:51:43] <eddyb> Manishearth: all closures?

[13:12:18] <bluss> I just missed you
[13:16:28] <Manishearth> eddyb: because it would simplify things to only have to reason about one ype of anonymous thingy?
[13:16:36] <eddyb> Manishearth: no, it wouldn't
[13:16:45] <Manishearth> hm
[13:17:05] <eddyb> Manishearth: you could desugar closures to use `-> impl FnWhatever` but it's hard
[13:17:24] <eddyb> they're all going to use struct + impl or each be special
[13:19:21] <Manishearth> eddyb: no I mean that internally represent closures as generators
[13:19:34] <Manishearth> purely implementation question
[13:19:45] <eddyb> uhm, still no
[13:19:54] <eddyb> closures are much simpler than generators
[13:20:00] <eddyb> they require no control-flow transform
[13:23:24] <Manishearth> eddyb: their raw representation though?
[13:23:30] <eddyb> still no
[13:23:40] <eddyb> closures are structs, generators are enums
[13:23:45] <Manishearth> hmm
[13:23:53] <Manishearth> well, closurs are single-variant enums
[13:25:32] <Manishearth> I'm saying we share as much as we can between the two, keeping the codebase simple
[13:25:57] <eddyb> the only sane way that would work is a blanket impl of FnMut for a Generator<Args, Value = Void, Return = Output>
[13:26:04] <eddyb> FSVO "sane"
[13:26:15] <eddyb> Manishearth: but atm there's no closure desugaring
[13:26:24] <eddyb> and generator desugaring is pointless without the MIR
[13:26:28] <Manishearth> ah
[13:26:43] <Manishearth> okay, I misunderstood how you were going to impl this
[13:27:16] <eddyb> I believe this should be functional now https://gist.github.com/eddyb/822c658190ccf18058db
[13:27:50] <eddyb> with a simpler first yield mechanic
[13:28:50] <eddyb> I'm not very enthusiastic about doing the state machine transform on that by hand
[13:28:55] <eddyb> definitely not in the web editor :P
[13:33:41] <Manishearth> eddyb: I wonder if this could be done as a plugin :P
[13:33:51] <Manishearth> I had some ideas for a stunted generator before
[13:34:00] <Manishearth> just that handling control flow would be painful
[13:34:13] <Manishearth> but I think it's going to be just as bad to do it in-tree
[13:35:08] <eddyb> Manishearth: not with the MIR
[13:36:26] <eddyb> there's a way to do parts of this with a syntax extension without needing types everywhere
[13:36:33] <eddyb> abusing closures for inference
[13:36:40] <eddyb> if you have -> impl Trait
[13:36:59] <eddyb> I actually wanted to demo such a generator in an -> impl Trait test
[13:37:11] <eddyb> Manishearth: but it's not as powerful as these goodies
[13:37:13] <Manishearth> eddyb: huh
[13:37:23] <Manishearth> eddyb: is there an rfc for anon return types?
[13:37:24] <eddyb> Manishearth: an enum generic over the type of every variable
[13:37:26] <eddyb> ah
[13:37:27] <Manishearth> if not, pls make one
