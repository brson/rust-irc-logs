[00:48:21] <strcat> it really sucked when it had modes and no borrowed pointers ;p
[00:48:28] <mcpherrin> My first impression of rust was "Wow, I have no idea what tjc is talking about, but I really like his socks"
[00:48:39] <ChrisMorgan> The first release I paid much attention to: "Hmm. I should keep an eye on this." Two releases later: "Yep, looks like it might meet my Ideal Web Framework language requirements. I should play with it."
[00:48:40] <apoelstra> oh, it was at 0.8-pre when i got into it

[00:49:10] <johnrkd> "this language actually makes sense"

[00:49:54] <strcat> I tried rust again when 0.4 was released and it was much better

[00:50:01] <doomlord_> balanced second impression from me:  (a) i genuinely missed C++ function overloading, (b) the module system confused me, (c) but ADTs wowed me a bit, and all the small differences to C++ were generally pleasant
[00:50:06] <strcat> had a bad first impression before that though
[00:50:09] <bjz> strcat: lol modes
[00:50:16] <dotfelix> just like two months ago, when I use to program in Go and got bored of Go

[03:48:31] <DanC> IoFactory looks quite handy for splitting out ambient authority.
[03:49:21] <meyer> Do you think it'd be silly to add an "aas" (meaning "all as") operator, which acts exactly like as, but with lower precedence? (In order to remove a bunch of parenthesis)

[13:03:49] <huon> antrn: *T is (somewhat) equivalent to `const T*` in C
[13:03:52] <eddyb> bstrie: our inference is pretty much HM. this issue is more about the interactions between method lookup and inference

[13:04:12] <huon> stepancheg: by design

[13:09:30] <huon> pyon: I think the more accurate way to say that is "if Self is not Copy"
[13:09:44] <huon> but... that still holds with `&mut self`
[13:10:23] <huon> any time you want to "save" the state, one can write `let saved = iter; iter.input(...)`
[13:10:31] <pyon> huon: Oh.
[13:10:49] <huon> I see the strategy though, very neat.
[13:11:04] <pyon> huon: Another problem is that, after the iterator is consumed, we cannot leave leftovers. For example, the TakeWhile iterator should leave the rest of the sequence for further use.
[13:11:13] <huon> pyon: (specifically, something like `&mut int` isn't Drop, but is also not copyable.)
[13:11:45] <huon> pyon: right... one might wish to consume the whole iterator for the last step
[13:13:24] <pyon> huon: Also, Peekable's peek() mutating the iterator is kinda kludgy.
[13:13:39] <eddyb> output iterators are cool

[13:15:15] <eddyb> pyon: you can substitute () for any in/out type to turn them off?
[13:15:41] <eddyb> huon: how does performance fit into this?
[13:15:42] <pyon> Mmm... I do not see why having "a million traits" is bad. It is the only way to have fine-grained control over generic algorithms.
[13:15:58] <pyon> Plus traits are always resolved statically unless we use trait objects.

[13:54:54] <Siyo> why does rust accept -1u as valid? I was trying to figure out why range_step(10u, 0, -1) wouldn't work. Obviously you can't have a negative step with uint
[13:54:57] <Siyo> is this ok?

[18:10:51] <doomlord_> i see enums and vtables as orthogonal, closed variants vs open methods or open variants vs closed methods; a state machine for game AI would have a framework that doesn't need to know all the object class states - it would just specify the events they need to deal with - so its the opposite case to enums i think

[22:10:49] <mcpherrin> End messages can be pretty annoying if you've got a network of tasks
[22:11:10] <huon> the sender is destroyed at the end of the send_to_task call because it's taken by value, and so if that that's the only sender, the channel closes. Cloning fixes this by holding a sending endpoint to the channel open until the end of main.
[22:11:30] <huon> would also be fixed with `send_to_task(s: &Sender<int>)`
