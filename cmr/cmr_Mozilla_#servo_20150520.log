[00:27:24] <jdm> the last two PRs linked there demonstrate them
[00:28:09] <zmike_> gw: because the alternative is to set up a timer running every 0.001s or faster and never ever disable it
[00:29:51] <zmike_> it's a mechanism for notifying the application that servo has work to do so the application can call the function to let servo do its work

[00:31:42] <gw> jdm: thanks, I'll see if I can repro. with the way it works now, timeouts are generally an indicator of a genuine bug somewhere in servo that results in it not pushing the most recent layout to the compositor.

[01:48:18] <zmike_> it seems that the glutin and cef ports share an issue
[01:48:41] <zmike_> they don't process events as often as they should
[01:49:09] <zmike_> glutin port has CompositorProxy::send() where it does wakeup_event_loop()

[01:49:38] <zmike_> but it seems there are other events which do not pass through there
[01:49:51] <zmike_> and so they don't get processed
[01:50:29] <gw> zmike_: what events are those?
[01:50:36] <zmike_> don't know
[01:50:50] <zmike_> but you can see this by scrolling a bit in the glutin port and then moving the mouse over the page
[01:51:04] <zmike_> the mouse movements generate events which wake up servo to continue processing its event queue
[01:51:08] <zmike_> same thing happens with resize
[01:51:15] <zmike_> it's more dramatic in the cef port
[01:52:16] <gw> zmike_: got a specific example page i can try to see that?
[01:52:24] <zmike_> I'm just using wikipedia
[01:52:37] <zmike_> on the main page
[01:52:41] <zmike_> it's a little bit subtle
[01:54:15] <gw> zmike_: I'm not sure I see it. are you scrolling with the mouse or keyboard? and what do you see change when you move the mouse over?
[01:54:16] <zmike_> though
[01:54:19] <zmike_> mouse wheel
[01:54:26] <zmike_> some text moves/reflows a tiny bit
[01:54:37] <zmike_> the scrolling timer doesn't go through this it seems
[01:54:42] <zmike_> I just traced it in gdb
[01:55:04] <gw> zmike_: that's a general reflow bug (the moving text). yes, the scrolling is all handled in the compositor, so doesn't go via the event proxy

[02:05:00] <zmike_> I'm not sure...it's possible that I'm interpreting the glutin port's redraws wrongly and that that is indeed totally unrelated

[02:05:51] <gw> zmike_: I think my confusion stems from not knowing (or deliberately forgetting) quite how the cef integration works. when you were talking about triggering "work" for servo, which thread / event loop are you actually spinning?
[02:05:52] <mwu> is there some place where we can see what bors' queue is?

[02:06:52] <zmike_> but I have this issue with scrolling where once I stop, moving the mouse afterward causes it to draw another frame
[02:07:10] <zmike_> indicating that servo isn't getting its events processed because the app isn't calling the function often enough

[03:23:43] <Manishearth> hm?
[03:23:59] <KiChjang> there are lots of links to algorithms defined in w3c
[03:24:02] *** c74d3 is now known as c74d
[03:24:08] <Manishearth> really?
[03:24:16] <KiChjang> yes, for main fetch
[03:24:19] <Manishearth> Are we sure that those algorithms aren't implemented in hyper or elsewhere?
[03:24:36] <KiChjang> that i haven't checked
[03:24:41] <KiChjang> i'll check hyper first
[03:24:57] <reem> hyper just implements bare HTTP
[03:25:00] <Manishearth> I do recall a bunch of minialgorithms within the spec itself
[03:25:05] <Manishearth> but none outside
[03:25:15] <KiChjang> https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-main-fetch
[03:25:27] <Manishearth> KiChjang: you could open a tracking issue with all the stuff that needs implementing and we could both work on it
[03:25:33] <Manishearth> this sounds like a splittable task
[03:25:39] <KiChjang> yes definitely
[03:25:52] <KiChjang> i'll have to skip the external ones in that case

[18:31:19] <jdm> Nashenas88: if the interface allows implementing the meaning of the spec, it doesn't need to match it exactly. what in particular would prevent that right now?
[18:32:42] <Nashenas88> jdm: My interpretation of the spec says that the secure flag would be a boolean, but he wants to implement it as an Option<&openssl::ssl::SslContext>
[18:32:58] <Nashenas88> His comment was "The problem with a boolean flag is that it doesn't allow the user any control over the SslContext used. I'd rather the user be able to specify their own context (so they can choose their required SSL/TLS versions, etc) than to just force a particular context."

[18:33:32] <jdm> Nashenas88: I don't see the problem there - if secure is true, that's the same as Some(some_ssl_context), and if it's false that's the same as None
[18:33:46] <Nashenas88> Which does seem very reasonable to me, I'm just curious if this causes issue with conformance with the rfc

[20:17:35] <Gankro> yoyo guys, I'm looking at shuffling the homu columns around to give some more useful/better information. In particular I'm thinking: 
[20:17:35] <Gankro> * shuffle columns so #,status,mergeable,title are the first things (in that order) -- they seem to be the most important info.
[20:17:35] <Gankro> * kill "approved by" as not particularly useful (maybe you disagree?)
[20:17:35] <Gankro> * add some "activity" column to make it clear if a PR has anyone discussing it yet, and how long its been since that last occured

[20:42:41] <zmike_> jdm: my issue is that with cef, there are two types of key down events: one is just the key down, and one is key down + repeat
[20:43:03] <Ms2ger> mwu, do you have push access to servo?
[20:43:05] <zmike_> but it seems that servo handles key down and repeat both as repeat
[20:43:10] <mwu> Ms2ger: no
[20:43:21] <zmike_> ie. the raw key down event will trigger repeat instead of just key down
[20:43:47] <jdm> I am still confused by this explanation.
[20:43:48] <Ms2ger> jdm, can we give mwu push access and move the smup branch into servo/servo before we start reviewing? I imagine we'll want to push changes to it

[20:44:52] <mwu> now I have to look at what I'm doing when I push -f
[20:44:53] <zmike_> jdm: uhhhhh
[20:45:05] * mbrubeck goes back to rustuppin'
[20:45:18] <zmike_> there are 4 types of key events: KEYEVENT_RAWKEYDOWN, KEYEVENT_KEYDOWN, KEYEVENT_CHAR, KEYEVENT_KEYUP
[20:45:19] <mbrubeck> and reviewing interruptible parser patches
[20:45:20] <zmike_> does this help?
[20:46:34] <jdm> zmike_: so how is repeat indicated?
[20:46:39] <zmike_> CHAR
[20:47:01] <zmike_> KEYDOWN = RAWKEYDOWN+CHAR
[20:47:34] <zmike_> it seems that servo has no similar event for RAWKEYDOWN
[20:47:40] <zmike_> is what I am getting at
[20:48:22] * jdm is trying to find documentation for these
[20:48:27] <zmike_> there is none
[20:48:27] <jdm> the names do not make sense to me
[20:48:41] <zmike_> I know what they do because I spent a lot of time in gdb
[20:48:43] <zmike_> there are no docs
[20:49:27] *** Joins: nrc|afk (nrc|afk@moz-14pjgj.xtra.co.nz)
[20:49:34] <zmike_> effectively it is possible to press a key without ever sending the key to the document
[20:49:58] <jdm> so when is KEYDOWN vs RAWKEYDOWN sent?
[20:50:03] <zmike_> this is for apps
[20:50:09] <zmike_> the app decides
[20:50:20] <zmike_> it's up to servo to handle it accurately
[20:50:42] <jdm> so RAWKEYDOWN is not meant to go to the document?

[20:51:02] <zmike_> I'm not entirely certain what the purpose is, but when I tested it that seemed to be the result
[20:51:27] <zmike_> ie. if I was using a search entry and tried typing while sending just RAWKEYDOWN and KEYUP then nothing would be typed into the entry
[20:51:41] <zmike_> but I suspect that browser shortcuts would still be processed
[20:52:16] <zmike_> or perhaps it's for timing how long a key has been pressed within the browser engine
[20:52:31] <zmike_> I don't have a definite answer, I only know the results that I saw in testing

[20:53:56] <zmike_> I would assume CHAR is "more correct"
[20:54:12] <zmike_> vs KEYDOWN is when you know you want to send both the key and the keypress

[21:14:26] <gw> jdm: one more issue I ran into with cleaning up pipelines - if a RunnableMsg is queued, and the pipeline is closed, this can cause panics (e.g. the load event tries to construct an event, which panics as the js runtime variable has been cleared for the window object). thoughts on the right way to do this? I could add a PipelineId field to RunnableMsg, and
[21:14:27] <gw> only fire it if the pipeline exists, but I wasn't sure if that will be ideal since RunnableMsg is used by the dedicatedworkerscope etc
[21:16:14] <Caspy7> Curious, how swappable is Spidermonkey & V8 with Servo? Or is it at all?
[21:16:29] <jdm> gw: we should add a field to the relevant object to indicate closed-ness and have runnables check that
[21:16:53] <jdm> gw: alternatively, add a class of runnables that have the pipeline id and are automatically ignored if it's closed

[22:06:30] <larsberg> mbrubeck: the latest snapshot literally only finished uploading this morning (linux is always longer, since we also build a 32-bit toolchain there) :-)
[22:07:16] <mbrubeck> The May 15 snapshot is looking good so far.
[22:07:49] <mbrubeck> I'm going to have to re-merge a bunch of Cargo.lock changes if Ms2ger's "little_rustup_that_could" lands.

[22:52:20] <gw> mbrubeck: cool. btw, I believe upstream glutin still has headless but it's done via dlopen() now so doesn't have the cargo feature. I'll try and get us back on upstream next week (and sort out the patches we have that aren't merged) after the rustup
[22:52:55] <mbrubeck> gw: Oh, good.  I tried to see if there was a simple way to update or merge, and it wasn't obvious.
[22:53:04] <mbrubeck> But that sounds better than I thought.
