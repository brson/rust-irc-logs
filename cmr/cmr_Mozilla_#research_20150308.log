[22:16:41] <nrc> Ha! Phil Wadler has a pretty printing paper - I assume at this stage he is just going for the complete set - a paper on everything
[22:18:32] <dherman> nrc: I spent a long time in grad school with that slew of pretty printing papers, and could never get the algorithms to work in a strict language
[22:18:53] <dherman> perhaps not proof of anything other than my own limitations
[22:20:13] <nrc> dherman: you mean implementing in a strict language or printing a strict language?
[22:20:25] <dherman> implementing in
[22:20:46] <dherman> there are a couple of lines (literally like about 2 lines) in the code that exploit laziness in such an instructable way I could never figure out how to port it
[22:21:58] <nrc> huh, interesting
[22:22:08] <larsberg> we (my advisor and I) played with the Wadler and earlier Hughes stuff trying to make a better SML pretty printer, but all the edge cases around indentation (partially due to clownshoes grammar choices, because much of SML syntax at best co-dates parser theory) made them not work
[22:22:22] <dherman> yeah the libraries are pretty annoying to use
[22:22:40] <dherman> nrc: I should say, I *did* port it, but occasionally would run into combinatorial explosions that were indistinguishable from iloops
[22:22:42] <nrc> It is tempting to try to implement a printer with a bunch of ad-hoc heuristics, rather than a fancy algorithm. I fear you would hit a pathalogical case quite quickly though
[22:23:12] <nrc> plus lots and lots of code
[22:24:14] *** Joins: ddamjano (Instantbird@moz-tb384d.cfl3.oeer.8388.2a02.IP)
[22:24:26] <larsberg> nrc: it's pretty darned easy to make something that parses the code into the AST and then has a bunch of context dependent rules it runs to a fixed point, plus it's trivial to "fix" misindentation that are logically nonsensical (of course you'd move the operator to the next line in a split even if it's not at full length; it looks "silly" otherwise!)
[22:25:11] <larsberg> the algebraic stuff often resulted in what were (to me) really hard to debug results, and for heavily-nested stuff, truly confusing to explain, much less change, the results
[22:26:08] <larsberg> interesting side note on pretty printing: one of the side projects I had one of the members of my team working on was called, "when in rome," which learned the indentation style of the code you were editing :-)
[22:26:30] <nrc> neat
[22:26:37] <nrc> did it work?

[23:04:59] <roc> FWIW I'm pretty happy with clang-format's pretty-printing of C++ code
[23:08:15] <cmr> nrc: I saw a passing mention that emacs can do it, but not very well.
[23:09:02] <nrc> cmr: it == pretty printing?
[23:09:15] <cmr> nrc: learning indentation style
[23:09:22] <nrc> oh right
[23:09:56] <nrc> Sublime text does it very badly, but its not really trying to learn the style so much as just the number of spaces indent
[23:10:20] <nrc> there was an interesting blog post on someone doing that for something in Fx deve tools, iirc
[23:10:44] <nrc> https://medium.com/firefox-developer-tools/detecting-code-indentation-eff3ed0fb56b
[23:11:18] <nrc> it's the kind of blog post that could almost be published in a journal :-)
[23:15:33] <roc> so no-one would ever read it?
[23:18:52] <nrc> such cynicism
[23:20:25] <roc> is it not still the case that the only value of CS journal publications is to build your tenure case?
[23:23:20] <nrc> probably
[23:23:35] <nrc> I wasn't saying the cynicism was not justified :-)
[23:41:48] *** reqshark_ is now known as reqshark
[23:51:56] <shu> anyone familiar with the linux kernel around?
[23:52:46] <kmc> a little bit, what's up
[23:54:43] <shu> kmc: i'm running into an absolutely bizarre bug where a signal handler saves an IP pointed to an invalid instruction
[23:55:08] <shu> kmc: but the sigill is never raised beforehand, always after the custom signal handler

[23:57:10] <cmr> (just floated by in #rust-gamedev)
[23:58:49] <kmc> neato
[23:59:08] <kmc> shu: strange
[23:59:15] <kmc> what's the instruction? where is it?
