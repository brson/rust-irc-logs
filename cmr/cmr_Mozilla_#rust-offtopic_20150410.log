[04:03:02] <c74d3> ah
[04:03:03] <tiffany> I have that in emacs
[04:03:06] <tiffany> it's quite nice
[04:03:06] <scott> ~/code/y/rusti in truth, so you weren't all that far off ;)
[04:03:16] <tiffany> why would you name a directory y?
[04:03:37] <scott> first I had code/x for experiments and random stuff
[04:03:48] <c74d3> I had that in Vim, I ought to have thought of that.
[04:03:57] <tiffany> I have a 'scripts' directory for experiments and random stuff
[04:04:01] <scott> then I made code/y for external code based on the tenuous connection of y -> you -> 2nd person -> other people's code
[04:04:15] <scott> in general I have code/<project> for active projects
[04:04:25] <tiffany> and a 'projects' directory for things that have been promoted to git repo, and a 'src' directory for stuff I've git cloned for some reason but don't contribute to
[04:05:41] <scott> I once had ~/code/<lang>/<project> but that was a poor organization and each <lang> dir would also be full of experiments cluttering them up
[04:06:01] <scott> now I have ~/code/<project> and ~/code/x/<lang>/<experiment> roughly
[04:06:24] *** Quits: Rym (y@moz-j0i.34a.55.31.IP) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[04:07:05] <c74d3> I think at one point I had `~/src/personal` for my projects, `~/src/collab` or something for other people's projects I was contributing to, and `~/src/external` for other people's projects I wasn't contributing to; then I switched to `~/src/<owner>/<project>`.
[04:07:32] <scott> I use code/y for cloning various github repos I don't care about
[04:07:34] <tiffany> that's a good idea
[04:08:05] <scott> ~$ ls code/y
[04:08:05] <scott> bare-metal-tetris  cargo  clang  proxos  rusti
[04:08:16] <scott> any more organization would be overkill for my uses here
[04:08:41] <scott> not sure why I still have cargo in there
[04:09:31] <tiffany> I have 121 things in src + projects
[04:10:27] <tiffany> almost 40 things in projects
[04:10:41] <tiffany> to be fair
[04:10:46] <tiffany> some of it I haven't touched in years
[04:11:03] <scott> I have too much stuff in code right now
[04:11:14] <scott> I need a one-letter directory for shelved projects now
[04:11:23] <c74d3> My old laptop's `~/src` just has most repositories at toplevel, with some category subdirectories, mostly in the form `<lang>-test`.
[04:11:29] <scott> I don't know why one-letter, but they're fun
[04:12:29] <scott> o for old. I'll use that
[04:13:08] <c74d3> I suppose organizing one's home directory as a hierarchy of single-letter directories could be efficient, if problematic for… I dunno, the executor of one's will?
[04:13:19] <scott> hehe
[04:13:45] <tiffany> it looks like the oldest shelved project I have was last committed to in october 2013
[04:13:52] <c74d3> …no, I don
[04:14:21] <tiffany> I had forgotten that most of it was written in lua

[04:18:38] *** Quits: Tobba (Tobba@moz-o13d22.bredband.telia.com) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[04:19:40] <c74d3> I recently tried again to write a simple program I'd been trying to write in OCaml and then Haskell, this time in Lua… I finished it with rapidity, and was rather chagrined at having found a weakly- and dynamically-typed programming language indeed more convenient than strongly- and statically-typed languages.
[04:21:11] <tiffany> I find haskell much more enjoyable and faster to write in than lua
[04:21:36] <tiffany> the typos really kill you once you start threading lots of data around
[04:21:41] <scott> I still use Ruby for scripting since I'm so quick with it, but I would not consider it seriously for large applications
[04:21:56] <tiffany> since they just make nil.. and nil can propagate through a thousand lines of code before it's inadvertently struck
[04:22:09] <tiffany> or god forbid, you could pass that nil to a luajit FFI function, and cause a segfault
[04:22:10] <scott> part of that is just that I've spent so much hands-on time using Ruby compared to any other language
[04:23:00] <tiffany> I once had lua bindings of my game engine
[04:23:15] <tiffany> I eventually got so sick of constantly having to fix the most ridiculous errors that I threw it out
[04:23:24] <tiffany> I was literally spending more time maintaining the lua bindings than I was the actual engine
[04:23:26] <FreeFull> Haskell takes time to get quick with
[04:23:34] <tiffany> I don't have all that much experience with haskell
[04:23:45] <FreeFull> And sometimes you get stumped on how to do something idiomatically
[04:23:52] <tiffany> just a lot of built up experience with functional programming in not-so-functional languages
[04:24:01] <tiffany> ah
[04:24:06] <tiffany> I don't really worry about doing things idiomatically
[04:24:19] <tiffany> in fact, some people would probably chastise me over the code I write in haskell
[04:24:35] <FreeFull> I haven't written Haskell in a while
[04:24:45] <tiffany> however, I am trying to get stuff done, not perform a bruteforce search for the most concise program
[04:24:48] <FreeFull> Rust lead me away
[04:24:58] <tiffany> I'm the other way around actually
[04:25:08] <FreeFull> Last time I was properly doing stuff with Haskell, I was getting stuck into the implementation of lenses
[04:25:15] <tiffany> I'd been putting off working on my programming language since I kept ending up fighting rust's type system
[04:25:19] <tiffany> and decided to just write it all in haskell
[04:25:22] <scott> I've spent very little time using Haskell practically
[04:25:36] <tiffany> I don't even know what lenses are
[04:25:51] <scott> I spend a lot of time learning new languages, and I think I can read but not write a tonne of languages as a result
[04:25:56] <FreeFull> I could get started again with Haskell if necessary, I'd just need some time to remember all the syntax and what things are called
[04:26:11] <tiffany> I rely quite heavily on hoogle
[04:26:31] <FreeFull> Lenses are pretty cool
[04:26:39] <FreeFull> And if you do multithreading, STM is really cool
[04:26:52] <tiffany> does haskell have support for the HTM in haswell?
[04:27:00] <FreeFull> No idea
[04:27:35] <c74d3> This program was only 28 lines long; I don't think I've done anything complex in Lua since a while back when, frustrated with type errors, I started trying to implement a basic strong dynamic type system as a Lua library.
[04:28:08] <c74d3> s/when/, &/
[04:29:34] <tiffany> the interpreter for my programming language is currently 369 lines long
[04:29:43] <rovar> I haven't found anyone that has made decent use of haswell HTM
[04:29:53] <rovar> it is just too fine grained
[04:30:00] <rovar> and also blows up cache lines
[04:30:26] <c74d3> Maybe Java, then.
[04:30:30] <tiffany> I heard that intel pretty much threw it out there with lots of hardware buffer limits and stuff, and expected everyone to just solve the problem of mapping arbitrarily large transactions to it
[04:30:31] <rovar> i'm sure someone could make use of it, but I've not heard 
[04:31:00] <rovar> I was very excited about it when it came out, cause STM was all the rage
[04:31:04] <tiffany> I would think that it would at least slightly speed up existing STM systems, if not replace their current backends
[04:31:19] <tiffany> STM is pretty weird to me
[04:31:23] <FreeFull> tiffany: Another nice thing about Haskell is its parsing libraries
[04:31:27] <rovar> it doesn't map well to existing STM systems at all
[04:31:31] <tiffany> freefull: I don't use any of them
[04:31:49] <tiffany> I have a hand-written 216 line long lexer
[04:31:53] <rovar> Parsec created a revolution
[04:31:59] <rovar> I really like https://github.com/Geal/nom though
[04:32:15] <FreeFull> Yeah, nom is neat as far as Rust stuff goes

[11:46:08] <libfud> hm
[11:46:09] <libfud> no
[11:46:16] <scott> you should probably arrange for the C code to treat it as an anonymous blob and use it via functions defined in Rust

[13:29:43] <libfud> do I have to manually allocate the memory for my structs in C?
[13:31:52] <huon> no
[13:31:59] <libfud> hm
[13:32:03] <libfud> I'm wondering what I'm doing wrong
[13:32:11] <huon> the opaque pointer design has all FFI interactions happen via pointers
[13:32:28] <libfud> because when I call a function that uses the struct's constructor and returns a *const struct
[13:32:43] <huon> in Rust?
[13:32:48] <libfud> hold on a sec
[13:32:55] <huon> are you allocating memory in Rust?
[13:32:56] <libfud> let me paste the relevant code
[13:33:02] <libfud> no
[13:33:11] <huon> then what pointer are you returning?
[13:33:12] <libfud> er, I call the constructor for the struct in rust
[13:33:30] <libfud> I have two people in the room holding a conversation and it's hard to think
[13:34:21] <huon> #[no_mangle] pub extern fn foo_create() -> *const Foo { let p = Box::new(Foo::new()); unsafe { mem::transmute(p) } }
[13:34:25] <huon> for example
[13:34:32] <libfud> oh
[13:34:38] <libfud> I was doing
[13:34:52] <libfud> &Foo::new()
[13:35:35] <FreeFull> huon: Is transmute the right way, or forget + &*p as *const Foo?
[13:35:53] <huon> I prefer transmute for this: makes the ownership transfer automatic
[13:36:03] <huon> wait, there's now into_raw and from_raw I think
[13:36:12] <huon> so they're probably even better than both
[13:36:25] <huon> http://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/boxed/fn.into_raw.html
[13:36:57] <FreeFull> Ah, they're unstable though
[13:37:08] <libfud> I need a few minutes
[13:37:17] <libfud> it's impossible to think right now
[13:38:02] <libfud> ok
[13:38:08] <libfud> there we go
[13:38:18] <libfud> so, a better way is to transmute
[13:38:27] <libfud> and better than that is into_raw and from_raw
[13:38:29] <libfud> which are unstable

[13:48:24] <libfud> I had an idea that something was weird when the function that returns the name of one of the buffers caused an panic on an unwrap

[17:11:25] <libfud> I wonder how many tech manuals I've read in my lifetime
[17:11:29] <eddyb> I found this very useful http://x86.renejeschke.de/
[17:11:33] <libfud> how many thousands of pages
[17:11:36] <eddyb> so I don't need to open my blue books
[17:11:42] <libfud> blue books?
[17:11:48] <eddyb> well, white
[17:11:50] <eddyb> white with some blue
[17:11:53] <eddyb> the intel manuals
[17:11:56] <libfud> oh
[17:12:39] <c74d3> (or am I misremembering that it had a robotic-looking avatar of green super-pixels on white)
[17:12:53] <libfud> when it comes to programming, I feel like I can't actually learn until I do something in a project, but at the same time I do need good refernce materials and a launching point
[17:13:13] <eddyb> tiffany: I'd stay to chat, but really, I'm supposed to be offline
[17:13:26] <tiffany> bye
[17:13:37] <libfud> adios eddyb 
[17:13:39] <proc> libfud: yep, "code the project to learn it" "learn it to code the project", I love this loop
[17:13:43] <eddyb> maybe I'll pop up once a few weeks, but not in the main channels. taking a break and whatnot
[17:13:56] <proc> bye
[17:14:18] <c74d3> eddyb, goodbye.
[17:14:38] <eddyb> I hope to get with rs0 and rid3 somewhere. maybe. while becoming a literary critic (or die trying!)

[17:17:30] <libfud> what editor/ide do you guys use?
[17:18:13] <proc> vm -> sublime test & eclipse
[17:18:14] <c74d3> Vim here, with many plugins.
[17:18:16] <libfud> and have you gained any tics from them? Like, when I used to use vim a lot I would constantly try to use hjkl and i and ^{, but since I started using emacs I've picked up stuff even worse than that
[17:18:36] <VShell> I am, at the moment, using Codebox hosted on my server. primarily because it works on my Chromebook, not because it's any good or works with Rust.
[17:18:49] <scott> libfud: what is ^{ in vim?
[17:18:56] <libfud> scott: escape
[17:19:02] <scott> ah
[17:19:32] <c74d3> That's ‘^[’, no?
[17:19:33] <scott> I think I hit escape (mapped as capslock) a lot in non-vim editors
[17:19:39] <libfud> oh
[17:19:42] <libfud> I may have hit shift
[17:19:47] <libfud> it's hard to tell with this particuar font
[17:19:57] <libfud> ^[
[17:20:15] <scott> heh I hope you don't program in that font
[17:20:32] <libfud> no
[17:20:41] <proc> comic sans all the way ;)
[17:20:44] <libfud> I think I'm going to change it right now actually
[17:21:00] <scott> my IRC client renders 'comic sans' in comic sans font whenever anyone says it
[17:21:12] <proc> :D
[17:21:13] <c74d3> I think the only keystroke habits I acquired from Vim that I found myself falling to in other programs are trying to delete words with Control-W and trying to exit Normal mode with Control-C.
[17:21:14] <scott> very useful feature or most useful feature?
[17:21:25] <proc> scott: useful indeed, client ?
[17:21:33] <scott> irccloud (browser-based)
[17:21:35] <c74d3> scott: does it do the same for other typefaces?
[17:21:41] <proc> ah, k
[17:21:45] <scott> c74d3: i think for a couple, but I don't remember which ones
[17:22:17] <proc> scott: Wingdings
[17:22:21] <scott> no dice
[17:23:06] <scott> nothing I'm trying is working. maybe it's just comic sans

[17:27:08] <scott> :p
[17:27:12] <proc> :D
[17:27:13] <c74d3> Vim never did make me use hjkl for movement rather than the arrow keys, except when I found myself in environments where the arrow keys were not functional/present.
[17:27:30] <proc> I'm for meal, Bobcat
[17:27:41] <XMPPwocky> i use a non-qwerty layout, so hjkl is sort of silly
[17:27:41] <scott> I only learned hjkl by conscious effort, but now it's second nature
[17:27:45] <libfud> I like using hjkl for firefox (vimperator) and scrolling through pdfs
[17:27:53] <XMPPwocky> i'll occasionally use j and k
[17:28:01] <scott> hjlk/arows are not common keys for me, though
[17:28:05] <scott> vim has much more powerful motions
[17:28:36] <proc> like deleting much faster then other editors ?
[17:28:51] <libfud> I use emacs stuff for going through words/sentences a lot now, especially since it's also used in shell stuff
[17:29:33] <libfud> C-space, C-w and C-y are all pretty neat
[17:29:36] <scott> readline also has a vim mode but I don't like it
[17:29:37] <libfud> I need to go to sleep
[17:29:57] <scott> I use the emacs bindings in readline (and actually I think a bunch of them work in vim insert mode)
[17:30:15] <scott> C-w does, at least. C-k doesn't
[17:30:46] <libfud> but C-k is awesome
[17:30:56] <scott> yeah, but not necessary in vim
[17:31:01] <libfud> ok, bed for real now, later guys
[17:31:05] <scott> I should learn the emacs bindings better for readline usage
[17:31:07] <scott> cya
[17:31:43] <c74d3> I did find myself often trying to erase lines with Control-U in GNU Emacs.

[18:33:59] <rustbot> Learned factoid 'bors'
[18:34:19] <barosl> Oh, thanks

[18:34:34] <rustbot> bors is the not only diligent but also tireless contributor to the Rust project.
[18:34:59] <barosl> So `the` is needed to make it a full sentence
[18:35:34] <Havvy> Using `:=`, it'll make the description be `%key% is %description%`

[18:37:05] <Astrum|Lap> I don't think factoid is synonymous with fact
[18:37:40] <barosl> It isn't, no?
[18:38:02] <Astrum|Lap> oh wait
