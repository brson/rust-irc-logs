[22:38:05] <Tobba> me neither really
[22:38:13] <hoverbear> "Let's make a language slower then python with weird syntax"
[22:38:24] <Tobba> still impressed they managed to fuck that up with the whole YAML thing
[22:39:09] <_achin> hm?
[22:39:09] <alan_andrade> In the case BDD is not the only testing suite, would that make you agree spork/zeus are ok to speed up your continuos testing env. ?
[22:39:19] <alan_andrade> steveklabnik ^
[22:39:30] <hoverbear> Tobba: What YAML thing?
[22:39:50] <Tobba> there was a thing where any ruby page that accepted content
[22:39:51] <Tobba> e.g POST
[22:40:10] <Tobba> you could send something that did like
[22:40:47] <alan_andrade> Another symptom that I feel emerge with bdd is that JS is left out
[22:41:00] <Tobba> I cant get it into IRC properly
[22:41:11] <Tobba> basicaly you sent it a peice of XML, containing a tag with type="yaml" set
[22:41:14] <steveklabnik> Tobba: you are being massively uncharitable
[22:41:25] <Tobba> which would invoke some hilariously unsafe YAML parser which could create arbitary objects
[22:41:53] <steveklabnik> alan_andrade: i dont believe the additional complexity of the tooling is worth the cost
[22:42:24] <steveklabnik> hoverbear: slightly over a year ago, there was an RCE in rails that involved a perfect storm of 4 or 5 bugs
[22:42:35] <hoverbear> steveklabnik: Ah I see.
[22:42:40] <steveklabnik> in code that people hadn't touched (or used really) in years
[22:42:49] <Tobba> it wasent really a perfect storm
[22:42:55] <Tobba> there was one amazingly massive fuckup
[22:43:03] <Tobba> and then the remote execution was just part of the carnage
[22:43:06] <steveklabnik> you can't even describe what happened properly
[22:43:11] <steveklabnik> i have commit to rails
[22:43:21] <steveklabnik> i helped make the fix happen
[22:43:24] <Tobba> pretty sure that was something along the lines
[22:43:27] <steveklabnik> this is not likely to be a productive ocnversation.
[22:43:32] <Tobba> probably not
[22:43:40] <Tobba> still, remote code execution, scripting language
[22:43:56] <hoverbear> I dunno, I haven't looked into rails enough to speak on it beyond it's syntax confuses the hell out of me
[22:43:58] <steveklabnik> i dont know why you're going on about 'scripting language'
[22:44:06] <steveklabnik> RCE is very, very bad though
[22:44:09] <Tobba> well, its not really a scripting language, but yeah
[22:44:25] <hoverbear> s/rails/ruby
[22:44:27] <Tobba> RCE shouldent even be possible, its on the level of trying to parse JSON using eval
[22:44:34] <Tobba> except in this case it was way more complex
[22:44:39] <steveklabnik> i personally spent three or four days of my spare time getting ssh credentials to random people's rails apps and helping fix them.
[22:45:09] <hoverbear> steveklabnik: You can have keys to my boxes whenever you want.
[22:45:10] <_achin> RCE should never be possible, but it generally is, for a arbitrary piece of software
[22:45:15] <steveklabnik> hoverbear: <3
[22:45:18] <Tobba> well yeah
[22:45:21] <steveklabnik> _achin: exactly.
[22:45:35] <hoverbear> steveklabnik: Just not my work boxes because I signed paper that said I wasn't allowed.
[22:45:38] <Tobba> its still amazing when it literally eval's code you put in due to a gigantic logical flop
[22:46:08] <steveklabnik> again, very uncharitable. it's an inherent issue with YAML.
[22:46:52] <_achin> note that python's pickle module warns you in big letters:  do not depickle unstructed data
[22:47:01] <hoverbear> de-pickle
[22:47:03] <steveklabnik> yup!
[22:47:07] * hoverbear de-pickles.
[22:47:07] <steveklabnik> very dangerous
[22:47:52] <_achin> if i write code that depickles untrusted user data, then i'm a fool.  this isn't the fault of pickle or python
[22:48:13] <Tobba> iirc rails tried to deserialize it by default
[22:48:16] <steveklabnik> this kind of logic feels very odd to me in a Rust chatroom ;)
[22:48:17] <_achin> (not saying that's what happened with ruby, but just givning a relevant example)
[22:48:40] <steveklabnik> it is, and it was a mistake.
[22:48:45] <hoverbear> steveklabnik: Have you used Sodium Oxide?
[22:49:00] <_achin> also, a nice dill pickle sounds very tasty
[22:49:35] <steveklabnik> i have not
[22:50:40] * hoverbear is a fan of Javascript and Rust. >.>
[22:50:48] <hoverbear> _achin: I could use a pickle
[22:51:08] <_achin> we should organize something.  a meetup.  were we talk about rust.  while eating pickles
[22:51:09] <alan_andrade> What does pickle mean in the python context ?
[22:51:16] <alan_andrade> haha
[22:51:27] <hoverbear> alan_andrade: http://docs.python.org/2/library/pickle.html
[22:51:31] <steveklabnik> alan_andrade: think "@post.to_yaml"
[22:51:56] <alan_andrade> ahhh I see
[22:52:07] <steveklabnik> great name
[22:52:45] <alan_andrade> yeah, very communicative...
[22:52:53] <hoverbear> Super descriptive
[22:52:53] <hoverbear> http://i.imgur.com/nFkNDg9.jpg
[22:53:07] <_achin> mrow
[22:53:57] <steveklabnik> http://tenderlovemaking.com/2013/02/06/yaml-f7u12.html <- pretty good, ACCURATE description of what happened
[22:54:02] <_achin> i wonder if someone could write a limited depickler in rust
[22:54:27] <_achin> (as a toy, not a production tool)
[22:56:21] <hoverbear> Gah this data mining course is annoying
[22:57:23] <alan_andrade> where are you taking it ?
[22:59:14] <hoverbear> alan_andrade: University of Victoria, BC
[23:00:24] <alan_andrade> for a moment I though it was an online thing.
[23:00:36] <alan_andrade> Well, are you even interested in data mining ?
[23:00:49] <hoverbear> alan_andrade: Yes very much so, this proff is just terrible
[23:01:03] <alan_andrade> I haaaate when that happens 
[23:01:14] <hoverbear> alan_andrade: Going in I had about an 8/10 interest level.
[23:01:15] <alan_andrade> It's a waste of time and money
[23:01:20] <hoverbear> It is, hugely so
[23:02:06] <alan_andrade> let me guess the teaching process
[23:02:12] <alan_andrade> slide after slide after slide
[23:02:16] <hoverbear> Not even
[23:03:51] <hoverbear> Comes to class, puts first slide up, spends most of the class on the board writing formulas (noting vectors as "bolds" instead of something sane), drawing diagrams etc that already are there in his slides... Ends class 10 minutes early because why the hell not.... Assigns homework with non-sensicle questions and no requirements eg "Implement Logistic Regression", yes, that was literally one of my questions on the last assignment.
[23:04:12] <hoverbear> Doesn't even reference or talk about the book which is apparently required
[23:04:50] <hoverbear> Responds to paragraph long email questions seeking clarification with "Yes"
[23:05:05] <alan_andrade> Oh damn !
[23:05:13] <hoverbear> Frankly I'd be tickled pink with slide after slide after slide
[23:05:52] <alan_andrade> It's frustrating
[23:06:18] <hoverbear> Yeah, and our midterm is tomorrow and yesterday he was like "Oh, yes, make sure to memorize all the formulas we've talked about since I won't give you any"
[23:06:31] <alan_andrade> "memorize"
[23:07:06] <alan_andrade> I don't think that's the best way to go for an engineer.
[23:07:08] <hoverbear> Memorize a bunch of arcane stats formulas I've never seen before and don't even know what half the variables mean since I've only implemented it in code, great.
[23:08:06] <alan_andrade> I really wish there was something you could do to make it better
[23:08:33] <hoverbear> alan_andrade: I was considering drinking a bottle of nyquil
[23:09:39] <hoverbear> alan_andrade: It's cool, as bad as this calss is next semester I'm totally thrilled about
[23:09:40] <alan_andrade> haha, I don't blame you, but I'd rather make it fun instead of just nil.
[23:10:43] <alan_andrade> Look at the good parts though, your with Rust ;)
