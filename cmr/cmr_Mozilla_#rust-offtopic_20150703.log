[00:02:42] <Elaine> what about it?

[00:03:43] <zacts> ah really?
[00:03:53] <zacts> what does that entail?
[00:03:58] <Elaine> yeah doing some dead-end stuff in cryptographic protocol analysis and unification

[00:04:06] <zacts> (a lame joke)
[00:04:10] <zacts> but yeah, oh cool
[00:04:16] <zacts> is it pretty math oriented?
[00:04:18] <Elaine> yes
[00:04:31] <Elaine> I'm an undergrad at Clarkson University, doing an REU at SUNY Potsdam this summer
[00:04:31] <zacts> I see, yeah... I've personally been working on math proofs and logic lately
[00:04:46] <zacts> thus why I probably have some of these symbolic math-like ideas floating around in my head

[03:06:05] <bstrie> I really couldn't care less what goes on at the rest of reddit, we're just there because their forum software is nice and free
[03:11:27] <Mutabah> And it does give some free publicity if a /r/rust post gets popular
[03:12:14] <bstrie> god no, that's a reason *not* to use reddit
[03:12:49] <bstrie> why would we ever want the /r/funny crowd to visit
[03:13:20] <bstrie> worst case scenario: reddit "dies" and goes back to the way it originally was, being just /r/programming and its satellites
[03:13:36] <bstrie> ~so okay with that~
[03:14:01] <bluss> the programming stuff isn't why reddit is interesting
[03:14:43] <bstrie> notably, none of my reddit front page has changed because I'm not subscribed to any of the shit subs, which seem to solely comprise the protesting subs

[03:20:38] <bstrie> WindowsBunny: there is no fallout 4 gossip, e3 came and blew its load, there's nothing more :P
[03:20:59] <bstrie> if you want I can come up with gossip here
[03:22:44] <bstrie> for example, did you know that you'll be able to swap out your dog for a radscorpion?
[03:22:44] <bstrie> it's true, I heard it from my friend who works at bethesda, or at least did before he was fired for leaking info from bethesda
[03:27:20] <niconii> did you know that they're adding a new stronger type of radscorpion above giant radscorpions?
[03:27:37] <niconii> they're called rad scorpions, they look like normal radscorpions except they have wicked shades on
[03:27:51] * WindowsBunny takes careful notes
[03:28:51] <niconii> also, in addition to super mutants, there will also be ones just called "mutants"
[03:29:09] <niconii> they look kinda like super mutants but they're just kinda wimpy and probably need to work out a bit
[03:29:21] <niconii> they've just kinda let themselves go really
[03:32:29] <Quxxy> niconii: I heard there was going to be a location where some mutants are trying to set up an "academy" for mutants, but it basically just degenerates into high school shenanigans, but with hideous skin lesions
[03:32:56] <Quxxy> Also, there's some bald guy or something, I dunno
[03:32:58] <bstrie> Quxxy: I heard they hired the author of Hatoful Boyfriend to write that story arc
[03:33:46] <Quxxy> Better him than the yandere sim dev :P
[03:33:52] <bstrie> also, despite suggestions to the contrary, Bethesda has confirmed that the game will be taking place in Boston, Kentucky, as they were unable to secure the licensing for Boston, Massachusetts

[03:57:24] <XMPPwocky> and then you could put .WAV files packed into map files (that's so mappers can use custom sounds), and they'd get loaded when you loaded the map...

[06:21:03] <Havvy> Thank you fmtq.
[06:21:25] <Havvy> bstrie:  The only one I'd really actually miss would be the Ask Me Anything one, ironically.
[06:21:43] <fmtq> I never go to reddit.
[06:21:48] <fmtq> I've been there several times for an AMA
[06:22:34] <bstrie> Havvy: and amusingly the AMA one didn't go dark out of protest, they just did it because they need a contact to do their jobs
[06:23:57] <Havvy> fmtq:  You're statements contradict each other. Also, you should at least read what's going on in /r/rust
[06:24:08] <fmtq> why
[06:24:18] <fmtq> your* 
[06:25:04] <Havvy> Your*, thanks.  Because there's usually good discussions about important things or newly released libraries.
[06:25:16] <fmtq> I don't use rust.
[06:25:27] <bstrie> Havvy: I think the implication is that AMA isn't reddit, and neither is /r/rust, which I consider to be a compliment :P

[06:26:29] <bstrie> horrifying
[06:26:37] <fmtq> writing a wrapper for a C++ library?
[06:26:39] <fmtq> in JNI?
[06:26:46] <fmtq> and then in ObjC++ and then in Swift?
[06:26:54] <fmtq> then coding the UIs for both for two separate OSes?
[06:26:59] <fmtq> WHAT IS PAINFUL ABOUT THIS I AM NOT SEEING IT
[06:27:33] <fmtq> I'm actually just getting paid for my knowledge of all those languages.
[06:27:35] <fmtq> lolol
[06:27:39] <bstrie> are you going from swift to objc++ to c++?
[06:27:43] <fmtq> no
[06:27:49] <fmtq> other direction, with pain.
[06:27:51] <bstrie> then why objc++
[06:27:57] <bstrie> why not just swift to C++
[06:27:58] <fmtq> is there a saner way?
[06:28:07] <fmtq> C++ to Swift.
[06:28:19] <bstrie> I don't understand why you'd have C++ calling swift
[06:28:26] <fmtq> I AM NOT HAVING THAT
[06:28:29] <fmtq> how are you not understanding me
[06:28:41] <bstrie> because you're making no sense? :P
[06:28:55] <fmtq> I have to interface C++ code from Swift.
[06:29:16] <fmtq> doing that cleanly and without losing my mind, as I understand it, is going to require some ObjC.
[06:29:23] <bstrie> so then make a C interface for the C++ library, which you'll need anyway for JNI
[06:29:33] <bstrie> surely swift doesn't need an objc shim just to call C code
[06:30:11] <fmtq> JNI supports C++ natively.
[06:30:22] <bstrie> I wasn't aware
[06:30:32] <bstrie> that also sounds horrible, I'll need to look into it
[06:30:52] <fmtq> it seems to commit unspeakable evil 
[06:33:00] <fmtq> btw bstrie: "You cannot import C++ code directly into Swift. Instead, create an Objective-C or C wrapper for C++ code."

[06:38:56] <bstrie> you're just supposed to design an "equivalent" set of java classes, but I have no idea how you verify equivalence
[06:39:51] <bstrie> like, it just maps Java's String to C++'s std::string automatically, who knows what else it's even doing
[06:45:14] <fmtq> HURRAY

[06:53:06] <amstrad> WindowsBunny: thought i had, must have missed that one
[06:53:22] <amstrad> which is a bit sad, Moo is one of the best id seen
[06:53:42] <amstrad> WindowsBunny: can i ask you about Fn() and Sync ?
[06:54:01] <amstrad> i know this is offtopic (as the topic is about rust )
[06:54:37] <amstrad> WindowsBunny: all im trying to do here is pass a Fn() between threads by way of a channel
[07:10:17] <amstrad> nevermind then
[07:16:38] <WindowsBunny> amstrad: ???
[07:17:09] <WindowsBunny> amstrad: If you want to send a trait object, you have to box it
[07:18:10] <amstrad> WindowsBunny: i have
[07:18:42] <WindowsBunny> amstrad: Also, it has to capture everything by value, not by reference
[07:18:54] <WindowsBunny> so you have to use the move keyword
[07:19:00] <amstrad> WindowsBunny: i have 	static xyz: (Sender<Box<Fn() + Send>>,  Receiver<Box<Fn() + Send>>) = channel();
[07:19:20] <amstrad> WindowsBunny: this is incorrect
[07:19:41] <WindowsBunny> Well you can have references
[07:19:44] <WindowsBunny> they just have to be 'static
[07:20:09] <amstrad> WindowsBunny: a static lifetime?
[07:20:34] <WindowsBunny> try doing...
[07:20:40] <WindowsBunny> Box<Fn() + Send + 'static>
[07:20:52] <amstrad> WindowsBunny: same issue
[07:21:00] <WindowsBunny> and what is teh issue?
[07:21:09] <WindowsBunny> *the
[07:21:28] <amstrad> src\main.rs:9:55: 9:64 error: the trait `core::marker::Sync` is not implemented
[07:21:29] <amstrad> for the type `core::cell::UnsafeCell<std::sync::mpsc::Flavor<Box<core::ops::Fn()
[07:21:31] <amstrad>  + Send>>>` [E0277]
[07:21:32] <amstrad> src\main.rs:9 
[07:22:17] <amstrad> WindowsBunny: that's with 'static btw
[07:22:40] <amstrad> static xyz: (Sender<Box<Fn() + Send + 'static>>, Receiver<Box<Fn() + Send + 'static>>) = channel();
[07:22:52] <WindowsBunny> amstrad: orite, Sender + Receiver are not Sync
[07:23:04] <WindowsBunny> so the issue is you can't shove them in a static :D
[07:23:19] <WindowsBunny> You'd have to synchronize access to them using a Mutex
[07:23:41] <amstrad> WindowsBunny: btw i shouldn't need to tho, im in a channel, i thought it was synchronize for me
[07:23:55] <amstrad> *btw - ' '
[07:24:03] <WindowsBunny> Each Sender/Receiver is not Sync
[07:24:11] <amstrad> whats the point of it then?
[07:24:14] <WindowsBunny> If you want multiple senders for example, you have to clone them
[07:24:20] <WindowsBunny> And each thread gets its own Sender
[07:24:40] <WindowsBunny> You can only have a single Receiver though, since it is an mpsc channel so single consumer
[07:24:47] <amstrad> hmmm
[07:24:55] <amstrad> geez Rust is a puzzle
[07:25:10] <amstrad> im not sure the logic you followed that lead you to the 'static lifetime
[07:25:26] <WindowsBunny> I don't think the 'static is needed
[07:25:28] <amstrad> which i believe i did use in some other example
[07:25:29] <WindowsBunny> since it is implied
[07:25:46] <amstrad> WindowsBunny: i think i did use 'static in some other example i wrote ages ago
[07:26:09] <WindowsBunny> amstrad: Each Sender/Receiver has an UnsafeCell with some stuff in it that it uses to send messages across the channel
[07:26:25] <WindowsBunny> it has no synchronization on that UnsafeCell, therefore it is not Sync
[07:26:47] <amstrad> WindowsBunny: i think conceptually, i have misunderstood channel
[07:26:51] <WindowsBunny> therefore a single Sender/Receiver cannot be used by multiple threads at the same time, such as in a static
[07:27:08] <WindowsBunny> a channel is used to transmit data from one or more Senders to a Receiver
[07:27:21] <amstrad> WindowsBunny: its crazy how Rust is able to work out that from what i have typed out there
[07:27:23] <WindowsBunny> channel() creates a Sender/Receiver pair, and you can clone the Sender as much as you want
[07:27:59] <WindowsBunny> Having Send and Sync in the type system allows Rust to statically verify a lot of things with regards to thread safety
[07:28:07] <amstrad> WindowsBunny: yeah, im familiar with cloning the Sender

[12:19:44] <Quxxy> ... I think you're missing the point here
[12:19:48] <Quxxy> If you do that, *all the macros disappear*
[12:20:02] <Quxxy> Which is kind of a problem when *so many* of the things in the API are really macros
[12:20:07] <Quxxy> *poof* there goes a chunk of your public API
[12:20:09] <benh> Can't you get a list of defined macros still
[12:20:14] <Tobba> Quxxy: oh
[12:20:16] <Quxxy> Yes
[12:20:29] <Quxxy> And because macros are completely arbitrary token sequences, clang doesn't even *try* to parse them
[12:20:34] <Quxxy> Which is why *I'm* parsing them
[12:20:40] <Quxxy> and trying to work out what to translate them to
[12:21:14] <Quxxy> None of which is relevant to the question of what string constants should be translated as :P

[12:49:18] <WindowsBunny> that's what I've been doing
[12:49:36] <Quxxy> I thought the deal was to just always take the Unicode path now
[12:49:52] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: all the UNICODE path is define shitty T versions of everything
[12:50:10] <WindowsBunny> It's better to just explicitly use the W or A version of something as you see fit
[12:50:51] <Quxxy> If it's a question of neatness over correctness, I'll defer
[12:51:19] <Quxxy> It shouldn't be *that* difficult since I'm already parsing the cc expressions and have a weird-ass custom evaluator

[12:53:57] <Quxxy> Well, the subset needed to cover most of the Windows headers, anyway
[12:54:11] <Quxxy> And, as such, it will probably be *highly* specific and hacky :P
[12:54:45] <mrmonday> I translate almost all macros incorrectly, because I haven't memorised C integer promotion rules, and all the macros I've needed to convert depend heavily on them, and support any integer type :<
[12:55:04] <Quxxy> Yeah, I'm being *very* conservative
[12:55:11] <mrmonday> lots of ugly/weird bit manipulation hacks
[12:55:38] <Quxxy> And, by and large, if a given expression is too hard, too weird, or only comes up infrequently, I'll just override the translation by hand
[12:55:44] <mrmonday> I've considered writing a c_integer_promotion!{} macro which automatically puts in the casts, never got around to it though

[12:57:02] <Quxxy> Having literal expression consts would help *a lot*
[12:57:28] <WindowsBunny> where const can be any integer type that the value can be represented in?
[12:57:51] <WindowsBunny> But wait, what if it is a negative integer literal, which needs to be used in places where an unsigned integer is expected
[12:57:53] <WindowsBunny> WHAT THEN?
[12:58:33] <Quxxy> What I had in mind was an actual *type* that can only show up as a literal or in a const
[12:58:44] <Quxxy> It has no width, and is basically just a BigInt
[12:59:05] <Quxxy> As soon as it "touches" any other integer type in an expression, the literal's type immediately coerces
[12:59:52] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: and what if it is negative and touches an unsigned integer type?
[13:00:03] <Quxxy> Well, what happens currently?
[13:00:31] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: I don't know because your idea hasn't been implemented yet :P
[13:01:01] <Quxxy> WindowsBunny: ... it's not a runtime type; the rules are equivalent to having an actual literal of the same value
[13:01:08] <Quxxy> It *has* to be folded at compile-time
[13:01:38] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: Right now I have to do -1i32 as u32;
[13:01:45] <Quxxy> There's your answer :)
[13:02:06] <kimundi> I had similar ideas as well. Basically get the compiler away from representing all integer literals as i64 internally :P

[18:11:12] <Tiffany> I think the trouble with "the" in company and site names is that company names have become proper nouns

[18:13:43] <Tiffany> "The Google Corporation", "Google, Inc."
[18:14:04] <zofrex> ", Inc." just sounds so much less threatening to me than "The X Corporation"
[18:14:15] <Tiffany> yeah, "Corporation" has taken on negative connotations
[18:14:29] <zofrex> probably because I spend more time watching terrible scifi movies than I do reading about companies
[18:14:46] <Tiffany> yeah, companies in dystopian scifi are always "The Corporation"
[18:14:50] <Tiffany> not "Bad Guys, Inc."
[18:14:56] <kristof> A corporation is a business which has become a legal entity in its own right, that's all

[18:15:15] <whipsch> bad guys, gmbh
[18:15:21] <niconii> brandonson: someone was let go from reddit or something, /r/AMA relied on them to handle AMAs, so they set the subreddit to private
[18:15:30] <zofrex> or something innocuous-sounding like "The Neodyne Corporation"
[18:15:36] <niconii> brandonson: then that sparked some reddit protest thing and lots of subreddits started doing it

[18:22:38] <kristof> In fact, nothing is evil.
[18:22:55] <niconii> zofrex: like there's just some specified date in the future where you just become evil
[18:23:15] <Tiffany> I believe turning evil is a standard outcome of a mid-life crisis
[18:23:41] <Tiffany> the number one motivation of supervillains is to make their mark on the world, in the form of a giant smoldering crater

[18:24:09] <niconii> "i sure liked donating to charity, but i guess burning down orphanages is fine too"

[18:36:01] <zofrex> hey, I have people skills! :(
[18:36:52] <niconii> i guess you could just build a robot army or something instead
[18:37:17] <niconii> and after someone knocks over asimo, i guess you can just surrender
[18:38:03] <kristof> the robot army fallacy
[18:38:45] <kristof> because people skills are so lucrative to business, anyone with people skills is more likely to have a bigger, better robot army *and* infrastructure than a person who does not have people skills
[18:38:45] <Tiffany> the control software to keep legged robots upright is already there
[18:39:00] <Tiffany> the main problem is, I imagine, getting motors with enough torque to respond to large disturbances

[18:47:20] <RC9> i had a psp version and i played it for days
[18:47:25] <RC9> well, play time
[18:49:28] <XMPPwocky> Less-well-known things I'm very proud that rust shipped 1.0 without:
[18:49:28] <XMPPwocky> a shared root namespace
[18:49:32] <XMPPwocky> MACROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOS
[18:55:22] <RC9> to be fair it has a shared toplevel namespace :P
[18:55:52] <Elaine> RC9: it's not shared
[18:56:04] <XMPPwocky> RC9: i think the point is you can't tell if you're in the root ns or in a sub-module
[18:56:07] <XMPPwocky> without using :: obviously
[18:56:14] <XMPPwocky> and even that's per crate
[18:56:19] <Elaine> right, it's per-crate.
[18:56:25] <Elaine> no crates share ::
[18:56:34] <Elaine> (except via macros ugh)
[18:56:39] <XMPPwocky> Rust's packaging system is a crate idea.
[18:56:41] <XMPPwocky> oh god i'm so sorry
[18:56:46] <Elaine> lol that's awesome
[18:56:58] <RC9> by that
[18:57:00] <RC9> i meant
[18:57:07] <RC9> you can name as many crates as you like
[18:57:10] <RC9> "nmath" or whatever
[18:57:22] <RC9> and theyre all in "nmath" namespace
[18:57:28] <RC9> as far as i know anyway
[18:57:43] <XMPPwocky> they can't refer to themselves by their crate name
[18:57:46] <Elaine> I'm not sure what you're trying to say
[18:57:50] <RC9> well
[18:57:55] <XMPPwocky> crates that *import* them can pick exactly one crate to call "nmath"
[18:58:02] <XMPPwocky> others can be imported as different names
[18:58:06] <XMPPwocky> it's not going to merge the crates
[18:58:12] <RC9> hm, i should go find what i read
[18:58:43] <zofrex> RC9: true story, at the end of high school I created a website for people to upload their prom photos. It exploded in popularity, I added galleries, commenting, it started spreading to other schools... and then I went "naw I don't think this idea has legs, I'm gonna can it to keep working on building a new bug tracker"

[18:59:39] <Elaine> Anyone in the Vegas area? I think Astrum was...
[18:59:40] <RC9> oh i know
[18:59:55] <RC9> i think it was about the crates.io not having namespaces? maybe
[19:00:03] <Elaine> oh yeah crates.io doesn't have namespacing
[19:01:00] <RC9> i have however seen the comical "expected type xy::zz, found a different type xy::zz"
[19:01:09] <XMPPwocky> RC9: the "different" there is new
[19:01:10] <RC9> i forget what causes that
[19:01:22] <XMPPwocky> RC9: two different versions of a crate, usually
[19:01:23] <Elaine> different versions of crates
[19:01:30] <RC9> yeah that would have been my guess
[19:01:31] <XMPPwocky> and you try to use types from one where the other was expected
[19:01:39] <XMPPwocky> leading to you questioning your sanity
