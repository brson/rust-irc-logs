[21:56:09] <nrc> rustc performance tracking: http://www.ncameron.org/perf-rustc/
[21:56:23] <nrc> please try it and let me know any bugs you find or features you'd like
[21:57:44] <nrc> Please report here: https://github.com/nrc/rustc-perf/issues
[22:01:55] <Tobba> nrc: seems to be something off with... I think it's html5ever (it assigned dodgy colors)
[22:02:05] <Tobba> the latest data point is zer0
[22:02:26] <nrc> Tobba: yeah, I think the version I'm benchmarking no longer builds
[22:02:33] <nrc> I should update the benchmark
[22:02:51] <Tobba> I guess it's due to the graphing library filling in the last point implicitly
[22:02:56] <arielb1> nrc: what's the regression at May 13?
[22:03:34] <Tobba> coincidentally, the graph also grinds my machine to a halt
[22:04:28] <arielb1> nrc: what are the dates?
[22:04:32] <arielb1> could they be matched by commits?
[22:05:29] <nrc> arielb1: I'm not sure, I haven't tracked any particular regressions/improvements
[22:05:52] <arielb1> rustc performance seems awfully noisey
[22:05:53] <nrc> arielb1: yes, I have the commit data for each pull, not sure how to expose it in the UI
[22:06:09] <arielb1> put the commit hash in the tooltip at least
[22:07:16] <nrc> it's impossible to copy out of the tooltips though, so I'm not sure how useful that is
[22:07:25] <arielb1> its only 8 characters
[22:07:27] <arielb1> or so
[22:07:49] <nrc> I guess
[22:07:56] <nrc> I was thinking of the whole hash
[22:08:00] <nrc> which is unnecessary
[22:09:05] <arielb1> why is there 10% noise?
[22:09:14] <arielb1> is this a shared machine?
[22:09:55] <arielb1> there seems to be a definite regression around May 13
[22:10:16] <nrc> no dedicated machine, not sure about the noise
[22:10:33] <arielb1> amazon?
[22:10:42] <nrc> it was doing builds, now it sleeps for a few hours between builds, might improve the accuracy
[22:10:55] <nrc> nope, and actual physical server sat under a desk in MV
[22:11:00] <nrc> *an
[22:12:11] <arielb1> I had leaving a desktop on give me that kind of jank
[22:12:48] <nrc> There is no GUI etc., shouldn't be as bad as desktop

[22:41:47] <eddyb> the perf thing doesn't load for me :/
[22:41:50] <eddyb> but I WANT IT

[22:43:07] <eddyb> thanks!
[22:43:39] <eddyb> Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: Cannot read property 'sort' of undefined
[22:43:47] <eddyb> (omg uncaught promise errors :D)
[22:44:04] <eddyb> (leaked exceptions in JS promises was my biggest issue a long time ago)
[22:49:20] <eddyb> response.body.state === "errored", huh
[22:52:11] <eddyb> nrc: you depend on promises being implemented in the browser? with no polyfills?

[23:36:39] <nrc> I forget people don't use nightly versions of browsers
[23:37:25] <nrc> eddyb: could we not move ast_map into its own crate - I think erickt tried that a while back
[23:37:41] <nrc> I approve of moving it out of libsyntax, but librustc gettting bigger is sad
[23:38:03] <eddyb> nrc: it wouldn't help to put it in a separate crate since librustc would just depend on that crate
[23:38:10] * eddyb shrugs
[23:38:31] <eddyb> nrc: but do those nightly versions agree between themselves :P?
[23:38:49] <eddyb> I don't even know what breaks in this case, it's just that the text you get back is empty
[23:41:33] <nrc> eddyb: from the server logs, it looks like a bad date
[23:41:46] <nrc> error handing could be better :-p
[23:42:38] <eddyb> I didn't touch anything
[23:42:45] <eddyb> that's just how it started
[23:42:53] <eddyb> CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in src/librustc/middle/traits/mod.rs
[23:43:05] <eddyb> I've forgotten how fun rebasing is
[23:43:43] <nrc> oh, hmm, that's odd
[23:44:00] <eddyb> nrc: I've force pushed because I was missing something, so now the ast_map PR is not r+'d. your choice :)
[23:44:55] <nrc> heh, keep the r+, it is definitely an improvement
[23:50:06] <eddyb> nrc, Tobba: fun fact: cmr tried for ages and couldn't get rustc to behave deterministically for huon's IRSY
[23:50:27] <eddyb> the graph would be one of a few possible states, even with pinned /dev/urandom and whatnot
[23:50:45] <eddyb> now it may be feasible to run it under rr and compare traces, if that's at all possible
[23:50:59] <eddyb> I/O performance might also skew the graphs
[23:51:44] <eddyb> (I'd recommend ramdisk for that. and, well, enough RAM for rustc to never swap)
