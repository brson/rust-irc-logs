[05:39:27] <niconii> no problem, i think aatch went a bit overboard as well
[05:41:38] <niconii> anyway, it's better form to explain why you don't like something, i think
[05:42:09] <niconii> sometimes you end up learning something instead
[05:43:30] <c74d> mm, I'm certainly averse to claiming that something or other is *bad* without constructive or at least specific criticism.
[05:44:14] <c74d> …I'm surprised, but I think that having been helped to realize that I was (blatantly) wrong all along may help me get over my usual pride issues and slink back.
[05:44:19] <c74d> (thanks!)
[05:44:27] <niconii> no problem!

[11:12:43] <mrmonday> I'd go one further and shoot anyone using javascript
[11:12:49] <mrmonday> as far as I can tell there is no reason to use it
[11:13:02] <mrmonday> since there are a thousand better languages which will compile down to it
[11:13:09] <Quxxy> Oh, and anyone promoting that hateful abomination previously known as Metro
[11:13:28] <mrmonday> with magic code maps so that debugging works, and such
[11:13:44] <Quxxy> Writing Metro "app"s in Javascript?  Set on fire, *then* shot
[11:14:13] <mrmonday> I kinda like metro, I feel like what's in Windows 8 is incomplete though
[11:14:37] <Quxxy> mrmonday: It's a moronic idea badly executed
[11:14:38] <mrmonday> it's pretty much jut scaled up Windows phone, like they hadn't figured it out properly yet
[11:14:55] <Quxxy> I could go about it at length
[11:15:11] <Quxxy> *go on about it
[11:15:22] <Quxxy> such lengths, wow, much hate
[11:17:13] <mrmonday> I think the ideas are all there personally
[11:17:17] <mrmonday> just terribly executed
[11:17:28] <Quxxy> You think only being able to launch one copy of a program is a good idea?
[11:17:38] <Quxxy> That having no distinction between different content areas is a good idea?
[11:17:41] <mrmonday> "just terribly executed"
[11:17:47] <Quxxy> That not being able to tell WHICH WINDOW IS FOCUSED is a good idea?
[11:18:11] <Quxxy> As far as I can tell, *those* aspects are all working as-intended
[11:18:33] <mrmonday> afaict Windows 10 is pretty close to getting it right, but I haven't actually played around with it to know
[11:18:43] <Quxxy> I've *been using* Windows 10
[11:18:48] <Quxxy> That's what I'm basing my opinion on
[11:18:59] <mrmonday> it doesn't affect me all that much tbh, since I don't use Windows [and when I do, all my apps are desktop apps anyway...]
[11:19:17] <Quxxy> I'm *talking about* the Desktop apps
[11:19:32] <Quxxy> They're replacing all the old-school ones that worked properly with shitty Metro garbage
[11:19:43] <Quxxy> The old "oh, you can just ignore it" line doesn't apply any more
[11:19:56] <Tobba> I'm not sure if Metro is a terribly moronic idea
[11:20:01] <Tobba> it's just very, very badly executed
[11:20:15] <mrmonday> probably a combination
[11:20:19] <bstrie> so if apple is willing to come out with swift 2.0 only a year after swift 1.0, that means we have precedent to break compat in 2016
[11:20:20] <zofrex> Quxxy: it makes me sad that you can't navigate with the keyboard :(
[11:20:24] <Quxxy> Tobba: As before, see the three examples I gave above; how are those badly executed when they're explicit design goals?
[11:20:36] <zofrex> that was always a staple of Windows for me
[11:20:44] <Quxxy> zofrex: Tell me about it
[11:21:00] <mrmonday> bstrie: I wouldn't follow Apple's lead in terms of backwards compatability... they break things with literally every release of their OSes
[11:21:09] <Quxxy> At least with Explorer they only broke a decade of muscle memory; at least keyboard navigation still works... kinda
[11:21:14] <Tobba> Quxxy: I'd assume the idea is to provide some more modern looking UI design and integrate it better with their phone OSes
[11:21:27] <Tobba> the fact that it doesn't integrate well with *anything* and sucks horsecocks is an implementation details
[11:21:28] <mrmonday> it's a PITA if you're developing for iOS/OS X when you have to fix your code every time Apple pushes an update
[11:21:33] <zofrex> for me I learned because 3.11 and 95 didn't always have the mouse working when you first installed them... but despite that not being relevant anymore, it makes me sad because it hints that accessibility has gone out the Window
[11:21:37] <Tobba> implementation detail*
[11:21:40] <Quxxy> Tobba: Again, how is that relevant to basic usability concerns with the fundamental design ethos?
[11:21:55] <bstrie> mrmonday: it just means that developers are inured to it
[11:22:00] <Tobba> I guess it depends on where you draw the line between ideas and implementation details
[11:22:20] <Quxxy> Implementation details are system search being broken if the taskbar is on the right side of the screen
[11:22:33] <bstrie> mrmonday: today I talked to folks using rust at dropbox and I was like "how do you feel about this potential breaking language change" and they are like "lol, things break, whatever"
[11:22:35] <mrmonday> something which I'd advocate against
[11:22:36] <Quxxy> "Let's make everything a single, flat colour with nothing to distinguish different areas" is a design idea
[11:23:15] <mrmonday> it's a tough line to draw, I think
[11:23:19] <Tobba> hey, flat design looks really good when not done by a moron
[11:23:24] <Quxxy> As is "let's replace buttons with text, which is not uniquely distinguished from other text in any way"
[11:23:32] <Tobba> (and is usable)
[11:23:49] <mrmonday> I really hope we don't end up in C++ land where nothing is ever allowed to break so you have to bolt things on to the sides
[11:23:53] <mrmonday> or, even worse, what D has
[11:24:07] <mrmonday> where "nothing is allowed to break" so everything gets bolted onto the sides
[11:24:08] <Quxxy> Oh goody, another pet hate
[11:24:14] <mrmonday> and yet everything still breaks
[11:24:18] <Quxxy> mrmonday: Were you there for the 1.0->2.0 debacle? :P
[11:24:23] <mrmonday> yuuupp
[11:24:25] <Quxxy> Or the Tangopocalypse
[11:24:34] <mrmonday> I started just as Tango was peaking I think
[11:24:45] <mrmonday> D1/Tango was my lang/stdlib of choice
[11:24:50] <Quxxy> Ditto
[11:25:00] <mrmonday> pretty sure we've talked before, many moons ago
[11:25:05] <Quxxy> $PERSON flushed *so* much goodwill down the toilet
[11:25:14] <Quxxy> To this day, I *still* can't believe how that went down
[11:25:48] <zwarich> bstrie: I think Swift 1.x also broke backcompat with 1.0 in some cases
[11:25:51] <zwarich> could be wrong
[11:26:02] <Quxxy> mrmonday: Does the name... "amber" mean anything to you? :P
[11:26:20] <mrmonday> yep
[11:26:25] <Quxxy> :D
[11:26:29] * Quxxy fistbumps mrmonday
[11:26:38] <mrmonday> followed that for a while, shame it fizzled out
[11:26:41] <Quxxy> Yeah
[11:27:09] <mrmonday> after a huge amount of work went into it too
[11:27:22] <Quxxy> I think my contributions to it ended up being Uncle Buildy, oat and work on the C backend
[11:27:44] <mrmonday> I don't remember if/how much I contributed to Amber
[11:27:57] <mrmonday> if I did it will only have been minor I think
[11:28:35] <mrmonday> I'm glad Rust turned up, otherwise I'd still be playing the D game and spending all my time working on the compiler rather than writing code
[11:29:01] <Quxxy> mrmonday: I ended up losing interest in D entirely
[11:29:10] <Quxxy> It didn't help that I got *super* burned by the 2.0 changeover
[11:29:17] <mrmonday> it's got a soft spot in my heart, and always will
[11:29:27] <Quxxy> and I no longer trusted the ruling cabal
[11:29:32] <mrmonday> was the first compiled language I learned (before C/C++/Java even)
[11:29:38] <Quxxy> :D
[11:30:01] <mrmonday> only learned C and C++ when I hit compiler bugs every few hundred lines of code :p
[11:30:15] <Quxxy> Oh, I had a *great* one
[11:30:28] <Quxxy> I actually got dmd to emit an unterminated string constant into static data
[11:30:33] <Quxxy> Wait no
[11:30:51] <Quxxy> It was... it was like the variable ended up pointing at the wrong part of the static data segment
[11:31:01] <Quxxy> So the contents came out as gibberish

[11:32:12] <eddyb> Quxxy: if I had to pick between cmake and autotools...
[11:32:21] <eddyb> I would burn them both to the ground
[11:32:29] <eddyb> and just compile Qt with Cargo or something
[11:32:54] <Quxxy> eddyb: I'd do what I did with Amber: write a Python script smart enough to do it all *properly* on any platform
[11:32:59] <mrmonday> ugh, build systems are the worst
[11:33:02] <Quxxy> With no configuration
[11:33:04] <zofrex> speaking of javascript hate and backward compat changes did anyone follow the Angular 2.0 debacle?
[11:33:19] <Quxxy> "You want this thing built?  *You got it.*"
[11:33:28] <eddyb> Quxxy: I wanted to build afl
[11:33:37] <eddyb> Quxxy: it doesn't even have a configure file
[11:33:53] <eddyb> the Makefile does some simple checks
[11:33:55] <eddyb> that's all
[11:34:02] <eddyb> no need to check all 20 million headers
[11:34:10] <eddyb> for functions you don't even use
[11:34:28] <eddyb> I personally love hand-written Makefiles, while they're still cute and simple
[11:34:51] <Quxxy> eddyb: You mean, it doesn't detect if you're running on a 1992 build of Solaris with EBDIC character set more than eight degrees north of the equator on a Wednesday in June?

[11:38:14] <zofrex> Quxxy: s'like all the VMS support in OpenSSL
[11:38:42] <Quxxy> bstrie: Executive summary: a massive breaking change that meant you more or less had to rewrite code
[11:39:10] <Quxxy> Tango (the alternative and much better designed, more extensive, better tested *and more efficient* standard library) not being ported
[11:39:40] <Quxxy> Language design guided by "whoever is physically close enough to Walter to buy him coffee and is named Andrei"
[11:39:54] <Quxxy> And when not that, by Walter comically misunderstanding a feature, then implementing it before anyone realises
[11:40:20] <Quxxy> A complete dismissal of any concerns that Walter and Andrei have not personally experienced... until they *do* when it's suddenly a huge priority
[11:40:59] <Quxxy> And, finally, a very public, very stupid and completely indefensible spat between the core team and the Tango devs over something trivial
[11:41:17] <Quxxy> Leading to a lot of really good people just walking away in disgust
[11:41:30] <Quxxy> Which all, more or less, happened around the same time
[11:42:01] <eddyb> fun
[11:42:03] <Quxxy> For me personally, there was one other: finding out that a project I'd sunk years into was fundamentally crippled by D's own language-level features not being compatible with each other
[11:42:12] <eddyb> Rust 2.0 should never happen without automatic translation of most code out there
[11:42:38] <Quxxy> So long as the core team doesn't end up spitting in the face of their users, they should do fine
[11:43:02] <Quxxy> bstrie: Hope you enjoyed that, I feel really angry now
[11:43:05] <Quxxy> I need a hot chocolate
[11:43:07] <Quxxy> Or a biscuit
[11:45:29] <mrmonday> go with both!
[11:45:41] <eddyb> I need to start writing that ELF spec
[11:45:47] <Quxxy> No biscuits
[11:45:48] <eddyb> now that I know how to use generator comprehensions
[11:46:00] <mrmonday> Quxxy: nice excuse for a walk to the shops
[11:46:10] <Quxxy> mrmonday: I don't think you appreciate where I am at the moment
[11:46:15] <mrmonday> bit of fresh air to clear the anger out
[11:46:22] <Quxxy> Also, it's nearly 10 PM
[11:46:31] <Quxxy> It's probably close to zero out there
[11:46:46] <Quxxy> And a minimum... hour's walk one way?  Maybe more
[11:46:55] <mrmonday> ah, I've lived the past few years as a student in a city with 24 hour shops
[11:47:04] <Quxxy> Lucky bastard

[11:47:53] <mrmonday> aah, that'd do it
[11:47:54] <eddyb> wait, Quxxy is an aussie?
[11:48:03] <eddyb> TIL
[11:48:27] <Quxxy> eddyb: You mean you couldn't tell from my incredibly thick accent, old chap?
[11:48:39] <mrmonday> we're just getting a glimpse of summer just now in Scotland
[11:49:33] <mrmonday> bstrie: I'd add to what Quxxy said: there's basically zero chance of what happened to D happening with Rust, in case that wasn't obvious
[11:50:08] * Quxxy laughs
[11:50:20] <Quxxy> I just remembered why D 2.0 has keywords starting with '@'
[11:50:28] <Quxxy> That's always good for a laugh
[11:50:29] <eddyb> mrmonday: who are you kidding
[11:50:34] <eddyb> mrmonday: we're all jerks
[11:50:39] <eddyb> FUCK YOU COMMUNITY
[11:50:48] <eddyb> inb4 cmr kicks me out
[11:50:49] <Quxxy> eddyb: <3 u 2
[11:50:53] <eddyb> because whistleblowing
[11:51:10] *** Quits: dpc (dpc@moz-t6gr4b.ca.comcast.net) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[11:51:29] <eddyb> now I suddenly feel like trying to play a song on a whistle. it's a good thing I don't have one nearby
[11:51:38] <eddyb> so I said something about ELF
[11:51:55] <mrmonday> eddyb: even if the entire core team /were/ jerks, it couldn't happen
[11:52:20] <mrmonday> Quxxy: @nothrow pure @safe, wait what.
[11:52:25] <eddyb> Tobba: array: [for i in 0..length { T @ base + i * size }]
[11:52:35] <Quxxy> mrmonday: You're forgetting the best one: @property
[11:52:56] <eddyb> mrmonday: IME, if they really are, they're good at hiding it
[11:52:57] <mrmonday> haaaa
[11:53:06] <eddyb> mrmonday: which would make them psychopaths?
[11:53:21] <eddyb> but really, they're a nice bunch of people
[11:53:28] <mrmonday> I love that they decided @property is terrible, but refused to fix it
[11:53:43] <mrmonday> "we have unnamed corporate interests who won't let us"
[11:53:44] <Quxxy> I love the reason @property happened *at all*
[11:54:03] <eddyb> Tobba: array: [for i in 0..length { T @ base + i * sizeof T }] if you happen to have something saner
[11:54:11] <mrmonday> why did it happen? I wasn't paying attention
[11:54:16] <Quxxy> Oh
[11:54:17] <eddyb> Tobba: okay, that's a bit long :/
[11:54:18] <Quxxy> OH!
[11:54:20] <mrmonday> methods that return function pointers?
[11:54:21] <Quxxy> Hang on, I have to make coffee first
[11:54:26] <mrmonday> or delegates
[11:54:41] <mrmonday> which are impossible to handle nicely if you don't care what callable thing you're getting
[11:55:53] <eddyb> Tobba: so maybe there should be syntax for plain-old arrays
[11:56:05] <eddyb> Tobba: array: [T; length] @ base for the last one
[11:56:13] <eddyb> Tobba: but that's *syntax sugar*
[11:56:20] <eddyb> okay, I am happy now :D
[11:56:38] <eddyb> Tobba: array: [for i in 0..length { T @ i * size }] @ base for the first one, actually
[11:56:45] <mrmonday> oh, wait, I guess you can handle them nicely actually with auto foo(T)(T something) if (isCallable!T) { } or so
[11:56:57] <mrmonday> replacing with static if for D1 obviously
[11:57:20] <eddyb> mrmonday: I actually thought about s/where/if in Rust
[11:57:23] <eddyb> it would be pretty
[11:57:40] <eddyb> impl<T> Eq for (T, T) if T: Eq
[11:58:11] <eddyb> and it would allow things that look weird with `where`
[11:58:25] <mrmonday> I'd want fall CTFE there if "if" were allowed
[11:58:33] <mrmonday> s/allowed/used/
[11:58:44] <eddyb> well, me too
[11:58:49] <mrmonday> just for consistency with if
[11:58:50] <eddyb> we're not that far off, actually
[11:58:56] <Tobba> eddyb: are you trying to invent new array syntax
[11:59:00] <eddyb> just needs some infrastructure work
[11:59:01] <eddyb> Tobba: no
[11:59:10] <mrmonday> oh yeah, I read about a sentence about some const fn thing, what's that all about?
[11:59:10] <eddyb> Tobba: this is for that arbitrary binary file format thing
[11:59:20] <eddyb> Tobba: I need something more general than arrays
[11:59:22] <Tobba> oh
[12:00:07] <eddyb> Tobba: also, reloc_sections: [for section in sections { if section.kind == RELOC { section } }]
[12:00:14] <Quxxy> mrmonday: Ok
[12:00:16] <Quxxy> Back
[12:00:21] <Quxxy> Here's how it happened:
[12:00:30] * mrmonday grabs popcorn
[12:00:36] <Quxxy> "Hey, Python has this cool thing where you can annotate functions and classes with extra information!
[12:00:40] <Quxxy> "Java has something similar.
[12:00:55] <Quxxy> "It'd be awfully neat if we could attach metadata to functions and stuff.
[12:01:18] <bombless_> hmm like doc comments?
[12:01:23] <Quxxy> "It'd *also* gives us a chance to distinguish between 0- and 1-arity methods that are callable as properties and those that aren't.
[12:01:27] * bombless_ grabs popcorn
[12:01:29] *** Quits: EduardoBautista (sid51042@moz-js96ql.highgate.irccloud.com) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[12:01:30] <Quxxy> "In Python, they do that using @property.
[12:01:38] <Quxxy> "(Just as a single example of the idea)
[12:01:49] <Quxxy> "Can we get Python-style annotations?"
[12:02:04] <Quxxy> (months of cajoling pass)
[12:02:16] <Quxxy> Walter: "Ok, I'll add @property as a keyword in the language that doesn't do anything."
[12:02:21] <nerdopoly> They're decorators and they work extremely different to Java.
[12:02:32] <bombless_> reminds me of objc
[12:02:36] <Quxxy> "Wait, that's not what we asked for *at all*.  That completely misses the whole point and introduces an almost totally pointless feature!"
[12:02:42] <Quxxy> "Sorry, too late; people depend on it now; can't be changed."
[12:02:43] <bombless_> which use @ for keywords if I understand correctly
[12:02:52] <mrmonday> oh wow
[12:02:56] <eddyb> Tobba: relocs: [for section in reloc_sections { ..[Rel; section.count] @ section.offset }]
[12:03:00] <Quxxy> Walter: "I guess this means I can use @ for *other* keywords, too!"
[12:03:00] <mrmonday> that's worse than I thought
[12:03:01] <mrmonday> ahaha
[12:03:04] <Quxxy> "Like @safe!"
[12:03:12] <Quxxy> "It won't even break any code!  This is a *brilliant* idea!"
[12:03:15] <eddyb> Tobba: something like that, anyways :D
[12:03:19] <Quxxy> [Entire D community]: *facepalm*
[12:03:30] <bombless_> &@ownded
[12:03:42] <mrmonday> doesn't D have UDAs that use @ now too?
[12:03:47] <bombless_> yes we can use @ instead of &own to represent that
[12:03:51] <mrmonday> how long until there's another namespace for keywords? :3
[12:03:52] * bombless_ runs
[12:03:55] <Tobba> eddyb: :D
[12:04:03] <eddyb> bombless_: references are the wrong abstraction
[12:04:22] <eddyb> bombless_: Own<'a, T> and OwnIn<T, Heap>
[12:04:24] <eddyb> or something like that
[12:04:39] <eddyb> where Own<'a, T> = OwnIn<T, Stack<'a>>
[12:05:01] <eddyb> Tobba: I think @ offset is bad
[12:05:14] <Quxxy> mrmonday: And now you know why I find @property in D so funny
[12:05:18] <eddyb> Tobba: maybe it should be a "goto"-style prefix directive
[12:05:38] <Tobba> sounds good
[12:05:39] <eddyb> Tobba: since this is after all just moving a cursor around and reading data :P
[12:05:49] <Tobba> well yeah
[12:05:59] <eddyb> it has to be lazy and iterator-based
[12:06:07] <mrmonday> Quxxy: yeah, that's far worse than I realised
[12:06:08] <eddyb> random access iterators would also get an Index impl
[12:06:12] <eddyb> and .len
[12:06:58] <eddyb> Tobba: and then I have to do this for all binary file formats and write a common API for them all
[12:07:09] <eddyb> err
[12:07:13] <mrmonday> have they started implementing "Rust has these cool lifetime things, we can kinda do it using this small tweak" thing yet?
[12:07:16] <eddyb> Tobba: all object file formats
[12:07:17] <Tobba> eddyb: will you support "unsized" things?
[12:07:21] <Quxxy> mrmonday: Do you know what
[12:07:23] <Quxxy> They kinda *have*
[12:07:27] <eddyb> Tobba: depends what you mean by that
[12:07:35] <Tobba> eddyb: things you have to read to determine the size of
[12:07:35] <mrmonday> haaa
[12:07:36] <bombless_> lifetime is from cyclone tho
[12:07:37] <Quxxy> They're going to allow returning refs
[12:07:40] <nerdopoly> I'm a bit lost.  What's everyone talking about?
[12:07:48] <Quxxy> But it's basically *only* for the case where Rust does lifetime inference
[12:07:51] <eddyb> Tobba: that's what "size" above is :D
[12:07:57] <bombless_> borrow checker is unique for Rust
[12:07:58] <mrmonday> nerdopoly: lots of things, but the bits you're lost at are probably about D
[12:08:12] <eddyb> Tobba: the size of each section or segment descriptor is encoded inside the ELF
[12:08:17] <eddyb> Tobba: to allow later extensions
[12:08:21] <Tobba> oh yeah
[12:08:28] <Tobba> still
[12:08:29] <eddyb> that's why I need comprehensions :P
[12:08:50] <mrmonday> I really don't get what they're trying to do with D
[12:09:16] <mrmonday> I thought they'd settled on "TDPL is what D is until D3, let's get that implemented", but apparently not
[12:09:27] <mrmonday> have they even finished implementing TDPL yet?
[12:09:47] <mrmonday> like last time I looked they hadn't even started on getting their core threading stuff implemented as the book describes it
[12:09:59] <Quxxy> mrmonday: *snort* really?
[12:10:05] <Quxxy> Did they at *least* fix the GC?
[12:11:16] <mrmonday> yeah, last time I looked "shared" was just a placeholder and didn't do any of the fencing/locking/whatever that it's meant to do
[12:11:32] <mrmonday> I know they've been doing a lot of work on the GC
[12:11:38] <mrmonday> but that doesn't necessarily mean anything
[12:11:59] <eddyb> what's TDPL?
[12:12:01] <Quxxy> That was the problem with my project: the GC doesn't function in the presence of associative arrays
[12:12:11] <mrmonday> they've seemingly ignored the concurrent and precise GCs that people have written as far as I can gather - just sticking with the mark+sweep with slight improvements
[12:12:23] <mrmonday> eddyb: "The D Programming Language"
[12:12:30] <mrmonday> K&R for D basically
[12:12:36] <eddyb> Tobba: do you have an example of what you mean?
[12:12:55] <eddyb> mrmonday: oh, implementing the feature set described in TDPL
[12:12:59] <eddyb> makes sense
[12:13:00] <mrmonday> Quxxy: seriously? fantastic
[12:13:08] <Quxxy> Oh yeah
[12:13:13] <Quxxy> Well, it's a *conservative* GC, right?
[12:13:27] <Quxxy> And the AA implementation stores the key hashes in the tree
[12:13:28] <mrmonday> oh yeah, missed that word off the list
[12:13:37] <eddyb> D at least has something going for it, similar to Nim actually
[12:13:43] <eddyb> Go on the other hand (heh)
[12:13:46] <mrmonday> there is a precise GC which can probably handle it, I haven't looked though
[12:13:56] <eddyb> could Nim replace D?
[12:14:06] <Quxxy> And as your heap size goes up, the probability of a random hash key being indistinguishable from a *pointer into the GC heap* goes up
[12:14:07] <eddyb> I wouldn't mind it personally, though the syntax is... odd
[12:14:12] <Tobba> eddyb: for example uh
[12:14:13] <mrmonday> I don't know enough about Nim to say
[12:14:15] <Quxxy> Until you finally cross The Line
[12:14:20] <Tobba> eddyb: file formats where you need to read until a certain thing
[12:14:23] <Quxxy> At which point, you just leak memory forever until you run out of address space
[12:14:26] <eddyb> Quxxy: LEL
[12:14:32] <eddyb> Tobba: OH
[12:14:33] <mrmonday> the biggest/best thing about D is its compile time power, which I believe Nim does better anyway
[12:14:35] <eddyb> Tobba: like C strings
[12:14:41] <eddyb> scanning
[12:14:41] <Tobba> oh, yeah
[12:15:00] <eddyb> let me think about it, since I might need it as well :)
[12:15:01] <Tobba> not just that though, I was referring to things where you need to read a bunch of things to find out how big something will actually be
[12:15:07] <Quxxy> I've never seen two language-level features that had such an apocalyptically awful interaction
[12:15:15] <mrmonday> also, being able to compile quarter of a million lines of code in a couple of seconds is pretty sweet
[12:15:20] <Quxxy> The best part?  The AA implementation *depends* on GC to work
[12:15:35] <Quxxy> It has never, and *cannot*, function as it exists
[12:16:12] <mrmonday> though if you make proper use of the compile time power you can't compile that fast at all, so...

[12:34:38] <eddyb> is it a new forum post?
[12:34:44] <eddyb> fuck yes
[12:34:52] <eddyb> who's in sfbay?
[12:34:53] <Tiffany> it's the new talk happening tomorrow, and one we're going to get a video of
[12:35:40] <eddyb> a Rust person should go there and get the collaboration story going
[12:35:54] <eddyb> I want rustc to be the second compiler after clang to emit Mill code
[12:36:28] <eddyb> I want examples of idiomaitic iterator code being turned into supercharged speculative vector loops
[12:36:40] <eddyb> idiomatic even
[12:37:37] <Tobba> I've been getting really bad output from LLVM lately
[12:37:41] <Tiffany> I wonder how fast the mill can do chacha
[12:38:08] <eddyb> the answer to that is probably "very" :D
[12:38:17] <eddyb> a block every few cycles
[12:38:30] <eddyb> well, on Gold you might get that
[12:38:35] <Tiffany> it's 320 operations, and you can only really do 4 at a time in parallel
[12:38:38] <eddyb> the lower-end stuff would take longer
[12:38:41] <eddyb> Tiffany: is it really?
[12:38:47] <Tiffany> on a 4x4 state matrix
[12:38:56] <Tiffany> well, 320 applications of the round primitive, iirc
[12:39:01] <Tobba> eddyb: yeah uh, there's 4 operations per round, and the operation itself can't really be parallelized too well
[12:39:10] <Tobba> I think you can do 2 things per clock there
[12:39:20] <Tobba> but, you can do multiple blocks at once, the Mill might shine there
[12:39:27] <eddyb> I don't know the exact scheduling model
[12:39:29] <eddyb> Tobba: oh, right
[12:39:35] <eddyb> that was where the parallelism came in
[12:39:48] <Tiffany> 20 rounds, 4 round primitives per round, and then each round primitive is +=, ^=, and <<<=
[12:40:12] <Tiffany> doing multiple blocks at once only increases performance if your messages are longer than 64 bytes
[12:40:48] <Tiffany> er, I messed that up
[12:41:03] <Tiffany> there's 4 quarter rounds per round, and there's 4 round primitives per quarter round
[12:41:22] <Tiffany> 20*4*4 is 320 so yeah
[12:41:43] <Tiffany> 320 applications of the round primitive, for a total of 960 actual operations
[12:42:31] <Tobba> in fact, the round primitive has no parallelism
[12:43:00] <Tobba> but you could possible do 4 rounds at once
[12:43:05] <Tiffany> so, where parallelism comes in
[12:43:21] <Tiffany> each quarter round operates on a different column of the 4x4 state matrix
[12:43:55] <Tiffany> so you can do all four quarter rounds in parallel
[12:47:19] <Tiffany> so presumably you'd have a SIMDed up version of the quarter round, and then you'd use a double round function in a loop that gets called 10 times
[12:47:40] <Tiffany> the double round function in order to do something fancier than a slow matrix transpose
[12:47:52] <Tiffany> well, the matrix transpose was done in salsa20
[12:47:55] <Tiffany> it's not done in chacha
[12:48:07] <Tiffany> chacha alternates between operating on columns and operating on diagonals
[12:48:18] <Tiffany> so you'll probably want to rearrange your SIMD registers
[12:48:22] <Tiffany> I don't know how  fast you can do that
[12:49:45] <Tiffany> oh
[12:50:05] <Tiffany> if you used AVX-512's masking instructions, you could just store the state matrix in a single register and mask off the regions you're not currently using
[12:50:45] <Tiffany> no, that wouldn't work

[13:03:34] <bluss> Finiterator
[13:03:35] <Quxxy> bluss: Because I wasn't trying to be obtuse :P
[13:04:21] <eddyb> wat
[13:04:26] <eddyb> Quxxy: that doesn't look new :/
[13:04:34] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: were you trying to be acute?
[13:04:42] <bluss> Quxxy: is it the same as std::iter::iterate?
[13:04:43] <Quxxy> WindowsBunny: *honk honk*
[13:04:56] <Quxxy> The problem is that iter::iterate generates an infinite sequence
[13:05:04] <bluss> ah
[13:05:04] <eddyb> Quxxy: .fuse()
[13:05:10] <Quxxy> I can truncate that sequence, but not from the closure
[13:05:12] <eddyb> well..
[13:05:21] <bluss> Unfold can do anything
[13:05:28] <eddyb> there's no filter_map/fuse combo?

[13:05:33] <Quxxy> fuse only works if Iterator::next returns None, not if the iterator item is None
[13:05:53] <Quxxy> .filter_map(|e| e.into_iter()) ... but there's still an infinite number of None's to go through!
[13:06:08] <bluss> that's take_while, != None
[13:06:31] <eddyb> wtf it's 4pm
[13:06:32] <Quxxy> bluss: But then there's an ugly .map(Option::unwrap) :P
[13:06:46] <bluss> Quxxy: hm that's ugly
[13:06:59] <bluss> Quxxy: so eddyb has the idea for a new adaptor
[13:07:10] <Quxxy> Oh yuss?
[13:07:18] <bluss> I just wrote an example file for itertools since a user requested it https://github.com/bluss/rust-itertools/blob/master/examples/iris.rs
[13:07:43] <bluss> it's pretty itertastic but it's doing a lot of things just to show features I guess

[13:11:31] <bluss> that ascii scatter plot code.. using join() to show how iterators can help you to create more allocations, not less
[13:15:05] <Quxxy> So, apparently, opening the settings in VS Code completely destroys your workspace, closing all open files

[13:17:39] <Quxxy> Were you here early when I suggested shooting all the people trying to use JS outside websites? :P
[13:17:51] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: I agree with that stance
[13:18:03] <WindowsBunny> calc0000: I'm sure you also agree
[13:20:20] <Tobba> I'm tempted to try VS code since it's supposedly not as fuckawful as Atom
[13:20:35] <Tobba> and the rust highlighting is probably better -- the sublime plugin sucks
[13:21:29] <WindowsBunny> Tobba: Or you could just use VisualRust? :D

[14:19:25] <zofrex> anyone have experience with Swift? (asking here because I trust you all have impeccable taste in programming languages ;)
[14:19:48] <zofrex> if so I'd be interested in hearing what your opinion of it is
[14:20:27] <eddyb> Swift is neat for a GC language
[14:20:54] <eddyb> I think the main thing it has over Java, C# and Go (even D? I'm not sure) is ADTs
[14:21:21] <eddyb> I would almost venture to say it's in-between OCaml and Rust
[14:21:28] <fmtq> Swift shits me
[14:21:32] <fmtq> mostly because Xcode fucking sucks
[14:21:36] <fmtq> why isn't Swift open sores 
[14:21:41] <eddyb> fmtq: it will be
[14:21:49] <eddyb> with some syntax changes it would look quite a lot like Rust
[14:21:49] <fmtq> I don't fucking care
[14:21:52] <fmtq> why isn't it open sores now
[14:23:12] <eddyb> because they had to agile it into production
[14:23:22] <eddyb> the implementation may stink in places
[14:23:41] <fmtq> uh
[14:23:49] <fmtq> it sucks in so many places and they keep making breaking changes in minor revisions
[14:23:53] <fmtq> that require major source code rewrites
[14:24:08] <eddyb> that would do it
[14:24:42] <eddyb> they will hire some Rust devs to clean up the compiler
[14:24:50] <eddyb> actually, is the Swift compiler written in Swift, or not?
[14:25:08] <eddyb> it's a GC language, so maybe the compiler is C++?

[14:39:11] <zofrex> tbh it's pretty readable to me
[14:39:38] <bluss> let mut blends = (0..8).cycle(); just use blends.next().unwrap() to get the next number
[14:39:53] <fkaa> could that be used with enums as well?
[14:40:04] <bluss> probably not
[14:40:29] <fkaa> let mut blends = [A, B].cycle(); ?

[14:52:06] <bombless> http://is.gd/xKKmH0
[14:52:23] <bombless> hmm ... wrong channel, I guess :D
[14:53:04] <bluss> bombless: &Str is a fat pointer
[14:53:22] <bluss> bombless: from experience I think it will be a pointer and an usize, the usize the length of the str
[14:53:56] <Quxxy> bombless: Yeah... I don't think that transmute makes sense
[14:54:31] <bombless> Yeah I know that's nonsense but that's the point, I don't know how to do it right, Quxxy
[14:54:36] <Quxxy> Ok
[14:54:59] <Quxxy> &Repr is { *const Repr, usize }
[14:55:09] <Quxxy> Because Repr is a DST
[14:55:16] <Quxxy> It's a DST because str is a DST
[14:55:28] <Quxxy> As such, the usize is the (runtime-erased) length of the str
[14:55:47] <Quxxy> (If you have a trait instead of str, the usize would actually be a pointer to the trait impl's vtable)
[14:55:51] <bombless> Quxxy: but how the runtime figure out the len of that &Str.1?
[14:56:06] <Quxxy> It doesn't: you have to tell it
[14:56:15] <bluss> it doesn't figure it out at runtime
[14:56:27] <Quxxy> The *whole point* of DST is that the compiler *does not have this information*
[14:56:46] <bombless> hmm guess I can check the asm output of the main function
[14:56:54] <bluss> consider the cast Box<[1,2,3]> as Box<[i32]> -- the size is 3 at compilation time
[14:57:29] <bombless> the &str is a slice and it has length, but I wonder how that length is fetched
[14:57:54] <bluss> &str is a fat pointer, its representation is just a *const u8 and a usize
[14:57:55] <Quxxy> It's part of the &str
[14:58:11] <bluss> I don't know the order of them
[14:58:21] <Quxxy> You're not supposed to; you're supposed to use std::raw if you want that
[14:58:57] <bluss> the from_raw_parts functions are easier to use
[14:58:59] <bluss> and stable
[14:59:04] <Quxxy> Yes!  Those!

[15:06:51] * tilpner disregards potential answers.
[15:07:42] <tilpner> In the Apache License 2.0, "Derivative Works" does not include "works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.".
[15:07:57] <tilpner> -- http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html
[15:08:04] <tilpner> Does this include static linking?
[15:10:17] <fmtq> doesn't static linking include a copy in the binary 
[15:11:49] <tilpner> A copy of what?
[15:12:47] <fmtq> In computer science, a static library or statically-linked library is a set of routines, external functions and variables which are resolved in a caller at compile-time and copied into a target application by a compiler, linker, or binder, producing an object file and a stand-alone executable.

[15:13:16] <fmtq> I think it's pretty safe to say that a staticly linked library would be a derivative work.
[15:13:28] <Tiffany> LGPL treats static and dynamic linking differently
[15:13:37] <Tiffany> since dynamic linking allows the user to swap out a new version of the library
[15:14:08] <fmtq> so does Apache.

[15:19:26] <eddyb> tilpner: the Perl bug
[15:19:35] <fmtq> in copyright parlance, a derivative is any "work" (something copyrightable) that includes a sufficient amount of some other work that a court would consider it a derivative of that work.
[15:19:46] <fmtq> and a work can be a derivative of several other works.
[15:19:48] <fmtq> it's not linear.
[15:20:04] <fmtq> if you make a painting out of 4 other paintings, it's a derivative work of those four other paintings.
[15:20:20] <fmtq> depending on the legal jurisdiction, that can lead to some interesting (read: horrible) court cases.
[15:20:57] <eddyb> bluss: the pointer comes first in a fat pointer, everything afterwards is variably sized information you're not supposed to process except for very specific cases
[15:21:22] <eddyb> e.g Trait has one vtable pointer and [T] where T: Sized has one usize (its length)

[15:27:37] <Quxxy> eddyb: But what if T is a trait?
[15:27:45] <tilpner> fmtq - I see. Company A links library B (Apache) statically into an executable C. C is now derivative work of B, so A needs to ship the license and any additional NOTICE files with C. If they linked dynamically, they would have to distribute the license and NOTICEs with B, but not with C. Is this correct?
[15:28:24] <fmtq> tilpner: if you link dynamically, from my reading, you don't have to include the license, but if you _distribute_ it with your binary, you would have to 
[15:29:50] <tilpner> fmtq - If A modifies B, they only have to indicate changes to B, but never release the changed code, regardless of how they link it. Still correct?
[15:30:25] <fmtq> I don't think you have to actually indicate that changes were made unless it's the source
[15:30:36] <fmtq> in binary form, attribution is enough because nobody can know if you modified it or not 
[15:30:52] <eddyb> Quxxy: then you also have a vtable pointer

[15:31:15] <eddyb> but you erased T and kept the vtable for T: Trait
[15:31:23] <Quxxy> I keep forgetting that a DST must have, at one point, been non-DST
[15:31:48] <fmtq> yeah tilpner, 4b "You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and"
[15:32:04] <fmtq> the notice only has to be in the modified files, not binary distro NOTICE

[15:33:53] <fmtq> tilpner: yep they are legally distinct 
[15:33:59] <Quxxy> There must be a corresponding non-DST which it *could* have come from; that it's constructed at runtime is irrelevant to the typesystem

[18:37:35] <fmtq> there's a whole page on this

[18:38:50] <Tobba> fmtq: that probably means there's been an edit war around it
[18:39:07] <fmtq> This page was nominated for deletion on 3 June 2008. The result of the discussion was keep.

[18:48:31] <eddyb> I am confused
[18:49:23] <eddyb> how long did the evacuation take? did they go all the way back to Earth?

[18:51:22] <cmr> looks like there were only 6 crew members, so it wouldn't have taken very long, and the implication does seem to be that if they didn't go all the way back to earth, they are in orbit with no fuel.
[18:52:04] <cmr> looks like a pretty shitty movie.
[18:53:10] <cmr> nice effects though
[18:56:43] <eddyb> orbit of Mars?

[18:57:30] <eddyb> I'm seeing a space-station oribiting Earth and the crew inside a space-station, which would imply they are there
[18:57:34] <eddyb> but it's not clear
[18:58:04] <cmr> yeah, I made that comment before I saw that part
[18:58:09] <cmr> they're very obviously at eart.
[18:58:10] <cmr> earth
[18:58:47] <cmr> seems like they got back impossibly fast if the numbers he is writing is the days he has been there
[18:58:59] <cmr> let alone waiting for a good transfer window
[18:59:28] <cmr> maybe not.

[19:00:17] <eddyb> growing food on the soil does seem pretty stupid
[19:00:37] <eddyb> especially how it's not "soil"
[19:02:19] <c74d> …Having belatedly remembered that I have enough other tasks to complete ere July that I do not realistically have sufficient time to realize my schemes of OS-assembly, it seems that I will now be, after all, succumbing to the temptation to take the easy route and installing a pre-made operating system.
[19:02:54] <c74d> eddyb: you were interested in Wayland, right? have you tried it on NixOS?
[19:03:11] <eddyb> c74d: well, kwin5 does work, somewhat, with it
[19:03:18] <eddyb> but you cannot just ditch X11 yet
[19:03:28] <c74d> oh?
[19:03:58] <eddyb> plasma5 is not entirely X11-free, that's what I mean
[19:04:03] <c74d> ah
[19:04:31] <eddyb> it runs a X11 server right now if you start kwin in wayland mode
[19:04:36] <eddyb> but it's in active development so...
[19:04:37] <c74d> is that a problem if I don't use a DE?
[19:05:12] <cmr> c74d: there aren't many good "standalone compositors" like there are window managers for X
[19:05:19] <c74d> oh
[19:05:24] <c74d> hm
[19:05:25] <cmr> (if any)
[19:05:39] <c74d> So a DE is *necessary* for Wayland?
[19:05:46] <cmr> No, certainly not.
[19:05:55] <cmr> But you may have an expectation of quality that simply doesn't exist yet.
[19:06:06] <cmr> You could use Weston, for example.
[19:06:25] <cmr> (the reference compositor, relatively simple, standalone, and has an extension interface)
[19:06:52] <c74d> I see Wayland as being still experimental; what quality shouldn't I be expecting?
[19:06:52] <mrmonday> are there any decent tiling WMs for wayland yet?
[19:08:31] <eddyb> https://community.kde.org/KWin/Wayland
[19:08:37] <eddyb> (not tiling :P)
[19:10:00] <cmr> mrmonday: I don't know of any decent ones, but I ahven't looked in a while
[19:10:11] <mrmonday> I'll live without it then
[19:10:20] <c74d> eddyb: plasma5 is… the current version of KDE?
[19:10:33] <mrmonday> it doesn't really offer me much anyway, even when it starts gaining popularity
[19:10:42] <mrmonday> I literally just sit with a web browser and a terminal open
[19:11:29] <mrmonday> my backgrounds rotate and I have a widget to tell me how much battery I have... that's about it
[19:11:50] <mrmonday> oh, things tile, and there are obviously multiple desktops
[19:12:12] <mrmonday> very much a minimal, no-frills kinda desktop
[19:12:56] *** Joins: Binero (jeroen@moz-9quuoa.access.telenet.be)
[19:13:11] <eddyb> c74d: yes
[19:13:23] <Tobba> so wait
[19:13:25] <Tobba> why does Metal exist
[19:13:51] <mrmonday> out of context that question is hilarious
[19:13:56] <mrmonday> as with many technical questions
[19:14:34] <c74d> Is there some significance to it being “KDE Plasma 5” rather than just “KDE 5”?
[19:15:01] <cmr> Tobba: because Apple makes their own graphics hardware and wanted a lower-overhead thing for mobile, I think.
[19:15:21] <eddyb> would Metal be obsoleted by Vulkan?
[19:15:25] <Tobba> cmr: and they're using it on OS X... why exactly
[19:15:36] <Tobba> eddyb: I'm pretty sure it basically *is* Vulkan, but incompatible
[19:15:36] <eddyb> c74d: KDE is the organization, Plasma is the desktop
[19:15:40] <Tobba> and they must have known about vulkan
[19:15:40] <eddyb> Tobba: lol
[19:15:50] <Tobba> so it probably just means they're never going to support vulkan because they're fucking dicks
[19:16:10] <cmr> eddyb: Kinda yes, kinda no, Metal is a nicer interface to use but also more limited because mobile.
[19:16:24] <c74d> eddyb: oh, did they de-initialism-ize their name like LLVM?
[19:16:32] <cmr> Tobba: probably to make it easier to share code across their platforms
[19:16:52] * c74d was assuming that KDE was the name of the DE.
[19:17:32] <Tobba> cmr: except they're apparently using Metal on desktop devices now
[19:17:41] <Tobba> and running the OS rendering on that
[19:17:55] <cmr> Tobba: well, it makes sense, Metal is far nicer than OpenGL.
[19:19:34] <c74d> NixOS people: to what extent does NixOS like to have one's graphical environment be managed with NixOS management magic?
[19:20:03] <c74d> specifically, if I build and run Wayland/Weston myself, would NixOS have a problem with that?
[19:20:13] <Tobba> cmr: still kind of utterly pointless with Vulkan in existance
[19:20:22] <eddyb> c74d: nope
[19:20:24] <Tobba> I can't see *any* reason for it to exist other than apple being dicks
[19:20:24] <cmr> Tobba: well vulkan doesn't exist yet so
[19:20:38] <c74d> eddyb: okay, thanks.
[19:20:49] <eddyb> c74d: what NixOS controls is the system-wide behavior, i.e. the DM you're going to see at boot
[19:21:03] <eddyb> and it lets you enable DE's easily
[19:21:31] <eddyb> I *think* you can enable both kde4, kde5 and gnome3 at the same time (and pick one from the DM when you log in)
[19:21:38] <c74d> DM is… display manager?
[19:21:39] <eddyb> err, not both
[19:21:44] <eddyb> c74d: yeah, like xdm or kdm
[19:21:49] <c74d> (desktop multiplexer? desktop— okay
[19:21:54] <eddyb> or lightdm or sddm
[19:22:08] <c74d> I've never used one myself. >_>
[19:22:22] <Tobba> cmr: they haven't even added support for Metal on OS X yet
[19:22:32] <Tobba> well, next version will have it
[19:22:41] <eddyb> c74d: huh
[19:22:48] <eddyb> c74d: how do you log in then?
[19:23:04] <eddyb> I guess you could do it in a tty and then start X manually
[19:23:14] <c74d> eddyb: on my previous laptop, I— did that.
[19:23:57] <eddyb> if autologin is not desired, it's not much worse than seeing a login screen
[19:23:59] <eddyb> I guess...
[19:24:26] <cmr> that's what I do on my laptop.
[19:24:42] <cmr> I get dumped into a tty anyway to enter my disk encryption passphrase
[19:24:46] <cmr> nbd
[19:24:47] <c74d> I think I'd rather only be typing my password into the kernel, rather than into X11.
[19:24:54] <fmtq> rofl
[19:25:04] <eddyb> c74d: login isn't the kernel
[19:25:12] <c74d> ah, right
[19:25:35] <fmtq> Tobba: metal.
[19:25:38] <c74d> still, far less to trust
[19:25:39] <fmtq> it's such a shit name for anything
[19:25:48] <fmtq> Carbon, Aqua, Cocoa
[19:25:48] <eddyb> I do agree that X11 shouldn't touch anything private
[19:25:49] <fmtq> all awful
[19:25:53] <fmtq> Metal is awful aussi 
[19:26:01] <fmtq> eddyb: X11 is great
[19:26:05] <fmtq> everyone should love X11

[19:55:28] <Tiffany> honestly
[19:55:33] <Tiffany> this vulkan debacle is the last straw with OS X for me
[19:55:41] <Tiffany> I don't think I'm going to bother supporting it in any of my code anymore
[19:55:46] <Tiffany> it was already annoying enough to begin with
[19:55:58] <Tiffany> maybe they'll turn around later
[19:56:04] <Tiffany> and maybe I'll change my mind if they do
[19:57:02] <WindowsBunny> I just use cross platform libraries, and then leave fixing of any remaining issues up to the people who actually use Mac
[19:57:03] <Tiffany> I don't expect it to happen though
[19:57:03] <Tobba> Tiffany: I thought OS X was at least going to support Vulkan?
[19:57:11] <Tiffany> even if they do implement vulkan, it's going to be 5-10 years down the road
[19:57:14] <Tiffany> they're still not even at GL 4.5
[19:57:16] <Tiffany> they're at GL 4.1
[19:57:25] <Tobba> true

[19:58:01] <Tiffany> abstracting over graphics APIs is tricky
[19:58:07] <Tiffany> so I don't expect that to work out very wlel
[19:58:41] <Tiffany> they tend to be close to being their own rendering engines unto themselves
[19:58:44] <eddyb> it will be lel, indeed

[19:59:05] <Tiffany> my graphics drivers here on linux are pretty solid
[19:59:15] <Tobba> Tiffany: I have OpenGL 2.1
[19:59:17] <Tobba> fucking radeon
[19:59:23] <WindowsBunny> I feel like realtech-vr barely supports their opengl extension viewer
[19:59:30] <Tiffany> yeah, AMD...
[19:59:41] <WindowsBunny> the website states 4.1, while the software is 4.3.5
[19:59:51] <WindowsBunny> the update system in the software links to a 404 page
[20:00:23] <WindowsBunny> their changelog on the website hasn't been updated since 4.0.0
[20:00:50] <WindowsBunny> their forum 404's as well
[20:01:25] <Tiffany> there's a funny irony to it windowsbunny
[20:01:34] <Tiffany> if you go to microsoft's website, they actually list opengl as being deprecated
[20:04:35] <WindowsBunny> My driver supports a max texture size of 16384 x 16384 which would be 1 GB for a standard RGBA texture
[20:04:59] <cmr> Tiffany: well, the OpenGL windows ships certainly is
[20:05:03] <cmr> it's a software 1.1 iirc
[20:05:10] <Tiffany> I thought it was software 1.3
[20:05:14] <cmr> maybe it is 1.3
[20:05:15] <Tiffany> it's something from the early 90s, whatever the case
[20:05:18] <cmr> yeah
[20:05:30] <Tiffany> there are actually a couple extensions supported too
[20:05:33] <Tiffany> WIN_ prefix
[20:05:41] <WindowsBunny> WGL_

[20:06:06] <Tiffany> like GLX and EGL

[20:09:05] * WindowsBunny nibbles on fkaa
[20:09:10] <eddyb> well, let's just hope nobody supports Metal

[20:09:30] <fkaa> itshappening.jpg
[20:09:52] <Astrum|Lap> it's basically "I really enjoy this apple" and the requested change is to replace 'apple' by 'all fruit' along with the spanish version of 'all fruit'

[20:12:17] <Astrum|Lap> this is a tame example btw

[20:18:51] <eddyb> I just used right shift to type ?
[20:18:58] <eddyb> and now I used left shift for some reason
[20:19:04] <fmtq> hah
[20:19:09] <fmtq> I only ever use left shift 
[20:19:11] <fmtq> no idea why 
[20:19:13] <eddyb> but ? is actually very nice on the right shift, as I get to not use my pinky
[20:19:17] <VShell> you use alt gr to get this weird symbol: ¦
[20:19:23] <fmtq> THE ORIGINAL PIPE
[20:19:25] <WindowsBunny> fkaa: Well, if you used my special voodoo build of Windows
[20:19:34] <eddyb> index on ? and middle finger on shift
[20:19:43] <Tobba> eddyb: why do the NixOS people never update nixos-unstable
[20:19:43] <fmtq> so I should make bacon
[20:19:44] <fmtq> yes or yes?
[20:19:46] <Tobba> everything is months old now
[20:19:49] <eddyb> Tobba: wat
[20:20:18] <Tobba> nixos-unstable points to a month-old version of nixpkgs
[20:20:19] <eddyb> I upgraded... a couple weeks ago?
[20:20:31] <eddyb> Tobba: are there more recent usable hydra builds?
[20:20:40] <Tobba> I'm not quite sure
[20:20:46] <eddyb> my worry is that if you switch to master
[20:20:53] <eddyb> you'll compile everything
[20:20:55] <Tobba> it goes full gentoo, yes
[20:20:59] <eddyb> lol
[20:21:19] <eddyb> NixOS is a superset of gentoo
[20:21:30] <eddyb> that would be enough to get an audience
[20:21:42] <XMPPwocky> Tobba: i updated my nixpkgs manually
[20:21:55] <XMPPwocky> next week, things will finish compiling
[20:22:04] <fmtq> I use OS X
[20:22:05] <fmtq> my life is better
[20:22:16] <eddyb> XMPPwocky: gentoo people will tell you you're using the wrong flags
[20:22:23] <fmtq> if I put my laptop to sleep and open it back up, my EFI is vulnerable to rootkit
[20:22:25] <fmtq> oh yes
[20:22:28] <eddyb> Tobba: does hydra save some kind of "most packages build" channel?
[20:22:44] <Tobba> not a clue
[20:24:48] <XMPPwocky> eddyb: i don't think you get to use custom flgs
[20:25:40] <XMPPwocky> how *are* you supposed to set global environment variables (for all users) on linux, anywa
[20:26:00] <cmr> you don't.
[20:27:08] <eddyb> [23:25] <vcunat> we've had Hydra overloaded and some problems that were breaking tests

[20:39:02] * c74d notes that “the wrong flags” in Gentoo are typically “anything other than `-pipe -O2 -march=native`”.
[20:39:34] <cmr> What about stack protectors?
[20:40:18] <c74d> Those are added automatically depending on… the setting of `eselect gcc`, I think.
[20:40:27] <cmr> ok.
[20:40:41] <cmr> (hardened gentoo or bust)
[20:40:45] <fmtq> what about -Ofast
[20:40:52] <fmtq> or -Ofuck
[20:42:20] <c74d> I believe manually adding stack-protector flags in CFLAGS is specifically discouraged due to conflicting somehow with Hardened Gentoo's automatically added stack-protector flags.

[21:17:00] <fkaa> doesn't help that i dislike dogs i suppose
[21:17:05] <c74d> (or other NixOS users)
[21:17:07] <eddyb> c74d: that's a very smart question
[21:17:19] <eddyb> c74d: I wish I had figured out how to use nix-shell and nix-build sooner
[21:17:31] <eddyb> c74d: getting sudo to work wasn't obvious
[21:18:06] <c74d> …heh. I never even installed sudo on my previous laptop.
[21:21:24] <eddyb> and never change your timezone
[21:21:34] <eddyb> this bricked my laptop back in Portland
[21:21:38] <eddyb> "bricked"
[21:21:46] <c74d> :x
[21:21:57] <eddyb> aka it took me the whole evening to figure out I had to press any key to get the EFI bootloader list to show up
[21:22:20] <eddyb> once you're in the bootloader, you just pick the previous generation and you're done
[21:22:27] <eddyb> aka what windows has had for ages now
[21:22:34] <c74d> wow, what's the problem with timezones?
[21:22:38] <eddyb> (and I haven't seen it once working for windows)
[21:22:40] <eddyb> c74d: idk
[21:22:50] <eddyb> I am guessing just the time difference on some file?
[21:22:56] <eddyb> I was getting a black screen
[21:23:17] <eddyb> though I moved my time in the past and future from the "BIOS" and it didn't help
[21:23:38] <c74d> is this a known issue?
[21:23:45] <eddyb> it probably only happens on jetlagged lenovos with a certain fabrication year
[21:23:50] <eddyb> aka once in a blue moon
[21:23:53] <eddyb> c74d: I have no idea
[21:24:03] <c74d> okay. thanks for warning me.
[21:24:22] <eddyb> wasn't much of a warning
[21:24:39] <eddyb> c74d: like, the thing to gather from that is "always know how to bring up the bootloader menu"
[21:24:57] <eddyb> because it's trivial to revent any configuration changes (provided you haven't manually GC'd them)
[21:25:13] <eddyb> usually what I do after an upgrade is wait for a reboot and then run a full GC
[21:25:28] <eddyb> so I know I can boot the system at least :P
[21:26:44] <c74d> I don't suppose Nix can be usefully told to keep all… generations(?) back to the last one that booted successfully?
[21:27:14] <eddyb> just don't manually GC them
[21:27:32] <eddyb> but your HDD might fill up given enough time :P
[21:28:14] <c74d> I kept my previous laptop on UTC despite not living in Iceland, I guess I'll stick with that.
[21:28:31] <c74d> The commented-out configuration options in the configuration.nix generated by nixos-generate-config, are those just examples of possibilities or are those the default options?
[21:28:32] <eddyb> oh, my timezone is fine, lol
[21:28:40] <eddyb> c74d: examples
[21:28:56] <eddyb> the bad thing was switching from Bucharest to Portland
[21:28:59] <c74d> 'k, thanks.
[21:29:06] <eddyb> around 10 hours of difference
[21:29:24] <eddyb> c74d: nix-collect-garbage --delete-older-than 30d for example keeps all generations in the last month or so
[21:30:31] <c74d> eddyb: so I presumed, but, to me, if I'm not going to have my timezone match my location, it might as well be ±00:00.

[22:32:45] <c74d> …I also recall that, last time I used Nix, my home directory was its own filesystem, and Nix *seemed* to be okay with that.
[22:32:50] <eddyb> c74d: but building something locally is done in a temporary directory

[23:11:21] <zofrex> it's annoying because it's a remarkable result in itself
[23:11:40] <Tiffany> I've never even thought to try returning an iterator in rust
[23:11:45] <Tiffany> just because I knew that is the path to insanity
[23:12:30] <Wraithan> eddyb: where you at that the heat is getting you
[23:13:36] <Wraithan> In the NW US we are getting our first real taste of the heat, wasn't a gradual ramp up like most years
[23:13:42] <eddyb> Wraithan: Romania
[23:14:26] <Tobba> I forgot how terrible this section of my code was
[23:14:27] <Tobba> *(vec.as_ptr().offset(28) as *mut usize) += (&*(transmute::<_, raw::TraitObject>(&handler as &(Fn(&InterruptSection)+Sync)).vtable as *const HandlerVTable)).call as usize - vec.as_ptr() as usize;
[23:14:32] <Wraithan> normally we are closer to 25c this time of year but has been up to 35c in the last couple days :/
[23:14:36] <Tobba> though it's almost impressively hacky
[23:14:57] <eddyb> Tiffany: have you seen this? https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/393u6x/this_week_in_rust_82/cs13rxb?context=10
[23:14:59] <Wraithan> we are down to 32 and hopefully returning to 25-30c over the next week
[23:15:09] <eddyb> Tiffany: the hypothetical Rust 2.z stuff

[23:17:31] <Tiffany> I like the suggestion to run arbitrary code at compile time
[23:17:41] <Wraithan> eddyb: I was just talking about the returning a Filter problem with a co-worker after my last week of PTO where I immersed myself in rust. Found that to be the biggest problem myself
[23:17:50] <eddyb> hahahaha http://doctrina.org/Const-Liffy-Pattern.html
[23:17:58] <Wraithan> Tiffany: isn't that called a build script?
[23:18:00] <Wraithan> ;)
[23:18:10] <Wraithan> I use one of those to generate dynamic tests
[23:18:13] <Tiffany> not if it involves codegen
[23:18:17] <Tiffany> well, I guess it is
[23:18:18] <eddyb> sounds like emulating Rust's expressions in C++
[23:18:19] <Tiffany> it's gross though
[23:18:23] <Tiffany> it's not as easy as a constexpr
[23:18:29] <Wraithan> Tiffany: sure
[23:18:39] <Wraithan> Just saying it is already possible
[23:18:52] <Wraithan> just not pretty
[23:20:25] <Tiffany> eddyb: the problem with that pattern is that llvm won't inline lambdas on -O0
[23:20:42] <eddyb> ikr? Rust rules
[23:20:55] <Tiffany> on the other hand, there is a GNU extension intended for use in macros
[23:20:57] <eddyb> (OTOH you never want -O0 Rust. though Servo runs okay with it)
[23:20:58] <Tiffany> ({})
[23:21:01] <Tiffany> which acts like rust's {}
[23:21:07] <eddyb> "intended for use in macros"
[23:21:27] <eddyb> because the language couldn't use such an improvement
[23:21:35] <Tiffany> foo = ({bar = baz; bar});
[23:21:48] <Tiffany> there is already the comma operator
[23:21:53] <Tiffany> but you can't declare variables inside it
[23:22:03] <Tiffany> (int x = 4, x) is invalid afaik
[23:22:14] <Tiffany> int x; (x = 4, x) is valid though

[23:29:53] <eddyb> Wraithan: I checked btw, 30˘C
[23:30:15] <eddyb> and it's going up
[23:30:43] <eddyb> up to 35°C next monday
[23:30:54] <eddyb> though that's just prognosis
[23:31:05] <eddyb> (sorry, wrong word. forecast)
[23:32:22] <eddyb> > But I don't have many spare time to learn how makefile for rust on embedded and setup everything.

[23:32:42] <eddyb> someone wants to get into embedded without sacrificing anything
[23:33:27] <Tiffany> "RUST"
[23:33:43] <eddyb> in RUST we tRUST
[23:33:51] <Tiffany> what would that even stand for
[23:33:55] <Tiffany> Rusty Ugly State Transitions?
[23:35:00] <eddyb> http://readonlymemory.vg/the-making-of-lemmings/ no you don't just do that to DMA *sigh*

[23:35:52] <Tiffany> I love not having to worry about these weird ass layouts websites use
[23:35:55] <Tiffany> I can just enter reader mode
[23:36:13] <eddyb> you make me jealous
[23:36:22] <eddyb> grrr
[23:36:24] <eddyb> my fingers hurt
[23:36:26] <eddyb> from heat
[23:36:28] <eddyb> grrr
[23:36:51] <Tiffany> it's 30-35C from april to september here, eddyb
[23:36:58] <Tiffany> and 50-100% humidity too
[23:37:10] <eddyb> ikr?
[23:43:51] <Tiffany> I've never actually played lemmings
[23:43:57] <Tiffany> only the penguin-based remake
[23:44:16] <Tiffany> pingus
[23:44:18] <eddyb> same here
[23:44:26] <eddyb> thanks for the nostalgia
[23:45:47] <dfockler> lemmings!
[23:45:56] <Tiffany> it seems like the original game has more props that can kill your lemmings
[23:46:01] <Tiffany> as this article described
[23:46:09] <Tiffany> pingus only has a tutorial level built into the game, and then level packs after that
[23:46:26] <Tiffany> but there aren't many ways to die besides falling to your death
[23:47:24] <dfockler> didn't the original have fire or something
[23:47:40] <dfockler> it's been so long I forgot
