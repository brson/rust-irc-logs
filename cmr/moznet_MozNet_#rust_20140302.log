[04:38:36] <ryeguy> by what definition of use?
[04:38:39] <ryeguy> it brings it into scope
[04:39:08] <cmr> yes, you need both `mod` and `use`. but `mod` usually goes in the crate root (or a mod.rs for submodules), whereas you use `use` to bring those names into scope afterwards, in submodules.
[04:39:39] <huon> mod defines the module heirarchy, `use` brings names from other modules into scope
[04:39:54] <o11c> huon: well, I have no idea what Rust's modules are trying to *be*, so I have no idea what kind of name they should use
[04:40:01] <o11c> python did modules well.
[04:40:27] <o11c> and as much as we hate C headers, they work well also.
[04:40:40] <huon> in python, modules are values
[04:40:45] <huon> in Rust, they're not
[04:41:15] <o11c> huon: irrelevant - C headers aren't values, but they act pretty much the same as python modules, relative to what Rust is doing.

[04:41:33] <cmr> our module system is most like ES6
[04:41:50] <cmr> which makes sense, since we're both trying to do the same thing: match the expressiveness of python's module system within a static framework.
[04:42:16] <o11c> cmr: and yet, your target audience is not people used to doing browser scripting
[04:42:27] <cmr> o11c: so?
[04:42:34] <o11c> Rust is, in many ways, a great langauge ... if everything is in one module
[04:42:36] <cmr> I'm stating what we're similar to in other module systems.
[04:42:52] <o11c> and fatally different from others
[04:43:00] <cmr> why?
[04:43:14] <o11c> because expectations *matter*
[04:43:36] <huon> people expect to be able to overload functions like C++
[04:43:53] <o11c> huon: and then they learn about traits, which Make Sense (tm)
[04:44:11] <huon> and then they learn about the module system, which Makes Sense (tm)
[04:44:16] <speckle> like c++, you say? well then, it's a real shame if rust can't drop all of the baggage from c++
[04:44:22] <masonl> Is there a std::iter::thingy to zip more than two iterators in rust?
[04:44:27] <cmr> masonl: chain
[04:44:30] <cmr> well...
[04:44:34] <huon> speckle: (that was an example of something that Rust doesn't offer)
[04:44:34] <cmr> that's slightyl different
[04:44:43] <speckle> ... oh
[04:44:55] <huon> masonl: just repeated .zip's
[04:45:00] <huon> giving nested tuples
[04:45:05] <masonl> I'm looking to do something like `for x in zip(*(range(i, 10) for i in range(5))): print x`
[04:45:14] <masonl> huon: Yeah tried that and got the nested tuples.
[04:45:27] <masonl> I'd like an n-tuple.
[04:45:34] <huon> have to manually convert it to one
[04:45:48] <huon> .map(|(a,(b,(c,d)))| (a,b,c,d))
[04:46:00] <masonl> Interesting. I'll try that, thanks.
[04:46:19] <cmr> (the difference here being that each tuple is a unique type in rust, whereas they're dynamic in python)
[04:47:01] <o11c> huon: anyway, my greatest fear is that Rust will become another academic language, because it insists on doing everything its own way, even when there's no reason for it
[04:47:34] <cmr> no other module system in any static language does what we do.
[04:47:46] <cmr> in terms of features.
[04:48:15] <cmr> the consensus is that our module system is indeed different, but docs and practice smooth out any bumps.
[04:48:23] <cmr> and in practice, that has been true so far.
[04:49:05] <huon> o11c: what's something else that's different without a reason?
[04:50:12] <o11c> cmr: there was a study, that showed that people who were trained on a dvorak keyboard were faster than when they had used a qwerty keyboard ... it was then discovered that if they put the same amount of effort into training them on qwerty, they did even better
[04:50:24] <cmr> unrelated
[04:50:27] <o11c> huon: having modules be relatively flat would be a huge help
[04:50:40] <huon> o11c: eh?
[04:50:55] <o11c> all the foo.rs modules in this dir are peers, however they import each other
[04:50:59] <huon> how's that relevant to my question?
[04:51:19] <o11c> huon: it's something that's being unexpected with no benefit
[04:51:35] <o11c> unless you think hiding nested structures in a flat directory is a benefit?
[04:51:36] <huon> but it's not "something else"
[04:51:42] <cmr> they're not nested.
[04:51:45] <cmr> they're 
[04:51:47] <o11c> ah, misread

[04:55:05] <o11c> ouch, really?
[04:55:07] <cmr> it's not really an example of "this is how rust should work"
[04:55:10] <cmr> yes, it reorders them.
[04:55:17] <huon> it doesn't preserve file structure, but yeah, pretty printer fundamentally sucks.
[04:55:19] <cmr> it's been broken since before 0.6
[04:55:28] <cmr> (if it ever worked...)
[04:55:50] <cmr> it views an AST which doesn't preserve as much information as it would like.
[04:56:08] <cmr> should be fixable with some extra side-tables from the pasre
[04:56:09] <cmr> r
[04:56:09] <o11c> but anyway, that's just one example of the kind of thing that would work if flat sturctures were flat
[04:56:14] <o11c> if each .rs file was its own AST
[04:56:36] <o11c> but no, a .rs file can refer to entities that are never imported in it

[04:57:45] <cmr> we are just like python, we just don't have a cache like "import" does.

[05:44:18] <Valloric> it seems I missed a discussion about modules... what does the Rust community think about modules in D? they closely follow filesystem organization
[05:44:55] <Valloric> I disagree with o11c that Rust modules are somehow really bad, but I will say that I don't find them very intuitive 
[05:45:06] <cmr> I agree that they're not intuitive
[05:45:22] <cmr> I think I struggled with the module system the most, as a beginner.
[05:45:35] <Valloric> there was a comment in the discussion that Rust modules bumps can be smoothed out with docs and experience
[05:45:46] <Valloric> IMO that's one of the hallmarks of a bad design
[05:45:58] <Valloric> sad to say, but it's true
[05:46:26] <cmr> if the only thing wrong with our design is "unintuitive" then I think we're on a good path ;p
[05:46:37] <cmr> (docs includes intelligent compiler warnings, to me)
[05:46:41] <cmr> (slash errors)
[05:46:54] <cmr> you used to just get "unresolved name", which is less than helpful
[05:47:09] <Valloric> good diagnostics do help, that's for sure
[05:47:12] <cmr> now it will at least tell you if it was there but private, which part of the path was unresolved, etc.
[05:47:20] <Valloric> but have you looked at D modules?
[05:47:22] <cmr> I don't know anything about D's module system

[06:37:06] <Valloric> sfackler: like I said, other than those two :)
[06:37:35] <Valloric> with pub use, I have to ensure I'm making relevant stuff in foo.rs public
[06:37:46] <Valloric> and include!() is a hack
[06:38:05] <Valloric> i'll survive though
[06:38:17] <cmr> well...
[06:38:26] <cmr> you can also sorta work around it using reexports
[06:38:41] <cmr> `foo` would be private, and you `pub use foo::Something`
[06:38:47] <cmr> to provide a more flat heirarchy
[06:38:53] <Valloric> cmr: this is actually the crux of my issues with the Rust module system; you mentioned you wanted modules to be uncoupled from the FS
[06:39:03] <cmr> this is basically the only way to split a namespace across files
[06:39:06] <cmr> Valloric: yup.

[06:40:17] <cmr> even if it's just being able to have multiple files contribute ti a single namespace
[06:40:20] <Valloric> that's my point; the module system wants to be agnostic of the filesystem, but isn't really
[06:40:27] <o11c> cmr: pub use foo::*;
[06:40:36] <cmr> o11c: glob reexports are likely to be removed
[06:40:41] <o11c> but forbit any non-use statements in that file
[06:40:54] <cmr> they cause severe issues with the resolution algorithm
[06:41:09] *** Quits: johns (johns@moz-BBE3ABD.mv.mozilla.com) (Ping timeout)
[06:41:15] <cmr> this inflexibility is a huge shortcoming of our module system
[06:41:17] <o11c> cmr: if you forbid any other code, it should be no different than catting the files together
[06:41:26] <Valloric> ... and glob imports are frowned upon in every language
[06:41:30] <cmr> o11c: yeah but I have include!() for that :P
[06:41:39] <o11c> oh, right.
[06:41:41] <Valloric> since you end up shooting yourself in the foot 
[06:41:43] <o11c> then what was the question?
[06:41:52] <cmr> not really a question
[06:41:58] <cmr> just a gripe about the module system
[06:42:03] <o11c> Valloric: and yet, in every language, people *use* them, so there is *some* value in *something* they do
[06:42:20] <Valloric> o11c: and most companies ban them, since they break everything
[06:42:31] <Valloric> people do lots of stuff they shouldn't

[11:24:32] <Yurume> 5478ms +/- 2h

[11:27:33] <brandonson> eddyb: pretty much.  Basically I have 'struct Mine(MyOtherStructWithImpls)' and want to make Mine implement traits by delegation to MyOtherStructWithImpls
[11:27:40] <eddyb> brandonson: well, it's easier for newtypes. there's an issue about automatically delegating trait implementations to a specific field (which would work with more than just newtypes)
[11:27:52] <hhhhhhhhhh> and how would i write it if i want: `pub trait Vec : Mul< ToPrimitive, Vec > + ... {`
[11:28:20] <eddyb> brandonson: do you just want to be able to call methods on it? soon you'll be able to implement Deref<MyOtherStruct> for Mine and get some sugar

[11:32:43] <brandonson> hrm, libraries on my path aren't getting found :/
[11:33:10] <eddyb> hhhhhhhhhh: okay... you most likely want to make those traits generic over a concrete primitive type

[15:25:01] <adridu59> can you elaborate your question?
[15:25:38] <eddyb> so my local master is out of date. that makes a few things behave oddly (like git branch -d doesn't think my recent branches are merged)

[15:27:29] <eddyb> yeah
[15:27:31] <Havvy> eddyb:  Is there a generic implementation for clone_to_entity(&self) -> ~Entity, or does each implementor need to implement it themself?

[15:27:48] <adridu59> git pull --all

[15:42:07] <eddyb> Havvy: mkay, you'll have to go with the other option for now (manually implementing an Entity method to clone itself and cast to ~Entity, for each Entity implementor)
[15:42:09] <tiffany> I have a bit more alarming problems than that right now, rustc won't even compile
[15:42:23] <eddyb> Havvy: why would you want to clone players, anyway?
[15:42:35] <eddyb> if you want shareable handles, use Rc<Entity>
[15:42:58] <Havvy> eddyb:  Because I'm a newb and don't fully understand the ownership system.
[15:43:00] <eddyb> well, no, that won't work because there's no DST yet :(
[15:43:18] <eddyb> Rc<Player> will work but there's no Entity trait object that you can create from that
[15:43:42] <eddyb> and Rc<~Player> => Rc<~Entity> is invalid (they don't share the refcount)

[16:21:51] <doomlord_> heh :) a "language supremacist"
[16:21:55] <SiegeLord> If you want to collaborate with people, you don't use Rust :P

[16:22:08] <doomlord_> heh thats true but
[16:22:13] <eddyb> doomlord_: someone used to do that on me with Haskell
[16:22:15] <Havvy> I've looked at C++ and I've looked at Rust. Rust is much easier to grok than C++.
[16:22:30] <eddyb> especially if you can grasp lifetimes

[16:23:02] <SiegeLord> Unpleasant or not, by choosing a 'non-standard' language you've cut down the possible number of collaborators 100-1000 fold
[16:23:06] <eddyb> C++ will screw you over quite bad, lifetimes are just a piece of cake
[16:23:18] <eddyb> doomlord_: so what was I saying... under DST, you can, for example, upcast Rc<BagOfTraits> to Rc<Any> and then downcast &Any to Option<&T>
[16:23:33] <eddyb> or just keep a RWArc<Many>
[16:23:44] <eddyb> and pull traits for that at your leisure
[16:23:47] <eddyb> *from that
[16:24:02] <SiegeLord> Like I recall the projects that switched from D to C++

[16:24:28] <eddyb> I don't know of languages with type erasure that allow such runtime polymorphism
[16:24:54] <speckle> But it can't be Lisp all the way down, Rust does much better than C at the bottom of the language stack, for some applications
[16:24:56] <doomlord_> i've used C++ for 15 years approx. Learning a new language keeps me sane
[16:25:07] <Havvy> speckle:  Lisp machines. ;)
[16:25:15] <doomlord_> its more a case of "i've been cursed with these issues for 15 years.."
[16:25:20] <speckle> Havvy, what is the Lisp machines garbage collector implemented in, though?
[16:25:32] <eddyb> Many is downcasting-to-unrelated-interface instead of downcasting-to-type-that-inherits-from-your-super

[18:38:51] <eddyb> yeah
[18:38:53] <cmr> hhhhhhhhhh: specifically, that dance is done because glfw needs to be initialized on the main thread.
[18:39:06] <hhhhhhhhhh> cmr: does that mean i cna't use glfw-rs with green threads
[18:39:20] <eddyb> you can't process events from any C library on a non-native thread AFAIK
[18:39:22] <cmr> hhhhhhhhhh: no, it just means you need to initialize it on the main thread.
[18:39:24] <SiegeLord> I think you can spawn them after the fact, no?
[18:39:31] <hhhhhhhhhh> my project is faking a gpu model because i got sick of writing cuda
[18:39:35] <hhhhhhhhhh> which means i would like to spawn 9999999 threads
[18:39:44] <eddyb> hehe
[18:39:56] <cmr> hhhhhhhhhh: there are certain operations that need to be done on the thread glfw was initialized on, see its docs.
[18:39:58] <SiegeLord> lol that... won't work
[18:40:32] <eddyb> I wish I could write IntConst(..-1)

[21:40:29] <esummers_> I checked std::rt, but didn't see anything
[21:41:27] <cmr> probably going to have to cast the ~Runtime object to an ~Any and check if it .is::<~GreenRuntime> etc or whatever the types are
[21:42:01] <speckle> sfackler, as for taking things upon themselves: honestly, the main thing that keeps me away from trying to use/contributing to Rust is how employment/IP law works in the United States.
[21:42:03] <speckle> My employer doesn't *explicitly* own things I do outside of work, but the "scope of employment" can surprisingly cover things you wouldn't expect, and I'm paranoid about that happening to any Rust contributions I attempt.

[21:50:30] <speckle> For now, I've just been learning Rust by reading docs, without writing any code besides 5-10 line unreusable experimental snippets just to learn basic syntax.  Until it's clarified, that's one way around it, I guess.

[21:52:40] <rweir> in return, though, gnu won't ever make it proprietary and gives you back the right to license your code under any other license you like, which is what separates it from e.g. canonical's cla
[21:53:05] <speckle> But notably, GNU also needs employers to fill out forms
[21:53:12] <o11c> speckle: the FSF's copyright assignment is not like most CLAs
[21:53:44] <o11c> the only reason the FSF requires copyright assignment is so that they can 1. upgrade to a newer version of the license, and 2. sue people violating the license
[21:53:58] <o11c> speckle: whereas, say, teh Canonical CLA exists so they can make it proprietary
[21:54:35] <Ms2ger> That feeling when you write rust code and it compiles the first time
[21:54:38] <brandonson> Darnuria: possibly. If you're just uppercasing latin characters (i.e. a-z to A-Z) then you could probably get it right in unicode without too much trouble

[22:38:22] <mihneadb> ( stack.rs:8:25: 8:26 error: unresolved name `T`. )
[22:38:25] <derek_c> sfackler: no, I was asking, for example, if I could do #[deriving(TotalOrd)] on an imported type
[22:38:27] <Darnuria> eddyb: Yep a lot.:)
[22:38:31] <sfackler> mihneadb: remove the <T> from the definition of push.
[22:38:35] <sfackler> derek_c: oh, no
[22:38:46] <derek_c> sfackler: is there an inherent reason why this is not OK?
[22:39:00] <sfackler> traits can only be implemented in the crate (module?) that declared the trait or type
[22:39:24] <mihneadb> sfackler: not sure why ? also, the error is in new's body
[22:39:33] <sfackler> plus there's no way a syntax extension could do it anyways since it'll have no knowledge of the interior of the type
[22:39:43] <sfackler> oh
[22:39:49] <sfackler> mihneadb: make it ~[]
[22:40:03] <sfackler> ~[T] there means a vector containing the single element T
[22:40:06] <sfackler> which doesn't exist
[22:40:22] <mihneadb> and how do you say a vector of Ts ?
[22:40:35] <sfackler> you'll want to remove the <T> in push since you want the T in push's argument to be the same T as the one in the struct
[22:40:37] <derek_c> sfackler: ok :(
[22:40:45] <sfackler> mihneadb: ~[]. the type is inferred
[22:41:14] <mihneadb> sfackler: oh so if I have a <T> in the impl statement it's "visible" inside the method's prototypes?
[22:41:17] <sfackler> derek_c: implementing TotalOrd on a wrapping type is the easiest way to deal with that kind of thing
[22:41:21] <sfackler> yep
[22:41:34] <eddyb> Darnuria: it's JSON, should be able to use rust-http and libserialize to make it work
[22:41:52] <mihneadb> sfackler: cool. So, back to the ~[], is there no way to explicitly say a vector of Ts ?
[22:41:59] <Darnuria> eddyb: cool.
[22:42:08] <derek_c> sfackler: you mean like: struct K(ImportedType); #[deriving(TotalOrd)] K?

[22:43:34] <sfackler> derek_c: you can't use deriving there. you'll have to implement TotalOrd yourself
