[00:34:38] <jdm> pcwalton: please help me sort out my complicated feelings about vtable-like things for servo
[00:34:47] <pcwalton> okay :)
[00:34:50] <jdm> pcwalton: in particular, for things like event handling
[00:35:16] <jdm> pcwalton: in eventdispatcher, we basically want to do a virtual dispatch to call per-element-type rust event handlers
[00:35:32] <jdm> I just really don't like the existing solutions we have for things like AfterSetAttr in element.rs
[00:35:35] <jdm> it's terrible
[00:35:56] <pcwalton> well, we do want single inheritance in rust
[00:36:37] <pcwalton> maybe it'd be easiest to use "as &mut Trait"
[00:37:04] <jdm> pcwalton: I'm not sure that will work. we have the equivalent of JSManaged<EventTarget>
[00:37:12] <pcwalton> (abstract_self as &mut Something).AfterSetAttr
[00:37:27] <jdm> is the idea that we would have something like
[00:37:45] <jdm> impl VirtualStuff for JSManaged<Something> { ... }
[00:37:56] <jdm> impl VirtualStuff for JSManaged<AnotherThing> { ... }
[00:38:08] <jdm> no, that doesn't seem like that would work
[00:38:23] <pcwalton> well, eventually we want something like
[00:38:32] <pcwalton> fn foo(JSManaged<self>, a: int, b: int) {}
[00:40:37] <jdm> pcwalton: so it sounds like we would need to switch on the type and cast to the concrete one regardless of the solution :<
[00:41:03] <pcwalton> well, if Node were actually a *trait* object then it wouldn't be a problem

[00:43:23] <jdm> let's imagine that there's an EventListener trait
[00:43:37] <jdm> and it's implemented by HTMLFooElement and HTMLBarElement
[00:44:14] <jdm> if we have an EventTarget type, which secretly is either an HTMLFooElement or HTMLBarElement
[00:44:35] <jdm> can we just obtain an EventListener trait object from that EventTarget object?

[01:58:50] <patrickkim> can i have question?
[01:58:52] <pcwalton> sure
[01:58:57] <patrickkim> in #1520
[01:58:58] <crowbot> Issue #1520: fix imagebox size compute - https://github.com/mozilla/servo/pull/1520
[01:59:22] <patrickkim> should i make assing_height thing in box_ you think?
[01:59:36] <pcwalton> I would do that
[01:59:56] <patrickkim> and..
[02:00:02] <patrickkim> in #1506
[02:00:03] <crowbot> Issue #1506: fix text-decoration property in layout & fix line-height property - https://github.com/mozilla/servo/pull/1506
[02:00:25] <patrickkim> in my pr, uses three color(4bytes *3)
[02:00:43] <patrickkim> if i make Option<~RareFlowFlags>
[02:01:05] <patrickkim> that also needs one color value
[02:01:35] *** kimundi is now known as zz_kimundi
[02:01:58] <patrickkim> so, it uses Option(8bytes?) + 4bytes i think
[02:02:35] <patrickkim> how do you think?
[02:04:29] <pcwalton> I was thinking that the color value should just be assumed to be equal to the text color if RareFlowFlags is none
[02:06:00] <patrickkim> <div style="text-decoration:underline;color:blue"> <em>asdf</em> </div>
[02:06:23] <patrickkim> in this case underline of "asdf" uses color of div i think
[02:06:43] <patrickkim> so we need option+color(or style of div)
[02:07:03] <larsberg> aydinkim: ping
[02:07:10] <patrickkim> <div style="text-decoration:underline;color:blue"> <em style="color:red">asdf</em> </div>
[02:07:12] <aydinkim> larsberg: poin
[02:07:26] <aydinkim> larsberg: Sorry for bother you :)
[02:07:30] <pcwalton> oh, I guess text color should not be in RareFlowFlags then
[02:07:36] <larsberg> I see that _rust_crate_map_toplevel is now in your list of symbols
[02:07:45] <pcwalton> so RareFlowFlags would be None for <div style="text-decoration:underline;color:blue"> <em>asdf</em> </div>
[02:07:50] <larsberg> And no problem - sorry it didn't just work with my changes!
[02:07:55] <pcwalton> but RareFlowFlags would be Some for <div style="text-decoration:underline;color:blue"> <em style="color:red">asdf</em> </div>
[02:08:19] <larsberg> in libstd in the function get_crate_map, my patch added debugging output that tells you if rust was able to find the symbol
[02:08:25] <larsberg> what gets printed in that output?
[02:09:19] <larsberg> aydinkim: the code at https://gist.github.com/larsbergstrom/8513764#file-rust_crate_map-rs-L37-L52
[02:09:54] <aydinkim> larsberg: yes. it must be succeeded. but I don't know why crashed.
[02:10:07] <patrickkim> pcwalton : ok i will try that!
[02:10:15] <pcwalton> cool :)
[02:10:16] <aydinkim> larsberg: I applied your all changes.
[02:10:48] <aydinkim> larsberg: and succeeded in finding libservo and _rust_crate_map_toplevel.
[02:11:12] <aydinkim> larsberg: and symbol pointer is valid (not null)
[02:11:45] <larsberg> aydinkim: very good! do you have a stack backtrace for the new failure?
[02:12:59] <aydinkim> larsberg: Unfortunately failure log is same. I think I need to run gdb or change ndk version.
[02:13:03] <larsberg> you can get one even without the debugger from:
[02:13:04] <larsberg> ~/android-sdk-macosx/platform-tools/adb logcat | ~/android-ndk-r9c/ndk-stack -sym libs/armeabi/
[02:13:40] <aydinkim> larsberg: Oh, you are now using ndk r9c version?
[02:14:13] <larsberg> aydinkim: yes, I am
[02:14:53] <aydinkim> larsberg: I'm now using original r9 version. so now I'm trying to build with version change to r9b.
[02:15:19] <aydinkim> larsberg: Possibly it causes the error.
[02:16:26] <aydinkim> larsberg: Anyway, rustuv is using on android? I couldn't find relation to any ohter libraries by using nm.
[02:17:05] <aydinkim> larsberg: I mean librustuv is just a standalone library that differs to linux.
[02:18:23] <jack> we need rustuv because we use green threads and uv is used for i/o
[02:18:33] <aydinkim> larsberg: I'm not sure that it is somthing like weak symbol problem or it is originally unused on android.
[02:18:38] <jack> I'm not sure I quite understand what you mean when you talk about rustuv
[02:18:52] <aydinkim> jack: librustuv is used on android?
[02:19:11] <jack> there is nothing different about the i/o on OS X or Linux and the i/o on android.
[02:19:42] <aydinkim> jack: As I investigated with nm, there is no link with any other libraries.
[02:19:52] <aydinkim> jack: in case of android
[02:19:55] <aydinkim> jack: in case of android servo

[05:38:30] <aydinkim> larsberg: On the other hands, If we make a library, it doesn't put librustuv link into library. So we need to link with 'extern'?

[20:14:25] <eddyb> larsberg: thanks, I'll see what I can do :D
[20:14:57] <larsberg> whoops, looks like it might be shifted by 1 pixel!
[20:15:06] <larsberg> (my hand diffing was inconclusive)
[20:15:13] <eddyb> heh
[20:15:33] <eddyb> tab switching with the scroll wheel (linux) may do the trick
[20:15:54] <eddyb> larsberg: it's shifted alright
[20:16:29] <eddyb> more than one pixel I'd say
[20:16:56] <larsberg> I think we need to do something more interesting like doing a pixel-by-pixel diff and spitting out an image that shows a "shadow" of where the differences were
[20:18:41] <eddyb> larsberg: it's actually as easy as a.pixels.iter().zip(b.pixels.iter()).map(|(&a, &b)| abs(a-b)).collect()
[20:19:21] <eddyb> though you might want 255-that to be opaque
[20:26:27] <larsberg> eddyb: thanks - that's honestly cleaner than our shell out to `diff`, blocking, and checking the return code
[20:26:52] <eddyb> larsberg: you can fold to count the different pixels, too
