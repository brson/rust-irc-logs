[05:27:21] <Gankro> Does servo do anything in particular to feed bytes to image codecs? Do anything to ensure they don't bounce on running out of bytes too frequently or anything?
[05:41:58] *** Joins: vikaton (uid59278@moz-0a9h81.ealing.irccloud.com)
[05:59:50] <eddyb> Gankro: servo has only blocking image parsing
[06:00:17] <Gankro> eddyb: So an image codec will never witness early EOF?
[06:00:21] <eddyb> Gankro: servo is the reason I started writing my streaming PNG parser which was shelved for more than an year
[06:00:38] <eddyb> somewhat recently nwin got me to finish the inflate implementation
[06:01:05] <eddyb> Gankro: https://github.com/PistonDevelopers/image-png see the inflate directory
[06:02:29] <eddyb> Gankro: I believe the intent of image-png is to have a streaming PNG decoder and nwin said he was inspired by my ancient code, but I'm not sure where it's at
[06:03:08] <eddyb> we need a really good concurrent image buffer to start with, and design image decoders to write to that
[06:04:23] *** Joins: tomaka (Pierre@moz-gg67kl.abo.wanadoo.fr)
[06:06:02] <Gankro> image decoding doesn't seem like something that needs parallelization within a single image...
[06:06:19] <eddyb> Gankro: the concurrency is to distribute in-progress images to multiple threads
[06:06:25] <eddyb> with as little overhead as possible
[06:06:32] <eddyb> Gankro: you want to see images as they load
[06:06:51] <Gankro> eddyb: each image is already on its own thread, I thought?
[06:07:07] <eddyb> Gankro: that thread is not rendering it
[06:07:38] <eddyb> (and you'd probably use a thread pool if your image decoder is not blocking for network data)
[06:08:56] <eddyb> Gankro: http://docs.gl/gl2/glTexSubImage2D
[06:09:53] <eddyb> that's what you need to pass the image data to, on a different thread
[06:10:05] <eddyb> wait, where's the stride
[06:12:13] <Elaine> eddyb: it's part of the GL state.
[06:12:20] <Elaine> unfortunately.
[06:12:48] <eddyb> actually, I need a "bytes per pixel" value
[06:12:58] <eddyb> can I do that per-texture?
[06:13:00] <Elaine> that's chosen by the pixel format of the texture.
[06:13:04] *** Quits: Tobba (Tobba@moz-o13d22.bredband.telia.com) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[06:13:20] <Elaine> and the type
[06:13:24] <eddyb> yeah, but can I have 32 bytes per pixel with just the first 4 being used? wait, no, that's still not good :/
[06:14:18] <eddyb> Elaine: I want to use a partially decoded PNG image buffer with Adam7 interlacing, and sample only some of the pixels (depending on the current stage of Adam7)
[06:14:35] <Elaine> Nope.
[06:14:51] <eddyb> I could've sworn pcwalton showed me something ages ago
[06:15:21] <Elaine> It's part of the GL state, with PixelStorei, not per-texture.
[06:15:52] <eddyb> can I change the state before each draw?
[06:16:22] <eddyb> aha! http://docs.gl/gl4/glPixelStore

[06:20:21] <eddyb> Elaine: there's a lot of stuff there but it looks like I only get a stride. which is not enough, because my data is not packed to the left
[06:21:17] <eddyb> Elaine: plan B: upload all the data, including the uninitialized regions, and use mipmaps to downscale it. can I get those to handle Adam7?
[06:22:31] <eddyb> you would think I could put it in nearest mode and do Adam7 in the fragment shader. but that's a bit too much

[07:28:25] <tomaka> I guess you could create a pixelbuffer for each pass
[07:28:39] <tomaka> and then upload to the texture from each buffer one by one
[07:29:18] <eddyb> tomaka: how?
[07:29:32] <tomaka> I can't see a solution that doesn't make you duplicate data
[07:29:44] <eddyb> if only OpenGL had one more option...
[07:30:05] <tomaka> yeah PixelStore misses the option to skip bytes between two pixels
[07:30:59] <eddyb> could you use the row size for that?
[07:31:16] <eddyb> somehow transmute a 1D texture to 2D
[07:32:01] *** Joins: kmicu (kmicu@moz-uga.edn.218.91.IP)
[07:32:09] <tomaka> heh you can't transmute textures
[07:32:20] <tomaka> and you'd lose bilinear filtering if you use a 1D texture
[07:33:27] <eddyb> so do I need to pretend my pixels are "ye big" in the decoder?
[07:34:08] <eddyb> instead of never writing overlapping bytes during the decode process
[07:34:35] <eddyb> but that's going to require some locking
[07:38:13] <eddyb> tomaka: what about mimmaps with NEAREST?
[07:38:41] <eddyb> could I get them to ignore the exact pixels that haven't been written yet?
[07:39:14] <eddyb> tomaka: whoa whoa the last stage is "every other row"
[07:39:33] <eddyb> that seems useful
[07:39:45] <eddyb> tomaka: so we both know what to look for https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam7_algorithm
[07:41:03] <tomaka> mipmaps with NEAREST?
[07:41:28] <tomaka> you can either manually upload mipmaps (but that's not helpful) or you can automatically generate them
[07:41:32] <eddyb> tomaka: as in, generate mimaps from nearest-neighbour but render them with bilinear
[07:41:55] <eddyb> (hoping that the generate step can pick just the right pixels)
[07:42:10] <tomaka> generating mipmaps is fucked up most of the time
[07:42:13] <tomaka> automatically*
[07:42:34] <tomaka> it gives bad results and often crashes the driver
[07:42:37] <eddyb> pass 6 and 7 can be done directly
[07:43:03] <eddyb> on a 1024x1024 image, pass 5 is 512x512, still pretty big
[07:45:02] <eddyb> so if you have XOYOZ horizontally, where X are good pixels and O is all zeroes, can you write a fragment shader to sample the correct result?
[07:45:36] <tomaka> no
[07:45:36] <eddyb> *X, Y, Z are good pixels
[07:45:46] <tomaka> or inefficiently
[07:45:57] <eddyb> I was thinking maybe taking two samples would be enough
[07:46:12] <eddyb> but that's obviously naive
[07:46:29] <eddyb> tomaka: if you find a solution, it would work for both pass 4 and 5
[07:46:56] <tomaka> and what about decoding from the start after each pass? :3
[07:46:57] <eddyb> and then pass 3 is a fourth of the image in both directions, small enough to quickly assemble manually
[07:47:01] <tomaka> decoding the PNG
[07:47:13] <eddyb> tomaka: what do you mean?
[07:47:31] <tomaka> you decode the PNG until pass 1 and cache the content of the file
[07:47:38] <tomaka> then you decode from the start to pass 2
[07:47:41] <tomaka> then from the start to pass 3
[07:47:54] * tomaka is going to get bashes
[07:47:56] <tomaka> bashed*
[07:47:57] <eddyb> but why?
[07:48:06] <tomaka> because it works?
[07:48:29] <eddyb> and you increase the buffer size each time?
[07:48:33] <tomaka> yeah
[07:48:43] *** Quits: waffles (wafflespean@moz-aeh.673.193.113.IP) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[07:48:55] <tomaka> that's the naive solution but I don't think it's worse than what you're trying to do with your complex solutions
[07:49:02] <eddyb> at that point it would be more efficient to write in multiple buffers
[07:49:25] <tomaka> yeah, or that
[07:49:50] <tomaka> you just write directly in 7 different mapped pixel buffers
[07:50:03] <tomaka> when you reach pass 1 you demap and upload the first one
[07:50:19] <tomaka> pass 2 you demap and upload the second one, and so on
[07:50:56] *** Joins: waffles (wafflespean@moz-aeh.673.193.113.IP)
[07:52:28] <tomaka> with a mapped pixel buffer your decoder would write directly into video memory
[07:52:36] <tomaka> and then turning that into a texture is very very fast
[07:53:23] <tomaka> I don't remember the numbers, but it's like 50 or 100 GB/s
[07:53:28] <eddyb> https://upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/a/8/6a8e16fe61ecc5c40547b83b79eeecbc.png so that's bilinear
[07:54:26] <eddyb> I probably need a piece of paper for this

[08:04:18] <eddyb> you need to combine those two values to get A * (1/2 - x/2) + B * (1/2 + x/2) from x/2
[08:04:30] <tomaka> you know that video card have a dedicated hardware that does this
[08:04:38] <tomaka> and doing it manually in the shader will be much slower
[08:04:48] <eddyb> unless I can figure an easy way to do it
[08:05:51] <eddyb> so what I need is (A * (1 - x) + B * (1 + x)) / 2
[08:06:58] <eddyb> so (sample(x-2) + sample(x+1)) / 2?
[08:07:03] <eddyb> seems doable though

[20:21:01] <frewsxcv> i ask because with this wpt test: https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/blob/d65b1193f7d246713a488d762213f8bc8dc0d80e/dom/traversal/TreeWalker-basic.html#L95 we need to treat the explicitly passed 'undefined' as 0xFFFFFFFF, but the codegen is converting the the 'undefined' to 0
[20:23:02] <Ms2ger> Yeah, that's a codegen issue
[20:23:10] <Ms2ger> undefined should be treated as not-passed
[20:23:11] <frewsxcv> maybe we should utilize the default value from the webidl if they pass 'undefined'
[20:23:17] <frewsxcv> ah
[20:23:38] <Ms2ger> Not sure if there's an issue yet
[20:24:14] <frewsxcv> is CodegenRust.py the file that would need to be altered to support that?
[20:24:33] <frewsxcv> i'll open an issue though
[20:24:40] * frewsxcv (if i don't find an existing one)
[20:25:29] <Ms2ger> Yep
[20:25:42] <Ms2ger> I was probably waiting for the smup, but that landed now

[22:49:13] <njn> if I landed a patch in SpiderMonkey, is backporting it to mozjs likely to be allowed?
[22:49:28] <njn> I want to add memory reporting for SpiderMonkey into Servo, and landing some changes to SM's reporting API would make things a lot easier on the Servo side
[22:49:47] <njn> I guess this is a question for jdm, but he's offline
[22:51:01] <larsberg> njn: do you mean landing a patch upstream and then cherry-picking the patch into servo? Or landing it upstream and doing a JS update? I'd assume either is fine, though the latter (doing an update) is preferred.
[22:51:22] <njn> larsberg: I was thinking the former
[22:51:29] <njn> larsberg: sounds easier :)
[22:51:41] <njn> larsberg: though I'd be cherry-picking into mozjs, not servo
[22:51:41] <larsberg> we pretty regularly cherry pick or do minor forks of upstream components, though we try to avoid it
[22:52:07] <njn> larsberg: sounds like I can start working on it, at least
[22:52:17] <larsberg> about a year ago we were doing that for roughly every third rust upgrade to avoid the pain of a full update
[22:53:03] <larsberg> njn: I would be interested in how painful SM upgrades are now, though. mwu seemed to think they'd be really straightforward }:-)
[22:53:21] <njn> larsberg: relatively speaking, I'm sure they are :)
[22:53:42] <njn> larsberg: but it's not something I want to do myself
[22:53:52] <njn> I bet there's a bunch of small things you have to know
[22:54:02] <njn> and what would take mwu a day would take me 5
