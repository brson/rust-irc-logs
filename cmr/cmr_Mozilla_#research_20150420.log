[22:51:27] <roc> kmc: I dispute many of the claims in that paper :-)
[22:53:29] <kmc> such as?
[22:54:00] <khuey> roc: thanks for the merge, btw
[22:54:12] <khuey> surprised we missed that for this long ;)
[22:57:36] <roc> thanks for the fix :-)
[22:58:22] <roc> how's the ARM perfcounters treating how?
[22:58:26] <roc> *you*
[23:05:02] <khuey> roc: did you see what I wrote about singlestepping?
[23:05:15] <roc> that singlestepping causes perfcounter divergence?
[23:05:43] <khuey> yes
[23:06:06] <khuey> I haven't seen any issues without forcing us to singlestep through everything though
[23:06:23] <khuey> I'm trying to get running xpcshell tests to work now
[23:07:05] <khuey> that should give some idea of what divergence we may see in a "real" use case
[23:09:06] <roc> khuey: is it predictable divergence we can account for?
[23:10:52] <roc> kmc: the basic claim is that doing record and replay at the VM level is advantageous. In particular that it gives performance advantages you can't get any other way
[23:13:41] <khuey> roc: in my limited testing it appeared to be deterministic divergence
[23:13:59] <khuey> roc: I didn't bother to figure out what was causing it yet, but it was always the same value
[23:14:06] <khuey> so presumably we could account for it
[23:14:13] <khuey> with effort
[23:14:18] <khuey> I'm not worried yet :)
[23:14:24] <roc> khuey: cool
[23:14:38] <roc> kmc: for example they talk about how taking advantage of GC means you don't have to capture as much in checkpoints
[23:14:49] <kmc> yeah
[23:15:53] *** Quits: pcwalton (pcwalton@moz-qjbkeh.mtv2.mozilla.com) (Client exited)
[23:16:02] <roc> kmc: but rr uses fork() to checkpoint and AFAICT we get the same advantages --- only dirty pages are copied
[23:16:26] <kmc> well it's a coarser granularity but yeah
[23:16:36] <kmc> they do discuss mmu based write barriers
[23:17:35] <khuey> roc: currently I'm trying to finish my rebase
[23:17:41] <khuey> so that I'm not on an ancient version
[23:17:48] <khuey> I was hitting too many issues that are fixed on trunk :P
[23:19:41] <roc> kmc: anyway memory usage for checkpoints is a non-issue in practice so far. For Firefox debugging anyway.
[23:20:50] <kmc> ok
[23:20:55] <roc> kmc: the downside of their approach is in the fine print... when you call from C# into native code (or vice versa)
[23:21:20] <roc> they're basically ignoring that. I think that's fatal in practice.
[23:22:15] <roc> in practice, the C#/Java FFI interface is extremely wide and in most applications you're definitely going to need FFI results for replay
[23:22:36] <roc> now, you could add record and replay to the FFI layer
[23:23:58] <roc> but I don't know that leads to a better place than rr

[23:25:23] <roc> I also think that integrating into a VM is a maintability hazard
[23:25:46] <roc> one nice thing about rr is that mostly it uses stable interfaces
[23:26:03] <roc> syscall ABI, CPU architecture
[23:27:03] <roc> also, their syscall transaction stuff seems completely pointless
[23:27:10] <roc> I mean their filesystem transaction stuff
[23:27:43] <roc> programs don't write out temporary files and read them back very often
[23:29:15] <roc> maybe they have programs that do... but if your filesystem can snapshot blocks, you can just use that

[23:40:06] <roc> burg: could be, but then, why the filesystem transaction stuff?
[23:40:17] <burg> MSFT has its own tool like rr, based on binary rewriting and other dark magic. It's the big stick that people use for fuzz bugs.
[23:41:21] <burg> It's probably easier to prototype the VM approach in their brand new CLR than in a very old JS code base
[23:42:31] <roc> I've heard about that tool. Wish they'd say more about it.
[23:42:38] <roc> binary rewriting is the wrong way to go though :-)
[23:42:54] <burg> But I have doubts that they can actually checkpoint DOM state and press play and have it work in nontrivial web apps
[23:44:58] <burg> Just based on how hard it is to make it no deterministic at browser VM level without checkpoints
[23:48:23] <burg> roc: they have published various parts of their rewriting/check pointing framework but not the tool. And you have to read between the lines since it's all couched as security research. btw, I'm finally graduating, and actively looking for something to do next.
[23:48:55] <roc> what do you want to do next?
[23:49:39] <burg> Invent/ship the future of debugging!
[23:50:46] <roc> mmmmmm
[23:57:46] <roc> I want someone to extend rr with replay-time code instrumentation (e.g. using VEX), split an execution into chunks and parallel build a Chronomancer-like omniscient debugging database and UI
[23:58:31] <roc> just need to find someone to pay you to build that :-)
[23:58:59] <burg>  That is the logical next thesis topic in this area ;-)
