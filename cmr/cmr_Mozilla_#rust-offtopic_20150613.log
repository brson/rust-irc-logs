[09:18:57] <bluss> oh the if (+)(E, E) thing?
[09:19:02] <eddyb> yes
[09:19:12] <eddyb> that's E: Add(E) in Rust
[09:19:16] <eddyb> wait, no, E: Add<E> :P
[09:19:22] <eddyb> I guess I'm missing the output type
[09:19:33] <eddyb> it's a first approximation, anyways
[09:19:51] <eddyb> the thing to note is that none of it is, well, typed
[09:20:09] <eddyb> actually, I'm lying, E: Type is
[09:20:34] <eddyb> let me just remove that :D
[09:20:45] <eddyb> there, it's not typed
[09:22:32] <eddyb> Point(Type) { x: f32, y: f64 } is a valid expression :D

[09:26:34] <Quxxy> eddyb: Perhaps something functional?
[09:27:37] <Quxxy> Well, it's taken me a *few hours*, but I've gotten Iron's hello world to compile
[09:28:15] <bstrie> hilarious, `try!` in swift is rust's `Result::unwrap`
[09:28:37] <Quxxy> To quote Clark Grisworld: Hallelujah! Holy shit! Where's the Tylenol?
[09:28:39] <bstrie> and `try` in swift is vaguely rust's `try!`

[09:34:21] <bstrie> their new exception system is certainly interesting
[09:34:52] <bstrie> it's like if you took the error handling from rust and go and java and made a baby
[09:34:53] <eddyb> do they have something like `T except E` for automatic Result<T, E> exception threading?
[09:35:14] <eddyb> where `throw e;` is `return Err(e);`
[09:35:30] <eddyb> and `return x;` is `return Ok(x);`
[09:35:55] <eddyb> and calling a function with `except E` does `try!` automatically
[09:36:10] <eddyb> I could see that working in Rust
[09:36:11] <bstrie> eddyb: well it's exceptions so that part's implicit, but it forces you to annotate throwing functions with `throw` and you can only call throwing functions with `try`
[09:36:15] <bstrie> eddyb: https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/ErrorHandling.html
[09:36:45] <eddyb> looks dynamic by default
[09:36:48] <eddyb> or strictly dynamic
[09:38:10] <bstrie> right, but only apple pretends that swift is a systems language, the swift designers know that this is an application language
[09:39:50] <eddyb> Swift is what Java should have been
[09:39:57] <eddyb> it's *that* old
[09:40:23] <Quxxy> bstrie: No, you see, *any* new language that compiles to native code is a system language
[09:40:39] <eddyb> maybe even more so. would have definitely been amazing to have Swift instead of Java back in the day
[09:40:57] <Quxxy> Or at least, has to *claim* that until people realise it's bullshit and then they quietly retract that remark, saying something vague about how they were using a different *definition* of "system language"; you just hadn't heard of it

[09:45:03] <fkaa> close enough? https://github.com/skybrian/Gongo
[09:45:43] <bstrie> the readme makes my brain hurt
[09:45:51] <bstrie> This is a simple computer program that plays Go, but not very well. I
[09:45:51] <bstrie> wrote it while learning the Go programming language. It's mostly of interest
[09:45:54] <bstrie> as a starting point for people who might want to write Go robots in Go,
[09:45:57] <bstrie> and as a example of a reasonably well-commented program written in the
[09:45:59] <bstrie> Go language.
[09:46:21] <fkaa> the "Go" trips me up
[09:46:24] <bstrie> I hope they never rewrite Rust in Rust
[09:47:13] <eddyb> Quxxy: daemon spawner!
[09:48:16] <bstrie> anyway, the bottom line is that I think swift strikes an interesting middle ground between checked exceptions and Result
[09:48:44] <bstrie> but also I'm betting that `2/0` doesn't throw exceptions, so they must now have two systems for dynamic runtime failure

[17:50:08] <cmr> bombless: that's actually not considered a breaking change by https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1105-api-evolution.md
[17:50:17] <cmr> since it's fixed with a simple UFCS i32::zero()
[17:52:02] <cmr> I'm not sure if that extends to the compiler though.
[17:55:36] <bombless> That looks like dangerous signal for me... since I don't want Rust to be something like Scala which sounds like your code keep breaking when you update. I'm not sure if this impression to Scala is correct or fair though.
[17:56:30] <bombless> wierd, normally what I think is, I don't care breaking-change as I keep focusing what happens on master branch...
[17:56:33] <cmr> I haven't had any breakages in my own code or the libraries I depend on, tracking nightly.

[18:11:47] <eddyb> WindowsBunny: so your plan to get rid of the CRT dependency
[18:12:01] <eddyb> seems similar to using syscalls directly on unix
[18:12:09] <WindowsBunny> eddyb: We're pretty close to not needing the CRT
[18:12:19] <WindowsBunny> eddyb: But not using the CRT, and using syscalls directly are not the same
[18:12:19] *** Quits: swgillespie (swgillespie@moz-rn1.vmq.232.104.IP) (Quit: My MacBook Pro has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[18:12:45] <bombless> dealing with floating numbers sounds painful
[18:12:49] <WindowsBunny> eddyb: Of the CRT with my HeapAlloc PR, we only use memcmp/memmove/memcpy/memset/strlen and all the math shit
[18:13:14] <WindowsBunny> math stuff can potentially be replaced with libm
[18:13:19] <eddyb> I know they're not the same
[18:13:26] <eddyb> but linux syscalls are stable and WINAPI is stable
[18:13:47] <WindowsBunny> WinAPI is something that can be very much relied on
[18:13:50] <eddyb> you can't go lower without inflicting damage on portability
[18:14:53] <eddyb> (and avoiding glibc isn't exactly great for a few other things. I don't like the whole libm issue. x64 can do a bunch of those functions in hardware *guaranteed* and so can ARM with hardfloat)
[18:15:06] <cmr> eddyb: it's not similar to using syscalls directly
[18:15:15] <cmr> the CRT isn't the win32 api
[18:15:31] <cmr> there's no analogy on windows to the split beween the CRT and the winapi
[18:15:32] <WindowsBunny> There's three layers on Windows, the CRT, the win32 subsystem, and NT
[18:15:55] <eddyb> cmr: I was comparing CRT to glibc
[18:15:57] <cmr> since on unix the CRT *is* the operating system api
[18:16:02] <cmr> eddyb: winapi is glibc.
[18:16:09] <eddyb> well
[18:16:21] <WindowsBunny> the win32 subsystem is an entirely user mode thing built on top of NT, and NT is the kernel syscall whatever thing
[18:16:24] <cmr> Not literally, because it doesn't provide the C functions, but the C functions aren't "native" on windows.
[18:16:48] <WindowsBunny> The CRT for the most part is just expensive wrappers
[18:16:50] <eddyb> well, I know all these things you're saying already
[18:16:57] <eddyb> guess I chose a weird way to phrase it
[18:17:04] <cmr> I suspect you know, so I'm not sure why you're still drawing the incorrect comparison :P
[18:17:17] <eddyb> it's only incorrect if you're too strict!
[18:17:22] *** Quits: eerie (eerie@moz-2u3428.red.bezeqint.net) (Connection closed)
[18:17:24] <WindowsBunny> the math functions and the memcpy + friends, do have their own optimized implementations
[18:17:28] <cmr> it's only correct if you're wrong! :P
[18:17:43] <eddyb> WindowsBunny: LLVM can handle some of the mem* functions
[18:18:00] <cmr> eddyb: I think you're confused, since LLVM *lowers* to those mem* functions
[18:18:11] <WindowsBunny> eddyb: But if LLVM decides to lower to the mem* function
[18:18:13] <cmr> sounds like we just need to use compiler-rt on windows
[18:18:15] <WindowsBunny> Then that function needs to exist
[18:18:22] <WindowsBunny> cmr: We do use compiler-rt on windows!
[18:18:23] <eddyb> WindowsBunny: yes. we have rlibc for this
[18:18:23] <cmr> and openlibm.
[18:18:42] <eddyb> anyways, what I meant is, you can't go lower than WINAPI on windows and you can't go lower than syscalls on linux, if you want some form of stability
[18:19:13] <eddyb> I personally dislike having any C code being ran in my statically linked binary
[18:19:46] <eddyb> but, ugh, dynamic linking makes me forget about any desire to remove depedencies on anything
[18:19:49] <WindowsBunny> eddyb: rlibc's implementations aren't exactly the best :P
[18:20:25] <eddyb> riiight
[18:20:34] <eddyb> WindowsBunny: they're the best LLVM can do by itself
[18:20:48] <cmr> not so, since we don't usually compile for the native CPU
[18:20:55] <cmr> they don't get fully vectorized

[18:22:46] <WindowsBunny> RtlCompareMemory!
[18:23:10] <WindowsBunny> (The compiler can optimize away a call to RtlZeroMemory, if it determines that the caller does not access that memory range again.)
[18:23:19] <WindowsBunny> hence why there is RtlSecureZeroMemory
[18:23:28] <eddyb> WindowsBunny: is it marked specially in the headers?
[18:24:02] <eddyb> God forbid MSVC hardcodes the symbol name

[21:05:21] <c74d> What in a Linux operating-system is supposed to detect display-brightness up/down key presses and adjust the display brightness accordingly?
[21:05:56] <cmr> c74d: the desktop manager or another program which listens and responds to key events.
[21:06:14] <c74d> Those keys worked for me on a ThinkPad running Gentoo Linux, but now they're not doing anything on this Inspiron running NixOS.
[21:06:40] <cmr> It depends on how the firmware handles them, whether it sends them as key events or just interprets them directly.
[21:06:41] <c74d> (Both in the kernel console with no graphical environment running.)
[21:07:05] <cmr> in the kernel's console you'll just need to write to the /sys devices directly.
[21:07:21] <cmr> Likely in /sys/class/backlight
[21:07:29] <c74d> I'm guessing it was the firmware handling the ThinkPad's backlight keys; I doubt Gentoo would be more inclined to automatically run some backlight daemon than NixOS.

[21:49:10] <c74d> it seems that it needs to have shell scripts set up in /etc to handle events like brightness key presses, but, in NixOS, such configuration is defined by the package, so I'd need to re-package it to re-configure it, and I don't want to bother.
[22:11:05] <c74d> Ugh, Bash doesn't have non-integer arithmetic?
[22:11:20] <c74d> -.-

[22:15:40] <cmr> c74d: I'm a fan of bc.
[22:16:51] <c74d> hm, I've used bc, but I didn't want to "shell out"... but in hindsight, if I don't want to shell out, I oughtn't use shell script.
[22:17:04] <cmr> indeed.
[22:17:39] <c74d> (I can get plenty-ish done in zsh without shelling out, though.)

[22:58:16] <c74d> ...I guess I could use nix-repl.
[23:02:31] <c74d> I guess I could use a "real" programming language... but does NixOS come with any of those?
[23:08:29] <c74d> It has... Perl. -.-
[23:08:58] <WindowsBunny> c74d: Any OS that doesn't come with Rust is terrible
[23:11:19] <Tiffany> I'm just happy that arch finally ships a core repo package of rust now that it's at 1.0
[23:12:39] <WindowsBunny> I wonder if Manishearth can convince Microsoft to include Rust in their Windows 10 package manager
[23:18:40] <blue_deref> WindowsBunny: Only if Rust switches to capitalized function names
[23:18:51] <blue_deref> WindowsBunny: And capitalized types
[23:19:02] <blue_deref> WindowsBunny: And capitalized instance variables
[23:19:14] <blue_deref> well, types are already capitalized in Rust
[23:21:21] <WindowsBunny> blue_deref: xD

[23:51:02] <Quxxy> But to answer the question implicit in your choice of greeting: back still hurts :(
[23:51:22] * WindowsBunny nibbles on Quxxy's back
[23:51:30] <Quxxy> Is that an euphemism, or are you IRCing and driving?
[23:51:41] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: I am IRCing and driving
[23:51:48] <Quxxy> Noooooo
[23:51:51] <Tobba> so when making this linux boot protocol shim I was hoping to get my kernel working under pxelinux
[23:52:00] <Tobba> currently pxelinux is the only thing it's broken on, and it's triggering a bug in it
[23:52:01] <Tobba> fuck.
[23:52:11] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: Don't worry, I only reply when the car is stopped
[23:52:28] <Quxxy> Tobba: :(
[23:55:24] <Tobba> I'm not sure what the heck is wrong with the syslinux loader in the first place
[23:55:33] <Tobba> it just jumps to invalid memory before reaching any part of my code
[23:55:46] <Tobba> but it worked partially before
