[00:00:43] <cmr> brson: constructor for what?
[00:02:12] <benh> box(Rc) fail!()?
[00:02:26] <brson> cmr: for whatever value is being boxed. 'constructor' in quotes
[00:02:50] <cmr> would anything special need to happen besides normal failure?
[00:03:57] <brson> cmr: the constructor runs after the uninitialized space for it has been allocated
[00:04:11] <brson> so that space needs to be freed, but it's not a valid value
[00:04:16] <cmr> hm, yes.

[01:39:53] <acrichto> or ping me on irc...
[01:39:58] <acrichto> hahaha
[01:40:18] <acrichto> bors is dead, long live larsbors!
[01:42:14] <acrichto> ./configure in a windows vm takes like 20 minutes
[01:42:16] <acrichto> this is absurd
[01:42:27] <ChrisMorgan> !
[01:42:37] <acrichto> or I'm doing something terribly wrong
[01:43:17] <larsberg> acrichto: that's how long it took in my windows vm (on a macbook pro)
[01:43:23] <acrichto> :(
[01:43:29] <larsberg> I was thinking, "I'll check for the header files for you!" about 5 minutes in
[01:43:39] <cmr> lol
[01:44:22] <Luqman> creating processes are slow on windows afaik and configure does that a lot
[01:45:44] <acrichto> unresolved name: libc::ECONNREFUSED
[01:45:45] <acrichto> yay!
[01:47:31] <strcat> acrichto: what do we set as the OS X target?
[01:47:35] <strcat> as in the minimum supported version
[01:47:44] <strcat> I think if you build on 10.7 it doesn't support 10.6 by default
[01:48:01] <acrichto> agrif said he was building on 10.6
[01:48:07] <acrichto> so it wasn't cross compiling across osx versions
[01:48:09] <strcat> but isn't it the snapshot that's not working?
[01:48:11] <acrichto> (that was my first thought too)
[01:48:14] <acrichto> hmm
[01:48:19] * ChrisMorgan wishes there was an ECONFUSED
[01:48:21] <acrichto> bingo
[01:48:32] <strcat> acrichto: right so 10.6 had slow thread-local data
[01:48:35] <acrichto> strcat: wait no, llc didn't work
[01:48:45] <ChrisMorgan> Is `const` valid anywhere in Rust any more, or is it always "obsolete syntax"?
[01:48:48] <acrichto> if llc didn't work, then LLVM just doesn't support thread_local on 10.6

[01:50:32] <strcat> acrichto: afaict it does, there's a branch in the code
[01:50:45] <acrichto> oh man I was having trouble just finding it
[01:50:48] <acrichto> it special cases on 10.6?
[01:51:34] <strcat> well I'm looking in gcc because I couldn't find it in LLVM ;p
[01:51:44] <strcat> maybe clang never did
[01:51:51] <acrichto> interesting
[01:52:02] <acrichto> they'd probably be interested in knowing about this
[01:52:09] <strcat> I don't think they'll care about 10.6
[01:52:11] <acrichto> I would highly suspect LLVM due to the raw llvm assembly not compiling
[01:52:12] <cmr> I would assume they know.
[01:52:31] <strcat> they also only support MSVC++ 2012 iirc
[01:52:48] <acrichto> although they haven't supported like any windows at all before this, right?
[01:53:05] <acrichto> #[cfg(sindows)]
[01:53:08] <acrichto> that is not right
[01:53:19] <Luqman> i think the way tls was handled in os x changed between 10.6 and 10.7
[01:53:35] <strcat> Luqman: yeah, but gcc supports it in 10.6
[01:53:35] <brson> acrichto: lol
[01:53:38] <strcat> and apparently LLVM doesn't
[01:53:58] <acrichto> maybe we could add target_os = "bad_macos"
[01:54:14] <cmr> Or, "bad_apple"
[01:54:16] <cmr> because I mean
[01:54:17] <acrichto> lol

[01:56:58] <acrichto> hopefully that will unbreak the rest of the queue
[01:57:22] <strcat> yeah I guess clang never supported TLS on 10.6
[01:57:24] <strcat> were they not using it yet?
[01:57:28] * strcat looks
[01:58:24] <strcat> 10.6 was released in august 2009, clang v1 was released in october 2009
[01:58:27] <strcat> so yeah, they weren't using it then
[01:59:30] <Luqman> i think you could get a gcc that had emulated tls that just called out to the pthread stuff
[02:00:06] <Luqman> and i don't think clang/llvm ever did that
[02:01:08] <Luqman> looks like 10.8 is when they got non-emulated tls according to https://plus.google.com/112211073672449541272/posts/bgsavM75uvX

[02:04:05] <dbaupp> acrichto: random thought: would you hate fmt::Default -> fmt::Format, so we can have a #[deriving] mode with a sensible name?
[02:05:15] <strcat> what's the oldest OS X release apple still does security updates for?
[02:05:28] <acrichto> dbaupp: I've been hesitant for a #[deriving(Format)] because that seems like {:?}, although if we're very uncomfortable with {:?} then I may be able to get persuaded for the deriving mode
[02:06:33] <dbaupp> acrichto: we should probably remove the ToStr one, at least?
[02:06:50] <dbaupp> (given that logic, and the fact that ToStr is subpar.)
[02:07:30] <cmr> Is there anything stopping it fromb eing #[deriving(fmt::Default)] ?
[02:07:33] <acrichto> hm
[02:07:33] <ChrisMorgan> nmatsakis: would you like me to make a PR of augmented-assignment for convenient commenting?
[02:07:33] <acrichto> I like how fmt::D:efault reads
[02:08:09] <Luqman> strcat: wikipedia suggests 10.6
[02:08:09] <nmatsakis> ChrisMorgan: not necessary
[02:08:13] <dbaupp> cmr: yes, doesn't parse now.
[02:08:25] <ChrisMorgan> nmatsakis: OK
[02:08:28] <nmatsakis> ChrisMorgan: it's on my to do list to pull in your branch and see if I can hack up trans 
[02:08:50] * ChrisMorgan needs to rebase it again since he fixed lang_items to use a macro
[02:09:10] <nmatsakis> ChrisMorgan: ok the less rebasing I have to do the better ;)
[02:09:22] <acrichto> dbaupp: hm, so if we remove the ToStr trait (which I think we want to?) it's still convenient to have to_str() sometimes, so maybe this is a separate Format trait which provides to_str for T: fmt::Default 
[02:09:28] <ChrisMorgan> But just now, I'm finishing off this ohcount parser for Rust, disambiguating RenderScript away so that they'll accept it...
[02:09:51] <dbaupp> acrichto: why can't we just have to_str as a default method on fmt::Default?

[04:58:11] <acrichto> dbaupp: yes it depends on my PR going through
[04:58:20] <acrichto> my PR is creating rlibs, but the current makefiles aren't cleaning them
[04:58:24] <acrichto> which means stale metadata is getting used
[04:58:40] <acrichto> hopefully it'll land this time, I don't understand the rustpkg failures
[04:58:47] <dbaupp> ah, I see.
[04:58:49] <acrichto> I ended up just ignoring it :\

[07:14:25] <ChrisMorgan> I believe Sphinx is the right tool for the job, and I think I probably need to make a Rust domain <http://sphinx-doc.org/domains.html> to demonstrate why.
