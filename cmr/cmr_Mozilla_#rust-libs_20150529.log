[15:42:57] <aturon> SimonSapin: as with many things, the post-1.0 policy here is a work-in-progress. for this kind of API, i suspect the bar for stabilization will be pretty low -- it's a small bit of surface area that's very consistent with the rest of std. ideally, we'd see some use in crates beyond your own :)
[15:43:07] <aturon> we plan to have a kind of "nomination" process for stabilization,
[15:43:16] *** Quits: Rym (y@moz-h2o.mso.205.31.IP) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[15:43:17] <aturon> along with a dashboard of unstable features to appear in our weekly report
[15:43:41] <aturon> and, in case you haven't seen, we're also planning to have a "final comment period" on APIs that have been nominated for stabilization --
[15:43:54] <SimonSapin> seeing use before stabilizing is a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem
[15:43:57] <aturon> a chance for people to raise any final issues, and to get visibility on the API, before we commit to it "forever"
[15:44:17] <aturon> SimonSapin: indeed. this is a tough problem, because there's no point to having nightly if people aren't going to use it,
[15:44:28] <aturon> but we still want to somehow get experience with new features before freezing them
[15:44:46] <aturon> to be clear, i'm not saying widespread usage is a hard requirement or anything
[15:45:00] <aturon> but at the same time we want to be careful about not stabilizing "pet" APIs
[15:45:05] <SimonSapin> I strongly prefer doing stuff on crates.io, but in this case any work around I could imagine to not having access to private fields was a horrible idea :]
[15:45:19] <aturon> heh, yes
[15:46:02] <aturon> sorry to not have a more clear answer, this is something the subteam hasn't really settled on yet
[15:46:08] <SimonSapin> I’ve seen a RFC for offsetof, which if it works on private fields would make it a slightly less bad idea
[15:47:35] <SimonSapin> though it’s still playing with fire, since private stuff is not stable
[15:48:49] <aturon> yes, i'd still be pretty uncomfortable with that as the right way to do things. we need for nightly to be more acceptable :)
[15:50:22] <SimonSapin> I’m kind of in-between as a library author: I don’t mind the unstability of nightly myself, but I want the train model to be successful and so I want to contribute to stable Rust to have a rich ecosystem
[15:51:21] <SimonSapin> When talking about the train system and stability to people, I’ve heard several times the concern that it’s all pointless if everyone is on nigthly and "nothing" works on stable
[15:51:51] <aturon> right, which was our initial fear :) but i think it'd now be easy to go too far in the other direction

[15:52:28] <aturon> Cargo features are one of the ways we're hoping to bridge this divide, allowing your libs to live in both ecosystems and provide opt-ins to use of unstable features -- but of course that doesn't cover all use cases
[15:52:58] <SimonSapin> the other direction being stabilizing new std stuff before it’s ready?
[15:53:31] <aturon> yes, or put differently, having so much of the ecosystem on stable Rust that people are very reluctant to try unstable features

[17:08:26] <nmatsakis> at some time we discussed the idea of beta or alpha serving as a 'middle ground'
[17:08:31] <nmatsakis> aturon: SimonSapin: ^
[17:08:37] <nmatsakis> I'm still sort of unpersuaded that was a bad idea :)
[17:08:44] <nmatsakis> that is, exposing some curated set of features that are deemed "close"
[17:09:00] <aturon> nmatsakis: ah right, but still require explicit opt-in
[17:09:02] <nmatsakis> I guess that's pretty clsoe to just using nightly tho
[17:09:04] <nmatsakis> yes
[17:09:19] <nmatsakis> probably in the end just having a healthy number of nightly users is good
[17:09:31] <nmatsakis> and making it easy to "choose nightly" in cargo
[17:10:13] <nmatsakis> (but of course not too many...)
[17:10:17] <aturon> heh :)
[17:10:31] <aturon> i think the library author perspective is the most difficult one
[17:10:33] <nmatsakis> I guess the advantage of having an alpha or something
[17:10:40] <nmatsakis> basically the risk TO US
[17:10:43] <aturon> because there's a strong incentive to make your lib work as broadly as possible
[17:10:47] <nmatsakis> is that if some immature feature sees too muc use
[17:10:48] *** Joins: Rym (y@moz-h2o.mso.205.31.IP)
[17:10:49] <nmatsakis> it's hard to change
[17:10:55] <aturon> right
[17:10:58] <nmatsakis> alpha lets us minimize that by saying "you really don't want nightly"
[17:11:19] <nmatsakis> and that way we only expose those features where we are ok with some amount of lock in cause we think it's basically ready
[17:11:46] <nmatsakis> from library users POV, yes, it's tricky, it seems like making it easier to have code that builds with and w/o unstable things is best we can do?
[17:11:56] <aturon> there's still the question of: how do we know it's basically ready if people aren't using it?
[17:12:04] <nmatsakis> well, it conforms to RFC
[17:12:07] <nmatsakis> and is well-tested
[17:12:31] <aturon> sure, that's a good minimum bar
[17:12:34] <nmatsakis> at least one user is happy ;)
[17:12:36] <aturon> hahaha
[17:12:39] <nmatsakis> if we can't find anyone
[17:12:41] <nmatsakis> who likes a feature enough
[17:12:43] <nmatsakis> to use it 
[17:12:47] <nmatsakis> what does that tell you?
[17:13:04] <nmatsakis> (to use it even when on nightly...)
[17:13:05] <aturon> well, we almost always have at least one fan
[17:13:13] <aturon> (the person who did the RFC in the first place)
[17:13:35] <nmatsakis> indeed. anyway, nothing is easy.
[17:13:53] <nmatsakis> didnt' mean to suggest otherwise :)
[17:14:20] <nmatsakis> just thinking that some middle ground between nightly and alpha MAY help here, though I think that to try and adopt it would be premature something-ization
[17:14:32] <aturon> yes, agreed on all counts
[17:14:42] <aturon> and i think you're right that reducing friction in using nightly is a good step to take now

[17:16:18] <sfackler> not sure if I talked to you about it, but an "unstable 1.x" release would be nice
[17:16:45] <steveklabnik> what is an unstable 1.x release
[17:16:57] <sfackler> so projects that need unstable features have an easy version to reference rather than "the nightly on 6-12-15"
[17:17:11] <sfackler> steveklabnik: the same commit as stable 1.x but with unstable features enabled
[17:17:39] <steveklabnik> hmmmm
[17:17:48] <steveklabnik> i have a gut level noooooo to that idea, but i'm not sure why :)
[17:23:54] <aturon> sfackler: so, one point that wycats has raised is that the train cutoff is completely arbitrary for unstable features --
[17:24:08] <aturon> that is, they could be in a totally weird state at the 1.X release
[17:24:24] <aturon> but i think that's partly why nmatsakis was talking about a sort of "in between" notion of stability
[17:24:40] <aturon> (but that also introduces yet more process complexity)
[17:24:48] <nmatsakis> yes; it may be good enough to have a 
[17:24:55] <nmatsakis> very visible web page showing the "progress" for each feature

[17:25:28] <nmatsakis> (so people can avoid those we deem "super unstable")
[17:28:37] <aturon> nmatsakis: yeah, that's another good step we can take right now. i'm working today on "sharding" various unstable lib features from things like `std_misc` into more meaningful groups, and i'll be creating issues for them
[17:29:12] <aturon> steveklabnik: oh, which reminds me -- i know this will make you a bit sad -- but we're heading in the direction of keeping an issue open for each unstable feature until stabilization happens
[17:29:18] <sfackler> the nice thing about having an unstable 1.x is that it's the *exact same code* as stable 1.x - i.e. the same known bugs, the same workarounds, etc
[17:29:27] <sfackler> it's in some way "less sketchy" than some random nightly
[17:29:30] <aturon> steveklabnik: which can also serve as a point for the final comment period on the impl
[17:29:34] *** Quits: Rym (y@moz-h2o.mso.205.31.IP) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[17:29:56] <aturon> sfackler: fair enough. and anyway, 1.x is then really just a shorthand for a particular nightly date
[17:29:57] <steveklabnik> aturon: yeah, makes some sense. we've already gone from 1900 -> 2000 issues just from the release, so... oh well
[17:30:19] <sfackler> aturon: it's a bit different since we end up with backports to the beta branch etc
[17:30:27] <steveklabnik> people have also not really been keeping up with the 'feature requests in the rfc repo' thing
[17:30:46] <aturon> steveklabnik: you mean, they've been filing feature requests to the rust repo?
[17:31:00] <steveklabnik> there's just a lot of gray area

[17:32:35] <steveklabnik> speaking of which, it would be really nice to knock out a bunch of ICEs
[17:32:40] <aturon> for me, i worry less about the total issue count as i do about visibility into different kinds of issues; i guess that means tagging is super important
[17:32:48] <steveklabnik> i guess it'd be nice to knock out everything ;)
[17:32:49] <aturon> steveklabnik: arielb1 has been working on some, i believe
[17:32:55] <steveklabnik> yeah, they have :)
[17:33:03] <steveklabnik> it's just something we take heat for
[17:33:15] <steveklabnik> 'look, rustc itself has over 200 crashing bugs, lol rust does'nt really help you write safe code'
[17:34:18] <aturon> steveklabnik: trollers gonna troll
[17:34:20] <steveklabnik> or 'rust literally has thousands of bugs open, i would not be comfortable actually using that in production'
[17:34:45] <steveklabnik> it's trollish but it also does have some degree of a point. rustc is special in this regard, it's true, but still
[17:35:24] <steveklabnik> it will be nice to have more modern rust projects in existance

[18:03:52] <acrichto> and it didn't make sense to me that you hand a fd down that's just closed (b/c you may want access to it as well)
[18:10:49] <aturon> acrichto: sorry in mtg, bbiab
[18:12:43] <eternaleye> acrichto: Sleeping for less than expected caused one of the nastier leap-second bugs in recent history...
[18:13:17] <eternaleye> acrichto: (timeouts of less than 1s getting rewritten to 0, resulting in busy-looping for 100%CPU)
[18:17:02] <acrichto> eternaleye: :(

[18:36:03] <eternaleye> acrichto: There was also a (sporadic) kernelspace _hang_ for the same reason
[18:36:35] <acrichto> eternaleye: whoa
[18:37:00] <eternaleye> acrichto: So yeah, sleeping less than expected can be really nasty.

[19:19:26] <cmr> carllerche: is it ill advised to implement mio::Evented myself?
[19:19:45] <cmr> carllerche: (I'm considering using Mio in my evdev library instead of select)
[19:20:46] * WindowsBunny wonders how carllerche is dealing with mio and windows
[19:21:01] <carllerche> WindowsBunny: slowly
[19:22:33] <carllerche> cmr: ummm... it should be fine?
[19:22:36] <carllerche> what do you want to define it on?
[19:22:53] <cmr> carllerche: just a `Device` type that I have, that wraps an evdev fd.
[19:23:04] <carllerche> cmr: it should be fine
[19:23:05] <cmr> carllerche: I'm asking because all the methods were marked #[doc(hidden)]
[19:23:17] <cmr> (which is generally a warning sign)
[19:23:22] <cmr> Ok
[19:23:58] <carllerche> hmmmm
[19:24:19] <carllerche> cmr: ah, I think I've been meaning to add a AsRawFd wrapper struct
[19:24:22] <carllerche> that makes it evented
[19:24:34] <cmr> That'd be handy for me!
[19:26:24] <carllerche> cmr: https://github.com/carllerche/mio/blob/master/src/sys/unix/io.rs#L13-L21
[19:26:30] <carllerche> does  Io work for you?
[19:26:43] <carllerche> it can be tweaked otherwise and / or a separate construct
[19:27:32] <cmr> carllerche: I think I'd prefer an impl of Evented for E: AsRawFd.
[19:27:57] <cmr> (So that my users could pass a &Device straight to mio, rather than having to have a method or other wrapper)
[19:28:22] <carllerche> cmr: well, that wouldn't work due to coherence i think 
[19:28:35] <carllerche> you would need an EventedFd wrapper
[19:28:39] <carllerche> i think...
[19:29:03] <cmr> Maybe
[19:29:14] * cmr not intimately familiar with coherence
[19:30:09] <carllerche> cmr: me neither :P
[19:30:51] <carllerche> WindowsBunny: i was on vacation, going to hopefully get back into it
