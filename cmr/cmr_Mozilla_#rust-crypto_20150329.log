[00:55:11] <Ilari> Yay, seems like gnutls added experimential support for AEAD #29 (Chacha20-Poly1305) for TLS.
[00:57:30] <Ilari> It is not compatible with the Chacha20-Poly1305 in chrome (and the ciphersuite IDs are different).
[01:02:44] <Ilari> Ugh, running verification tests in debug mode... *SLOW*.
[01:03:48] <tiffany> valgrind has a lot of false positives for me
[01:04:19] <tiffany> it doesn't understand swapbuffers
[01:06:10] <Ilari> Well, I get some "false positives" from rust runtime (test code).
[01:06:52] <tiffany> do you think chrome will switch to the new suite?
[01:07:59] <Ilari> Will probably support both for some time.
[01:08:39] <tiffany> hmm
[01:09:14] <tiffany> is it just android which has chacha20-poly1305?
[01:13:52] <Ilari> I think it is Chrome on all platforms (but non-android is unlikely to prefer it).
[01:15:28] <Ilari> Well, if you have old enough computer, it will prefer it, even on amd64.
[01:27:07] <tiffany> I have chrome 38 on linux and it uses AES_128_GCM on youtube and google

[18:42:26] <tiffany> what the hell is with telegram's encryption
[18:42:33] <tiffany> https://core.telegram.org/techfaq
[18:47:56] <Ilari> Reliability on weak connections? UDP-based protocol with retransmissions. Fast? There are fast standard algorithms.
[18:49:06] <Ilari> I have seen serious encryption run at 1GB+ per second.
[18:50:21] <bascule> lololol
[18:50:47] <bascule> https://core.telegram.org/mtproto/auth_key
[18:50:49] <tiffany> I really doubt that any scheme this guy could come up with would be slow enough to be the bottleneck instead of the user's internet connection
[18:51:06] <bascule> ^^^ cool protocol
[18:51:52] <Ilari> Yeah, STM-64 or better Internet connections on individual computers tend to be umm... Somewhat rare.
[18:52:47] <Ilari> And if individual computer has such thing, it likely has quite a few more than 4 CPU cores.
[18:53:16] <tiffany> I wonder how many cores a run of the mill multi-million-dollar IBM mainframe has
[19:00:00] <Ilari> Probably a lot. I think there are thingies that can pack thoursands of cores into a single rack.
[19:01:00] <tiffany> yeah, oracle sells servers which have 4 SPARC CPU sockets each, and then each CPU has 16 cores
[19:01:22] <tiffany> I think they were 4U on account of having 16 PCIe slots
[19:03:53] <Ilari> Also, looked up how many cores Top500 #1 is reported to have: 3,120,000.
[19:04:18] <tiffany> ah yeah, tianhe-2
[19:04:28] <Tobba> christ
[19:04:42] <Ilari> Also, 1000TB of RAM.
[19:04:45] <Tobba> I can think of like 3 problems that can be parallelized that far
[19:04:50] <Tobba> what do they even use that for
[19:04:52] <tiffany> a big gob of xeons and phis
[19:05:31] <Tobba> I guess a lot of big simulations just boil down to massive mapreduces
[19:05:43] <tiffany> tobba: climate modelling, bioinformatics, astronomy
[19:05:54] <Ilari> And if one can't use full power for one thing, run multiple at once.
[19:06:21] <tiffany> you can also run multiple different jobs if you can't parallelize across the whole thing
[19:07:26] <Ilari> Wonder how fast that thing could compute higher-security minimal-parameter hyperelliptic surface. A few hours?
[19:09:19] <tiffany> it probably costs a hella lot of money to rent it, though
[19:11:25] <Ilari> Also, power probably costs a lot alone: 17.8MW. And that is going to generate lots of heat that needs to be removed, making the total power consumption much higher.
[19:17:24] <tiffany> http://top500.org/statistics/efficiency-power-cores/ the ones with coprocessors are more power efficient
[19:18:46] <Ilari> Yeah, high-performance CPUs are well-known not to be very power-efficient.

[19:32:52] <Ilari> Could be fun to have "your web browser does not support strong encryption" banner. :->
[19:35:35] <Ilari> Given if web browser does not signal support for any AEAD ciphers.
[20:21:45] <Ilari> Of course with mentions of "hackers" obtaining all sorts of data. :->
[20:21:56] <Ilari> Or "cybercriminals"
[20:24:55] <Ilari> (Since I don't suppose there are "cyberterrorists") :-> :->
[20:26:34] <tiffany> there was once a time when I would make fun of anyone prefixing something with 'cyber'
[20:26:56] <tiffany> because the only time I saw it used was by educational material from the early 90s, and by jaded librarians at my school
[20:28:56] <tiffany> apparently it's ripped from cybernetics, which comes from greek kubernētēs which means governor
[20:31:39] <Ilari> Lol... wrapping arithmetic ops apparently aren't marked stable. :-)

[23:08:36] <bascule> umm
[23:08:52] <bascule> with current client cert UX, the first thing that your browser is going to do is pop up a dialog asking you what client cert you want to use
[23:09:32] <bascule> has this guy ever used client certs with a browser before?
[23:09:41] <bascule> it's terrible from a UX perspective
[23:09:54] <bascule> but from a security perspective, it's a very noisy attack
[23:10:18] <bascule> plus even if I were using client certs (which I don't, because the UX is so bad) I would only use it as one of at least two factors
[23:10:26] <Ilari> Also, what browser has so low-friction usability for client certs that any bank in their right minds would attempt to use client certs? Also, the requests are explicitly marked as http://.
[23:10:33] <bascule> hahahahahaha
[23:10:35] <bascule> yeah exactly
[23:10:41] <bascule> nobody uses client certs because the UX is so bad
[23:12:38] <Ilari> I have tried to make client certs work on web once...
[23:14:52] <Ilari> For non-web, I think I have tried thrice and succeeded thrice.

[23:24:26] <bascule> FIDO seems ok
[23:24:28] <Ilari> These certainly aren't even strong amateurs.
[23:24:39] <tiffany> I use client certs for logging into irc
[23:24:42] <bascule> FIDO is at at least designing their protocols around the web
[23:24:52] <bascule> we use client certs for all S2S communication at Square

[23:25:49] <bascule> what's nice about the FIDO Alliance protocols is they respect the same origin policy
[23:25:59] <bascule> and derive a unique keypair per origin
[23:26:45] <Ilari> Saw that "gemalto" thread, where FIDO folks were slamming the proposal for not respecting SOP?

[23:27:09] <bascule> probably Brad Hill? ;)
[23:27:13] <bascule> tiffany: yes
[23:27:21] <bascule> U2F specifically with Yubikeys
[23:27:41] <tiffany> I wonder what I could use a yubikey for
[23:27:51] <lahwran> so what can be done to get competent people doing things about shitty broadly-deployed crypto?
[23:28:12] <bascule> tiffany: a second factor to e.g. Google, airgapping SSH keys, airgapping GPG keys
[23:28:15] <bascule> those are the main uses
[23:28:24] <tiffany> oh, you can use it with ssh and gpg?
[23:28:31] <bascule> with a NEO or NEO-n, yeah
[23:28:46] <tiffany> nice
[23:29:11] <lahwran> yubikeys are the things where you write the key to the device, and then it can't be read back off, right?
[23:29:13] <cmr> I also use the fixed-text mode to store my laptop's disk encryption key
[23:29:23] <cmr> lahwran: that is one of their features
[23:29:24] <bascule> lahwran: yep
[23:29:36] <lahwran> ssh/gpg/etc just talks to the device
[23:29:45] <bascule> you can either load keys on them or generate keys directly on the device
[23:29:54] <bascule> keys go in, keys don't come out ;)
[23:30:02] <bascule> unless there's sidechannel attacks ;)
[23:30:23] <lahwran> I'm not sure I understand what you're saying
[23:30:29] <tiffany> are there yubikeys with the key printed right into the silicon?
[23:30:32] <lahwran> unless "there are"?
[23:30:36] <Ilari> I actually have smartcard with keys. Never got it to actually work.
[23:30:44] <lahwran> do you mean "unless someone finds the sidechannel attacks"
[23:31:01] <lahwran> (I am not actually sure if it's fundamentally that bad, but it's fashionable to be pessimistic about crypto)
[23:31:33] <tiffany> sidechannel attacks like sticking a high quality spectroscope next to the yubikey while it operates and pulling the key out of the EM leakage
[23:31:43] <lahwran> hehe
[23:32:06] <tiffany> the point being that there is no intended way to get the key off the yubikey through the software interface
[23:32:08] <lahwran> sidechannel attacks like putting it under a microscope?
[23:32:49] <tiffany> well, if you can change the key that means it has some kind of NVRAM rather than hardcoded silicon
[23:33:02] <bascule> tiffany: that's how the U2F root secret works
[23:33:05] <tiffany> so unless your microscope can examine which power state each NAND cell is in, you won't have much luck there
[23:33:09] <bascule> however it's actually a symmetric key
[23:33:19] <lahwran> tiffany: I heard about something like this, where you can only write a key once
[23:33:22] <bascule> https://www.yubico.com/2014/11/yubicos-u2f-key-wrapping/
[23:33:31] <lahwran> because instead of storing it in NVRAM, it stores it by burning out diodes
[23:33:34] <lahwran> is that not the yubikey?
[23:33:44] <bascule> the master U2F secret for a yubikey is created at manufacturing time and can't be changed
[23:33:49] <bascule> it's similar to the UID key on an iPhone
[23:34:10] <lahwran> I'm trying to figure out how you'd be nsa-safe with a yubikey though
[23:34:17] <lahwran> don't you need to check that the hardware is what it says it is?
[23:34:19] <bascule> well
[23:34:25] <bascule> with GPG at least, you can use your own key
[23:34:28] <bascule> generated however you want
[23:34:32] <lahwran> which requires you to open it up and make sure it's structured the way it's supposed to be
[23:34:38] <bascule> sure
[23:35:51] <bascule> I know there are quantum mechanical processes to generate random keys at manufacturing time, although I'm guessing yubico does something a lot more mundane
[23:36:14] <bascule> that's why loading your own key is a lot more appealing imo
[23:36:26] <Ilari> Also, With Linux, one can write PAM thingies that do whatever one wants with authentication. On Windows, one must write an app for the smartcard. Ran into that years ago.
[23:36:27] <bascule> it at least answers the "where did this key come from?" question
[23:36:34] <bascule> heh
[23:37:35] <Ilari> One domain supported using certain type of smartcard for authentication onto their Linux workstations, but not for their Windows workstations. Due to that limitation.
[23:38:18] <bascule> Sun had amazing smartcard authentication for e.g. Sunray
[23:38:49] <Ilari> Yeah, I heard.
[23:43:20] <Ilari> Most of the time client certificates are involved in context of PKI, the amount of usability friction is incredible.
[23:45:57] <Ilari> Also, some fun quotes on p3 of https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/92/slides/slides-92-acme-3.pdf
[23:46:03] <bascule> Ilari: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sFk8rtuA_E
[23:48:41] <Ilari> Hmm... How much friction one needs before one needs a quantum theory to describe it? :->
[23:51:06] <Ilari> Hmm... Friction involves just two force vectors (force pressing the object and force resisting the motion). Those are forces, so there the limit when one needs full quantum theory is ~10^44N or so.
[23:53:28] <Ilari> Reminds me that someone made the observation that the threshold dose of LSD is about 1 plank mass (most plank units are either ridiculously small or ridiculously large. Plank mass is one of the execptions).
