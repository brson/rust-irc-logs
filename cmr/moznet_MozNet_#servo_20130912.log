[04:49:05] <tikue_> jdm: \O/ awesome, i was thinking about doing something like that

[04:50:01] <tikue_> jack: ah ok
[04:50:10] <jack> supposely they are sending us home with rough versions though. maybe i can send that around privately
[04:50:20] <tikue_> that'd be great -- if it's allowed of course
[04:51:26] <tikue_> i was trying to think of a use case the other day for a continuously looping javascript program, but it kind of seems like an anti-pattern in general no? i mean, at the very least servo can say "badly-coded ads won't crash me!" which is cool, but it'd also be cool to be able to come up with new ways to use the internet via this parallel capability
[04:51:58] <jdm> it's true
[04:52:13] <jack> tikue: it doens't have to be continously looping slowly or anything. it could be just a loaded system. or a page with a lot going on
[04:52:38] <tikue_> yeah true
[04:53:06] <jack> don't forget that things like indexeddb access are synchronous or used to be
[04:53:20] <jack> so all kinds of stuff can cause jank

[05:05:16] <jack> ah
[05:05:31] <jack> i have no idea what that is doing.
[05:05:50] <jack> does it just need extra parens?
[05:06:57] <jdm> let me see what rusti thinks
[05:07:25] <tikue_> the types aren't the same
[05:07:32] <tikue_> assignment is ()
[05:07:57] <jack> am i just the first person to use an IndexedGetter?
[05:08:05] <jdm> nope
[05:08:15] <jack> tikue is right though. parens don't help.
[05:08:16] <jdm> I think, at least
[05:08:40] <jdm> there's just something about this one that's special
[05:09:54] <jdm> jack: what you could try doing is changing wrapAndSetPointer around 1464
[05:10:11] <jdm> move wrapCall onto its own line and only check the result
[05:10:13] <jdm> that's a start
[05:12:30] *** Quits: bholley (anonymous@moz-FCAF9AAB.hsd1.ca.comcast.net) (Quit: bholley)
[05:12:33] <jdm> no, I have a better idea
[05:13:54] <jack> i'm trying your first one anyway :)
[05:14:22] <jack> well it doens't work obviously
[05:14:27] <jack> because i don't knowt he LHS
[05:14:51] <jack> wrapCall argument is already in LHS = RHS form so i can't do much about it.
[05:15:19] <jdm> jack: for line 1564 and 1567, return "*${jsvalPtr} = domstring_to_jsval(cx, &%s);\n%s" % (result, wrapAndSetPointer("${jsvalPtr}.is_null()"))
[05:15:22] <jdm> something like that
[05:15:44] <jdm> ie. perform the assignment beforehand and use a better condition for the wrapping call
[05:16:43] <jack> i don't need an extra scope there?
[05:16:53] <jack> {${jsvalPtr} ...
[05:17:25] <jack> nm i see what you did
[05:17:46] <jdm> granted, that will probably come up with ${jsvalPtr}.is_null() != 0
[05:18:50] <jdm> so we probably want is_not_null() as int
[05:19:46] <jdm> the final expression of !(ptr.is_not_null() as int != 0) hurts me inside
[05:20:00] <jack> yes.
[05:21:01] <jack> btw, that worked.

[05:21:51] <jdm> is there an easy way to turn on debug servo builds?

[18:22:29] <tikue> lbergstrom: are there any test pages that can cause pipeline failure? wanna play around with your branch

[18:23:09] <lbergstrom> src/test/html/summit-crash.html is a toplevel page
[18:23:35] <lbergstrom> src/test/html/summit.html contains an iframe with a link that will also load that page (for delayed Andreas-head-loading goodness)
[18:24:03] <tikue> ooh cool. does only the iframe crash?
[18:24:06] <lbergstrom> but you have to know the link is there because iframes after the first one currently don't render (but they're there and respond to hit testing)
[18:24:16] * tikue doesn't have servo on-hand atm
[18:24:19] <lbergstrom> yes, just the one iframe crashes and it's replace with Andreas in-place
[18:24:38] <tikue> lbergstrom: iframes after the first don't render?
[18:24:48] <tikue> that doesn't sound good
[18:25:05] <lbergstrom> yes, jdm is looking into some related issues
[18:25:15] <lbergstrom> I was planning to poke around as well once the change lands
[18:26:04] <tikue> lbergstrom: do you mean nested iframes after the first level? or do you mean any iframes at all
[18:26:30] <lbergstrom> I mean that if you have two iframes (no nesting involved), the second one does not display
[18:26:39] <tikue> :((((

[18:31:48] <tikue> lbergstrom: i can only speculate, but I'm certain the html is being parsed correctly. my guess is that it's not getting added to the current frame tree or something. i'll take a look at that as soon as i can
[18:32:05] <kmc> http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/xml-parsing-accelerator-with-intel-streaming-simd-extensions-4-intel-sse4 I mentioned this at dinner yesterday

[22:16:42] <cmr> ...just like that?
[22:16:46] <tikue> cmr: doesn't work
[22:16:48] <cmr> You might need to set a log level.
[22:16:58] <cmr> tikue: did you build with --cfg debug, if you're looking for debug! stuff?
[22:17:15] <tikue> cmr: servo automatically builds with debug! enabled
[22:17:28] <cmr> try RUST_LOG=gfx::rendering=4 ?
[22:17:46] <cmr> Otherwise I don't know :(
[22:18:00] <cmr> I think you can do like RUST_LOG=::help or something like that to get a list of the loggables.
[22:18:18] <tikue> cmr: oh awesome thanks
[22:19:10] <tikue> weird! i don't see gfx::rendering
[22:19:26] <tikue> text, platform, font_list, font_context, font, but no rendering...
[22:21:04] <tikue> jdm, lbergstrom: the second iframe is technically "there." you can click in it and the script receives the click event with the correct coordinate value relative to the iframe
[22:21:42] <lbergstrom> tikue: yup, I even have a demo where you can click a URL and then the new iframe will be loaded there and the new content *will* be visible
[22:21:51] <tikue> lbergstrom: wat
[22:21:55] <tikue> so the layout is there too
[22:22:03] <tikue> i bet the renderer just isn't sending its messages 
[22:22:07] <tikue> lazy renderer >_<
[22:22:46] <lbergstrom> or maybe it's not being given paint permissions by the constellation? I'm still working my way through that code
[22:23:17] <tikue> lbergstrom: it's possible, but doubtful, because the compositor knows about the frame, which is why it receives the click events
[22:23:55] <tikue> and it only knows about frames that are cleared for permission from the constellation
[22:26:58] <jdm> I propose this for our failing image: http://25.media.tumblr.com/cab3606dbfac54e4b82612cc5820d01c/tumblr_mk3xrnPeLf1qawth1o1_500.jpg

[22:30:50] <jgraham> Hmm, getting a failure from unwrapping a None. Which is certainly my fault, but I wonder if there isn't some style that is better for avoiding this kind of 
[22:30:56] <jgraham> "null pointer exception"

[22:31:32] <tikue> jgraham: `option.expect("this is why this should always be Some() and None means there is a bug");` 
[22:31:35] <tikue> that's how i usually do it
[22:32:04] <jgraham> So that's just informational?
[22:32:08] <tikue> yeah
[22:32:24] <tikue> so that later when you've forgotten what it was for you have a reminder
[22:33:01] <cmr> Usually if you want to use unwrap there's nothing you can do when it's None.
[22:33:12] <cmr> But you can match on the Option if there are useful things to do
[22:33:30] <cmr> (or use the is_none/is_some helper methods if you don't like that style of code)
[22:33:56] <tikue> on the other hand, if you want to do something in case of Some() and just skip ahead in case of None, then you can use or `for unwrapped in option` or a variety of option methods
[22:35:00] <jgraham> Anyway, in this case it would be nice to have more than one line of traceback. Is there some flag I need to turn on (this is probably documented)
[22:36:04] <lbergstrom> in GDB, b rust_begin_unwind
[22:36:19] <tikue> hmmm, i'm noticing short graphical glitches when i go forward and backward in servo. kind of looks like a really fast powerpoint slide transition animation
[22:36:30] <lbergstrom> though to be able to make sense of the stack you'll want to compile with -Z debug-info (which should land in Makefile.in when my PR lands)
[22:36:32] <tikue> where the next page is zooming in real quick
[22:36:43] <cmr> lbergstrom: servo builds with debug-info?
[22:37:10] <lbergstrom> cmr: it will soon
[22:37:42] <cmr> lbergstrom: I mean, rustc doesn't segfault when building it with debug-info
[22:38:19] <lbergstrom> cmr: it was recently fixed for us, which I'm very happy about
[22:38:55] <cmr> Oh, very nice!
[22:39:47] <tikue> i'm really confused about RUST_LOG=gfx::render_task. It kind of seems like it no longer exists
