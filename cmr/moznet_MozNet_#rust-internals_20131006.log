[01:19:11] <cmr> tjc: someone in #rust discovered the weirdest thing about rustpkg
[01:19:17] <cmr> you know how remote packages are broken?
[01:19:19] <tjc> yeah
[01:19:26] <cmr> cd /tmp; rustpkg install github.com/steveklabnik/hello;
[01:19:28] <cmr> works fine :\
[01:19:38] <tjc> well, I never promised that they were unconditionally broken :-)
[01:19:40] <cmr> but apparently *only* in /tmp
[01:19:43] <tjc> hmm
[01:19:43] <cmr> hah
[01:19:48] <tjc> what other directories did you try?
[01:20:46] <cmr> I mostly have tried in ~/entropy (my persistent /tmp) and ~/hacking (my source dir)
[01:20:50] <tjc> hmm
[01:20:59] <cmr> Although I just updated my rust and can't replicate ;\
[01:20:59] <tjc> maybe it has to be in a directory with only one component?
[01:21:02] <tjc> I should really just fix this
[01:21:40] <cmr> I can reproduce with rustc 0.8 (c1b187d 2013-09-23 21:06:03 -0700), which is the build I have on the lab machines
[01:22:35] <tjc> OK. Well, that is certainly weird. I'll be curious to find out why that is when I dig into the code
[01:22:37] <cmr> (it works in /tmp but not anywhere in home)
[01:22:40] <cmr> mm
[01:22:44] <cmr> just thought I'd pass it on
[01:22:48] <tjc> thanks!

[02:04:55] <Eridius> oh crud, I have a good use right now for Trait::<for type>::method(). Too bad that doesn't work yet
[02:05:09] *** kimundi is now known as zz_kimundi
[02:05:32] * Eridius wants to add a nullary static method to a trait whose return type is not based on Self, and therefore needs some way to select an impl
[02:07:08] <acrichto> Eridius: recently I've seen the workaround to be taking Option<T> and always supplying None
[02:07:12] <Eridius> hrm
[02:08:05] <Eridius> surely there's an issue to track the impl of <for type>. Any idea what to search for?
[02:08:14] <acrichto> "for" :P
[02:08:18] <Eridius> :P
[02:08:19] <acrichto> I know there is one open for this though
[02:09:00] <Eridius> https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/5221 looks promising, but I see no mention of <for T>

[02:25:20] <tjc> cmr: r? https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9736 , since you requested the change :-)
[02:27:00] <cmr> https://github.com/catamorphism/rust/commit/eb2a7e1ab3365a1f41904b370e0be5c0baa1f95e#diff-b72c3b3cbe672af06d77d896bffc6c55R127
[02:27:07] <cmr> I'm not sure that's right.
[02:27:18] <cmr> The workspace should be the first thing in your RUST_PATH or .rust
[02:27:32] <cmr> It should just *build* whatever is in the cwd
[02:27:40] <tjc> cmr: Sort of...
[02:27:53] <cmr> But I'm not familiar with how the code actually works
[02:27:54] <tjc> I actually have another change in the queue that changes the PkgSrc struct so that it tracks both the source and destination workspace
[02:27:54] <cmr> :p
[02:27:58] <cmr> Ah, ok
[02:28:00] <tjc> and you're right, in this case "workspace" is a misnomer
[02:28:16] <tjc> But in the meantime, there's code in… package_source.rs, I think… that determines the "destination workspace", which is definitely a workspace
[02:28:26] <tjc> but may not be the same as the workspace field in the PkgSrc
[02:28:38] <tjc> you're right that the naming is misleading
[02:29:37] <cmr> tjc: r=me
[02:29:42] <tjc> cmr: thanks!

[02:58:55] <Eridius> ^^^^^^^^^^^^^6
[02:59:12] <Eridius> the mere act of having a variable in-scope causes it to parse differently?
[02:59:18] <cmr> whua
[02:59:27] <Eridius> like I said, really weird
[02:59:32] <cmr> I wonder if it's seeing it in the ident interner..
[03:00:08] <Eridius> perhaps, but that would suggest it's interning too early, no?
[03:00:17] <cmr> No idea, just a shot in the dark.
[03:00:21] <cmr> tjc: How's the summit?
[03:00:48] <tjc> cmr: complicated! I feel like I'm not the intended audience for a lot of it
[03:01:06] <tjc> but, the Servo session here in Toronto went really well -- Jack spoke for about 30 min and then there were about an hour and 10 min of questions
[03:01:17] <tjc> which is really great -- and every one was a good, on-topic question
[03:01:54] <cmr> jeez!
[03:01:56] <cmr> Is it recorded?
[03:02:12] <Eridius> filed as https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/9737
[03:03:24] <tjc> cmr: I'm not sure if there's going to be video posted
[03:03:57] <tjc> cmr: https://etherpad.mozilla.org/summit-sessions-saturday-understandingservo has a link to the slides to the Brussels one (which jdm did) apparently...
[03:04:15] <tjc> there are "suggested example questions" there that jack wrote in advance, but no answers, and no notes in general :-)
[03:06:49] <cmr> "Fortunately Servo never crashes!" hah

[04:43:24] <cmr> "If `workspaces` is empty..."
[04:43:38] <cmr> What is workspaces?
[04:44:06] <cmr> Looking at the old error and my experience with it, I *think* it would work when there are actually packages installed in the workspaec.
[04:44:11] <cmr> More confusing naming?
[04:46:40] <tjc> cmr: Yeah, That's pretty confusing
[04:46:55] <tjc> oh, wait, actually it's not :-)
[04:47:06] <tjc> this is saying, "search for the package in all of the workspaces in the RUST_PATH..."
[04:47:12] <cmr> Ahhh
[04:47:21] <cmr> So workspaces is "the workspaces that this package appears in"?
[04:47:29] <tjc> "and if it's not found (that is, if `workspaces` is empty), pass in the default_workspace() to the PkgSrc constructor as the destination to install into"
[04:47:30] <tjc> yeah

[05:10:28] <Eridius> btw acrichto, if you're around, using BytesContainer is promising so far. I haven't finished updating the entire source base, but the consumption of ~ pointers hasn't been too bad yet (although I'm sure it's going to confuse someone somewhere)

[05:15:56] <Eridius> cmr: I don't have a good way to measure that (if only I had benchmarks ;) ) but I'm not expecting there to be

[05:16:43] <Eridius> in fact, it's technically allowing for the elision of some allocations, if you pass an owned value to .push/.join/etc, _and_ it needs to consume (i.e. if there's a NUL and it needs to raise a condition). But that's so edge-casey that it's kind of irrelevant

[06:45:08] <dbaupp> acrichto: <3 the new memory usage
[06:51:24] <acrichto> dbaupp: and it gets even better!
[06:51:28] <Eridius> what'd you do?
[06:51:50] <acrichto> actually release the tcx
[06:51:58] <acrichto> and add a cache to const_eval to reduce mem by 400MB
[06:52:01] <Eridius> the what?
[06:52:03] <Eridius> ooh sweet
[06:52:21] <acrichto> tcx == *the* program analysis results
[06:52:26] <Eridius> ooh
[06:52:28] <acrichto> which is like all of rustc's memory
[06:52:35] <dbaupp> unlanded, yeah?
[06:52:42] <acrichto> we can drop it after trans, and we used to, but it regressed
[06:52:51] <acrichto> dbaupp: it's all landed, just waiting for irfy to catch up :)
[06:52:53] <dbaupp> (or, at least, not yet irfy/mem'd?)
[06:52:58] <dbaupp> hah
[06:53:46] <dbaupp> are we valgrinding on the buildbots again, yet?
[06:53:55] <cmr> It seems I have built every commit since May 16
[06:53:56] <Eridius> acrichto: I just pushed the BytesContainer change to https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9655
[06:54:05] <Eridius> (I only ran check-fast instead of full check for the moment)
[06:54:17] <cmr> Or, attempted to build
[06:54:30] <Eridius> a number of spots needed .as_slice() on the argument to avoid consuming, but otherwise it seems to work well
[06:54:42] <dbaupp> cmr: \o/ 5 months of rustcs is something everyone should have.
[06:54:45] <acrichto> Eridius: nice!
[06:54:56] <cmr> Looks like only 18 have failed to build.
[06:55:20] <Eridius> now I'm hoping that bitrot doesn't cause issues, because the "convert the rust source" commit now uses the wrong API, making rebasing harder. Oh well
[06:55:25] <cmr> Though I'm at the point where I had to manually enable python2, and disable ccache.
[06:55:33] <dbaupp> oh? ccache/
[06:55:35] <dbaupp> ?
[06:55:44] <cmr> Well, the --enable-ccache option to configure.
[06:56:32] <dbaupp> oh, right; configure acquired that recently

[07:01:46] <dbaupp> cmr: probably relatively easy: just put a "time limit" field in it... is this a feature request?
[07:01:51] <cmr> dbaupp: yes
[07:02:09] <cmr> When multibuilder doesn't have anything left to build, it can kick off benchmarking.
[07:02:16] <dbaupp> ok, I'll knock something up by tonight[a few hours]
[07:02:22] <cmr> oh, cool
[07:02:36] <cmr> then I'm going to sleep, it's 3am :p
[07:02:42] <dbaupp> hah, night
[07:03:02] * cmr was going to try and implement it himself
[07:03:04] <acrichto> git show 'head@{3 months ago}'
[07:03:08] <acrichto> git is crazy
[07:04:23] <dbaupp> yeah
[07:04:48] <dbaupp> acrichto: being a moz-employee, you don't happen to know if [some subset of] the summit sessions will be online?
[07:05:02] <acrichto> that is indeed a good question
[07:05:32] <acrichto> I'm not sure, although I would imagine that they would
[07:05:53] <acrichto> they haven't necessarily recorded everything though
[07:05:59] <dbaupp> oh :(
[07:06:02] <dbaupp> (did you go?)
[07:06:14] <acrichto> yeah I'm in Santa Clara
[07:06:33] <acrichto> most of the sessions aren't really that related to rust
[07:06:57] <acrichto> there was one today about servo here by pcwalton, which was basically "ask pcwalton questions about rust/servo" time
[07:07:01] * dbaupp mainly just wants to see the servo one(s)
[07:07:06] <dbaupp> did it go well?
[07:07:14] <acrichto> yeah defintely
[07:07:25] <acrichto> I love how everyone's like "When can I use rust?!"
[07:07:31] <acrichto> or "I have something I want to port to rust..."
[07:07:37] <acrichto> it's so exciting!
[07:08:00] <dbaupp> yeah, even quite a few non-mozilla associated people seem to have the same thing
[07:08:06] <dbaupp> (judging by HN and /r/programming)
[07:08:32] <acrichto> we just gotta get a release out now :)
[07:08:47] <dbaupp> meh, then we have to be BC; and that's hard work :P
[07:08:55] <acrichto> lol
[07:09:28] <dbaupp> it will be good to be able to put 1.0 out the door though
[07:09:37] <dbaupp> "look what we made", etc etc :)
[07:10:06] <dbaupp> also, unrelatedly, how does #[feature(macro_rules)] interact with the std-macros?
[07:10:10] <acrichto> yeah and sadly it really is crucial that we get to a backwards compatible point
[07:10:16] <acrichto> haha that's everyone's first question
[07:10:22] <acrichto> feature gating happens before folding/injection
[07:10:28] <dbaupp> ah, of course
[07:10:31] <dbaupp> easy solution :)
[07:10:40] <acrichto> same thing with use std::prelude::*;

[07:10:49] <acrichto> we can't actually remove globs from the language without dealing witht hat
[07:10:55] <acrichto> god globs are annoying
[07:10:55] <dbaupp> yeah
[07:11:12] <dbaupp> for the privacy rewrite?
[07:11:14] <acrichto> after working in resolve with them, we need to either put a lot of work into them or kick them out
[07:11:25] <dbaupp> :(
[07:11:58] <acrichto> I guess they're not too hopeless
[07:12:05] <acrichto> I personally view them as a code smell so I'm probably biased
[07:12:16] <acrichto> but basically right now it just doesn't import priv items
[07:12:27] <acrichto> meaning that your error message when you forget priv is "unresolved name" not "this name is private"
[07:12:31] <acrichto> one is a lot more helpful than the other
[07:12:39] <dbaupp> yeah
[07:12:40] *** Quits: erickt (Adium@79611EE9.A51CB73B.6FBF6D51.IP) (Ping timeout)
[07:12:52] <acrichto> I think the privacy messages could probably be improved as well
[07:13:03] <acrichto> xxx "foo" is private *inside `bar`*
[07:13:12] <acrichto> the inside part is currently omitted but may be quite useful
[07:14:06] <dbaupp> I agree that ::* is codesmell; *except* for the prelude-style imports, or importing math functions
[07:14:31] * dbaupp essentially exclusively uses glob imports in python for `from math import *`
[07:14:50] <acrichto> lol importing math functions
[07:14:54] <acrichto> I like how specific that case is
[07:15:04] <acrichto> yeah it's true that sometimes they're incredibly useful
[07:15:16] <acrichto> but things like "use ast::*" I think may not be the best
[07:15:18] <dbaupp> haha, mainly 'cause the functions have a clear source for sin/cos etc
[07:15:42] <acrichto> I doubt that we'll actually remove them
[07:15:58] <acrichto> I just need to figure out how to glob-import private items but still print violations later on
[07:16:05] <acrichto> it doesn't work into my patch at all currently
[07:16:10] <dbaupp> https://github.com/mozilla/rust/blob/master/src/libsyntax/parse/parser.rs#L15-L61 is also pretty bad :P
[07:16:25] <acrichto> I don't know why that exists
[07:16:31] <acrichto> I feel like that *must* have been before globs
[07:16:38] <dbaupp> probably
[07:16:39] <acrichto> but yeah that's terrible
[07:16:44] <acrichto> worse than globs
[07:17:08] <dbaupp> it would be nicer just as one {...} block, without the repeats of `use ast::`, if we were trying to avoid globs
[07:17:44] * acrichto would rather see "use ast;"
[07:18:00] <acrichto> use ast::* brings in the name "public" and "private" which is sad
[07:18:06] <acrichto> b/c you can't shadow enum variants apparently
[07:18:23] <dbaupp> even with locals?
[07:18:34] <Eridius> I suspect that use of `use foo::*` would go down dramatically if we had a way to say "bring in this enum and all variants"
[07:18:40] <acrichto> rusti: enum A { a } let a = 3;

[07:18:54] <dbaupp> ah :(
[07:19:00] <dbaupp> Eridius++
[07:19:14] <acrichto> Eridius: yeah that would be kinda nice...
[07:19:24] <acrichto> there was a proposal at some point "use std::option::Option::*"
[07:19:25] <Eridius> I'm thinking something like `use foo::enum(*)`, which is vaguely haskell-like, but not very discoverable
[07:19:38] <Eridius> acrichto: that would work if Some and None were namespaced by the Option type, but they're not :/
[07:19:46] <acrichto> that was the change
[07:20:00] <acrichto> although I wasn't a big fan of it
[07:20:14] <acrichto> it didn't realy catch traction I think b/c "option::Option::*" is awful to type
[07:20:19] <dbaupp> acrichto: having a way to ignore certain things from a glob would also make them more usable (similar to `import Foo hiding (bar)` in Haskell)
[07:20:30] <Eridius> I do wish there was a way to define an enum whose variants are namespaced (but have that be opt-in)
[07:20:40] <dbaupp> (although that's just making globs more attractive, rather than fixing them.)
[07:21:06] <acrichto> dbaupp: yeah, I feel like we can all get by just fine without globs and with globs we just want so much more that we'll never be satisfied
[07:21:25] <acrichto> Eridius: mod Enum { enum Enum { ... } } but that's terrible :P
[07:21:29] <Eridius> yeah
[07:21:37] <dbaupp> acrichto: does any language have imports like us, but *not* have globs?
[07:22:01] <acrichto> the two off the top of my head are ruby/go/lua
[07:22:04] <acrichto> three*
[07:22:08] <dbaupp> hah
[07:22:10] <acrichto> but ruby/lua don't really ahve imports like us
[07:22:24] <acrichto> C++ I guess doesn't, but they just have headers...
[07:22:35] <acrichto> python is actually the only one I can think of where you bring identifiers into scope with imports
[07:22:36] <dbaupp> using namespace std;
[07:22:38] <acrichto> I'm sure there's more though...
[07:22:42] <dbaupp> or whatever the invocation is
[07:22:45] <acrichto> ah yes
[07:22:50] <dbaupp> (Java, Haskell)
[07:22:52] * acrichto knows so much c++
[07:22:56] * acrichto knows so many languages
[07:23:03] <acrichto> does java have * ?
[07:23:08] <dbaupp> I think so
[07:23:10] <acrichto> it's been like 5 years since I wrote any java
[07:23:11] * dbaupp knows so much java
[07:23:18] <acrichto> does haskell?
[07:23:28] <dbaupp> `import Foo` is automatically a glob
[07:23:41] <dbaupp> `import qualified Foo` is an unglob
[07:23:48] <acrichto> indeed
[07:23:53] <acrichto> (I know no haskell)
[07:23:56] <dbaupp> `import Foo (bar, baz)` is use foo::{bar, baz}
[07:24:08] <Eridius> http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Import
[07:24:16] <dbaupp> (i.e. the first too are equivalent to `use foo::*` and `use foo` respectively)
[07:24:20] <dbaupp> *two
[07:24:30] <Eridius> technically the first is equivalent to `use foo; use foo::*;`
[07:24:37] <acrichto> ah interesting
[07:25:26] <dbaupp> (fwiw, java has `import foo.bar.*`)
[07:25:41] <acrichto> I think it's inevitable for us to have globs
[07:25:41] <dbaupp> (according to google, at least)
[07:26:01] <acrichto> the main reason I think it's a code smell is that it makes refactoring godawful (at least in python)
[07:26:05] <dbaupp> Eridius: ah, true
[07:26:07] <acrichto> but seeing how we have a compiler and all it's not that bad
[07:26:23] <dbaupp> <3 static types & checked matches
[07:26:30] <acrichto> <3 compilers
[07:26:34] <acrichto> even c++
[07:26:37] <acrichto> one can refactor c++
[07:26:42] <acrichto> one cannot refactor python I am convinced
[07:26:51] <Eridius> speaking of compilers and refactoring, I would really love a way to ask rustc to rename functions for me
[07:27:07] <acrichto> I don't actually think there's a map of "id => usages"
[07:27:18] <acrichto> just the other way of "id => definition"
[07:27:32] <acrichto> sounds like a sweet ide extension though
[07:27:42] <acrichto> just make it take like 5GB of ram to compete with eclipse :P
[07:27:43] <Eridius> `go fix` is one of the killer Go tools
[07:28:05] <acrichto> did you use it much?
[07:28:05] <dbaupp> acrichto: you can presumably just traverse the whole tree and do the def_id -> definition thing, renaming if it matches
[07:28:28] <acrichto> dbaupp: "rust fmt" could be way more powerful than it actually is
[07:28:44] <Eridius> acrichto: personally, only occasionally, but I never engaged in any sort of large refactoring of Go source
[07:28:49] <Eridius> I know it was used heavily by the core Go deves though
[07:28:53] <Eridius> *devs
[07:28:53] <acrichto> Eridius: I never personally got to use 'go fix' b/c I only got on the bandwagon after 1.0, but I'm curious how useful it was pre-1.0
[07:28:54] <dbaupp> acrichto: it could also be way more correct ;)
[07:29:07] <acrichto> Eridius: it would have made fmt! => format! a lot nicer :P
[07:29:11] <Eridius> acrichto: I'm pretty sure it was used extensively during the run up to 1.0 any time refactoring happened
[07:29:18] <Eridius> `go fix` could also detect obsolete syntax and fix that for you too
[07:29:33] <Eridius> which was used a lot by the community. New go version? Run `go fix` on your source and watch as it updates your source!
[07:29:44] <Luqman> acrichto: but the monkey patching you can do in python :P
[07:30:13] <acrichto> Luqman: and one some platforms we can even rewrite the text section!
[07:30:19] <acrichto> that's monkey-patching, right?
[07:30:31] <acrichto> Eridius: I wonder if we should invest more heavily in a "rust fix" tool
[07:30:43] <Luqman> haha
[07:30:45] <acrichto> I have a feeling if our pretty printer worked at all it would be pretty simple to do actually
[07:30:47] <Eridius> acrichto: that would be really helpful
[07:30:55] <acrichto> "impl B;" => "impl B {}" would be been really easy
[07:31:03] <Eridius> `go fmt` is another great tool I think. It completely kills all style wars
[07:31:13] <Eridius> but I think proper formatting of Rust code is a bit harder to define
[07:31:27] <acrichto> how so?
[07:31:34] <acrichto> I always thought we were fairly similar
[07:31:44] <Eridius> nothing comes to mind off the top of my head, but I'm certain I've seen code before where I wasn't really sure what the ideal formatting is
[07:31:55] <Eridius> whereas Go's source typically has an unambiguous choice
[07:32:14] <dbaupp> formatting generics is particularly hard
[07:32:15] <Eridius> (although sometimes the unambiguous choice is a bit simplistic, e.g. it doesn't let you have one-line if statements, it always puts in the newlines)
[07:32:18] <dbaupp> (at least, I find it so)
[07:32:42] <Eridius> formatting match could also be slightly tricky; exactly when do you use braces vs not, for single-expression arms?
[07:32:53] <acrichto> oh that's a good point
[07:34:06] <dbaupp> just no braces always? (although braces for arms that are purely side-effect-ful is nice; so braces for single expression arms returning ()... that's getting pretty complicated)
[07:34:27] <Eridius> if an arm is long enough that I want to put it on a new line I always give it braces
[07:34:29] <dbaupp> rust fmt requiring the code to typecheck would be peculiar(?)
[07:34:31] <Eridius> although I've seen code that doesn't
[07:34:47] <acrichto> do we need to run typeck?
[07:34:58] <dbaupp> if we're checking for arms that return () we do
[07:35:05] <Eridius> I don't think you'd want to typecheck. Type-checking shouldn't affect style
[07:35:17] <Eridius> I omit braces all the time for arms that return ()
[07:35:27] <Eridius> None => println("foo"), // no need for a brace!
[07:35:27] <acrichto> I'm about 50/50 :P
[07:35:44] <Eridius> although I also give them braces quite often too, None => { println("I feel like braces today") }
[07:35:47] <acrichto> None => return, looks weird so I always write "None => { return }"
[07:35:52] <Eridius> acrichto: agreed
[07:36:02] * dbaupp would be fine with no braces for all single-line, single-expression arms
[07:36:59] <Eridius> clearly we should just build a neural net, give it the entire rust codebase to crunch, and let it decide what style to use. Although I suspect we'd get something kinda crazy, with all the old code lying around in rustc
[07:37:15] <Eridius> and it would probably decide things like "identifiers that start with e get braces"
[07:37:58] <dbaupp> acrichto: from the implementation of #[feature] it looks like it might be possible to have it per-mod? was per-crate an explicit design decision?
[07:38:27] <acrichto> that was the initial decision we made at the meeting (or at least what I could remember), I think of a feature as more of a crate-level thing than a module-level thing anyway
[07:38:37] <dbaupp> Eridius: that'd be amazing; "why is the style guide like this?" "bors-style said so"
[07:38:47] <Eridius> per-crate makes sense to me. You're opting in at the level of the library or executable
[07:38:57] <Eridius> dbaupp: oh god, bors doesn't need more power
[07:38:58] <dbaupp> Haskell has per-module for the language features
[07:39:11] <dbaupp> (well, GHC's {-# LANGUAGE #-} pragmas)
[07:39:20] <Eridius> dbaupp: aren't those features more things that aren't in Haskell 99, and less things that are unstable that may be removed from the language?
[07:39:40] <Eridius> whereas #[feature] seems like opting in to things that may be removed at a later date, or that are generally just not yet stable
[07:39:43] <dbaupp> Haskell 2010/prime/whatever it's called now, but yeah
[07:39:48] <dbaupp> I guess so
[07:39:50] <Eridius> oh they updated it? nice
[07:40:07] * dbaupp doesn't use haskell enough to know if LANGUAGE includes experimental features or not
[07:40:15] <Eridius> personally, I think of Haskell's LANGUAGE pragmas as things that are going to be confusing to newcomers
[07:40:45] <Eridius> wtb faster rust compiles
[07:40:56] <Eridius> I should be in bed, but I'm trying to get `make check-stage1` to pass

[07:42:48] <Eridius> heh. I'm on a 3.4GHz iMac
[07:43:13] <Eridius> rustc needs to lern 2 parallelize
[07:43:25] * dbaupp wants a parallel syntax::{visit, fold}

[07:43:44] <dbaupp> although a parallel LLVM/trans would be more useful
[07:43:57] <dbaupp> and have far larger benefits
