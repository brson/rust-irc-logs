[00:40:50] <bjz> Amaranth: what's wrong with that?
[00:41:17] <Amaranth> bjz: I'm trying to port some code for a fixed type and I was looking at what traits I should implement for all of the functionality it provides
[00:41:37] <Amaranth> It doesn't provide everything Real does so I have to do that one as just a method on the struct
[00:41:46] <bjz> Amaranth: sqrt is almost alway going to be Transcendental
[00:42:36] <bjz> woops
[00:42:36] <bjz> I mean, algebraic
[00:42:36] <bjz> ie. not an integer
[00:42:42] <bjz> Amaranth: what is your type?
[00:42:50] <Amaranth> A fixed point type
[00:43:30] <bjz> Ah
[00:43:30] <bjz> Amaranth: you might be interested in num-rs
[00:44:08] <bjz> Amaranth: so fixed point vs floating point?
[00:44:12] <Amaranth> Right
[00:45:12] <Amaranth> bjz: Do you know, if I implement ToPrimitive and FromPrimitive can I just implement Add<Fixed, Fixed> and have it convert primitives to Fixed automatically to do the addition?
[00:45:43] <Amaranth> And convert my Fixed to an int or whatever if that is what the result is supposed ot be

[00:48:16] <bjz> I think pcwalton said the operator overloading stuff was going to be relaxed
[00:48:44] <bjz> for Add<Fixed, Fixed>, Add<Fixed, i32> (on i32). and Add<i32, Fixed>, is Fixed a concrete type?
[00:48:51] <bjz> ie. not generic?
[00:48:52] <pcwalton> it could use some work on functional dependencies
[00:48:56] <Amaranth> Not generic, right
[00:49:12] * bjz looks up functional dependencies
[00:49:24] <SiegeLord> So I'll be able to do 1 * Matrix in the future?
[00:49:31] <bjz> pcwalton: so much to do, so little time in the day :(
[00:50:10] <pcwalton> SiegeLord: yeah, I think so
[00:50:17] <SiegeLord> That's exciting
[00:50:26] <pcwalton> what we actually need to do is the inverse of functional dependencies
[00:50:37] <pcwalton> we have Add : Self -> RHS, Result now
[00:50:39] <pcwalton> when it should just be
[00:50:44] <pcwalton> Add : Self, RHS, Result
[00:50:52] <pcwalton> in kinda-sorta-Haskell speak.
[00:51:47] <bjz> pcwalton: http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Functional_dependencies ?
[00:51:55] <pcwalton> yeah
[00:52:07] <pcwalton> actually what we might want is
[00:52:10] <pcwalton> Add : Self, RHS -> Result
[00:52:11] <pcwalton> or something
[00:52:21] <pcwalton> that would give you C++ I think
[00:52:34] <bjz> pcwalton: awesome. sounds kinda tricky to implement
[00:52:46] <pcwalton> I think what we wanted was associated types
[00:52:51] <pcwalton> so it would just be Add<Self,RHS>
[00:52:58] <pcwalton> and then Result would be an associated type
[00:53:13] <bjz> yeah, associated types would be awesome, but again, so much to do for 1.0
[00:53:17] <pcwalton> and associated types would have the implicit functional dependency

[00:54:18] <pcwalton> I haven't read them yet but they're on my list.
[00:55:04] <bjz> pcwalton: I don't expect it to happen for 1.0, but it might be good to see if we can leave things open to it
[00:56:40] <bjz> pcwalton: It really does feel to me that there is an interesting relationship between modules and traits (even just our simple modules), but I haven't really got my head around it
[00:58:10] <bjz> pcwalton: like, do types have their own modules? and then do traits add to that module in an add-hoc way? or do each of the trait impls on the type create a new module?
[00:58:19] <bjz> pcwalton: dunno if that makes sense
[00:58:26] <pcwalton> yeah, there is some relationship there
[00:58:55] <bjz> pcwalton: see, the foo.method() thing suggests the former

[12:19:28] <rsaarelm> So is cmake the tool of choice for making complex project builds with everyone given up on rustpkg?
[12:24:25] <skrylar> i don't know that everyone is given up on rustpkg... i think some of us are just waiting for it to function
[12:24:33] <skrylar> supporting 'bin' targets would help a lot with that

[12:26:43] <rsaarelm> Well, step in the right direction in any case.
[12:27:04] <bjz> I'd like to get to work on gfw-rs
[12:27:10] <bjz> *gfx-rs
[12:27:22] <bjz> but that would only be rendering
[12:27:53] <rsaarelm> I guess I'll just give cmake a shot to get my project right now building with something a bit less frankensteinian than the current Makefile I got set pu.
[12:28:16] <skrylar> eh, rustc handles itself well enough that you don't need much more
[12:28:24] <skrylar> i've been toying with tup again
[12:28:54] <rsaarelm> I do when I'm building non-rust stuff too like static libs of GLFW and Portaudio in my build process.
[12:29:01] <rsaarelm> Tup is cool too.
[12:29:18] <skrylar> i used to do heavy tup use before i triedto use it with LaTeX
[12:29:31] <rsaarelm> Quite barebones though, and it gets tricky with the complicated output names for rust crates.
[12:29:42] <skrylar> had one project with haXe where IIRC it would build SDL and friends using tup
[12:29:54] <rsaarelm> I did a quick try with tup, but didn't figure out how you can have output file names that are the result of the rustc system call that gives the crate name.
[12:30:00] <skrylar> have haxe do the cpp output, and then subsequent compiling of those 
[12:30:19] <skrylar> rsaarelm: you can just shove the hash name in to the tupfile
[12:30:44] <skrylar> there's a way to have tup run some lua to generate rules, but i don't know if that can call out to rust
[12:32:15] <skrylar> nope, it doesn't have the OS module
[12:32:38] <rsaarelm> So the hash names are stable enough that changing the crate source won't break them?
[12:33:07] <skrylar> i'm not sure how officially stable it is, but i think its based on the crate's name and versioning
[12:33:19] <rsaarelm> That's good enough for me I think.
[12:33:34] <rsaarelm> If it changes very rarely, I can live with manually changing it.
[12:33:40] <skrylar> i'm technically a rustnoob
[12:33:43] <rsaarelm> Or make a tool for changing it.
[12:34:31] <skrylar> it looks like if you wanted to be industrious, you could have a shell script ask rustc for crate names and output some tup vars for it

[15:16:33] <kvark> first, we had link_args. Then we switched to link(name=""), and now we are back to link_args?
[15:16:40] <bjz> the issue was that glfw has different names on different package managers

[15:20:04] <bjz> I just can't keep the CMake stuff in my head
[15:20:05] <kvark> sp3d: that's the thing. I think rustc now complains about link(name="") being invalid (or deprecated?) syntax. Unless I'm totally lost. Anyway... would be able to be more precise when I get home.
[15:20:35] <kvark> bjz: I can't either, and it's sad you had to use it at all.

[16:03:25] <csherratt> I wonder if it would be easier just to build glfw as a static library.
[16:04:49] <kvark> definitely more convenient for us (users)! what are the drawbacks, bjz?
[16:05:20] <kvark> ah, I guess it's the old question of dynamic vs static linking
[16:05:25] <bjz> not sure
[16:05:36] <bjz> how would I make it static >_<
[16:06:49] <kvark> bjz: if you link to glfw static lib? (".a" instead of ".so")
[16:07:02] <csherratt> glfw itself builds as static by default. Just make sure it compiles with -fPIC and everything should work.

[19:18:45] <rsaarelm> Looks like a tup build system might be working quite well, except for the bit where I need to enter the package hashes manually.
[19:19:06] <rsaarelm> Haven't figured a system where I can make tup call shell commands and bind the expanded results in variables.
[19:22:49] <rsaarelm> Also, I'm pretty sure I'll end up going blind if I do stuff like this to build myself static libraries... ": lib/portaudio/configure |> cp -r lib/portaudio pa-build; cd pa-build; ./configure CFLAGS=-fPIC; make; cp ./lib/.libs/libportaudio.a ../; cd ..; rm -rf pa-build |> libportaudio.a"

[19:25:57] <photex> rsaarelm: this is the first I've heard of tup
[19:26:01] <photex> looks interesting
[19:28:17] <rsaarelm> Yeah, it's neat.
[19:28:27] <rsaarelm> But it uses black magic.
[19:29:04] <rsaarelm> Some Mac guy seemed to get into a situation where he would've needed to modify his kernel to get tup's file monitoring sorcery to run, and didn't end up too happy about people using it.
[19:29:21] <rsaarelm> I've only used it on Linux, where it has worked fine out of the box.
[19:29:44] <kvark> sounds scary
[19:29:55] <kvark> you'd want your build system to be rock solid, like a hammer
[19:30:03] <photex> yeah, that sorta moves it out of my radar for now haha
[19:30:20] <photex> s/out of/off/
[19:30:44] * photex can totally use common english expressions in conversation
[19:31:35] <rsaarelm> It is pretty solid.
[19:32:03] <rsaarelm> It just uses some tricky stuff to monitor all the files each build command reads or writes to build an implicit dependency graph.
[19:32:36] <kvark> oh, I see, so here is where problems come from :)
[19:33:18] <kvark> is there any solid piece of software using Tup?
[19:34:42] <kvark> (aside from gittup)
[19:37:51] <o11c> kvark: no
[19:38:24] <kvark> oh well, gittup seems pretty big though :) Just wondering on how mature Tup implementation is
[19:38:35] <o11c> tup has some good ideas, but also fails in a lot of ways
[19:38:48] <o11c> once you write a decent GNU makefile, you don't need anything else
[19:39:23] <tiffany> maintaining a makefile is a pain
[19:39:27] <kvark> o11c: maybe, I just need to get better at makefiles...
[19:42:01] <rsaarelm> Went down from a 107 line Makefile to a 39 line tup config.
[19:43:07] <rsaarelm> The only wart in the setup is hardcoding in the crate hashes.

[19:44:49] <o11c> rsaarelm: number of lines isn't relevant, you're just calling a library
[19:45:24] <o11c> rsaarelm: the makefile I've written only has a couple sections that need to be editor to apply it to a single project, but it's 418 lines total

[19:46:36] <o11c> I really, *really* wish make made it easy to force -r and -R
[19:47:03] <rsaarelm> Yeah, librarizing the make stuff could work.

[19:49:29] <o11c> for now yeah
[19:49:41] <SiegeLord> And it doesn't seem to work on Windows?
[19:49:46] <o11c> other languages don't have the same needs for .o etc ...
[19:50:06] <o11c> It worked under cygwin last I checked
[19:50:12] <SiegeLord> That's not Windows
[19:50:26] <o11c> the project itself requries a unix api, so non-cygwin is pointless for *me* to support
[19:50:36] <o11c> but I don't see anything about the makefile part that shouldn't support native windows
[19:50:49] <o11c> other than the fact that windows doesn't have a sensible path/shell/anything
[19:51:06] <SiegeLord> Of course, hence the build system providing those things
[19:51:34] <rsaarelm> Maybe I'll just use the "touch libderp.dummy" pattern in my tup thing.
[19:53:32] <rsaarelm> No, wait, that'll make tup mad because I'm reading and writing files I'm not telling it about. Crap.
[19:54:06] <cmr> rustc --crate-file-names is a thing that exists.
[19:54:15] <cmr> it will tell you exactly what will be written
[19:55:10] <rsaarelm> I know. But I can't figure out how to get its output to tup's build target value without running a different build tool to generate the tupfile, which kinda defeats the purpose of a build system.
[19:55:25] <rsaarelm> Or hardcoding it by hand.
[19:55:27] <rsaarelm> Which I'm doing.
[19:57:57] <rsaarelm> Unless... Tup doesn't mind stuff that happens *outside* the build tree. So I'll point the library build to something like ~/.rust instead?

[20:17:46] <rsaarelm> Well, sucks to be them then.

[20:19:31] <rsaarelm> And given that it's a game, I expect I'll be distributing binaries somehow and most people will download those.
[20:19:44] <kvark> true indeed
[20:20:06] <rsaarelm> Or I'll use the package manager of a civilized OS, and the package manager will take care of procuring a tup if a build from source is desired.
[20:21:16] <rsaarelm> Tup really should at least be in the official packages repository for Arch Linux...
[20:22:25] <rsaarelm> Apparently the magic stuff is a problem again, the tup binary needs to be a suid binary.

[20:43:41] <tiffany> at one point there were 3 ways you could build my engine, there was a shell script, there was tup, and there was scons
[20:43:55] <Amaranth> Although the main reason everyone uses the same build systems is because they just copy/paste from an existing project and tweak it for their needs
[20:44:03] <tiffany> I didn't bother maintaining the tup or shell script builds though, but now I'm thinking of moving back to tup

[20:44:28] <tiffany> my engine is a bit too odd of a case to have copy-and-paste build files

[21:07:18] <tiffany> so
[21:07:24] <tiffany> tup /can/ use suid, but it's not required
[21:08:27] <tiffany> it's used to create fuse chroots
[21:10:29] <tiffany> which is apparently used to be able to watch "outside" stuff, such as updating an external library
[21:10:53] <tiffany> currently you have to remove all the object files if you wish to force a rebuild because of a dependency update
