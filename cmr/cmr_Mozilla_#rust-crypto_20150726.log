[12:19:35] <Tiffany> I think I avoid existing libraries more often than I should
[12:19:43] <Tiffany> I'd avoid JWS because of the complexity
[12:20:03] <Tiffany> even if my own application would be larger to implement my own .. whatever JWS does
[12:22:09] <Tiffany> a subset of it, anyway
[12:25:14] <Tiffany> I'm not sure what you'd even use JWS for
[12:25:26] <Tiffany> bearer tokens, with symmetric crypto? and digitally signed messages with asymmetric?
[12:32:56] *** Joins: Tobba (Tobba@moz-o13d22.bredband.telia.com)
[13:12:04] <Ilari> Tobba: Well, it does symmetric MACs and asymmetric signatures (not really good idea to combine, even if those seem similar, because the properties are anything but similar).
[13:12:35] <Tobba> Ilari: wrong person?
[13:12:40] <Tiffany> did you mean to address that to me?
[13:14:45] <Ilari> OOps, yeah.
[13:16:19] <Tiffany> this feels like a case of round peg in square hole just because it fits
[13:17:23] <Ilari> Or trying to unify things that don't actually unify.

[16:37:47] <Ilari> I take it isn't pleasant to work with?
[16:40:43] <Ilari> bascule: I take that JOSE libraries should have separate functions for verifying signatures and MACs?

[16:45:53] <bascule> Ilari: that blog post is a litany of WTF features that wound up in JOSE/JWT
[16:46:02] <bascule> like a "none" algorithm? wtf
[16:46:38] <bascule> but yes those were poorly implemented client libraries
[16:57:05] <Ilari> bascule: What blog post?
[17:01:14] <bascule> https://auth0.com/blog/2015/03/31/critical-vulnerabilities-in-json-web-token-libraries/
[17:05:08] <Ilari> Separating the algorithm key is for from the raw key data is VERY bad idea.
[17:05:34] <bascule> "algorithm key"?
[17:05:50] <bascule> at the time you load the key, you should hopefully know what algorithm you're using, heh

[17:06:48] <Ilari> E.g. losing track that e.g. RSA signing key is RSA signing key is a bad thing.
[17:07:04] <bascule> aah yes, indeed
[17:07:17] <bascule> like Basic Constraints style?
[17:07:23] *** Quits: eddyb (eddyb@moz-41j.ntb.25.188.IP) (Connection closed)
[17:09:11] <Ilari> Well, and the fact that it is RSA key and not say HMAC key.
[17:09:20] <bascule> hahaha, yes, indeed
[17:09:51] <Ilari> BTW, PKIX gets that wrong for ECC signing keys. And NSS recently had related vulernability.
[17:10:15] <Ilari> There is currently no way in PKIX to express that a key is ECDSA key.
[17:10:48] <Ilari> But there is way to express "this is fixed-DH key" (WTF?)
[17:12:37] <bascule> haha
[17:12:58] <bascule> hmm, I could potentially leverage the fixed-DH part
[17:13:13] <bascule> at least if it works with Curve25519 keys
[17:14:47] <bascule> I'd like to have a way of issuing a public key for generating Macaroons discharges
[17:14:54] <Ilari> Sadly, I don't think there is appropriate OIDs for that. :-/
[17:14:58] <bascule> heh, ok
[17:25:42] <Ilari> And given that existing fixedDH OID assumes some 19th century formulas, one would have to define a new key format too.
[17:32:38] <bascule> haha, off

[18:44:06] <Ilari> And it is OPTIONAL in keys (which is IMO retarded).

[19:39:01] <Ilari> Wonder why DJB and Mike like SHA-3 so much... Because it has variable-length output mode?
[19:43:06] <Tiffany> huh

[19:43:33] <Ilari> Mike H., not Mike S. :-)
[19:43:52] <Ilari> Tiffany: Well, blake2b is limited to 512 bits. :-/
[19:44:03] <Tiffany> is that an issue?
[19:49:45] <Ilari> Well, yes, if you need 896 bits for double-width goldilocks curve. Or 1056 bits for double-width E-521.
[19:51:56] <Tiffany> lighttpd disabled SSLv3 by default
[19:52:15] <Tiffany> oh, huh
[19:52:15] <Ilari> Did it also disable RC4 by default?
[19:52:19] <Tiffany> I'm not sure
[19:52:52] <Tiffany> the version change doesn't change it
[19:52:58] <Tiffany> but it might have disabled it by default beforehand
[19:53:54] <Tiffany> they have a recommended default cipher suite, but I'm not sure if this is the actual default
[19:54:01] <Tiffany> the recommendation has !RC4
[19:56:29] <Tiffany> according to the docs, which are probably out of date
[19:56:30] <Tiffany>     OpenSSL ciphers string (default: "HIGH !aNULL !3DES +kEDH +kRSA !kSRP !kPSK")
[19:56:55] <Tiffany> honestly I'm not using lighttpd in new installs anymore
[19:57:01] <Tiffany> been using nginx instead
[19:57:20] <Tiffany> lighttpd hasn't had terribly active development, doesn't support OCSP stapling or anything fancy like that
[20:00:49] * bascule hasn't used lighttpd in like 10 years, heh
[20:01:03] <Tiffany> I don't think it's changed much in 10 years...
[20:01:26] <Tiffany> I remember that it used to be used by youtube, but then they switched to nginx
[20:01:57] <Tiffany> I had been using lighttpd for so long because the first time I looked at nginx I couldn't find any documentation in english, most of the site was in russian
[20:02:06] <bascule> heh yeah
[20:02:06] <Tiffany> and I never really checked in on it after that
[20:03:01] <bascule> nginx has seemed pretty popular for the past 5 years or more
[20:03:03] <Tiffany> these days nginx seems to have slightly better docs than lighttpd, or at least a less obtuse config syntax
[20:03:04] <Tiffany> yeah
[20:03:21] <Tiffany> lighttpd has completely fallen off netcraft, and nginx is like second to apache
[20:08:41] <Ilari> Heh, DJB partially breaking 2 of the proposals.
[20:24:19] <bascule> heh, nice
[20:25:04] <Ilari> And didn't he also partially break short hashes earlier.
[20:26:34] <Ilari> Or at least show that those are a good bit weaker than full hashes.
[20:50:24] <Ilari> Got one of chairs to call the thread a rathole. :->
[21:31:39] <Ilari> bascule: Also allegedly some NSA rep said (in lightweight crypto workshop) that symmetric encryption above 96 bits doesn't make sense.
[21:32:52] <Tiffany> hahahaha
[21:34:25] <Ilari> For some reason, SIMON and SPECK (two NSA lightweight ciphers) go to 256 bits...
