[16:39:18] <acrichto> edunham: brson: just cleaned out /cores on mac3, it had 400GB of core dumps...
[16:42:22] <brson> cool
[16:44:11] <edunham> acrichto: thanks; i discovered some flaws in my vpn setup this morning :/
[16:45:38] <edunham> till we get a better mac solution, do you think nuking the oldest half of the core dumps whenever it fills up past some threshhold would impact anyone's workflows too badly?
[16:47:46] <brson> edunham: that would work fine
[16:49:17] <acrichto> edunham: oh yeah that'd be totally fine
[16:49:25] <edunham> brson: ok; how much of those core dumps are actually useful?
[16:49:30] <acrichto> edunham: I think it used to have a cron job that just blew away the whole directory every night
[16:49:34] <acrichto> we can.. probably turn them off now
[16:49:42] <acrichto> I haven't used them in over a year at least
[16:49:49] <acrichto> they're sometimes used for debugging crashes that only happen on the bots
[16:49:53] <acrichto> but those are super rare nowadays
[16:50:13] <edunham> ok so to be on the safe side we might concievably want the latest 10 of them?
[16:51:02] <acrichto> yeah but I wouldn't sweat it too much if they just all get deleted
[16:52:07] <edunham> is there anyone else who might want them if they were gone?
[16:58:26] <acrichto> edunham: nah I don't think so
[17:04:14] <edunham> ok, cool. I'll set up those cron jobs.
[20:57:07] <brson> edunham: what does dmarc-rua@ do?
[20:57:57] <acrichto> brson: I believe that whenever a mail client marks an email as spam *because* of the dmarc rule, it will send an email to that address
[20:58:01] <acrichto> with a description of what happened and why
[20:58:09] <edunham> brson: so, dmarc has 2 purposes: advise clients on what to do with messages that fail authenticity checks, and tell clients where to report failures
[20:58:52] <brson> cool
[20:58:58] <edunham> acrichto: the DMARC rule itself doesn't actually carry any information about whether a message was spam -- it just says what to do if the message fails all available methods of DKIM and SPF
[20:58:59] <brson> edunham: so is dmarc 'on' now?
[20:59:29] <acrichto> edunham: ah yeah makes sense
[20:59:43] <edunham> brson: yes. I'm currently looking at how to spoof a message from r-l.o to make sure I get a report from the client.
[21:00:39] <edunham> hmm, I am not very good at easydns UI yet. It seems my mailmap creation didn't actually work.
[21:00:43] * edunham retries
[21:01:54] <edunham> brson: dmarc-rua@r-l.o is the destination for those client reports on "here are the messages that i got from your domain but thought were spoofed"
[21:02:15] <brson> edunham: i found that sending an email to a mailmap from an email in that map does not do the 'self-delivery'
[21:02:24] <brson> edunham: so e.g. i don't see emails i send to security@
[21:02:56] <edunham> brson: the dmarc reports will be sent by the mail hosts who're rejecting messages from *@r-l.o
[21:03:23] <edunham> but that's good to know
[21:03:24] <brson> understood. I thought maybe you were seeing problems testing the mailmap
[21:06:11] <edunham> nope, I'm just teaching myself some email scammer tactics, since I haven't had reason to forge sent-from information before
[22:01:50] <edunham> brson: what're the processes for getting allowed to be on the security@rust-lang.org alias?
[22:06:13] <brson> edunham: the core team needs to decide, but in earlier discussion it sounded like we're with it
[22:06:29] <brson> edunham: since you've got the keys to everything anyway there's no way to stop you
[22:06:37] <brson> so go ahead and add yourself
[22:06:47] <brson> *we're ok w/ it
[22:07:35] <edunham> okay, and if it makes anyone feel better I promise I won't disclose 
[22:07:38] <brson> edunham: there's a security team gpg pubkey that people are supposed to use when writing to it
[22:07:40] <edunham> or act on anything I learn from the list :)
[22:08:09] <edunham> oh, because we don't differentiate between product security and infra security right now
[22:08:09] <brson> i can send that to you
[22:08:33] * edunham wonders if an infra-security alias would be a better long-term solution
[22:08:38] <brson> edunham: yes, it's mostly for the security of rust
[22:08:41] <brson> not of infra
[22:09:10] <edunham> tbh I expect that most of the messages relevant to me on that list will be unencrypted
[22:09:32] <edunham> such as bots that automatically check things like the DMARC records and email security@domain hoping it hits someone who cares
[22:09:55] <edunham> so for now, I'd be fine with not holding the private key to messages from people who care about language security
[22:10:09] <edunham> and if anything comes through that's both encrypted and relevant to me, we can re-assess :)
