I made sure its fan was at the top rather than the bottom, so it had a bit of ventilation, but it was still sitting at 102–104°C when I arrived home, where 105°C is the point it was configured to immediately power down at.

[07:41:23] <barosl> I think I now understand what is called "creating control structure within the language" in Lisp-ish languages
[07:41:50] <barosl> Is is that the language's control structures are entirely written in something like Rust's `macro_rules!`?
[07:42:33] <barosl> Inputing an AST, and outputing a resulting AST?
[07:44:10] <eddyb> barosl: more like executing an AST
[07:44:31] <eddyb> you can write a LISP interpreter in LISP :P

[07:46:27] <eddyb> you can write an eval function in LISP that takes an AST and executes it

[08:41:47] <aji> it's technically an IR spec and associated optimizing compiler
[08:41:56] <eddyb> that works on a low-level IR (intermediate representation)

[08:47:39] <eddyb> well, maybe not 16-bit architectures
[08:47:49] <eddyb> but that's not exactly very hard to fix
[08:48:23] <eddyb> libstd has OS-dependent code in it, and requires threading
[08:49:56] <arjun_> Hm, so it depends on which libstd I'm going to target.
[08:50:10] <eddyb> "which"?
[08:51:55] <arjun_> How is rustc targeting for android? Is boinic a problem?
[08:53:02] <eddyb> nope, you just need the android toolchain
[08:53:16] <Diggsey> arjun: Bionic shouldn't be a problem as rust doesn't have very strong dependencies on specifics of the C runtime
[08:53:27] <eddyb> I wonder if Servo has binary builds for android that I can download
[08:54:53] <Diggsey> doubt it
[08:56:04] <Diggsey> it would be nice if rust could automatically build the stdlib when you specify a non-native target
[08:56:37] <Diggsey> everything else about cross-compiling with llvm and rust is really nice
[08:57:11] *** Joins: panicbit (panicbit@moz-kqu.rvb.226.79.IP)
[08:57:25] <Diggsey> not that it would take much to beat the horror story of cross-compiling with gcc...
[08:59:26] <eddyb> Diggsey: or, you know, you could download those targets...
[09:00:03] <eddyb> you can cross-compile to windows if you have a compatible mingw around, I would think
[09:00:14] <Diggsey> you mean download prebuild stdlibs?
[09:00:31] <eddyb> but 32 <-> 64 is trivial, just download the other one and install it
[09:01:00] <eddyb> Diggsey: yeah. $PREFIX/lib/rustlib/ has per-target subdirectories
[09:01:16] <eddyb> I wonder if multirust already supports this
[09:01:27] <Diggsey> yeah, I was just suggesting making the process easier
[09:01:41] <Diggsey> for many targets it's not easy to download prebuilt binaries
[09:02:14] <eddyb> compiling custom libstd's is not exactly easy, either
[09:03:29] <eddyb> Diggsey: though it has already started https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/liblibc/lib.rs#L15-L18
[09:03:51] <eddyb> and https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/liblibc/lib.rs#L78-L80
[09:04:26] <eddyb> but that's just the libc crate, doing the rest is less fun
[09:05:10] <Diggsey> yeah, I have one example where someone has set up a cargo project with symlink into a checked out rust submodule :P
[09:05:33] <eddyb> Diggsey: you could start by having a tool to do a shallow checkout of rust-lang/rust based on the exact commit hash reported by rustc --version
[09:06:41] <Diggsey> part of the problem is the insane makefile rust uses - trying to extra just the bit to compile the stdlib is not an attractive option
[09:07:09] <eddyb> and then use a custom Makefile, importing the data in mk/crates.mk to have the right dependencies...
[09:07:27] <eddyb> Diggsey: most of it is bootstrapping though
[09:07:50] <Diggsey> yeah but it's alot to wade through to find the relevent bits
[09:07:55] <eddyb> now I'm tempted to write a small makefile and see how far I get
[09:08:01] <eddyb> Diggsey: I can only think of one relevant bit
[09:08:11] <eddyb> Diggsey: and that's crate dependencies
[09:08:38] <Diggsey> but doesn't the main makefile define all sorts of variables and things that you'd need to duplicate exactlyt
[09:09:06] <eddyb> to build rustc, yes

[09:13:27] <Diggsey> yes to the first part
[09:13:31] <eerie> that is, without compiling the emitted source
[09:13:37] <Diggsey> depends on what you mean by the second part
[09:13:39] <eddyb> eerie: a provable quine?
[09:14:31] <eddyb> "without compiling the emitted source" is a very quick way of making the scheme *not* work
[09:14:37] <eerie> eddyb: something like this, I guess
[09:14:59] <eddyb> unless you trust some signing party
[09:16:32] <eerie> I thought of a way to verify that a binary you downloaded is actually from the source code, and wasn`t modified. If you need to compile and compare, then there is no point in downloading the binary, just compile the program yourself
[09:17:22] <Diggsey> well the easiest way would be to have a 3rd part build service that then provides checksums for the downloads
[09:17:45] <eddyb> Diggsey: not just checksums, signatures
[09:17:51] <Diggsey> sorry yes
[09:18:02] <eddyb> but then you're trusting that build service
[09:18:09] <Diggsey> but you can have mutliple build services
[09:18:29] <Diggsey> as long as builds are deterministic
[09:18:38] <Diggsey> you can check that they give the same results
[09:18:47] <eddyb> there might be ongoing research on distributed deterministic builds
[09:19:02] <eddyb> I vaguely recall something a couple years ago
[09:19:27] <eddyb> I know large projects are struggling to get deterministic builds

[14:25:04] <eddyb> I think so, T[N]
[14:25:11] <eddyb> or [N]T, I forget
[14:25:54] <barosl> Nevertheless I think starting with imperative style and later transferring to functional is also viable to learn Haskell
[14:26:14] <barosl> I even think every function could be `IO t` at the beginning
[14:27:37] <eddyb> I don't think this is how actual FP developers use Haskell, though, so it can be considered misrepresentative, just like the unsafe code in benchmarks
[14:28:28] <barosl> How about adding "Caveat: While you can compile this code in GHC, this code would never be used in production. Are you mad?" at the end of the TOC
[14:28:50] <eddyb> is that a rhetorical question?

[14:30:04] <barosl> Also reminds me of http://simple.wikipedia.org/
[14:30:20] <eddyb> barosl: is it using MVar like a Cell in Rust?
[14:31:14] <eddyb> hmm, I can't tell for sure from a quick read, but it seems like an Atomic<Gc<T>>
[14:31:18] <barosl> eddyb, Uh, nope, my understaind is that it is a Box with Sync
[14:31:34] <barosl> Oh, and it can only contain one value
[14:31:47] <barosl> So consequent reads will be blocked until a value is provided
[14:31:51] <eddyb> you do know that Sync is only a marker on types which can shared between threads safely, right?
[14:32:07] <barosl> Yup. MVar is also thread-safe

[14:32:30] <barosl> Not sure of that, sorry!
[14:32:46] <eddyb> it looks to me like you could just have an atomic GC'd pointer

[14:33:19] <fmtq> then, I told my girlfriend I did this.
[14:33:20] <barosl> I think its primary use case is to be used like a Chan
[14:34:12] <eddyb> hmm, so Atomic<Option<Gc<T>>>... but the blocking implies a semaphore or something similar, which has more overhead

[16:03:18] <eddyb> (have you tried rewriting it in Rust? :P)
[16:03:26] <cmr> should I do that, or should I find a way to automate actually building it?

[16:06:16] <eddyb> WindowsBunny: why would google have to pay anything?
[16:06:22] <lahwran> the performance of modern computing would be mindblowing for a bit, but he'd probably get used to that fairly quickly(?)

[16:21:12] <eddyb> cmr: isn't that similar to &mut T -> &T?
[16:21:37] <cmr> eddyb: the issue, you mean?
[16:22:17] <cmr> With &Cell it's different since you're allow mutation later, which crates a memory dependency.
[16:22:26] <cmr> with &mut T -> &T it's basically fine if you never mutate.
[16:22:27] <eddyb> hmpf
[16:24:24] <eddyb> right, so "nobody knows" is the best bet so far
[16:24:35] <cmr> yep!

[16:30:28] <eddyb> I got somewhat spoiled by a compilation of epic tracks, mixed with scenes from movies and games, but I'm still curious how it all unfolds :P
[16:30:44] <eddyb> geofft: could you describe those rules?
[16:34:05] <geofft> eddyb: basically they all flow out from the requirement that signals can be delivered, asynchronously, at any point in execution 
[16:34:28] <geofft> so, for instance, you can't do things like malloc, because you might have been signaled while malloc was holding a lock 
[16:34:55] <eddyb> geofft: that's tricky
[16:34:59] <geofft> there's a set of C API functions that POSIX requires to be "Async-Signal-Safe". `man 7 signal` on Linux lists them at the bottom 
[16:35:17] <geofft> which means that the code is necessarily written so that it does not take any mutexes, rely on global data structures, etc. 
[16:35:43] <geofft> you also can't take mutexes, rely on global data structures in unsafe ways, etc. on your own 
[16:35:51] <eddyb> so you need `doesn't call any extern "C" function outside of a given set`?
[16:36:09] <geofft> and also does not access global variables, even safe ones. 
[16:36:25] <geofft> and also does not create or destroy boxes, or call Rust functions that do, or... 
[16:37:04] <eddyb> geofft: what do you mean by global variables?
[16:37:25] <eddyb> creating/destroying a Box reaches into extern "C" so that's already covered
[16:38:28] <geofft> I _think_ you can't safely use Cell or RefCell 
[16:38:47] <geofft> since they're intended for single-threaded use, and signal delivery is sorta like being multithreaded, in all the wrong ways 
[16:40:21] <geofft> anyway, I'm not sure this is all well-correlated with what you're trying to do 
[16:40:57] <geofft> but it did occur to me that "closure, where it can only call functions from a whitelist" / "closure, where it can't call functions from a blacklist" might be a generic way of capturing both of these concepts. 
[16:41:18] <eddyb> geofft: in a signal handler, you can only access global state
[16:42:13] <eddyb> but that seems limiting. hmpf

[17:42:41] <Hannibal_Smith> I times to times question myself how Samsung is active into Rust dev
[17:42:57] <Hannibal_Smith> But seems like that are more interested into Servo than the language
[17:43:53] <GaryOak_> Probably trying to get a jump on what Firefox OS might look like written in Rust
[17:44:41] <XMPPwocky> anyways, it's interesting because of all the scary bugs (RCE, disclosure of server admin passwords, etc etc etc.)  i've encountered in this game engine, rust would "obviously" have prevented approximately none of them
[17:45:52] <XMPPwocky> you can say "foo wouldn't have happened because people would have done $FOO because it's standard in Rust", or "because $FOO is the default and the only safe way to do it"
[17:46:24] <eddyb_> huh
[17:46:28] <XMPPwocky> but often, these are the places where rust's dynamic security features would be turned off for perf reasons ahead of time
[17:46:44] <eddyb_> XMPPwocky: what are you talking about with the function lifetimes?
[17:46:54] <XMPPwocky> eddyb_: you know, right now fn is always 'static
[17:47:07] <XMPPwocky> eddyb_: but with dynamic library loading and unloading, you might need non-'static fns
[17:47:17] <eddyb_> and Cell::with_mut would be always 'static
[17:47:40] <eddyb_> F: 'static is one of the things I considered, but it's not enough
[17:48:01] <Hannibal_Smith> XMPPwocky, Haskell people primary made claims that are not appropriate to the type system around it...and made people belive that a well typed code really can't go wrong...just a personal opinon
[17:48:37] <XMPPwocky> Hannibal_Smith: well, there are logic errors (and there are certainly loads of exciting and fun logic errors too)
[17:48:56] <XMPPwocky> and then there are memory safety issues
[17:49:24] <Hannibal_Smith> Yes, but as you noted, logic erros are as importats as memory safety issues
[17:49:41] <XMPPwocky> http://www.garrysmod.com/2014/04/19/exploit-fix-released/ this was a simple logic error (if you define "letting clients and servers send arbitrary files to eachother without a particularly good reason" as simple
[17:49:45] <XMPPwocky> )
[17:50:56] <XMPPwocky> i fel like the takeaway is "do games need security? yes. do games need memory safety? yes. is just 'we use Rust' alone enough to grant memory safety? ... probably not."
[17:51:37] <GaryOak_> Just because it ensures memory safety doesn't mean it stops you from doing stupid things
[17:51:52] <Lurkin> But will it blend?
[17:52:01] <GaryOak_> that's the true question
[17:52:16] <Lurkin> I mean, if my memory is safe, what will I do when I want to blend it?
[17:52:44] <Lurkin> Insert head, start blender?
[17:53:01] <Hannibal_Smith> XMPPwocky, sorry now I understand better your opinion
[17:53:05] <XMPPwocky> but then again, there are a few issues that, while *technically* logic errors, would probably have been caught by Rust
[17:53:52] <XMPPwocky> for example, using in-band error handling (returning some sentinel value) instead of out-of-bound (ADTs)
[17:54:23] <XMPPwocky> it appears that it's super easy for things that don't ever consider errors to ship
[17:54:30] <eddyb_> I can't parse that, dave
[17:54:53] <Hannibal_Smith> XMPPwocky, yes like null pointers
[17:55:17] <eddyb_> null pointers are evil
[17:55:21] <Hannibal_Smith> But IMHO also today is not a bad design to use sentinel values
[17:55:21] <XMPPwocky> eddyb_: say, malloc / new returning NULL, and nobody checking for null
[17:55:45] <eddyb_> I almost want Option<*mut T> to be required, but that's too late now :P
[17:56:03] <XMPPwocky> eddyb_: i'd +1 that
[17:56:10] <eddyb_> XMPPwocky: -> Option<NonZero<*mut T>>

[17:56:51] <Tiffany> OptionPtrMut<T>
[17:56:56] <eddyb_> Option<Unique<T>>
[17:57:06] <XMPPwocky> but like i was saying, the root of a lot of these issues is just *not thinking* about security
[17:57:16] <eddyb_> now you can call malloc and even send the pointer across threads :P
[17:57:33] <eddyb_> XMPPwocky: it's a cultural issue, definitely
[17:57:40] <XMPPwocky> i'm not sure (but i'd like to think it's true) if having to type "unsafe" will actually make people think about security
[17:57:47] <eddyb_> I started with VB, PHP and JS
[17:57:59] <Astrum|Lap> perhaps because security is hard
[17:58:08] <Hannibal_Smith> XMPPwocky, personally I consider "unsafe" as "things that Rust type system can't express"
[17:58:13] <Astrum|Lap> path of least resistence
[17:58:18] <Hannibal_Smith> Not related to security...
[17:58:31] <Astrum|Lap> also that
[17:58:33] <Hannibal_Smith> Maybe I'm also wrong here
[17:58:35] <eddyb_> XMPPwocky: oh but you can grep for it
[17:58:49] <eddyb_> and make it look nasty on crates.io
[17:59:00] <XMPPwocky> Astrum|Lap: well, stuff like "this code segfaults when fed corrupted data, so we'll stick a checksum on"

[18:00:31] <Astrum|Lap> eek, so exciting for this weekend
[18:00:33] <Hannibal_Smith> XMPPwocky, but this is a problem not related to programming languages...or is?
[18:00:35] <Astrum|Lap> no work to do
[18:00:45] <XMPPwocky> the point of singling out games here is that they clearly have this issue
[18:00:51] <Astrum|Lap> so... FPGA or rust... maybe both
[18:01:02] <eddyb_> FPGA?
[18:01:04] <XMPPwocky> a lot of it's because people don't think about security in single-player games, because what's the worst that could happen
[18:01:06] <eddyb_> I'm jealous
[18:01:19] <XMPPwocky> but nobody's going to convince management that the engine needs to be rewritten / THOROUGHLY audited
[18:01:24] <XMPPwocky> before they implement multiplayer or whatever

[18:04:20] <GaryOak_> EVE Online probably has decent security knowing their player base
[18:04:20] <Hannibal_Smith> So exposing WebGL was going to be a great security issue
[18:04:22] <Astrum|Lap> I ran a community with a few dozen gaming servers for things like counter-strike, etc...
[18:04:26] <Astrum|Lap> SO many holes in security
[18:04:27] <XMPPwocky> and like 30 minutes of simple random fuzzing got a whole lot of exploits
[18:04:32] <Astrum|Lap> of the 'send this value crash the server' kind
[18:04:37] <Hannibal_Smith> But now seems like they changed their mind
[18:04:51] <XMPPwocky> Astrum|Lap: oh yeah, most of those are exploitable to RCE if you try hard enough
[18:05:12] <XMPPwocky> Also, they appear to have disabled asserts in release builds recently
[18:05:14] <Astrum|Lap> I wrote plugins to help mitigate some attacks it was so bad
[18:05:16] <XMPPwocky> except that a lot of those asserts
[18:05:17] <GaryOak_> That's funny that iOS in-app purchases are probably more secure than a huge game studio
[18:05:24] <XMPPwocky> were actually crucial for security (bounds checks, etc.)
[18:05:36] <Astrum|Lap> and let's not even get into multiplayer 'hacking'
[18:05:51] <Astrum|Lap> like BF3 where they trusted the client
[18:06:06] <Astrum|Lap> because obviously if I say I killed some dude with a medpack, I clearly did
[18:06:16] <Astrum|Lap> (not really exploitable, but still an obvious issue)
[18:06:25] <Astrum|Lap> or rather, a security issue
[18:06:26] <XMPPwocky> Astrum|Lap: i don't care *that* much about that, tbh
[18:06:40] <XMPPwocky> because rage aimbot and wallhack can ruin games to pretty much the same extent
[18:06:43] <Astrum|Lap> well it's just an example of how those things are designed
[18:06:48] <XMPPwocky> sure
[18:06:55] <Hannibal_Smith> <XMPPwocky> were actually crucial for security (bounds checks, etc.) <-Games already have difficoulties to ship what people wants...
[18:07:03] <GaryOak_> but if you bring down a server stack, you cost the company money
[18:07:46] *** Joins: Lilly (Lilly@moz-pfkvo9.bredband.comhem.se)
[18:07:51] <XMPPwocky> GaryOak_: true, but again that sort of server DoS isn't *that* much more game-ruining than just aimbotting everybody
[18:08:02] <Hannibal_Smith> Games are interesting because there ins't an "good enough" performance
[18:08:05] <XMPPwocky> unless it's a MMO or something where you can kill a whole instance
[18:08:08] <Astrum|Lap> I'm sure you can still flood source servers with essentially useless messages from the client
[18:08:12] <Hannibal_Smith> There is always something more that they can do
[18:08:15] <Astrum|Lap> so that the server is perpetually in catch-up mode
[18:08:25] <GaryOak_> Look at something like SimCity, that basically destroyed their reputation with players and reviewers
[18:08:38] <GaryOak_> at least Maxis, EA was already bad

[18:09:40] <XMPPwocky> and introduced https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7cNFL8f--w where you could shut down chat for a whole server
[18:09:49] <Astrum|Lap> yeah
[18:10:34] <Hannibal_Smith> And XMPPwocky, if you think that games should reconsider bound checking, I would be curious about your opinon on Rust dev to ship code (-release) without checks

[18:12:10] <Tobba> there was that one time there was a server that said it had 200 players on it that would delete hal32.dll if you joined it
[18:12:13] <XMPPwocky> if you set your viewangle's roll to 90 degrees, and look up
[18:12:21] <XMPPwocky> you move at full speed while crouched
[18:12:35] <XMPPwocky> but only if moving backwards

[18:15:15] <XMPPwocky> sprintf(command_buffer, "say \"%s\";", chat_box_contents)
[18:15:23] <Tobba> when you hit "join game" in steam it launches the game with arbitrary command line arguments specified by the person you're joining
[18:15:31] <eddyb_> wait, can you overflow it?
[18:15:34] <XMPPwocky> Tobba: and you can trigger that from a url

[18:16:07] <Tobba> oh yeah and heres a funny one
[18:16:19] <Tobba> the load_module console command or whatever it was named could be run by the server
[18:16:24] <eddyb_> can you put ; in those cmd arguments?
[18:16:31] <Tobba> if you renamed a dll file to have an .mdl extension it would just eat that right up and load it
[18:16:38] <XMPPwocky> of course it would
[18:16:43] <Tiffany> you have no idea how many potential buffer sprintf buffer overflows are stopped by capping command strings to 1024 bytes in this mud codebase, eddyb
[18:16:56] <Tiffany> it's over a thousand
[18:16:59] <Tiffany> probably more

[18:17:44] <XMPPwocky> or something like that
[18:18:00] <Tobba> I remember uplay having an exploit exactly like this
[18:18:02] <XMPPwocky> does unbindall work?
[18:18:05] <Tobba> so you'd think people would take is seriously
[18:18:06] <XMPPwocky> of fucking coures it does
[18:18:23] <Astrum|Lap> lol
[18:18:48] <XMPPwocky> also, recently the server handshake was changed
[18:18:50] <Astrum|Lap> I'm assuming other engines have similar issues
[18:18:57] <Astrum|Lap> but due to popularity they're not exploited as much
[18:18:59] <XMPPwocky> er, sorry, the protocol for querying stats
[18:19:06] <XMPPwocky> like what map, which players, etc.
[18:19:33] <Astrum|Lap> at one point I wanted to make a sourcebans successor that supported more than just source games
[18:19:40] <XMPPwocky> before, you'd send (values not correct, i forget what they were) a packet with 0xDEADBEEF, the server would send back a packet with 0xDEADBEEF
[18:19:47] <XMPPwocky> and then you'd be connected
[18:20:01] <XMPPwocky> now, this was UDP...
[18:20:04] <Astrum|Lap> wonder if that'd still be a viable thing to work on..
[18:20:05] <XMPPwocky> so if you spoofed the source IP
[18:20:07] <Tobba> let me guess; you could reuse the token to hell
[18:20:14] <XMPPwocky> you could get two servers to talk to eachother forever
[18:20:19] <Tobba> haah
[18:20:20] <Astrum|Lap> I know a lot of games are moving to servers you can't run yourself
[18:20:21] <eddyb_> ahahahahaha
[18:20:32] <XMPPwocky> or a server to talk to itself
[18:20:34] <Tobba> thats fucking brilliant
[18:20:56] <XMPPwocky> basically https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz9ra9FqNKQ

[18:25:05] <XMPPwocky> this is getting silly

[18:30:17] <Tobba> most important RFCs are also horrible
[18:30:28] <Tiffany> horrible?
[18:30:39] <XMPPwocky> the IRC RFCs are amazing
[18:30:43] <Tiffany> I've always preferred IETF RFCs to other types of standards documents
[18:30:44] <XMPPwocky> 90% of what's described is never implemented
[18:30:49] <Tiffany> they're usually much easier to work through
[18:30:50] <XMPPwocky> 90% of what's implemented isn't in any RFC
[18:30:52] <Tiffany> also lol yeah xmppwocky
[18:32:03] <Tobba> they're great standards documents, just usually crappy standards
[18:32:12] <eddyb_> Tobba: say you always knew the traffic in each node for the past one second
[18:32:32] <eddyb_> like, the density. one number
[18:32:43] <eddyb_> (cheap to multicast, I hope)
[18:33:24] <eddyb_> each node has a 2D heatmap and each packet to be routed forms a line segment crossing the grid
[18:34:47] <eddyb_> you could pick a cold path, update the heatmap and send the packet in the right direction
[18:34:48] <Tobba> couldn't you group up all neighbouring nodes in groups of two
[18:35:33] <eddyb_> I am assuming this would work if you had perfect realtime data
[18:35:54] <Tobba> would still need to keep it somewhat in sync
[18:36:05] <Tobba> and uh, then group all the groups of two in groups of two
[18:36:08] <eddyb_> the question is how much latency you can afford
[18:36:10] <Tobba> get that O(log2 n)
[18:36:35] <Tobba> hm, forget I said anything about IETF RFCs, they're pretty great
[18:36:46] <Tobba> having to read the MIME RFC makes me cranky as heck
[18:37:40] <Tobba> eddyb_: well, preferably none
[18:37:58] <Tobba> but if you did the binary grouping thing you wouldn't actually need to keep track of too many nodes
[18:38:15] <eddyb_> I mean, how much heatmap update latency you can afford
[18:38:36] <eddyb_> affording none is worst case :P
[18:38:37] <Tobba> I'm pretty sure the heatmap would oscillate like hell wouldn't it
[18:39:01] <eddyb_> make it cool off slowly?
[18:39:39] <Tobba> could still oscillate pretty badly I think
[18:39:49] <Tobba> especially if you're gonna have crappy implementations around
[18:39:51] <eddyb_> there was a thing for adapting a system

[18:40:43] <eddyb_> I forget what it's called, it had an odd acronym, likely overlapping something unrelated

[19:06:02] <Astrum|Lap> =)
[19:06:19] <eddyb_> hmm
[19:06:31] <eddyb_> "category" itself is a good name
[19:06:43] <eddyb_> a type is a category of values
[19:06:51] <eddyb_> a typeclass is a category of types
[19:07:00] <Astrum|Lap> I... would not go that far
[19:07:12] <eddyb_> but that's just the first step!
[19:07:13] <Astrum|Lap> like I said I'm not an expert (or even really a novice) in this area
[19:07:46] <eddyb_> Astrum|Lap: the goal is to remove this artificial tiering
[19:07:52] <Astrum|Lap> most I've used category theory for has been silly things like the fundamental group and functors
[19:08:19] <eddyb_> why not have a category of typeclasses?
[19:08:25] <eddyb_> or multi-typed values?
[19:08:31] <Astrum|Lap> well I don't really know what the integers mean in the case of F(n) (or what F is obviously)

[19:19:11] <WindowsBunny> Astrum|Lap: How much does it cost for a full keyboard worth of switches?
[19:19:30] <GaryOak_> like $50 US
[19:19:45] <c74d> eddyb_: Does it break the relevant theoretical models terribly if one says that if one can validly say “x is a y”, then y is a type?
[19:20:00] <Astrum|Lap> WindowsBunny: I joined a group buy
[19:20:05] <Astrum|Lap> it was $0.16/switch
[19:20:06] <XMPPwocky> c74d: that sounds vaguely like dependent types
[19:20:19] <eddyb_> c74d: I don't know
[19:20:30] <Astrum|Lap> so... full keyboard (ish) is about $16 for the switches
[19:20:34] *** Quits: Rym_ (y@moz-o80acm.range86-189.btcentralplus.com) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[19:20:37] <XMPPwocky> c74d: you could say that for any function f(x), the set of inputs x where f(x) is defined is a type
[19:20:40] <eddyb_> but a type of types... how do you express that using the number 2?
[19:20:47] <WindowsBunny> Astrum|Lap: nice
[19:20:48] <c74d> And then “x is a Int”, so Int is a Type, so Type is a Type.
[19:21:11] <Astrum|Lap> WindowsBunny: yeah, I actually got 400 switches so I can make a few, heh
[19:21:30] <WindowsBunny> Astrum|Lap: Good luck with your keyboard adventures

[19:23:09] <Astrum|Lap> switch matric is simple
[19:23:22] <c74d> eddyb_: why/how would one need to express a type of types with the number 2?
[19:23:36] *** Joins: pcwalton (pcwalton@moz-l8ebtf.sfo1.mozilla.com)
[19:24:07] <c74d> In my hypothetical programming language, a type's type is just a type, but I'm too uncultured in the relevant theory to know whether that's somehow bad.
[19:24:19] <Zoxc> Astrum|Lap: Cases and blackplates are hard
[19:24:29] <Astrum|Lap> that's my only concern, Zoxc

[19:25:14] <Zoxc> CNC
[19:25:49] <eddyb_> c74d: because otherwise you cannot express the concepts associated with numbers larger than 3
[19:25:53] <Zoxc> Cases are a bit large for most 3D printers?
[19:26:00] <eddyb_> minor revelation btw
[19:26:10] <Astrum|Lap> well my current plan is to not make a full keyboard
[19:26:16] <Astrum|Lap> the PCB would be outrageously expensive
[19:26:47] <Astrum|Lap> 60% will do
[19:27:06] <eddyb_> foo(f: F, F: Fn()), which in Rust 1.0 is fn foo<F: Fn()>(f: F)
[19:27:16] <Zoxc> Astrum|Lap: So keep the right half? =P
[19:27:25] <eddyb_> can be written as foo(f: F: Fn()) as a shorthand
[19:27:39] <eddyb_> but if F is not used anywhere else then...
[19:27:45] <c74d> when I see “PCB”, I always think “toxic sludge” before “computer component” :x
[19:27:46] <eddyb_> foo(f: Fn())
[19:28:01] <Astrum|Lap> I'd actually like to make a modular keybaord
[19:28:06] <Astrum|Lap> I have a few ideas I've been toying with
[19:28:50] <eddyb_> now, that may not apply to Rust because of how much it cares about performance and preciseness
[19:29:38] <eddyb_> I would even use a sigil for trait objects just so generics can use traits
[19:29:56] <eddyb_> Box<~Trait>
[19:30:45] <eddyb_> ~Foo being shorthand for existentials
[19:31:03] <Zoxc> Foo is shorter
[19:31:35] <eddyb_> Box<~> would be like an empty trait's object
[19:31:42] <XMPPwocky> interface{}
[19:31:50] <eddyb_> &[T; ~]
[19:33:17] <niconii> could you even do anything with Box<~>
[19:33:18] <eddyb_> fn foo(x: &[T; ~N], f: Fn(T) -> U) -> Box<[U; N]>
[19:33:32] <eddyb_> niconii: query its size, alignment and drop it
[19:33:52] <eddyb_> Box<Sized>, if it works, would be the same
[19:35:31] <eddyb_> I guess weird uses of these existentials would lead to dependent typing

[20:47:26] <Tiffany> of course, if you're writing any kind of math system, you'd damned well better make any number to the 0th power be 1, including 0
[20:47:41] <Tiffany> it's much more harmless than division by zero going to infinity
[20:47:53] <Tobba> I thought most people avoided giving that a definition
[20:48:22] <Astrum|Lap> well what Tiffany said is technicaly correct, Tobba 
[20:48:36] <Astrum|Lap> which is all that matters in math
[20:49:16] <Tobba> well, all you're doing is moving the special cases around
[20:49:49] <Astrum|Lap> how so?
[20:49:56] <Tiffany> I guess so
[20:50:11] <Tiffany> I didn't consider that there might be usecases where it's useful for 0^0 to be 0
[20:50:16] <Astrum|Lap> next you'll tell me 1 should be prime! =P

[21:36:59] <GaryOak_> Astrum|Lap is coding in a spinning chair #nasaspacecamp
[21:37:07] <panicbit> \o/
[21:37:07] <panicbit>  |
[21:37:07] <panicbit>  ∧
[21:37:12] <Astrum|Lap> that's be pretty awesome
[21:37:15] <Tobba> close enough
[21:37:24] <GaryOak_> \o/
[21:37:25] <Tobba> that character actually moves around like hell in hexchat
[21:37:25] <Tobba> what
[21:37:30] <GaryOak_> | |
[21:37:47] <Tobba> if you mark any nearby lines it flickers around
[21:38:18] <panicbit> Uh, is hexchat a xchat clone?
[21:38:24] <niconii> the world's first irc animation
[21:38:30] <niconii> what a historic moment
[21:38:36] <panicbit> Oh yeah right. It's the windows build.
[21:38:36] <Tiffany> hexchat is a fork of xchat, panicbit
[21:38:44] <Tiffany> the development of xchat has been abandoned for 5 years
[21:38:54] <panicbit> I actually used that one myself a long time ago :|
[21:39:09] <panicbit> Xchat2*
[21:39:18] <Astrum|Lap> we need a new irc client, that's web 3.0 compatible
[21:39:20] <Astrum|Lap> or 4.0
[21:39:22] <Astrum|Lap> whatever we're up to
[21:39:28] <Tiffany> web infinity
[21:39:31] <Tiffany> point oh
[21:40:07] <GaryOak_> I'm on a macintosh computer
[21:40:09] <panicbit> Well, there's mibbit??
[21:40:11] <niconii> we need a new irc client with the sound aesthetic sense of the average geocities website
[21:40:35] <niconii> why the fuck can't i make marquees in irc
[21:40:37] <panicbit> Mibbit somehow seems to be popular...
[21:40:40] <Astrum|Lap> lol
[21:40:49] <GaryOak_> WebIRC is actually ok
[21:40:53] <Astrum|Lap> I've never used an irc client I've liked
[21:41:01] <Astrum|Lap> and I've used most of them at this point
[21:41:10] <GaryOak_> I use LimeChat on Mac, it's decent
[21:41:23] <ytain> i use textual
[21:41:32] <niconii> oh yeah, speaking of marquees
[21:41:39] <Astrum|Lap> I use colloquy, it's bad in subtly different ways from the rest
[21:41:39] <ytain> textual is a soft reskin of limechat
[21:41:50] <GaryOak_> ytain: I'll check that out!
[21:41:56] <panicbit> There's a nodejs lib for irc. We totally should make another bloated app that hogs 100% cpu and 2 gig ram.
[21:42:01] <ytain> GaryOak_ they have source code on github
[21:42:04] <niconii> you know that whole... falling snowflake effect that some sites have/had?
[21:42:13] <GaryOak_> hahahaha yep
[21:42:17] <niconii> i found a site like that once, but
[21:42:17] <Tobba> that completely murdered firefox I assume?
[21:42:25] <niconii> it wasn't done in javascript
[21:42:25] <Astrum|Lap> panicbit: we'll base it off of atom whatever
[21:42:29] <Tobba> oh wait, geocities
[21:42:43] <Astrum|Lap> we clearly need a huge chunk of chrome for irc
[21:42:50] <panicbit> Astrum|Lap: Funny thing is I was thinking of Atom when I talked about ressource usage...
[21:42:53] <niconii> it was annoying me, so i looked in the inspect element window to try and remove it
[21:43:00] <niconii> there were like
[21:43:06] <Astrum|Lap> panicbit: it's the first thing that came to my mind, lol
[21:43:07] <niconii> 500 vertical marquee tags
[21:43:13] <Tobba> hah
[21:43:16] <niconii> every single snowflake was a marquee
[21:43:20] <Astrum|Lap> I don't understand why someone thought that was a good idea
[21:43:32] <panicbit> Astrum|Lap: Well, in theory it is.
[21:43:35] <niconii> and they weren't wrapped up in a div or anything, so i couldn't even remove them all at once
[21:43:51] <Astrum|Lap> in a very broad theory
[21:43:59] <niconii> rather, they were in a div, but it was something like
[21:44:11] <panicbit> Astrum|Lap: But eh. Maybe atom will help advance the state of JS or something like that.
[21:44:34] <niconii> <div><div id="actualsite">...</div> <five hundred marquees...></div>
[21:45:00] <niconii> so i couldn't delete the outside div without just wiping out the whole site
[21:45:07] <Tobba> panicbit: I hope it's a lesson to stop bolting complicated things to already overcomplicated things

[21:46:43] <Astrum|Lap> Tobba: nah
[21:46:53] <Astrum|Lap> eventually the web will take over all of computing
[21:47:02] <Astrum|Lap> and we'll be stuck with it
[21:47:04] <Tobba> Astrum|Lap: then we'll all be running chrome in a VM
[21:47:06] <Astrum|Lap> and future generations will curse us
[21:47:15] <Tobba> where the security model eventually becomes too convoluted and bad
[21:47:19] *** fkaa_ is now known as fkaa
[21:47:20] <Tobba> so we put the VM in another VM and the cycle continues
[21:47:44] <niconii> let's implement chrome in hardware
[21:47:52] <ytain> well there's sandboxing

[21:47:54] <niconii> what could go wrong?
[21:48:31] <Tobba> imagine the hardware bugs
[21:48:31] <Astrum|Lap> ugh, chrome
[21:48:41] <Astrum|Lap> 10GB repo
[21:48:54] <Astrum|Lap> with like 100MB of license headers
[21:49:07] <panicbit> chromium user here :P
[21:49:10] <GaryOak_> ytain: make a language that's based off of tab and space characters, so when someone opens the sourcecode it looks like nothing
[21:49:25] <Astrum|Lap> GaryOak_: been done
[21:49:31] <ytain> unicode
[21:49:35] <WindowsBunny> GaryOak_: whitespace
[21:49:41] <Astrum|Lap> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitespace_(programming_language)
[21:49:43] <Astrum|Lap> heh
[21:49:56] <GaryOak_> haha awesome
[21:50:03] <WindowsBunny> syntax highlighting is so important in that language
[21:50:05] <Astrum|Lap> I love esolangs
[21:50:29] <panicbit> Befunge is quite a nice language
[21:50:50] <Astrum|Lap> I still want to revisit piet
[21:51:14] <panicbit> Your code is layed out on a 2D space and the instruction pointer is a 2D Point as well
[21:51:39] <Tobba> I need to stop typing in 80-col
[21:51:41] <Tobba> but it's a fun piss-take at people who write code like that
[21:51:42] <panicbit> (i.e. your code runs in every direction)
[21:52:05] <Astrum|Lap> panicbit: check out piet, it has a mildly similar concept
[21:52:13] <panicbit> Astrum|Lap: I know :)
[21:52:14] <Astrum|Lap> it's more tree navigation
[21:52:25] <panicbit> Astrum|Lap: Couldn't manage to wrap my had around the colors yet :P
[21:52:29] <panicbit> head*
[21:52:43] <Astrum|Lap> eh, it's not too bad, I've written a few interpreters for it
[21:52:43] <GaryOak_> I remember Malbolge in a TV episode lol
[21:52:44] <Tobba> befunge with rotation operations could be fun
[21:52:47] <panicbit> Or the keywords if you prefer that...
[21:52:50] <Tobba> GaryOak_: sherlock?
[21:52:53] <Tobba> I think
[21:52:56] <GaryOak_> Yeah!
[21:52:58] <Astrum|Lap> also there's a cool group relation between the colors!
[21:53:07] <Astrum|Lap> two seconds
[21:54:33] <GaryOak_> Whoa Piet is rad!
[21:55:09] <Astrum|Lap> so the colors are of the form 0xRGB
[21:55:21] <Astrum|Lap> where R, G, and B can be 00, C0, or FF
[21:55:44] <panicbit> I like CFDG as well. It's not an eso-lang but it makes pretty images :) (Take a look through the gallery http://www.contextfreeart.org/gallery/)
[21:56:13] <Astrum|Lap> and if you look at it a bit further you see that light red, red, and dark red all share the same value
[21:56:25] <GaryOak_> That could be the future, like using PhotoShop to write programs
[21:56:33] <Astrum|Lap> take min and max anyway
[21:56:50] <Astrum|Lap> so light red = FFC0C0, min = C0, max = FF
[21:56:55] <Astrum|Lap> replace min values with 0, max with 1
[21:57:00] <Astrum|Lap> light red = 100
[21:57:10] <Astrum|Lap> red is FF0000 which is 100
[21:57:15] <Astrum|Lap> dark is C00000 which is 100
[21:57:19] <Astrum|Lap> just... a nifty little thing =P
[21:57:38] <Astrum|Lap> and it also forms a group
[21:57:44] <Astrum|Lap> iirc
[22:00:59] <panicbit> Anyone tried Java2k yet?
