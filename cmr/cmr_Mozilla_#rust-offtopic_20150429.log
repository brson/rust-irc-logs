[00:00:22] <tiffany> I've done that ever since I watched that talk about the web and rust
[00:00:49] <barosl> ChrisMorgan, I even do that in GVim. No menus, no scrollbars, and even mouse disabled

[00:01:23] <ChrisMorgan> barosl: nah, mouse=a is good.
[00:01:43] <barosl> I just wanted to be a pure keyboardist
[00:01:46] <scott> in certain cases the mouse is faster
[00:01:50] <eddyb> wine: created the configuration directory '/home/eddy/.wine_64' wine: WINEARCH set to win64 but '/home/eddy/.wine_64' is a 32-bit installation.
[00:01:54] <eddyb> this is pure stupid
[00:02:04] <tiffany> I have scrollbar disabled in vim, but not the menu
[00:02:06] <ChrisMorgan> barosl: it cannot be refuted that just occasionally mouse is useful.
[00:02:10] <tiffany> I haven't used it in a while
[00:02:17] <scott> I never use the menu
[00:02:24] <scott> (and have it hidden)
[00:02:41] <ChrisMorgan> I have guioptions=aegiLt
[00:02:44] <tiffany> there's no visible widgets in my emacs
[00:03:00] <barosl> aegil... agile...
[00:03:08] <scott> I have guioptions=aegi
[00:03:13] <scott> but I don't recall what that means
[00:03:20] <ChrisMorgan> scott: :help 'go'
[00:03:28] <scott> already looking :p
[00:03:46] <ChrisMorgan> Seeing as I never have the menus on, t is superfluous.
[00:04:44] <ChrisMorgan> Hmm, apparently I do have scrollbars on in gVim in certain situations, that’s what L is about.
[00:05:11] <ChrisMorgan> But the only reason I have gVim installed at all is that the package for vim only doesn’t have certain features that I want built into it.
[00:05:23] <ChrisMorgan> I always use vim in urxvt.
[00:05:33] <scott> looks like 'a' is for X selection integration, 'e' is for GUI tabs which I don't use, 'i' is for GUI icon with doesn't matter, and 'g' is for menu items and is superfluous for me
[00:05:54] <scott> I use gvim since it has better font rendering, colors, and mouse support
[00:06:15] <scott> mostly pretty minor
[00:06:16] <ChrisMorgan> scott: better mouse support in what way?
[00:06:35] <barosl> I've only used gnome-terminal and konsole on Linux, so how much better is urxvt than those?
[00:06:38] <ChrisMorgan> I tweaked my urxvt colours so that the colours were better.
[00:06:54] <scott> I forget the details. only thing I can think of off the top of my head is changing the mouse cursor when dragging vim window dividers and such
[00:07:12] <barosl> What I care about terminals is... well, unicode support?
[00:07:13] <ChrisMorgan> barosl: they’re simply different. I just didn’t want any gnome or kde stuff, so I went with urxvt and after some effort got it working as I wanted.
[00:07:29] <barosl> And xterm-256color compliance?
[00:07:52] <barosl> Surprisingly many terminal emulators on Windows don't support xterm-256color correctly
[00:08:18] <ChrisMorgan> barosl: some characters still appear as boxes because I’ve never gotten around to figuring out how to fix its font fallbacks which don’t seem to be working, but all the important Unicode stuff (☺, ☹, punctuation, that sort of thing) works fine.
[00:08:38] <barosl> Ah, that's odd
[00:08:43] <barosl> Does it use fontconfig?
[00:08:45] <FreeFull> I use nvim
[00:08:46] <eddyb> okay, so
[00:08:49] <ChrisMorgan> I wouldn’t recommend using urxvt without a bit of effort into configuration, though.
[00:08:50] <eddyb> I have a project
[00:08:55] <scott> apparently neovim can do true colours in some terminals
[00:09:01] <ChrisMorgan> barosl: can’t remember the details of it all.
[00:09:01] <scott> regular vim does 256 color at best, afaik
[00:09:03] <eddyb> which never compiles with win32 rust under wine
[00:09:05] <eddyb> it just doesn't
[00:09:16] <barosl> I'm completely open to configuration. I even wasted my 40 hours to configure zsh!
[00:09:24] <FreeFull> scott: Yeah, it can
[00:09:55] <eddyb> LOL
[00:10:01] <eddyb> LOL IT JUST FUCKING FINISHED
[00:10:04] <eddyb> gosh that took AGES
[00:10:12] <FreeFull> How many hours?
[00:10:13] <scott> I eventually switched back to bash after getting too lazy for zsh configurating
[00:10:16] <barosl> scott, *true colors*? Is that even possible?
[00:10:17] <ChrisMorgan> barosl: my ~/.Xdefaults: https://pastebin.mozilla.org/8831699
[00:10:22] <scott> then I switched to fish, and it was mostly all great by default
[00:10:22] <barosl> You mean 24-bit colors?
[00:10:32] <scott> barosl: yeah
[00:10:44] <eddyb> FreeFull: minutes, but still a lot compared to normal compilation. last time I tried this it ended up in some deadlock so I assumed the same was happening now
[00:10:44] <barosl> ChrisMorgan, Huh, it uses .Xdefaults.... I'll have to figure out what exactly it is
[00:11:08] <barosl> I considered it a legacy
[00:12:03] <ChrisMorgan> Some parts of that file are dead weight; e.g. I don’t actually have uim, it didn’t pan out nicely for me in this environment, I use xim.
[00:12:05] <barosl> printf "\x1b[38;2;255;100;0mTRUECOLOR\x1b[0m\n"
[00:12:06] <barosl> Wow
[00:12:13] <barosl> I didn't know it was possible
[00:12:20] <barosl> Truly amazing
[00:12:24] <eddyb> barosl: fun fact: I started some of that
[00:12:47] <FreeFull> My terminal supports it but tmux doesn't seem to
[00:13:00] * barosl starts rewriting his .zshrc, .tmux.conf, and .vimrc
[00:13:03] <eddyb> more like I told a guy about an obscure feature and he started bugging all the terminal emulator implementers out there to implement it
[00:13:06] <barosl> Wut
[00:13:08] <barosl> No tmux
[00:13:12] * barosl aborts
[00:14:02] <barosl> eddyb, When was that? Is true color in terminal even standardized?
[00:14:21] <ChrisMorgan> As far as I’m concerned, the main use for gVim over Vim is editing xpm files 😛
[00:14:51] <eddyb> barosl: it's a VT2-something thing, I'm not sure...

[00:16:56] <barosl> FreeFull, "24-but should replace 256 colour support, I do not want to have both."
[00:17:10] <barosl> Isn't that the same as saying he does not want 24-bit color support?
[00:17:25] <barosl> 256 color will not disappear anytime soon
[00:17:43] <eddyb> https://gist.github.com/XVilka/8346728
[00:18:46] <tiffany> eddyb: is inline image display standardised or do xterm and urxvt just happen to agree on how to implement it?
[00:18:54] <eddyb> inline image display?
[00:18:59] <eddyb> I've never used that
[00:19:09] <FreeFull> tiffany: I don't think it's even an xterm feature, but some X11 hackery
[00:19:13] <eddyb> if xterm does something, it's likely going to get copied
[00:19:22] <tiffany> I have this file viewer called ranger which displays inline images
[00:19:24] <tiffany> it's pretty neat
[00:19:45] <eddyb> tiffany: does it mess with the CRTC :P?
[00:19:50] <barosl> I remember the link browser supported it
[00:19:53] <tiffany> er, CRTC?

[00:20:36] <eddyb> tiffany: are you not familiar with 8088MPH by now?
[00:20:38] <barosl> But I've always felt it like a hack, so didn't really like it
[00:21:00] <tiffany> http://i.imgur.com/9aVDxpH.png
[00:21:04] <tiffany> I tried the emacs version of w3m
[00:21:06] <tiffany> it didn't work very well
[00:21:26] <eddyb> http://trixter.oldskool.org/2015/04/07/8088-mph-we-break-all-your-emulators/ this and more technical follow-ups were big news a few weeks ago
[00:21:32] <geofft> oh yeah, the internet claims ranger uses w3mimgdisplay 
[00:22:03] <FreeFull> How do I configure ranger to do that?
[00:22:22] <tiffany> there's some config option
[00:22:42] <tiffany> put this in .config/ranger/rc.conf:
[00:22:42] <tiffany> set preview_images True
[00:22:42] <tiffany> set draw_borders True
[00:23:14] <tiffany> draw_borders half-fixes this weird bug where images don't display property
[00:23:17] <tiffany> in urxvt
[00:23:25] <tiffany> if you're using xterm you might not need it
[00:24:14] <geofft> oh, and yes, looking at the w3m source (w3mimg/x11/x11_w3mimg.c) it uses the $WINDOWID environment variable 
[00:25:00] <geofft> xterm and possibly some other emulators set WINDOWID to the id of the Window resource that's displaying the current terminal 
[00:25:06] <geofft> so that you can do stupid tricks like this 
[00:25:18] <tiffany> oh
[00:25:28] <tiffany> I thought it was fancier than that
[00:26:10] <geofft> hm, it's possible that if you find your own Window (with, like, xwininfo or something), you can export WINDOWID=that 
[00:26:25] <geofft> and get w3m-img / ranger to work in an arbitrary emulator 
[00:26:35] *** Quits: Lilly (Lilly@moz-pfkvo9.bredband.comhem.se) (Quit: bajs)

[00:26:58] <tiffany> that also explains why it's so buggy too, I guess
[00:27:14] <tiffany> the images are prone to weird striping patterns and being offset almost off the edge of the screen
[00:27:21] <WindowsBunny> eddyb: So is it possible that wine has broken mouse wheel support?

[00:27:43] <geofft> there is a protocol for displaying images in the terminal, sixel 
[00:27:50] <geofft> https://github.com/saitoha/libsixel has all sorts of stupid tricks using it 
[00:28:37] *** Quits: Skyler (Skyler@moz-nu4i4b.sd.cox.net) (Client exited)
[00:29:05] <FreeFull> Does this support more than 256 colours though?
[00:29:06] <geofft> oh and someone wrote a w3mimgdisplay-compatible tool using libsixel so that it works with ranger :) 
[00:29:34] <WindowsBunny> Meanwhile the windows console has a strict 16 color limitation
[00:29:34] <geofft> apparently xterm's sixel implementation only supports _16_ colors 
[00:32:01] <FreeFull> Yeah, w3mimgdisplay does something else, and supports truecolor
[00:32:17] <geofft> presumably w3mimgdisplay can use anything that X can use, including libGL 
[00:32:18] <FreeFull> It does one thing for xterm, and another for linux framebuffer
[00:32:19] <tiffany> uh huh
[00:32:44] <tiffany> does sixel have some kind of weird colour limitation?
[00:32:49] <geofft> ... now I'm imagining a VT-something escape sequence for embedding GLSL 
[00:32:49] <tiffany> everything looks like it's gif-encoded
[00:33:07] <niconii> huh, interesting
[00:33:33] <FreeFull> tiffany: sixels are a very old standard designed for line printers and physical terminals
[00:33:51] <geofft> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixel has a bit of info 
[00:34:01] <geofft> "Colors were defined using either RGB or HSV values in a peculiar DEC format. On a printer, a line of sixels was sent several times, each representing a single bitplane from the register-based colors on the terminals (normally 2 or 4 bits)." 
[00:36:18] <niconii> yeah, they mention the DEC LA-50 printer which seems to be from 1983

[03:19:47] <WindowsBunny> Mutabah: I dislike the variable widthness of tabs
[03:19:50] <lahwran> ^
[03:19:56] <lahwran> that's *the* reason to not use it
[03:20:04] <Mutabah> ... ah, had forgotten that little quirk
[03:20:12] <rootnode> especially when the tabs are followed by spaces to align multiline parameters for example
[03:20:15] <Mutabah> As I always use it chained
[03:20:21] <c74d> I don't mind tab indentation. *stands next to Mutabah with a large shield*
[03:20:32] <rootnode> and then someone uses a different tab-width and it all ends up being a mess
[03:20:40] <WindowsBunny> It also makes it really hard to stay within a column limit
[03:20:40] <scott> tabs in other people's code causes me so many problems
[03:20:42] <lahwran> I'd really rather code was stored entirely unprettified, though
[03:20:51] <WindowsBunny> Because if the tab size changes, suddenly code might break out of the column limit
[03:20:55] <c74d> I don't approve of using whitespace for alignment, though.
[03:20:55] <lahwran> just store code on one line
[03:21:09] <lahwran> and then use a language-aware editor
[03:21:18] <lahwran> (maybe not on one line; some editability when saved is nice)
[03:21:24] <c74d> ++lahwran
[03:21:44] <lahwran> but basically what I'm saying is that a vim that actually gave me operations on conceptual boundaries, rather than text chunks, would be amazing
[03:21:48] <scott> or have a strict formatter like gofmt
[03:21:52] <c74d> (definitely not one line though, that wouldn't work for all languages)
[03:21:56] <lahwran> oh, sure
[03:22:03] <lahwran> for existing ones, definitely not
[03:22:05] <scott> I don't mind tabs nearly as much in Go than in languages that lack a formatting tool like gofmt
[03:22:09] <lahwran> for existing ones, store it nicely
[03:22:19] <lahwran> I mind tabs especially much in go, actually
[03:22:24] <lahwran> because they're still variable when displayed
[03:22:25] <scott> why?
[03:22:34] <lahwran> except now you can't avoid them
[03:22:44] <scott> but it doesn't matter in Go because you aren't ever doing alignment or mixing with spaces
[03:22:47] <WindowsBunny> I want my code to appear the same everywhere
[03:22:50] <lahwran> ^
[03:22:56] <lahwran> tabs in go still don't promise that
[03:23:03] <WindowsBunny> scott: If I write my code to fit in 100 columns with 4 space tabs
[03:23:10] <WindowsBunny> then someone displays it in a viewer with 8 space tabs
[03:23:20] <scott> 100% their fault
[03:23:20] <lahwran> which is the norm in go, I think, 4 space tabs and around 100 columns
[03:23:23] <WindowsBunny> suddenly my code which is carefully lined up to fit in 100 columns is broke
[03:23:27] <lahwran> that's not helpful, though, scott
[03:23:31] <lahwran> I don't want to just blame them
[03:23:37] <scott> I do
[03:23:38] <WindowsBunny> scott: So I have to use stylish to force github to do 4 space tabs
[03:23:41] <scott> 8 spaces is retarded :D
[03:23:55] <WindowsBunny> scott: Go yell at github
[03:24:09] <scott> I agree github handles tabs awfully
[03:24:29] <scott> and I agree it would be better if they didn't exist so they wouldn't have to handle them
[03:24:34] <WindowsBunny> scott: And if I use spaces, then everyone viewing my code on github will see it the way I intended
[03:24:45] <scott> I haven't viewed Go code on github much
[03:24:50] <lahwran> also for the record Mutabah, you did not ask a stupid question
[03:24:52] <scott> perhaps if I had I would hate Go even more
[03:24:58] <lahwran> or say a stupid thing
[03:25:10] <Mutabah> lahwran: :D
[03:25:17] <lahwran> you spawned an interesting discussion and I don't see any serious anger
[03:25:26] <Mutabah> I expected more flames
[03:25:28] <WindowsBunny> Mutabah: YOU FRIGGIN PIECE OF SHIT I HATE YOU FLAME FLAME FLAME
[03:25:36] <WindowsBunny> That better?
[03:25:37] <WindowsBunny> :D
[03:25:38] <lahwran> yeah that's not actually much of a thing in reasonable circles
[03:25:40] <Mutabah> (Where's the boom? There was supposed to be an earth-shattering kaboom?)
[03:25:47] * c74d stands closer to Mutabah with the shield.
[03:26:07] <scott> one tab bad, 4 space good
[03:26:24] <Mutabah> For the record - I use tabs, usually with 4 space configured.
[03:26:43] <lahwran> I use four spaces, on all kinds of code. I do not use go.
[03:26:55] <WindowsBunny> I refuse to go anywhere
[03:26:57] <WindowsBunny> so I stay at home
[03:26:59] <lahwran> lol
[03:27:10] <WindowsBunny> and I rust
[03:27:12] <scott> I mostly used 2 space, coming from Ruby, but I use 4 space for Rust
[03:27:34] <scott> also I followed the Google style guide which uses 2 spaces for C++
[03:27:36] <WindowsBunny> Man, there need to be more companies using Rust
[03:27:45] <WindowsBunny> So I can get a job rusting
[03:28:01] <scott> I had to deal with some GNU code recently (old gmake source)
[03:28:13] <scott> mixed tabs and spaces. half-indented braces.
[03:28:16] <XMPPwocky> the only logical standard is one space and one tab
[03:28:24] <c74d> scott: GNU :(
[03:28:35] <scott> I tried to follow the surrounding style but I totally failed
[03:28:36] <lahwran> I seriously don't get gnu
[03:28:45] <scott> I couldn't even find a setting for tab width that was consistent
[03:28:57] <scott> 4 spaces made part of the file look right and others wrong
[03:29:03] <scott> 8 spaces make those other parts look right
[03:29:06] <scott> thanks GNU

[03:29:50] <c74d> I wouldn't tell other people they shouldn't have a problem with it, but I have no problem with indentation being variable width. I try to keep program source within 78 columns, but I don't consider it much of an issue if some people see different indentation that puts it a bit over that.
[03:29:56] <WindowsBunny> lahwran: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhY9Zxv1-oo
[03:30:24] <scott> I'm mildly amused/infuriated by the fact that for all their free software preaching, GNU is one of the least approachable open source communities for me
[03:30:40] <scott> the barrier to entry is so high with their esoteric style guides and weird coding practices
[03:30:51] <niconii> i already used 4 spaces/braces on the same line before rust
[03:30:53] <c74d> (Whether I use tabs or spaces, though, seemingly depends only on whatever my editor does by default for the programming language at hand.)
[03:31:06] <niconii> so rust was really easy because i didn't need to change anything

[04:22:31] <FreeFull> There are ways of avoiding it
[04:22:47] <FreeFull> I suppose this is one reason why indents are 4 spaces =P

[04:42:00] <Yurume> I propose pi tab stop to end all tab stop discussion

[04:42:24] <Havvy> Yurume: Would any editor other than emacs be able to do that correctly?
[04:42:25] <FreeFull> I propose we get rid of newlines, and don't have more than one space at once

[04:42:52] <FreeFull> Yeah
[04:42:54] <Yurume> not that hard.
[04:43:02] <FreeFull> Rust has one of those handy grammars that let you cram everything on one line, always

[04:46:14] <FreeFull> n^n grows faster than pi^n
[04:47:02] <scott> oh, indeed... just need to distribute the ^n and that's obvious
[04:47:46] <Yurume> for any given k>0, there is a lower bound x s.t. k pi^n < n^n for every n >= x
[04:48:51] <Havvy> How would you say O(pi^n) properly?
[04:49:04] <Havvy> Would it just be O(k^n)?
[04:49:39] <scott> just O(pi^n), since that constant matters afaik

[04:59:42] <Gankro> > The %assign directive can be used to define numeric constants like the EQU directive. This directive allows redefinition.

[05:02:52] <Gankro> I'm going to say x86, and you can tell me if that's a nonsensical statement
[05:02:59] <cmr> it is.
[05:03:06] <Gankro> excellent
[05:03:45] <cmr> which assembler, is the important bit.
[05:04:10] <c74d> My hypothetical programming language has mandatory three-column indentation.
[05:04:27] <FreeFull> c74d: Everything is indented by three columns, always
[05:04:41] <c74d> …oh, I was scrolled up and the discussion was still on indentation.
[05:05:03] <Gankro> cmr: is ELF a valid answer?
[05:05:10] <cmr> no definitely not.
[05:05:13] <cmr> ELF is an object file format.

[05:07:33] <cmr> mmm.
[05:09:01] <Gankro> I mean knowing my school I probably wasn't *wrong* in the grand scheme of things, but having a basic grasp of precise terminology and basic instructions seems like it would be useful
[05:09:33] <cmr> thankfully you can learn everything you need if you're willing to spend an unbounded amount of hours pouring over manuals and blog posts.
[05:09:47] <Gankro> That's basically the plan
[05:10:02] <cmr> I recommend the intel software developer's manual very highly
[05:10:05] <FreeFull> Positive: The internet has the knowledge you need. Negative: It's hard to tell which knowledge is the good knowledge.
[05:10:09] <cmr> although AMDs is ok too.
[05:10:19] <Gankro> Regardless, my point stands: why the hell does nasm have like 3 ways to define constants, one of which is not actually a constant?
[05:10:32] <FreeFull> No idea. I personally use fasm
[05:11:21] <cmr> Gankro: consider % to be like #define, and EQU to be like `const`
[05:12:13] <scott> %assign is for nasm macros
[05:12:25] <scott> which can even do things like loop and %assign each iteration
[05:12:45] <Gankro> cmr: But %define is a seperate from %assign :S

[08:05:24] <Dabo> it'd be really nice to be able to combine multiple if let statements and regular if statements using && or some other operator, though && is consistent with other things
[08:06:52] <Dabo> It would be awesome to have `let` expressions just evaluate to a boolean - would need logic in the compiler to ensure that code can never use the variable if the boolean is false, but that could be as simple as dissallowing the or operator in if statements which use `let`
[08:07:25] <Dabo> there are multiple occasions where I have an `if let` directly inside an `if` directly inside another `if let` statement .-.

[14:21:25] <eddyb> that would do nicely to cause whatever is going on here

[14:22:00] <eddyb> yes
[14:22:17] <WindowsBunny> did you forget that earlier? ;P
[14:22:31] <Tobba> I'm not sure what "system" is even supposed to mean there

[19:01:59] <XMPPwocky> are touchpad drivers ever NOT horrible
[19:02:20] <XMPPwocky> > turn "two-finger tap to right-click" on
[19:02:40] <XMPPwocky> > sends computer into bootloop and disables touchpad / keyboard even in the bios
[19:03:14] <XMPPwocky> had to get an external keyboard
[19:06:18] <tiffany> I use synaptics and disable all the gestures
[19:06:32] <tiffany> I specificallly passionately hate that one you just mentioned
[19:06:37] <tiffany> it fires accidentally
[19:06:39] <tiffany> constantly
[19:06:45] <tiffany> even without touching the damn thing
[19:06:52] <XMPPwocky> tiffany: the buttons on this touchpad... i can barely press them with my finger
[19:06:55] <XMPPwocky> i usually need to use a fist
[19:08:21] <tiffany> when I'm stuck using my touchpad I usually switch over into "remember all those keyboard-only navigation methods that I never use"
[19:08:28] <XMPPwocky> heh
[19:08:44] <XMPPwocky> i never have unexpected gesture triggers, actually, it's neat
[19:09:00] <tiffany> there's probably some kind of configurable sensitivity
[19:09:15] <tiffany> and mine was set to "azidoazide azide"
[19:09:32] <XMPPwocky> lol
[19:09:59] <XMPPwocky> oh and anyways i got what i wanted to do, which is to enable the touchpad while typing

[19:10:24] <XMPPwocky> when there are like 16 different gesture settings
[19:10:31] <XMPPwocky> and the setting in the OS doesn't do anything
[19:10:32] <tiffany> the touch pad would be disabled for 1.5 seconds after so much as breathing on a key

[21:18:07] <GaryOak_> Astrum|Lap: luckily mine aren't outward facing APIs
[21:19:44] <Astrum|Lap> actually... I think what's worse is that the documentation is always atrocious
[21:31:39] <GaryOak_> Fortunately, I'm pretty decent at documenting my API
[21:32:33] <Astrum|Lap> you are apparently the first
[21:34:09] <GaryOak_> hah
[21:34:41] <GaryOak_> well those APIs that aren't documented generally don't stick around very long
[21:35:20] <GaryOak_> Unless they are in the MS ecosystem, in which 40 old programmers know exactly how to ghost whisper to it to make it work
[21:36:02] <Astrum|Lap> well most APIs have documentation, it's just very incomplete and sometimes flat out wrong
[21:36:15] <Astrum|Lap> as in earlier where it says, 'pass this parameter to do X'
[21:36:24] <Astrum|Lap> so I passed that parameter and X did not happen at all
[21:36:29] <c74d> “40-year-old”, or “40-odd”?
[21:36:50] <GaryOak_> 40-odd
[21:36:50] <c74d> oh nevermind
[21:37:22] <Astrum|Lap> I ended up performing a number of tests to confirm that the docs were indeed lying and I just wasted an hour trying to figure out why something that depended on it wasn't working -_-
[21:37:44] <c74d> I've realized that “40 old programmers” is completely valid English, which ought to have been obvious in hindsight. <_<
[21:38:23] <c74d> they're programmers, they're old, and there're 40 of them
[21:38:31] <VShell> GaryOak_: I spent most of yesterday trying to figure out how you write extensions for IE. apparently, the short answer is "you don't".
[21:38:39] <c74d> …except apparently you really did mean “40-odd”, okay.
