[19:54:34] <nmatsakis> aturon: there is one thing I wanted to ask you about
[19:54:41] <nmatsakis> well, I guess we have mtg.
[19:54:43] <nmatsakis> and it's kind of involved.
[19:55:53] <aturon> nmatsakis: hah, maybe after mtg then?
[19:56:14] <nmatsakis> perhaps, yes. I'm actually planning on working late today as well
