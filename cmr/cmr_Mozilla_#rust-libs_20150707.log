[11:19:53] <bluss> is it ok to fix std::io's read to end to use slightly more unsafe to memset properly?

[21:06:23] <Gankro> sfackler: burntsushi: kimundi: we're starting an impromptu libs triage meeting right now if you're interested
[21:06:40] <burntsushi> Gankro: i'm here
[21:06:46] <sfackler> Gankro: yo
[21:07:04] <kimundi> I'm here, but not really awake anymore
[21:08:10] <huon> brson: libs triage?
[21:09:09] <aturon> hey all, I just made a private discuss post with the video link
[21:09:27] <aturon> (we're hoping to be more organized about this in the future, just thought we'd try reaching out for now)
[21:09:58] <brson> huon: what room?
[21:10:10] <aturon> Rust
[21:10:15] <burntsushi> aturon: never done this before. gotta install vidyo?
[21:10:24] <aturon> yeah
[21:11:22] <burntsushi> i might be a little bit then. don't wait up!
[21:11:53] <aturon> ok, no worries. i'll be sending out email about scheduling something regular after this one.
[21:12:00] <burntsushi> great :)
[21:15:21] <brson> i can't connect to vidyo because the server is out of licenses...
[21:15:30] <aturon> uhhh
[21:16:16] <aturon> brson: have you had that problem before? do we just talk to service desk?
[21:16:59] <brson> aturon: i've never seen this before
[21:17:09] <sfackler> do I need an account to log into vidyo?
[21:17:11] <aturon> hm, i'm wondering if we should just punt this libs meeting until later this week, to get that sorted out and give others a chance to get prepped?
[21:17:26] <aturon> sfackler: i believe the invite link should suffice
[21:18:10] <sfackler> ah, I'm seeing an "Error: could not register license on server" trying to connect
[21:18:23] <aturon> gah, ok
[21:18:49] <aturon> kimundi: burntsushi: sfackler: is there a time tomorrow y'all could do a 1-1.5 hour chat?
[21:19:18] <sfackler> I'm free all day except for 11:30-12 PST
[21:19:23] *** Quits: gleb (gleb@moz-3u1drv.rusanovka-net.kiev.ua) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[21:20:03] <burntsushi> aturon: i don't get home until ~4pm EST. a start time of 5pm-8pm EST is a safe bet.
[21:20:20] <Gankro> 2pst souns good then
[21:20:20] <burntsushi> assuming i can get vidyo installed... still struggling
[21:20:28] <brson> i'll file a bugzilla ticket
[21:21:09] <aturon> brson: i'm asking in #servicedesk as well
[21:21:12] <kimundi> I'll need a few moments how find out what those times translate to in my timezone...
[21:21:36] <Gankro> kimundi: 24 hrs from now
[21:22:19] <burntsushi> ah! vidyo has to be taught not to demand pulse audio i guess.
[21:23:08] <kimundi> Right now its 23pm here, so if it could start one/two hours earlier that would be great :)
[21:23:17] <aturon> (if vidyo ends up being a big problem, we could potentially use something else; thing is, mozilla office is set up to use it, and it does work really well for large groups)
[21:23:55] <burntsushi> aturon: i'm in the "log in" popup. it seems like i need a portal/user/pass. my guess is the portal is "Rust" but idk user/pass.
[21:24:13] <aturon> burntsushi: hm, the link *should* give you access? but i've not used it externally
[21:25:36] <sfackler> when I click the link, videyo opens up the "welcome" thing that asks for a name, but then when I hit connect, it routes to the login screen with the license server error
[21:25:50] <burntsushi> aturon: going to the link again did something. browser says "vidyodesktop connected!" and my desktop client did something. but then sent me back to login dialog. "Error: Could not register license on server."
[21:26:01] <burntsushi> sfackler: sounds like my issue too
[21:26:15] <Gankro> At least everyone is walled on the same problem :P
[21:26:16] <aturon> OK yeah, so there seems to be a general issue with vidyo at the moment
[21:26:40] <sfackler> videoconfrencing's the best
[21:28:39] <burntsushi> kimundi: what about 4pm EDT? i think that's 22pm for you? (roughly 22.5 hours from now)
[21:29:21] <kimundi> burntsushi: Yeah that would be better
[21:29:49] <aturon> great! so let's plan on 4pm EDT tomorrow? I will send out info for vidyo and hangouts, and we can see which one manages to work
[21:30:05] <burntsushi> aturon: perfect. i do use hangouts every day, so i at least know that works
[21:35:33] <nmatsakis> aturon: did we ever decide whether Arc<T> requires (innately) that T: Send (vs saying that T: Send => Arc<T>: Send)?
[21:35:43] <aturon> (you should all have hangouts; testing for tomorrow)
[21:35:51] <aturon> nmatsakis: the latter
[21:36:02] <nmatsakis> aturon: interesting. 
[21:36:08] <aturon> nmatsakis: because of generic programming
[21:36:30] <nmatsakis> aturon: right
[21:47:28] * kimundi just found http://everytimezone.com/ and thinks that that will help him immensely keeping track of time
