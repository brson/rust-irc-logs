[00:00:08] <bjz_> :)
[00:00:51] <Amaranth> mesa in Ubuntu 10.04 is GL 2.1 old junk
[00:02:08] <bjz_> Amaranth: could you use glew to print out what features it supports?
[00:02:19] <bjz_> glewinfo I think?
[00:02:19] <h3r3tic> bjz_: the only reason to use VAO is to reduce the driver overhead. until you get to the point where the CPU is your major bottleneck, there isn't much use :P
[00:02:23] <Amaranth> I don't even have it installed anywhere
[00:02:31] <bjz_> Amaranth: apt-get?
[00:02:33] <bjz_> :P
[00:02:39] <bjz_> h3r3tic: oh ok
[00:02:55] <h3r3tic> I thought glxinfo could print extensions too
[00:03:10] <bjz_> h3r3tic: yeah I thought it was standard practice, but it seems more flexible to do it without vaos
[00:05:33] <Amaranth> Interesting to see that OS X is the old broken junk when it comes to GL support now
[00:05:47] <bjz_> Amaranth: yep :P
[00:05:56] <bjz_> Amaranth: it was on 2.1 for ages
[00:06:06] <Amaranth> Sure but so was mesa
[00:06:14] <bjz_> Amaranth: in lion we got 3.2 support though
[00:06:24] <Amaranth> I thought it was snow leopard that added 3.2
[00:06:35] <bjz_> Amaranth: but they skipped lots of the deprecated functionality
[00:06:36] <bjz_> maybe
[00:06:57] <bjz_> Amaranth: now in Maverckis we get 4.2 I think
[00:08:07] <bjz_> Amaranth: I think one of the reasons some of the older machines couldn't update to lion was because they couldn't update to the latest gl
[00:08:28] <bjz_> Amaranth: they keep everything standard across the OS install base.
[00:08:38] <bjz_> the issue is you get bottlenecks
[00:08:51] <bjz_> with getting access to the new stuff
[00:09:16] <bjz_> I have no idea if we will get the debug callbacks :(
[00:09:20] <bjz_> in 10.9
[00:09:42] * bjz_ has his new macbook in the mail, will find out soon
[00:10:25] <bjz_> Amaranth: so for name I was thinking "gfxy" maybe?
[00:11:30] <bjz_> or maybe something to do with rendering... not sure
[00:13:05] *** Joins: doomlord_ (servitor@moz-3F3192E5.range86-184.btcentralplus.com)
[00:13:06] <bjz_> "-y" because "gfx" is boring :P
[00:13:25] * bjz_ is so creative
[00:13:55] <bjz_> cmr: any ideas?
[00:14:25] <bjz_> cmr: un-boring name for a render manager?
[00:14:33] <bjz_> maybe bstrie could help
[00:15:37] <bjz_> he is pretty funny
[00:16:13] <bjz_> "howdygfx" (because it talks to the graphics card)
[00:17:11] <h3r3tic> lol
[00:18:06] <h3r3tic> well, the rule of all new languages is that all project names in said languages have to start with the same letter as the language
[00:18:11] <h3r3tic> so your lib has to start with an 'r'
[00:18:15] <h3r3tic> duh.
[00:18:57] <bjz_> rhowdygfx
[00:19:00] <h3r3tic> or at least be a pun of some sort on the language
[00:19:03] <h3r3tic> like, Iron
[00:19:06] <h3r3tic> because it rusts, derp.
[00:19:09] <bjz_> ironic
[00:19:12] <h3r3tic> or maybe Patina
[00:19:13] <bjz_> :P
[00:19:15] <h3r3tic> ha
[00:19:29] <h3r3tic> though mine's "Shuriken"
[00:19:32] <h3r3tic> ... they can be rusty!
[00:20:13] <bjz_> well how can you relate rust to rendering
[00:20:18] <bjz_> ochre?
[00:20:25] <bjz_> like the paint?
[00:20:39] <bjz_> or should I say pigment
[00:21:04] <h3r3tic> idunolol :P
[00:21:12] <bjz_> that's a nice name
[00:21:24] <Amaranth> Considering the name of my barely started entity framework is "yokel" I don't think you want me coming up with names
[00:21:27] <bjz_> I will use "idunolol"
[00:21:31] <h3r3tic> xDDDD
[00:21:36] <bjz_> lolrs
[00:21:42] <Amaranth> yokel = rustic person = rustic entity = entity in rust
[00:21:42] <h3r3tic> perfect
[00:21:46] <h3r3tic> O_O
[00:22:06] <bjz_> walrs
[00:22:07] <cmr> bjz_: not really paying attention atm :p
[00:22:14] <bjz_> like 'walrus'
[00:22:25] <bjz_> wal-rs
[00:24:31] <bjz_> ferric
[00:24:45] <bjz_> ferric |ˈfɛrɪk|
[00:24:45] <bjz_> adjective
[00:24:45] <bjz_> relating to iron.
[00:24:45] <bjz_> • Chemistry of iron with a valency of three; of iron(III). Compare with ferrous.
[00:25:01] <bjz_> <3 Dictionary.app
[00:25:24] <bjz_> ferrum
[00:26:32] <bjz_> or I could just do gfxy-rs
[00:26:57] <bjz_> I'll use 'lust' to finally appease bstrie
[00:28:17] <bjz_> grrs
[00:28:49] <bjz_> I might just go gfx-rs for now
[00:29:17] <h3r3tic> call it 'rim' because rims rust, and because rim lighting.
[00:29:22] <Amaranth> At least changing the name doesn't require renaming everything like if you changed a C++ namespace
[00:29:57] <bjz_> heh
[00:37:39] <bjz_> Amaranth: https://github.com/bjz/gfx-rs

[15:32:30] <cmr> Also this isn't #rust... oops
[15:34:15] <bstrie> cmr: dammit, I've been here since before 0.1 :P
[15:34:32] <bstrie> not as old as the ocaml compiler though
[15:34:42] <bstrie> but, I mean, back then it was just patrick and graydon
[15:35:10] <bstrie> I remember when elly ported cargo from python to rust :)
[15:35:15] <cmr> Heh
[15:37:21] <bstrie> I started following rust when I got my new job in 2011
[15:37:46] <bstrie> they hired me to do a greenfield project so I was researching a million different backend languages
[15:39:03] <bstrie> I was right out of college, never really exploring programming languages very much, and had spent a year unemployed and not doing any programming at all
[15:39:30] <bstrie> so when I tell you that I eventually chose javascript for our backend language
[15:39:35] <bstrie> I hope you can forgive me
[15:39:42] <cmr> hahah
[15:39:44] <cmr> node?
[15:39:45] <bstrie> those were the days of maximal node.js hype :P
[15:39:47] <bstrie> yes
[15:39:55] <cmr> I drank that kool-aid for a while too.
[15:40:16] <cmr> I actually really liked javascript for a while. Then I discovered lua, which is javascript, but better in every way :p
[15:40:36] <cmr> I at one point had most of the spec memorized down to section headings.
[15:41:41] <bstrie> anyway, rust seemed cool. had always wanted to learn a systems programming language but was too stupid and impatient to bother with C++. and the devs were SO approachable, it was great. just lurked in the channel for hours, observing them at work

[23:23:04] <erickt> jeaye: ping
[23:24:56] <jeaye> erickt: pong
[23:26:01] <erickt> hey there! I wanted to make sure you knew about http://www.meetup.com/Rust-Bay-Area/events/143439552/. It's in SF :)
[23:26:52] <jeaye> ah
[23:26:58] <erickt> spots are going fast, and if I'm going to have any chance of convincing you to give a lighting talk on q3, I first need to make sure you got a spot :)
[23:27:08] <jeaye> I'll be there.
[23:27:47] <erickt> awesome
[23:29:13] <jeaye> As for presenting, I'd need to get back to you.
[23:29:28] <erickt> someday I'll get you
[23:31:23] <jeaye> There're cooler (and more active!) projects happening in here than q3. 
[23:32:43] <jeaye> I'll get back to you in a week or so about it. Is that alright, erickt?
[23:32:56] <jeaye> (My RSVP has been sent)
[23:34:10] <erickt> jeaye: That's perfect! I figure the lightning talk will be 5-10 minutes, so you wouldn't need to do much
[23:35:11] <erickt> jeaye: unless you would want more time to present, I can always queue you up for the next meetup :)

[23:38:11] <jeaye> Ok. I'll let you know.
