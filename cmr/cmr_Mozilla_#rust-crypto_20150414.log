[22:54:28] <bascule> anyone have any thoughts on keywhiz?
[22:54:56] <mcpherrin> bascule: using FUSE is kinda weird
[22:55:00] <bascule> mcpherrin: haha what
[22:55:26] <bascule> https://twitter.com/jedisct1/status/588079207663726593
[22:55:37] <bascule> things need to read secrets from files
[22:55:46] <bascule> and there's already the POSIX permission model...
[22:56:10] <mcpherrin> Yeah, I don't think it's a terrible idea, just seems a little weird to me.
[22:56:27] <eternaleye> bascule: Why not 9p?
[22:56:30] <bascule> what would you do instead that's a generic, catch-all solution for everything that could possibly be a secret?
[22:56:40] <eternaleye> bascule: Could even trivially send it over the mTLS connection...
[22:57:14] <bascule> eternaleye: umm, what?
[22:57:23] <bascule> why would we use that on Linux instead of FUSE?
[22:57:42] <eternaleye> bascule: Because 9p is a small, simple protocol that's easier to audit?
[22:57:59] <bascule> and how good is the Linux kernel driver?
[22:58:03] <eternaleye> bascule: Using trans=fd, you could even do the auth by binding to the channelid
[22:58:05] <Ilari> Heh, with one of my apps that has API key, one could even symlink the API key file. :-)
[22:58:08] <mcpherrin> 2
[22:58:12] <eternaleye> bascule: At least as good as fuse...
[22:58:21] <bascule> does it ship with a stock CentOS 6.5 kernel?
[22:58:25] <eternaleye> bascule: Considering a _lot_ of virtualization stuff uses it using virtio
[22:58:46] <bascule> feels like FUSE is the happy path here?
[22:58:47] <eternaleye> bascule: Mm, that I dunno. Lemme check on the server I have access to that runs that.
[22:58:53] <bascule> like we used TCP and you're like "Why not SCTP?"
[22:59:22] <eternaleye> bascule: Plus, there is also already a 9p fuse implementation anyway
[22:59:30] <mcpherrin> bascule: I just would have expected linking a library into apps that need to read secrets and handling them explicitly
[22:59:34] <eternaleye> bascule: Though yes, added steps would be a pain
[22:59:43] <eternaleye> mcpherrin: Sure, but that requires changing the app
[22:59:44] <mcpherrin> bascule: But if you don't want that, then FUSE is sensible
[22:59:47] <bascule> mcpherrin: for every app in the universe?
[23:00:14] <bascule> like, should we patch MySQL?
[23:00:32] <bascule> and... everything else
[23:00:39] <mcpherrin> bascule: I guess I'm just used to embedded dev where there isn't much 3rd party code that goes unpatched :P
[23:01:01] <bascule> mcpherrin: we have native clients for it, but the LCD interface is FUSE
[23:01:34] <mcpherrin> I'd probably have gone for a tmpfs and a sync agent if I wanted to do it FS level
[23:01:47] <mcpherrin> But that puts secrets around "early"
[23:01:51] <mcpherrin> versus on-demand
[23:01:51] <eternaleye> Mmm, it does look like centos 6.5 lacks 9p
[23:04:04] <mcpherrin> I think I'm warming up to the idea of using FUSE for this though
[23:07:52] <eternaleye> Hm, bcrypt for the passwords? Not scrypt?
[23:08:04] <bascule> lol
[23:08:11] <bascule> talk to me about password hashing functions ;)
[23:08:26] <bascule> WHY NOT ARGON2?
[23:08:29] <bascule> or catena?
[23:08:38] <tiffany> I've never heard of those
[23:08:44] <eternaleye> bascule: Sure: "they all suck, but bcrypt had a paper not too long ago where they got good speed on a GPU IIRC"
[23:08:46] <bascule> or yescrypt!
[23:08:55] <eternaleye> bascule: And yes, I read the PHC list.
[23:08:56] <bascule> eternaleye: guess we're not hipster enough

[23:23:34] <bascule> eternaleye: lol unlikely
[23:23:52] <bascule> also we're largely MySQL internally. Postgres is something of a legacy DB for us
[23:24:39] <bascule> why? Postgres DBAs are rarer than unicorns
[23:24:50] <bascule> and we have Unusual Scaling Requirements
[23:24:58] <bascule> both in terms of DB size and sheer number of databases
[23:27:32] <eternaleye> Mm
[23:27:54] <eternaleye> bascule: Then again, time was Linux folks were rare than unicorns compared to MCSEs
[23:28:01] <eternaleye> bascule: And that's about how I view MySQL...
[23:28:21] <eternaleye> *rarer
[23:31:14] <bascule> eternaleye: do you have over 10,000 hosts running databases where you work?
[23:33:13] <eternaleye> bascule: No, but I've been deeply unimpressed by mysql as a whole many times even in single-machine deployments.
[23:35:58] <bascule> eternaleye: MySQL has a ton of warts. Many can be fixed by better configuration. A lot of people who bitch about MySQL semantics run it with the stock config options and don't realize they can be changed
[23:36:19] <bascule> did you know MySQL has a strict mode that makes it behave a lot more like Postgres? :o
[23:36:23] <eternaleye> bascule: Eh, even with InnoDB/other stuff I've not been impressed.
[23:36:53] <tiffany> I haven't worked on anything that couldn't be served by sqlite yet
[23:37:09] <eternaleye> tiffany: How about anything not stringly typed? :P
[23:37:21] <tiffany> sqlite isn't stringly typed, is it?
[23:37:26] <tiffany> it's weakly typed, sure
[23:37:27] <eternaleye> tiffany: Yuuuuup.
[23:37:31] <tiffany> ouch..
[23:37:43] <eternaleye> tiffany: It supports the type specifiers, but it really treats everything as strings.
[23:37:51] <tiffany> why does it do that?
[23:38:24] <eternaleye> I reaaaalllly want to write a tiny adapter lib that starts and/or connects to a minimal-settings postgres server and has the sqlite API
[23:38:32] <eternaleye> tiffany: Simplicity of implementation.
[23:39:09] <tiffany> are there other in-process databases that are any good?
[23:41:47] <bascule> there are tons of good in-process databases
[23:41:50] <bascule> it depends on your workload
[23:44:51] <eternaleye> There's also "in-process databases" as opposed to "in-process SQL relational databases"
[23:45:32] <eternaleye> If you just need key/value storage (which TBH is true of a lot of people using sqlite), LMDB is shiny (if a bit complex), while LevelDB is quite simple.
[23:45:46] <tiffany> I like relational databases
[23:47:19] <bascule> haha
[23:47:23] <bascule> eternaleye: I was just about to name those two
[23:47:26] <bascule> HamsterDB is cool too
[23:48:35] <eternaleye> bascule: Just be careful not to typo when googling it...
[23:48:55] <tiffany> does sqlite have to go through and parse number fields to sort them?
[23:48:58] <tiffany> unless you add an index
[23:50:23] <eternaleye> tiffany: Relational databases are nice for relational data; otherwise, though, it's just extra overhead and fragility.
[23:50:51] <tiffany> what overhead and fragility?
[23:51:02] <tiffany> and I do usually have relational data
[23:51:51] <eternaleye> tiffany: Query planning is not free, nor is parsing SQL, nor is the handling of datatypes beyond "blob of bytes", etc.
[23:52:26] <eternaleye> tiffany: A _lot_ of stuff can do just fine with exact lookups, ordered iteration, and blob values.
[23:52:44] <tiffany> I don't know anything about query planning
[23:53:03] <tiffany> it would be nice if there was a nicer query language than SQL
[23:53:37] <eternaleye> tiffany: "query language" is kind of the problem in itself

[23:54:52] <tiffany> I like relational algebra
[23:55:35] <eternaleye> Sure, but it's also what makes it hard to do interoperation between imperative languages and SQL.
[23:55:47] <eternaleye> They have fundamentally different paradigms
[23:55:58] <eternaleye> And that's less a function of SQL than it is of relational DBs

[23:57:33] <bascule> what if nails change and start looking like screws?
[23:57:34] <bascule> and yes
[23:57:35] <bascule> yes they are
[23:57:44] <eternaleye> bascule: BTW, did you see http://www.frankmcsherry.org/columnarization/serialization/rust/2014/12/15/Columnarization-in-Rust.html
[23:58:02] <eternaleye> (He has a number of really fascinating posts)
[23:58:07] <bascule> I did not, but I like capnp ;)
[23:58:26] <eternaleye> https://github.com/frankmcsherry/columnar
[23:58:59] <bascule> capnp lays out data in memory so it's identical to the serialized form
[23:59:19] <eternaleye> bascule: There are use cases where they're orthogonal.
