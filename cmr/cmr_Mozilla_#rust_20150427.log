[01:51:22] <KallDrexx> Mono has proven to be instable, and on some of our boxes it randomly crashes and we never know (mono crashes not my code).  So it just sits there, and if the mono executable dies it reloads it and logs the event to a file
[01:51:39] <KallDrexx> next step of course is to rewrite the mono app in rust so I don't have that instability, but in due time
[01:52:17] <KallDrexx> so simple, but it's critical it keeps working, which I guess is one of the points of rust :)

[02:17:04] <KallDrexx> So random tangent that Winding's post made me think of.  If you constantly create and destroy values on the heap (but not in order), are there any mechanisms in rust to handle fragmentation since there's no GC?
[02:17:53] <talchas> only as much as any malloc implementation tries to
[02:18:42] <cmr> we use jemalloc, which is pretty good at avoiding excessive fragmenting.
[02:19:00] *** Joins: laogao (laogao@moz-m3ssu7.members.linode.com)
[02:19:03] <aatch> KallDrexx, Rust also tries to help you avoid allocation in the first place.

[02:22:37] *** zz_kimundi is now known as kimundi
[02:23:01] <aatch> You can allocate in slabs, which means you use a little more memory than you need, but fragmentation is much less of an issue since you're allocating larger amounts.
[02:23:17] <KallDrexx> o11c: yeah, I've gotten bit by the GC quite a bit lately in some of the apps I wrote in C#, which is very frustrating since one of the reasons I used c# was to not have to think about memory :P

[04:12:24] <annodomini> Seriously though, lifetimes are actually something you have to understand intuitively, without notation for it, in something like C or C++. In Rust, you're required to notate it, and not be quite as fast and loose with it, but the compiler generally makes it pretty clear when you need to.

[06:03:50] <aatch> slimsag, on nightly, anyway.
[06:04:16] <slimsag> aatch: right; but it means declaring a separate type for each one: Vec4f32, Vec4f64, Vec4i64 etc instead of a Vec4<T> (because #[simd] can't operate with a unconstrained type)
[06:04:38] *** Quits: brianloveswords (brianlovesw@moz-tq78gs.fios.verizon.net) (Quit: My Mac has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[06:05:14] <slimsag> aatch: I can do it with macros and a top-level Vec4 trait type -- but it just feels off (like one should be able to #[simd] a generic type Vec4<T> when T is f32 etc)
[06:06:01] <aatch> slimsag, the problem is that you can't put anything other than a primitive in an SIMD type to start with.
[06:06:48] <ChrisMorgan> Guest44: what do you want this create function for?
[06:07:11] <Guest44> ChrisMorgan I want it for creating given type instances
[06:07:43] <aatch> slimsag, so having a type like Vec4<T> with #[simd] would be kinda weird.

[06:11:04] <tomaka> nevermind
[06:11:06] <slimsag> aatch: it seems like the num crate would do it (i.e. Vec4<T:Float> could be #[simd]) but obviously those are traits and as such a num::Float *might* be e.g. a 2GB structure (not strictly a f32 or f64 type)
[06:11:13] <p1start> Guest44: Default exists as a trait that generalises over new()
[06:11:36] <ChrisMorgan> Guest44: by convention, new() is an inherent method, while Default is a trait. Where there is a new() with no arguments, the two should be equivalent, but new() may take arguments or may not exist.
[06:11:43] <p1start> Some new() implementations take parameters, anyway, so Default is different

[06:12:05] <Guest44> that makes some sense

[06:12:39] <JP-Ellis> ?

[09:31:24] <Manishearth> hydraidm801: closures can capture upvars though
[09:31:27] <hydraidm801> ah ok
[09:31:29] <aatch> `let baz` is variable declaration.

[09:32:04] <hydraidm801> I came from python world so some of this is new to me
[09:32:12] <aatch> Importantly for variables, each `let` introduces a new variable, even if it's the same name as an existing variable.
[09:32:35] <aatch> so `let foo = a; let foo = foo.transform()` is valid.

[11:56:22] <aatch> ehiggs, maybe. This is just how I feel about it. I tend to see programming languages as tool-boxes, so Rust gives me more tools to ensure correctness than C++ does.
[11:56:45] <aatch> ehiggs, but if people want to ignore those tools and break their code...
[11:57:21] <ehiggs> aatch I agree. So in using the language it should be like 'darn, it didn't catch everything. i guess that's to be expected with a language that's not formally proven to do whatever'. but in designing the actual language, a different hat is often worn

[12:44:04] <frankmcsherry> soma: you can use it to constrain a type, and it indicates that the type contains no funny references. This is handy if you want to return elements of that type, stash elements of that type in a Vec, or some other container, without having to worry about whether the reference will still be valid in the future.

[12:59:52] <ptalbot> the problem is that, for generic programming, the user will have to specify on its generic types: `&'a T: Intersection<&'b T, Output=XX>` which is less convenient than `T: Intersection<Output=XX>`, but it also means that for optimization purpose, we reduce the conviniency of high-level constructs.

[16:19:25] <terpstra> bluss, i don't understand
[16:19:26] <frankmcsherry> Hey, crazy question, but: does Bencher leak? I have a RAII guard that finalizes a constructor, and when I just run the code all is well, but if I #bench it I get a "didn't initialize me" error. 
[16:19:50] <terpstra> as long i hold the iter_mut(). the whole slice is borrowed mut, so no one can read the previously written data..?
[16:20:08] <bluss> terpstra: yeah
[16:20:16] <bluss> terpstra: you can hold the iter mut internally
[16:20:23] <bluss> terpstra: but your current way seems fine?

[18:17:54] <frankmcsherry> Drek: great to use to conditionally work with Option (what I do mostly). Occasionally gets a bad rap, because "exhaustiveness" of match is a good thing and if let is like an escape hatch from that.

[21:00:41] <XMPPwocky> oh yeah libgcc dependency sucks
[21:00:48] <KurtRustle> can i have a mutable vector in a struct?
[21:00:53] <XMPPwocky> you can -L -static-libgcc
[21:00:55] <Layl> and will at later points perhaps be DLLs

[21:01:15] <XMPPwocky> KurtRustle: yes, but tha'ts not how mutability works
[21:01:20] <Layl> so my issue just got closed with "not cargo's job"
[21:01:23] <XMPPwocky> structs have "inherited mutability" for their contents
[21:01:23] <carllerche> won't it only break stack unwinding w/ other DLLed rust libs?
[21:01:27] <XMPPwocky> Layl: oh, cargo bug
[21:01:29] <Layl> so... who's job is it?
[21:01:39] <carllerche> My general strategy is to build a final .a and then deal w/ the linking myself
[21:01:49] <XMPPwocky> KurtRustle: so if the *struct* is mutable, its contents will generally be
[21:01:49] <Layl> at the moment to get a production ready folder, you need to have specific knowledge about dependencies and do a bunch of manual commands

[21:05:40] <carllerche> in general or on windows?

[22:15:51] <isak> also I was a bit confused about structs and enums etc
[22:16:03] <isak> why is the memory layout different from C unless you tell it to use C representation
[22:16:22] <XMPPwocky> so rust can do better optimizations
[22:16:27] <geofft> C doesn't have enums with values, for instance 
[22:16:36] <isak> no that part i got
[22:16:37] <XMPPwocky> the less that's defined, the more "wiggle room" the compiler has in deciding things
[22:16:48] <isak> but does rust reorder struct layouts or something?
[22:16:48] <FreeFull> C only has undiscriminated unions, Rust only has discriminated unions
[22:16:50] <steveklabnik> bfisher-fleig: yeah, the coercion kicks in when you try to use it as a 7str
[22:16:51] <XMPPwocky> rustc could hypothetically rearrange struct fields, for example
[22:16:53] <XMPPwocky> it *doesn't* 
[22:16:55] <XMPPwocky> but it could
[22:17:04] <FreeFull> It doesn't right now
[22:17:05] <isak> it shouldn't 
[22:17:09] <isak> that would be terrible
[22:17:13] <FreeFull> But you have no guarantee it won't without #[repr(C)]
[22:17:17] <steveklabnik> isak: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_%28computing%29#Models
[22:17:20] <geofft> isak: also, for instance, structs that implement Drop currently have a boolean to track if they've been dropped already 
[22:17:20] <FreeFull> And no guarantees about padding
[22:17:42] <geofft> if someone figures out a better answer, Rust might stop doing that in the future 
[22:17:44] <Layl> geofft, how can a struct be dropped twice though?

[22:18:00] <Layl> isn't that a thing rust is built around preventing

[22:20:08] <steveklabnik> there's also a plan to do it on the stack probably
[22:20:11] <geofft> anyway, point being for isak's question that Rust reserves the right to add fields, collapse fields, etc. to structs and enums to do Rust-ish things 
[22:20:21] <geofft> I would expect that you can't impl Drop on a #[repr(C)] struct 
[22:20:27] <XMPPwocky> so the issue is with Drop
[22:20:35] <FreeFull> Moving the drop flag to the stack is the best idea
[22:20:35] <XMPPwocky> it's decided that it won't run early
[22:20:44] <steveklabnik> https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/210 <-
[22:20:52] <XMPPwocky> so you can't just put a destructor call on the wrong side of a conditions

[22:21:01] <isak> steveklabnik: hm, so the way I understand it is that the 1:1 just let's the kernel schedule it. The 1:N let's the runtime schedule it entirely and doesn't use native cores, and the M:N one let's the runtime (or whatever) schedule it but also  uses real threads behind the scenes
[22:21:09] <steveklabnik> ahh https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/320 was the merged one
[22:21:23] <Layl> still, I don't think it makes much sense to have a struct that implements drop that gets passed around to an extern C

[22:41:42] <isak> well, when you would be doing eprintln! you would already be in the situation of having an error so why not have another one ;)
[22:41:55] <bstrie> bluss: we could make it not panic at all if it encounters an error, but I don't see how you're going to make it handle errors without just making it a clone of writeln!

[23:21:52] <bluss> you could submit a lint
[23:22:07] <isak> hoverbear: what's wrong with const? you wanna take the address?

[23:40:02] <hoverbear> Manishearth: I understand why it's there I just worry about it being a bit of a stumbling block for newbies
[23:40:16] <Manishearth> You have `Ty`, `Ty` again, `t`, `sty`, `TyS`, and another `Ty`
[23:40:23] <Manishearth> then you have the `ty` module
[23:40:27] <isak> let panic! x = 3;
[23:40:32] <bstrie> if at first you `Err`, `Ty, `Ty` again
[23:40:48] <FreeFull> let in x = 3;
[23:40:56] <Manishearth> and then you have a plethora of variables and fields called `t`, `ty`, `typ`, `type_` and whatnot

[23:42:43] <isak> it just says if ye wanna mut and then not mut then you can say it's not mut again!

[23:43:36] <hoverbear> isak: But after that you couldn't redefine
[23:43:50] <mbrubeck> I think if you can accept `let x; { let x; }` then it's just a slight generalization to `let x; let x;`

[23:44:32] <hoverbear> mbrubeck: But the first makes sense since it's a more-specific scope, the second is the same scope
[23:44:36] <isak> "now hang on they let me redefine it, what happens if I redefine it even to a completely different type?!"
[23:44:42] <isak> "dear lord it works!"
[23:45:02] <mbrubeck> It requires the exact same sort of skepticism when reading lines later in a function.  It just changes which lines can be affected by one scope.
[23:45:08] <bstrie> isak: clearly this means rust is utterly unsfe
[23:45:28] <mbrubeck> bstrie: So shadowing should require `unsafe let x`  >:)
[23:45:43] <hoverbear> mbrubeck: Yeah, and that's the core tenant of my argument. When I saw `let x = 5` I figured whenever I saw `x` I could assume it was 5.
[23:45:45] <isak> they weren't kidding when they said rust will eat your laundry
[23:45:51] * isak goes to protect laundry
[23:46:03] <hoverbear> mbrubeck: let unsafe x = 5;
[23:46:04] <mbrubeck> hoverbear: You mean, whenever I saw `x` and it's not inside any additional {}
[23:46:19] <hoverbear> mbrubeck: Yes. When it's not more rightward.
[23:46:24] <mbrubeck> hoverbear: For example if you had `let x = 5; if something { ......   return x }`
[23:46:35] <mbrubeck> yeah
[23:47:03] <isak> if anything it let's you sometimes avoid { } hell, so that's good

[23:56:53] <isak> hmm, here I was just gonna ask quickly about what happened to green and somehow ended up spending the whole evening talking about this :P. I think it probably has more true value as an alternative to rusts move semantic by default model. In that it let's you program as if you had mutation without worrying about mutation (data races etc) - with some performance cost but probably a large "friction" decrease
