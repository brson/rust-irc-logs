[04:36:56] <bstrie> dcolish: main() essentially runs in a task, yes, but I'm not sure what your question is
[04:37:26] <bstrie> dcolish: (also, many more people hang out in the other channel on irc.mozilla.org)
[04:38:55] <dcolish> ah cool, i think the borrowed pointer tutorial helped me a bit too
[04:39:11] <dcolish> i was confused about ownership semantics
[04:47:19] <bstrie> dcolish: owned pointers get freed when they go out of scope, though they can change ownership
[04:47:24] <bstrie> they aren't owned by a task
[04:47:36] <bstrie> managed pointers are, effectively, owned by the task
[04:47:42] <bstrie> but don't use those :P

[05:07:54] <dcolish> you dont like managed pointers?
[05:10:08] <dcolish> they seem pretty useful to me
[05:10:28] <bstrie> dcolish: they have a lot of problems at the moment
[05:11:00] <bstrie> dcolish: it's idiomatic to use owned pointers wherever possible, and only resort to managed pointers when you have something with cycles
[05:17:07] <dcolish> interesting, i would have thought that managed pointers would have been more encouraged
[05:18:38] <bjz> dcolish: the implementation is pretty slow at the moment, and in most cases you don't actually need them
[05:19:11] <bjz> dcolish: another issue is that you can't pass them between tasks - you have to copy them
[05:19:25] <dcolish> you cant promote them to borrowed?
[05:20:50] <bjz> dcolish: you can borrow them yes. tbh I'm a little hazy on the details
[05:23:55] <dcolish> i havent really gotten to tasks yet
[05:25:37] <dcolish> i guess owned and managed are pretty similar if you control lifetimes correctly
[05:27:12] <dcolish> ah yes, you definitely cant pass managed pointers because they're local to the task's heap
[05:31:02] <bjz> GC will hopefully become a lib feature
[05:31:47] <dcolish> i heard that was a thread on the mailing list. i should give that a read
[05:34:06] <bjz> it was a blog post by one of the core devs, but I don't knw how much the rest of the team is on board
[05:34:29] <bjz> but imo it sounds like a good idea
[05:35:05] <bjz> it would use special traits to hook in, then folks would be able to implement their own if they wanted
[05:48:45] <dcolish> the analogy b/t @ and ref counted pointers is interesting
[05:49:12] <dcolish> kind of like shared_pointers in C++11

[17:18:07] <itdaniher> I compiled rust-0.6 last night and I'm now attempting to compile the rust-sdl library set so I have a bit to play around with. Unfortunately, I get a number of errors concerning resolving imports of std::libc::foo, as per http://itdaniher.com/p?EFwH. Any insight would be appreciated!
[17:20:57] <SiegeLord> itdaniher: rust-sdl probably requires the use of trunk rust
[17:21:41] <itdaniher> SiegeLord: head vs. 0.6?
[17:22:13] <SiegeLord> Yeah, 0.6 is pretty outdated... most 3rd party libs target the master branch
[17:22:27] <SiegeLord> The head of it, that is
[17:22:40] <itdaniher> oh, I see: "The releases on http://www.rust-lang.org tend to not work."
[17:22:52] <itdaniher> thanks, I guess I'll put my macbook air to work for another few hours...
[17:23:05] <SiegeLord> Yeah, this should be made more apparent...
[17:23:13] <itdaniher> I'm awfully excited to play with Rust though, I will say that.
[17:23:48] <itdaniher> thanks for the pointer, SiegeLord! (no pun intended)

[18:27:14] <itdaniher> so I just built rust from the master branch on github and now I'm getting a whole different set of errors on rust-sdl...
[18:27:18] <itdaniher> http://itdaniher.com/p?TiUS
[18:28:42] <itdaniher> it looks like I'm missing a method called foldl?
[18:28:52] <itdaniher> which I understand to be synonymous with 'reduce'
[18:28:54] <bstrie> itdaniher: yeah 0.6 is ancient, 0.7 should actually be out very soon...
[18:29:06] <bstrie> but then 0.7 will be ancient about a week after it's released
[18:29:44] <bstrie> itdaniher: it's possible that whoever usually maintains rust-sdl hasn't kept up with the recent changes
[18:29:58] <bstrie> keeping up with rust is pretty hard right now :P
[18:31:14] <itdaniher> bstrie: is there a changelog outside of git log?
[18:31:41] <itdaniher> and are there any expectations of hitting an easier-to-keep-up-with 1.0 in the next few years?
[18:31:47] * itdaniher is new to rust
[19:03:01] <bstrie> itdaniher: there is a changelog, yes
[19:03:43] <bstrie> itdaniher: https://github.com/mozilla/rust/wiki/Doc-detailed-release-notes
[19:04:10] <bstrie> itdaniher: https://github.com/mozilla/rust/blob/master/RELEASES.txt also has an incomplete list of 0.7 changes
[19:04:19] <bstrie> though neither changelog will be very comprehensive
[19:04:25] <bstrie> there's just too many changes to enumerate
[19:04:44] <bstrie> itdaniher: 1.0 is expected to come out within a year, yes
[19:04:57] <bstrie> best case scenario, by the very very end of this year
[19:06:30] <bstrie> itdaniher: also, the channel on irc.mozilla.org is much more active if you have questions
[19:50:39] <Jeaye> End of the year, eh?
[19:50:42] <Jeaye> hmm
[19:58:57] <itdaniher> bstrie: thanks, I'll join the channel!
