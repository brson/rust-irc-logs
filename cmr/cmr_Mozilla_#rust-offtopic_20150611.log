[01:10:03] <WindowsBunny> and why does Git think winapi-rs is 29.6% renderscript?

[01:11:25] <Tobba> XMPPwocky: note that <script> is not blocked

[01:14:34] * WindowsBunny hands bstrie some 24-carrot ingots
[01:14:42] <bstrie> WindowsBunny: in the past our diplomacy was actually with projects using .rs for their own custom files, we helped them come up with new extensions and migrate all their code
[01:14:47] <bstrie> WindowsBunny: and by we I think it was huon?
[01:15:07] <bstrie> on github's end we only need to patch linguist
[01:15:14] <c74d> bstrie: I think it was ChrisMorgan.
[01:15:38] <bstrie> wish I could find the issue, whoever it was did a very thorough job
[01:16:12] * ChrisMorgan has done it for quite a few things
[01:16:24] <ChrisMorgan> But I don’t think that linguist is one of them.

[01:17:56] <ChrisMorgan> I’ve done ohcount (which had the renderscript/redscript/several others bother), pygments (PR waiting for merging for some time now), google/code-prettify (ditto, though only a few weeks there), vim, one or two others as well.

[01:18:56] <c74d> :/ NixOS only offers grsecurity versions of Linux 3.14 and 4.0?
[01:19:19] <ChrisMorgan> I decided that “#pragma version” means RenderScript, otherwise Rust.
[01:20:34] <ChrisMorgan> Because RenderScript files are *required* to have the `#pragma version(1)`, that linguist heuristic should really be changed so it defaults to Rust.
[01:20:44] <ChrisMorgan> Who’s going to do that?
[01:21:09] <WindowsBunny> ChrisMorgan: You?
[01:21:17] <bstrie> I don't see why it currently classifies those files as renderscript, they don't contain any of those tokens
[01:21:36] <bstrie> and it's an elsif, not an else, so I don't see why renderscript would be the default

[02:14:20] <Tobba> Rust can certainly do it though
[02:15:10] <Tobba> in theory, since we don't really have anything that relies on incantations of casting pointers to integers and doing fancy math on them

[02:21:48] <Tobba> it's just that it would be cool, and if the analysis worked right it could avoid byte arrays in theoretically all situations

[02:32:01] <c74d> last time I built Linux, it was manually configured, and the configuration was a bit bloated by Gentoo standards, but it *far* more minimal than this (and only took four to seven minutes to build)
[02:32:14] <Quxxy> I had it to the point where it could reverse the WINVER and api partition from the headers for every symbol
[02:32:16] <c74d> s/but it/but/
[02:33:02] <Quxxy> I think the reason I stopped was that A. I wanted to re-write in Rust, and that turned out to be a bit of a pain, and B. I couldn't work out a good way of segregating the output
[02:35:33] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: Well, if you ever decide to work on it again, just tell me :D

[06:48:28] <WindowsBunny> If SpaceX manages to get landings working, then SpaceX is gonna be tossing up so many

[12:28:49] <eddyb> wat
[12:28:57] <eddyb> they're making a Now You See Me sequel?
[12:29:15] <eddyb> are they making a "now you don't" joke?
[12:45:11] <Tobba> http://www.google.com/safebrowsing/diagnostic?site=sourceforge.net
[12:46:15] <fmtq> wot
[12:48:22] <Tobba> apparently part of it is because stuff like LOIC is on there
[12:48:37] <Tobba> and since AV vendors are stupid, those get classified as malware
[12:49:30] <Tobba> gotta love having to disable your AV to crack a password
[12:50:28] <eddyb> Tobba: sourceforge.net *is* malware
[12:50:32] <eddyb> don't download anything from it
[12:50:39] <Tobba> eddyb: no shit
[12:50:40] <eddyb> they've started wrapping installers
[12:50:45] <Tobba> just that safebrowsing lists it as safe
[12:50:48] <eddyb> ah
[12:50:51] <eddyb> that's what you mean
[12:50:54] <Tobba> even though.. well look at those statistics
[12:51:01] <eddyb> I still don't get your logic :P
[12:51:09] <eddyb> whitelisted because of false positives in the past?
[12:51:25] <Tobba> I'm assuming so
[12:51:31] <eddyb> > Part of this site was listed for suspicious activity 305 time(s) over the past 90 days.
[12:51:38] <eddyb> or rather, it's fine-grained
[12:52:35] <Tobba> oh, interesting
[12:53:48] <eddyb> is this the original spiderman? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFHvH9FtACg

[13:11:48] <Tiffany> tobba: I think things like loic and bitcoin miners are listed as malware because botnet owners like to embed them into their botnets
[13:12:07] <Tobba> why would you embed fucking LOIC into a botnet
[13:12:23] <Tiffany> idk, but I remember news articles about bitcoin miners in botnets
[13:12:29] <Tobba> it's utter shite and stripping away the fancy UI probably breaks detection anyways
[13:12:43] <Tobba> slowloris will still fuck up most apache servers, so
[13:13:07] <Tiffany> slowloris is the one that actually exploits DoS vectors right?
[13:13:12] <Tiffany> as opposed to just flooding generic shit packets
[13:13:47] <Tobba> slowloris is the one that just does snail connections
[13:14:12] <Tiffany> oh
[13:14:15] <Tiffany> heh
[13:14:19] <Tobba> and unless you set up apache to close those... well apache is kinda broken by design there
[13:14:53] <Tiffany> slowloris is probably the reason why web servers have such a low timeout these days
[13:14:56] <Tobba> Tiffany: I think some 0day DoS vectors on PHP I have still work though
[13:15:00] <Tiffany> it makes it impossible to visit most websites with dialup
[13:15:13] <Tiffany> they never fixed the hash function did they?
[13:15:27] <Tobba> I don't think so
[13:15:34] <Tiffany> so you can just give keys which all modulo to the same value and then you can utterly destroy a php server's performance
[13:15:56] <Tobba> as far as I know, it's way more broken then publically known
[13:15:57] <Tiffany> trying to look up the slowloris website
[13:16:01] <Tiffany> my net is going slow as hell today
[13:18:11] <eddyb> Tobba: oh, right, I didn't try afl on PHP
[13:18:30] <Tobba> oh dear.
[13:18:37] <eddyb> but to be practical you have to take something like, e.g. wordpress and feed it random requests
[13:18:49] <Tiffany> someone changed slowloris to redirect from the software to some animal
[13:18:55] <Tiffany> on wikipedia
[13:19:06] <Tiffany> normally I wouldn't care, but that shit costed me about 2 minutes
[13:19:31] <eddyb> can you run PHP server software through the command line easily?
[13:19:35] <eddyb> like, some cgi thing
[13:19:37] <Tobba> eddyb: "php"
[13:19:42] <eddyb> isn't that the cli?
[13:19:49] <Tobba> it runs a PHP script
[13:19:55] <Tobba> afaik you can feed it headers etc somehow?
[13:19:55] <eddyb> I need to pass HTTP headers to it and shit
[13:19:58] <Tiffany> you could run php as fastcgi
[13:20:01] <eddyb> Tiffany: that's the cgi
[13:20:04] <eddyb> err, Tobba
[13:20:16] <eddyb> but I don't know how to run php in CGI mode. hence why I'm asking
[13:20:19] <Tiffany> I don't remember exactly how you do it

[13:21:38] <eddyb> Tobba: they still don't have their own private test island
[13:22:22] <Tiffany> apparently lighttpd isn't vulnerable to slowloris
[13:22:25] <Tiffany> I wonder how it manages that
[13:22:37] <c74d> I saw articles on that, but the one I read didn't mention infrastructure, only making cities techier.
[13:22:40] <eddyb> echo ":PHP:E::php::/usr/bin/php4:" > /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/register
[13:22:44] <eddyb> hahaha NOPE
[13:22:55] <c74d> eddyb: maybe if they annex Oracle first :p
[13:23:06] <c74d> or build one out of barges
[13:23:09] <eddyb> > Turns out debian php build comes with /usr/bin/php-cgi 
[13:23:18] <Tobba> wouldn't absorbing oracle be like absorbing cyanide
[13:23:35] <Tiffany> tobba: moldbug would tell you that is what must happen to save the country
[13:24:11] <Tobba> this is starting to remind me of the cheesy story in the manual of system shock (DOS)
[13:24:34] <Tobba> where a corporation is allowed to form its own government because it employed more than half the population
[13:24:53] <c74d> Google building infrastructure seems reasonable to me though… they're already, like, the best ISP, except they're exclusive, and they have a supposedly nice public (except not) transit system, except that it's exclusive.
[13:25:01] <Quxxy> eddyb: It's your fault I'm playing with NixOS
[13:25:04] <eddyb> Tobba: ohh. I was wondering about that a few months ago
[13:25:30] <c74d> Tobba: is Oracle failing or something?
[13:25:37] <Tobba> c74d: they're generally hitler
[13:25:43] <Tiffany> it's a fascinating dystopia theme, tobba
[13:25:56] <Tobba> c74d: they're also kinda sueing Google atm so
[13:25:59] <eddyb> if you had your own voting system and more than 50% of the population in it and they decided on a matter
[13:25:59] <Tiffany> corporations as governmental bodies
[13:26:06] <Tobba> (over allegedly copying... 10 lines of code)
[13:26:13] <Tobba> I thought that was settled, but apparently not?
[13:26:39] <c74d> a distributed fungal Hitler filling up most of their offices?
[13:27:05] <Tiffany> hasn't oracle been in a lawsuit for like 10 years over whether APIs can be copyrighted
[13:27:22] <Tobba> which they won, so I maintain my "hitler" claim
[13:27:25] <c74d> I suppose it could raise anti-trust issues though.
[13:27:53] <Tobba> I don't think google and oracle have too much in common, so it wouldn't be an antitrust thing
[13:28:18] <c74d> …anyway I was merely joking about Larry Ellison owning one of the Hawai'ian islands.
[13:29:12] <Tobba> oh
[13:29:13] <c74d> (in a way that doesn't even make sense really because they'd need to annex his island, not his company >_>)
[13:29:38] <Tobba> life goal: own a sizable island
[13:30:48] <fmtq> not a worthy goal

[13:52:05] <Tiffany> wow, sqlite stores even the list of tables as a B-tree
[13:52:17] <Tiffany> B-tree is a pretty amazing data structure
[13:52:19] <Tiffany> it scales pretty much infinitely
[13:53:09] <eddyb> BTreeMap?
[13:53:24] <Tiffany> I don't know about BTreeMap
[13:53:31] <Tiffany> I mean this thing https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tree
[13:53:33] <Quxxy> IIRC, B-tree in this context is where each node is some fixed length long
[13:53:44] <Quxxy> In Sqlite it's like... 512*B
[13:53:53] <Quxxy> (Forget the scale :P)
[13:54:00] <Quxxy> The idea being you read nodes in as big chunks from disk
[13:54:35] <Tobba> it's probably one of the only tree structures that isnt terrible for locality
[13:54:35] <Tiffany> each btree node is a page in sqlite, and pages are between 512 and 65536 bytes long
[13:54:49] <Tiffany> each page consists of the btree part at the front, and a bunch of attached data at the end
[13:55:12] <eddyb> we have the magic number of 7 IIRC
[13:55:24] <Tiffany> I thought the magic number was e
[13:55:28] <Tiffany> or 3, if you need to round
[13:55:49] <eddyb> BTreeMap parametrized on an integer would be neat
[13:56:44] <Tiffany> but yeah, in sqlite, if you have more than like a few dozen tables, the schema spills over onto more pages
[13:56:49] <Tiffany> otherwise, it all fits on the first page
[13:57:19] <Quxxy> Oh, so BTreeMap is a B-Tree, not just a Binary Tree?
[13:57:21] <bluss> our BTreeMap uses B = 6 and for it that means up to 11 keys, 12 children per node
[13:57:32] <bluss> Quxxy: that's why it's called B-Tree Map
[13:57:38] <eddyb> bluss: 6, not 7?
[13:57:40] <eddyb> my bad
[13:57:41] <Quxxy> Neat
[13:58:22] <bluss> I thought that using ArraryVec to parameterize a btreemap would be possible but it's actually not realistic until at least associated consts
[13:58:29] <eddyb> uhm
[13:58:33] <bluss> so that I can use array size N-1 for keys and N for children
[13:58:34] <eddyb> we have associated consts
[13:58:39] <eddyb> I forgot about that
[13:58:43] <bluss> eddyb: ICE's
[13:58:50] <eddyb> (they aren't implemented in the best of ways though)
[13:58:57] <bluss> if you try to size an array by an assoc const
[13:59:00] <eddyb> bluss: yeah, I'll have to have a look at it one of these days

[13:59:39] <fmtq> I want mongolite 
[13:59:44] <fmtq> I tire of dealing with sqlite 
[14:00:07] <bluss> this bmap just needs a nice way to parameterize it by array size and it's done, eddyb https://github.com/bluss/bmap/blob/master/src/bmap.rs
[14:00:31] <eddyb>     (NaiveDate::from_ymd(year, 1, 1)..).take_while(move |date| date.year() == year)
[14:00:39] <eddyb> Quxxy: not bad

[14:01:05] <Quxxy> eddyb: :D
[14:01:21] <eddyb> I am trying to remove temporary vectors now, if I can

[14:01:36] <Quxxy> Nifty
[14:01:50] <eddyb> Quxxy: use write! on Strings ;)
[14:02:00] <Quxxy> I... didn't think you *could*
[14:02:13] <eddyb> you have to import std::fmt::Write in scope, but you definitely can
[14:02:33] <Quxxy> Oooooh... you use the formatter trait, not the IO one
[14:02:54] <eddyb> now I have to understand group_by
[14:03:10] <Tiffany> oh
[14:03:19] <Quxxy> I hear there's a pretty sweet iterator cheat sheet for that sort of thing :P
[14:03:25] <Tiffany> I was confused at the distinction between a binary tree and a trie for a moment
[14:03:41] <Tiffany> I suppose a binary tree needs to store the key because of how it works
[14:04:32] <eddyb> the layout of the nodes in a trie encodes the key whereas a regular tree only has a specific layout for performance
[14:05:25] <eddyb> Quxxy: why isn't the inner vec an iterator?

[14:05:58] <Quxxy> Because then you have both the iterator and the item pointing to the original iterator
[14:06:00] <eddyb> that seems pointless
[14:06:08] <eddyb> Quxxy: hmm
[14:06:09] <Quxxy> So you need an Rc<RefCell<State>>

[14:07:00] <Quxxy> bluss: Not me, eddyb; he's updating the calendar example
[14:07:08] <eddyb> Quxxy: you can do it by holding &mut It inside GroupBy
[14:07:17] <eddyb> the question is if that's ergonomic enough
[14:07:44] <Quxxy> Wait, so who owns the base iterator?
[14:07:46] <eddyb> I guess there's an easy way to find out if it would work: return GroupBy<&mut Self> from group_by
[14:07:50] <eddyb> Quxxy: someone else!
[14:08:03] <eddyb> (let's see if it's an issue :P)
[14:08:04] <Quxxy> But the group items would also need a &mut It
[14:08:08] <Quxxy> And then you're aliasing
[14:08:11] <eddyb> no you're not
[14:08:13] <eddyb> you're reborrowing
[14:08:17] <bluss> I think you need shared mutable state eddyb
[14:08:29] <Quxxy> Ah
[14:08:32] <bluss> the iterator protocol needs all elements -- all group's iterators -- to be available at hte same time
[14:08:51] <eddyb> so you can't use the original iterator while the new one is al- wait
[14:08:57] * eddyb has confused himself
[14:09:09] <eddyb> you'd still be able to call .collect() on it
[14:09:17] <eddyb> so something must prevent it

[14:09:24] <bluss> for simple iterators you can just clone the iterator instead https://github.com/bluss/rust-itertools/blob/master/examples/group.rs

[14:10:33] <Quxxy> eddyb: Didn't think it would
[14:10:36] <eddyb> Quxxy: because GroupBy needs to own the iterator

[14:44:14] <fmtq> moment(someFuckingDate).add(30, 'days')
[14:44:40] <bombless> what happend if you add(1, 'months')
[14:44:45] <Tiffany> the best part is how a lot of applications, for some reason, rely on local time being contiguous
[14:44:51] <Tiffany> so like, when you change timezones, or when DST occurs
[14:44:53] <Tiffany> they just crash
[14:44:55] <Tiffany> like that thing eddyb had
[14:44:57] <benh> or you run ntpdate
[14:45:29] <Tiffany> oh god
[14:45:33] <eddyb> Tiffany: where I couldn't boot with a different timezone?
[14:45:37] <Tiffany> there's going to be another leap second in 29 days
[14:45:42] <Tiffany> er, 19 days*
[14:45:49] <Tiffany> yeah eddyb
[14:45:58] <eddyb> the weird thing is I tried to adjust the hardware clock and it didn't help
[14:46:01] <fmtq> bombless: it also works
[14:46:45] <eddyb> 61 seconds lel
[14:47:01] <bombless> fmtq so what is moment(new Date('2015-3-30')).add(1, 'months')
[14:47:14] <eddyb> why does this guy sound like sherlock holmes?
[14:47:28] <benh> how can it be anything besides 2015-04-30?
[14:47:32] <bombless> hmmm I should say ...
[14:47:37] <benh> subtract?
[14:48:30] <bombless> moment(new Date('2015-1-30')).add(1, 'months')
[14:48:36] <bombless> I guess
[14:48:47] <eddyb> > I realised, at the point where I shouted "AND THEN", that I was basically trying to channel Matt Smith's Stonehenge speech from The Pandorica Opens. I'm not quite sure I managed it.
[14:49:30] <eddyb> it's funny cause https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJQ691PTKsA is the title of a Doctor Who episode, I think :P
[14:50:06] <Tobba> considering doctor who is about time and "End of Time" is pretty generic, certainly more than one episode
[14:50:37] <eddyb> hmpf
[14:50:46] <eddyb> it's also a moment in at least two storylines
[14:50:58] <Tobba> either the one where they went to the actual end of time, or the one they blew up the universe
[14:51:24] <Tiffany> for being called "Coordinated Universal Time", UTC isn't very universal

[14:56:26] <eddyb> > The library modern JavaScript doesn't deserve, but needs right now.
[14:56:59] <bombless> ... I prefer Lua than JS, but JS is okay..
[14:57:13] <eddyb> lol Lua
[14:57:50] <Tiffany> lua has better semantics than javascript, but not by a very big margin
[14:58:10] <eddyb> and then it has 1-indexing
[14:58:11] <Tiffany> for example
[14:58:13] <Tiffany> > '0' == 0
[14:58:15] <Tiffany> false
[14:58:26] <eddyb> oh come on, not the comparison operators
[14:58:30] <eddyb> + is a far bigger issue
[14:58:42] <eddyb> with == you just write === and you're done
[14:58:53] <Tiffany> okay, I will give you that
[14:58:56] <Tiffany> > '0' + 1
[14:58:56] <Tiffany> 1.0
[14:59:03] <eddyb> nice
[14:59:05] <Tiffany> I don't know why lua does this
[14:59:15] <eddyb> what does it use for string addition?

[14:59:25] <eddyb> ah

[14:59:46] <Tiffany> > 'foo' .. 'bar'

[14:59:49] <Tiffany> stdin:1: attempt to perform arithmetic on a string value
[14:59:58] <Tiffany> so there's that at least
[15:00:04] <Tiffany> doesn't javascript just atoi() strings when doing addition
[15:00:45] <bombless> it's valueOf in JS

[15:04:37] <eddyb> fmtq: so someone from PSD left after stating that the wives of Romanians working abroad are "whores" and their children are "vagabonds"
[15:04:38] <bombless> erlang BEAM is kinda interesting I guess
[15:04:49] <bombless> like https://github.com/joxa/joxa https://github.com/rvirding/lfe
[15:04:56] <eddyb> fmtq: and everyone is thinking he did it intentionally to get the fuck out before it all blows to hell

[15:05:59] <eddyb> Tobba: PNL presumably
[15:06:10] <eddyb> it's one party vs another right now
[15:06:22] <eddyb> well, we're supposed to have elections for the senate and whatnot later this year
[15:06:36] <eddyb> so it may just bring those sooner
[15:06:37] <Tobba> so that means...?
[15:06:39] <Tobba> oh
[15:06:43] <Tiffany> oh, apparently not
[15:06:44] <eddyb> happened before
[15:07:21] <eddyb> there's also M10 which turned into a party... or is half civic rights association half party. I don't even know anymore
[15:07:39] <eddyb> been too busy with school to get myself involved
[15:08:33] <Tobba> so tl;dr SNAFU?
[15:11:32] <eddyb> it will get worse before it gets better
[15:11:41] <eddyb> also, I'm (power) hungry
[15:12:55] <Tobba> fun
[15:27:40] <Quxxy> eddyb: bluss: I'm just doing a fully-lazy version of GroupBy; what do you think should happen if you call .next() on a *previous* group's sub-iterator?  Panic or just emit None?
[15:27:40] <bombless> hmm I think we can make another function trait like FnCopyable, then we have FnCopyable --> Fn --> FnMut --> FnOnce
[15:28:32] <bombless> anyway you can have `type SelfArg = ...`
[15:31:32] <eddyb> Quxxy: are you going to add allocation overhead?
[15:31:39] <eddyb> bombless: ...
[15:31:40] <Quxxy> eddyb: Yes :(
[15:31:43] <eddyb> bombless: the Copy trait
[15:31:46] <eddyb> Quxxy: don't bother
[15:32:04] <eddyb> it's faster to run NaiveDate for a month in a loop than allocate once
[15:32:15] <eddyb> s/run/advance
[15:32:34] <Quxxy> Is that true in general, though?
[15:32:37] <Quxxy> (This is for itertools)
[15:32:48] <eddyb> allocation has a cost *shrug*
[15:32:57] <eddyb> you want streaming iterators at that point
[15:33:08] <Quxxy> Very much so, yes
[15:33:19] <Quxxy> But I can't do that with the standard interface :P
[15:33:28] <eddyb> don't use the standard interface
[15:33:37] <Quxxy> Wait, hang on; the *current* group_by is allocating once per step, anyway
[15:33:42] <eddyb> :/
[15:33:44] <eddyb> > error: method `Output` is not a member of trait `FnMut`
[15:33:46] <Quxxy> How is this worse?
[15:33:50] <eddyb> it's not a method you dumb compiler
[15:33:55] <eddyb> Quxxy: it's worse than I'm using here
[15:34:21] <eddyb> btw, why are you using by_ref?
[15:34:26] <eddyb> it's outdated
[15:34:31] <eddyb> (and I wish it was deprecated)
[15:34:44] <Quxxy> Because shit keeps changing and no one tells me :P
[15:34:50] <eddyb> it's &mut iterator
[15:35:19] *** bvssvni is now known as bvssvni_
[15:36:23] <Quxxy> I'd probably still use it in places because I hate mixing prefix and postfix ops
[15:39:04] <bluss> because of the annoying difference between for x in &foo and for (i, x) in foo.iter().enumerate().. I'm pondering   for (i, x) in enumerate(&foo) now
[15:39:08] <bluss> more python
[15:39:14] <bluss> IntoItrator forces it, it's not me
[15:40:06] <eddyb> meh, foo.enumerate()
[15:40:11] <eddyb> you can just add that method

[20:18:29] <cow_2001> :|
[20:18:35] <cow_2001> dfockler: why not?
[20:19:43] <dfockler> password cracking software can use word lists to check for combinations of words 
[20:20:08] <eddyb> john the ripper, I think, is a good one
[20:20:09] <dfockler> cow_2001: but you should still build it
[20:20:20] <cow_2001> it doesn't matter
[20:20:23] <dfockler> and make it into a lib
[20:20:43] <cow_2001> each word in the wordlist can be considered to be a single symbol
[20:20:53] <cow_2001> let's say there are 6000 symbols
[20:20:57] <cow_2001> 6000**4
[20:21:40] <cow_2001> 4 words give you 50 bits of entropy
[20:23:04] <dfockler> not if the password cracker has already built hashes for all the combinations of words in the word list
[20:24:34] <cow_2001> they could have built hashes for 8 character long passwords
[20:24:43] <niconii> dfockler: all 1,296,000,000,000,000 of them?
[20:24:53] <niconii> dfockler: and that's just if you're using four words
[20:25:03] <cow_2001> niconii gets it
[20:25:56] <dfockler> make one that uses random unicode
[20:26:06] <cmr> yeah that's not going to fly
[20:26:15] <cow_2001> you can't remember random unicode
[20:26:19] <cmr> most services I use don't even allow $ in passwords.
[20:26:19] <dfockler> like smiley face, bananas, horse, bowl of rice
[20:26:41] <niconii> keep in mind, assuming only one byte to store each hash (and obviously it's way more than that), you'd need 1.296 *petabytes* to store all those hashes
[20:28:36] <niconii> use six words, and suddenly you need 46.656 *zettabytes* to hold all that data

[20:33:57] <Murarth> Has anyone used rusti on Windows since the latest revision? I want to confirm that it works before I make a little announcement on /r/rust about it.
[20:36:20] <dfockler> so if your dictionary is large enough and random enough then Diceware can be useful
[20:36:26] <niconii> dfockler: keep in mind cracking a list of four words is not the same as cracking each word individually
[20:36:32] <dfockler> yeah
[20:36:35] <Murarth> Also, if anyone knows the least painful way of installing GNU readline on Windows, I'd like to add that to such a post, to make things easier.
[20:36:57] <niconii> dfockler: it's the time to crack one word raised to the fourth power
[20:37:31] <dfockler> niconii: yeah I understand you have to select 4 words, combine them and then hash them
[20:37:45] <cow_2001> Murarth: is "install cygwin" a valid answer?
[20:38:09] <cow_2001> Murarth: no clue about windows. i don't use windows.
[20:38:34] <niconii> er, not time, that's a bit off, i mean the number of different possible words raised to the fourth power
[20:38:50] <cow_2001> niconii: isn't it the same as time
[20:38:51] <Murarth> cow_2001: I suppose it is, but I once tried to install Cygwin on Windows and it's a huge piece of software. If that's not required, I'd like to be able to give an easier suggestion.

[20:39:19] <niconii> cow_2001: if it was time, then if it took you one second to crack one word, well... 1**100 is still 1, so...
[20:39:46] <cow_2001> err
[20:41:41] <niconii> so the time it takes is (amount of time to try one combination) * (number of possible words ** 4)
[20:41:42] <cow_2001> total time = time / word * (word bank)**(number of words in a password)?
[20:41:50] <niconii> yeah
[20:41:53] <cow_2001> grr
[20:42:56] <niconii> oh, also, these estimated times assume a) you know it's diceware, and b) you know how many words are in the password
[20:43:00] <Murarth> Well, Cygwin is suggested by the maintainer of readline. So, I guess that's good enough.
[20:43:16] <cow_2001> Murarth: cool :D
[20:46:24] <Murarth> There are really no Windows users here right now? That's so weird. I'm so used to majority Windows users everywhere else.

[20:47:46] <Murarth> WindowsBunny: Have you tried using rusti with the latest nightly? I want to confirm there weren't any other Windows issues hiding behind the one I just fixed.
[20:48:30] <WindowsBunny> Murarth: I don't even know how to run rusti
[20:48:36] <WindowsBunny> I just use playbot
[20:48:42] <WindowsBunny> or the online playpen
[20:48:48] <cow_2001> Murarth: join us :D
[20:49:17] <Murarth> It builds like anything else, using cargo. You need to have Cygwin installed, apparently, for the readline dependency.

[20:50:17] <Murarth> Ha ha, aww. :(
[20:52:12] <Sho> Jurassic World wasn't even all that bad
[20:52:29] <WindowsBunny> Murarth: The most that is acceptable is msys2 + mingw-w64
[20:57:26] <WindowsBunny> Murarth: But I won't be content until it is pure rust
[21:00:49] <Murarth> WindowsBunny: As soon as someone writes a pure Rust replacement for GNU readline, I'll gladly use that.
[21:01:09] <WindowsBunny> Murarth: what does readline do?
[21:01:12] <Murarth> It doesn't seem like anyone wants to write such a thing in any language. linenoise doesn't look very good.
[21:01:35] <WindowsBunny> Murarth: It would be trivial for me to write a library that on Windows gives you direct key events
[21:01:41] <Murarth> Accepts input on stdin with in-place editing and support for Tab completion and other interesting stuff.
[21:01:41] <cmr> linenoise sucks, yeah.
[21:01:47] <WindowsBunny> and full control to the console however you want
[21:01:58] <WindowsBunny> Murarth: and then someone could implement something like readline on top of it
[21:02:22] <WindowsBunny> heck, I can even give you mouse events
[21:03:21] <Murarth> readline has a lot of crazy features that I don't want to reimplement. I'm not sure how many use all of those features, but it's the kind of thing people have been using with bash for however many years. Having rusti work just like most other Unix command line utilities is a pretty nice feature.
[21:03:57] <WindowsBunny> Murarth: Well, someone should reimplement it in pure rust
[21:04:03] <Murarth> If there's a different expectation for Windows REPL functionality and some Windows-specific library for that (that's pre-installed on Windows), I would be open to using something like that.
[21:04:04] <WindowsBunny> and make it work with the native windows console
[21:04:23] <WindowsBunny> there's an entire API on windows for console manipulation
[21:04:32] <WindowsBunny> There's just none of the high level tab completion and history stuff
[21:06:13] <Murarth> Would backspace and any other keyboard sequences also need to be implemented?
[21:06:45] <WindowsBunny> Murarth: Well, if you want raw key events, you'll have to handle backspaces and stuff yourself
[21:06:52] <Murarth> Do Windows users expect keyboard sequences in console programs? Like, Ctrl-U in readline deletes all characters before the cursor.
[21:07:13] <WindowsBunny> until windows 10, there were barely any keyboard sequences
[21:07:20] <Murarth> I don't necessarily need raw key events. Just in-place editing (adjusting the cursor and backspace).
[21:07:39] <Murarth> And only reading one line at a time from stdin.
[21:07:57] <WindowsBunny> Murarth: Well, you can adjust the cursor and backspace with regular input already
[21:08:51] <WindowsBunny> you just can't move the cursor with the mouse until windows 10
[21:09:01] <WindowsBunny> or unless you handle mouse events yourself
[21:10:10] <Murarth> Well, I would need the raw key events for up and down arrow, in order to implement history recall.
[21:10:54] <Murarth> Mouse support isn't important.
[21:10:58] <WindowsBunny> and you'd need to handle the tab key for auto-complete?
[21:11:06] <Murarth> Yes. Tab, too.
[21:11:22] <WindowsBunny> well, writing such a library should be fairly easy
[21:13:11] <eddyb> famous last words

[21:14:58] <Murarth> WindowsBunny: If you wanted to write such a library and implement support for it in rusti, I would gladly accept it.

[21:57:24] <cmr> The best thing that I ever found about my school's web filter (which was pretty robust!) was that you could get through its IRC filter by sending lowercase "user" when connecting to the server.
[21:57:38] <cmr> From there it's pretty simple to setup a SOCKS proxy using some poor unsuspecting channel.
[21:58:06] <panicbit> cmr: It's a common trick. Just send a http header and off you go
[21:58:42] <panicbit> (The irc server will most likely ignore your header)
[21:59:59] <panicbit> Uh... Some day our proxy/firewall thing started to block outgoing ssh connections and thus I started tunneling SSH over HTTP *_*
[22:04:39] <WindowsBunny> Murarth: So all you need is push_history, read_line, and some sort of completion callback?
[22:07:12] <Murarth> WindowsBunny: The completion callback is just the way interfaces with readline's completion API. rusti's name lookup stuff to feed that happens in the `completion` mod.
[22:07:38] <Murarth> WindowsBunny: So, your code can just call completion::complete whenever the user presses Tab and use the result.
[22:08:04] <WindowsBunny> Murarth: But I have to provide the current entered text, right?
