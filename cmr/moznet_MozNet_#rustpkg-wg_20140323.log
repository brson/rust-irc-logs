[09:17:34] <Seldaek> wycats: yes Makefile/Rakefile/Gemfile, but no package.json, composer.json, bower.json, and foo.rs. I know where you're coming from but I still think Cargo.toml freaks me out a bit :)
[09:28:56] <huon> cargO.toml
[09:29:44] <Seldaek> wat:P
[09:30:15] <huon> please everyone, it's got a capital, but leading lowercase
[09:30:39] * huon is a problem solver

[15:34:43] <o11c> no, it should start with an uppercase letter, so it get sorted to the right section in 'ls'
[17:07:42] <wycats> Uppercase + suffix for syntax highlighting is the way to go :)
[17:07:57] <wycats> Small efficiencies matter
[18:11:14] <Seldaek> o11c: interesting, I never considered that
[18:11:59] <Yurume> wycats, is TOML highlighting widespread? I'm not sure about that.
[18:12:43] <Seldaek> still troubles me deeply but I'll shut up since the argument is probably more valid than my habit-based gut feeling
[18:13:02] <Seldaek> Yurume: chicken and egg :)
[18:13:37] <Seldaek> it should highlight properly (mostly anyway) with INI highlighting
[18:14:18] <Yurume> then would it make more sense to name it Cargo.ini?
[18:14:31] <Yurume> wouldn't*
[18:14:56] <cmr> "ini" is a pretty overloaded extension
[18:15:52] <Seldaek> Yurume: no I mean adding toml highlighting support should be pretty easy
[18:16:04] <Seldaek> so if people start using it a bit, editors will catch up quickly I think
[18:16:23] <Seldaek> abusing another extension to get highlighting sounds kinda wrong
[18:16:39] <cmr> there's vim support and pygments support, what more could you want? ;p
[18:16:59] <cmr> also sublime it seems
[18:16:59] <Seldaek> real editor support? :p
[18:20:21] <Yurume> cmr, I don't consider the highlighting support as an advantage until it gets bundled with the editor :p though yeah, it will be mostly a ftdetect patch for TOML.
