[05:32:11] <c74d> how nice or not is Bumblebee?
[05:35:03] <scott> c74d: last time I used it, once it was set up, usage was as easy as `optirun <program>` to let that program use the nvidia GPU. bumblebee seamlessly handled turning the GPU on and off as needed
[05:35:14] <scott> no idea how it works with external displays
[05:37:19] <tiffany> so
[05:37:22] <tiffany> I have an optimus system
[05:37:25] <c74d> I guess I'd need to install Nvidia drivers, and... make everything use them somehow?
[05:37:30] <tiffany> and I also use a monitor hooked up via hdmi on a daily basis
[05:37:33] <tiffany> yeah, you need nvidia drivers
[05:37:43] <tiffany> you can use nouveau too if all you want to do is keep the thing off
[05:37:56] <tiffany> the gpu doesn't need to be on for hdmi to work
[05:38:17] <tiffany> afaik
[05:38:31] <tiffany> I think the bios option is just a bit over enthusiastic about shutting things off?
[05:38:41] <tiffany> so yeah
[05:38:55] <tiffany> you install bumblebee, and the nvidia driver isn't loaded until you want to turn on the gpu
[05:39:21] <tiffany> when you want to turn on the GPU, bumblebee will un-powergate it (nvidia GPUs are hilariously bad at power management, so the only way for it to not kill battery and turn your laptop into a space heater is to completely powergate it)
[05:39:38] <tiffany> and then load the nvidia driver, which connects to the right device somehow (auto detect I guess?)
[05:39:43] <c74d> "powergate"?
[05:39:53] <tiffany> PCI devices can be gated such that they receive no power
[05:40:16] <tiffany> that's how the nvidia GPU is shut off by bumblebee, and by the optimus driver on windows
[05:40:31] <tiffany> the minimum power state for nvidia gpus, for whatever reason, is 50 megahertz
[05:40:54] <tiffany> which is enough to bump my system's idle temp to 70C when it's on and not doing anything

[06:13:31] <barosl> zwarich, I believe just reducing the undefined behaviors would be tremendous
[06:13:55] <zwarich> the Verifiable C subset related to the CompCert project has some amusing restrictions
[06:13:58] <c74d> Ooh, it seems Wayland now has signed tags, as of someone from Samsung taking over the release-tagging duty seven weeks ago.
[06:14:02] <zwarich> no address-taken function parameters
[06:14:04] <zwarich> lol
[06:15:48] <barosl> What does it mean? No pointers?
[06:16:07] <zwarich> you can't do f(int a) { ... &a ... }
[06:16:17] <Zoxc> int b = a; &b
[06:16:33] <zwarich> but you can do f() { int a; ... &a ... }
[06:18:23] <barosl> Huh, isn't that too restrictive? Does it relate to one of the undefined behaviors?
[06:18:37] <barosl> Oh wait...
[06:18:57] <scott> I assume it's a just a restriction for "Verifiable C" to make it easier to verify
[06:18:59] <barosl> Why does someone want to take address from the function parameter?
[06:19:22] <zwarich> that's why they banned it, there's not much of a point and it complicates the semantics :P
[06:20:11] <barosl> I see. I've never thought of such a pattern, but I'm also curious why it could harm the verifiability

[07:30:50] <Yurume> what is the weight in use? 400?
[07:33:36] <Zoxc> Not sure, I just took a screenshot of Google in both Chrome and Firefox
[07:33:52] <Zoxc> I also noticed that tabs not in focus doesn't use GDI rendering
[07:34:34] <Zoxc> I see smooth scrolling is usable when general.smoothScroll.mouseWheel.duration* is set to 100 atleast
[07:40:24] <WindowsBunny> Zoxc: Firefox uses DirectWrite for font rendering
[07:40:31] <Zoxc> So does Chrome
[07:41:32] <Zoxc> I may have disabled that though
[07:41:53] <Zoxc> Doesn't DirectWrite's GDI style match GDI? or does Firefox use a bolder filter or something?
[07:42:09] <WindowsBunny> DirectWrite means it is using full on natural cleartype

[20:20:47] <XMPPwocky> bizarre
[20:21:17] <Tobba> it's *possible* the only reason it worked in the other computer was luck, my previous theory was that a solder joint had cracked on the SATA connector on the disk

[20:37:58] <ytain> the PSU flaky?
[20:38:00] <Tobba> it'd explain a few things, except the power supply is of a reputable brand
[20:38:07] <Tobba> and is certainly not overloaded
[20:38:10] <ytain> new?
[20:38:13] <Tobba> however the power here *is* kinda dirty
[20:38:18] <Tobba> ~2.5 years
[20:39:16] <ytain> perhaps you need something to limit the interference to the PSU
[20:39:26] <fmtq> scissors
[20:39:30] <Tobba> obviously
[20:40:26] <Tobba> I haven't checked for noise on the power line in a while, but it's quite over the standard voltage (but still within the specifications of what appliances should be able to handle)
[20:40:40] <ytain> maybe you can look for a stetzer filter
[20:40:48] <Tobba> you can notice this because cheap chinese electronics explode pretty fast

[23:14:41] <scott> eddyb: why would anyone waste their time making that shit?
[23:14:57] <eddyb> here we go https://www.kde.org/announcements/plasma-5.1/
[23:15:12] <eddyb> https://www.kde.org/announcements/plasma-5.1/icons_task_manager.jpg
[23:15:20] <eddyb> not all the icons are new
[23:15:22] <scott> ytain: that's roughly the kind of style of thing I was referring to, yeah. I was specifically asking if Plasma had such a thing
[23:15:42] <eddyb> actually, only the first, the third, the fifth and the one before last
[23:15:53] <scott> eddyb: okay, cool, I could deal with that if it acts the way I expect functionally
[23:16:37] <ytain> scott that dock is using OpenGL so I don't know if it uses KDE or Plasma
[23:16:41] <eddyb> scott: pinned apps stay on the left
[23:16:52] <eddyb> ytain: that's not how KDE works ;)
[23:17:08] <scott> eddyb: sounds like it probably works just like unity/windows then

[23:17:42] <ytain> well then it is independent of KDE or Plasma
[23:17:48] <scott> "Web browser plasmoid"
[23:17:53] <eddyb> ytain: then it's not KDE
[23:17:54] <scott> also totally pointless
[23:18:02] <scott> what is it with KDE and desktop widgets
[23:18:09] <eddyb> scott: uhm
[23:18:22] <eddyb> I have none of those
[23:18:28] <scott> I mean, I can just not use it and be fine
[23:18:35] <eddyb> their existance does not impede my enjoyement of KDE
[23:18:41] <scott> I'm just questioning the developers priorities and ideas about DE design
[23:18:44] <eddyb> ah
[23:18:53] <eddyb> scott: KDE is not a small project
[23:19:13] <eddyb> the same developers making those things may not be capable of doing much else in KDE
[23:19:31] <eddyb> TotalBiscuit has a very good point in the gamedev industry
[23:19:58] <scott> I should become dictator of KDE and start shoving crap like that into third-party repos
[23:20:13] <eddyb> cosmetic DLCs are sometimes born out of artists having nothing to do at all for months before releases
[23:20:22] <eddyb> scott: it... is third-party repos
[23:20:53] <scott> neither of these plasmoids being showcased in the announcement are part of plasma proper?
[23:20:56] <eddyb> scott: most of the widgets in existence are on a sort of content server thing
[23:20:57] *** Quits: fmtq (fmtq@moz-d08itp.tpgi.com.au) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[23:21:00] <eddyb> scott: which ones?
[23:21:08] <scott> analog clock / web browser
[23:21:23] <eddyb> who bothered to remove the analog clock, lol

[23:21:35] <scott> > New plasma widgets: 15 puzzle, web browser, show desktop
[23:21:43] <scott> show desktop, probably useful to someone
[23:21:45] <eddyb> it's not like it's rewritten from scratch every month
[23:21:50] *** Joins: fmtq (fmtq@moz-d08itp.tpgi.com.au)
[23:21:58] <scott> the other two? embarrassments you shouldn't announce
[23:22:09] <scott> or include in plasma
[23:22:14] <eddyb> grrr
[23:22:16] <scott> lol
[23:22:25] <eddyb> why does the widget list
[23:22:38] <eddyb> show up in the part of my display that's physically damaged?
[23:23:04] <scott> KDE ought to have a configuration option for setting which parts of the display are damaged :)
[23:23:15] <eddyb> there's a X thing for that
[23:23:16] <eddyb> I think
[23:23:36] <eddyb> oh they are by default
[23:24:14] <eddyb> maybe not the puzzle
[23:28:47] <scott> discourse is supposed to be the next-gen forum software and all that, but I still find reddit easier to read
[23:29:01] <scott> it's weird when linear conversations just keep nesting in reddit, but I can deal with that
[23:29:18] <scott> in discourse when stuff starts branching it gets confusing and I can't just collapse part of the tree
[23:29:45] <scott> (and it's not actually a tree conceptually)
[23:32:48] <eddyb> scott: the odd ones aren't here https://projects.kde.org/projects/kde/workspace/plasma-workspace/repository/revisions/master/show/applets
[23:34:22] <scott> ah, so they aren't in the 'core' repo at least
[23:34:42] <eddyb> they're in here, it seems https://projects.kde.org/projects/kde/workspace/kdeplasma-addons/repository
[23:34:54] <eddyb> and most of those aren't even packaged
[23:35:12] <eddyb> I barely have any of them

[23:56:10] <eddyb> is this a troll? I can't tell
[23:56:13] <eddyb> probably not
[23:57:06] <zwarich> scott: discourse is terrible on mobile too
[23:58:00] <scott> eddyb: at a glance, pedantic *and* wrong?
[23:58:03] <scott> the best combination
[23:59:59] <eddyb> scott: well, I have found glibc's crt.S somewhere in some github clone of it
