[00:15:13] <eternaleye> huon: There's also 'git config push.default nothing', which errors out push unless explicit refspecs are given
[00:17:39] <eternaleye> huon: Thus pushing to master from master would require "git push origin master:master"

[01:26:29] <huon> eternaleye: oh, neat
[01:26:31] <huon> eternaleye: is it possible to apply that to specific remotes?
[01:26:33] <huon> (I wanna be able to freely push to my own :P )
[02:38:12] <eternaleye> huon: git config remote.name.push ''
[02:38:14] <eternaleye> er <name>
[02:38:41] <eternaleye> huon: git push then yields "fatal: Invalid refspec ''"
[02:38:47] <eternaleye> huon: As does "git push origin"
[02:38:55] <huon> ah ok
[02:39:16] <eternaleye> huon: Basically, it sets the refspec to push to to the empty string
[02:39:21] <eternaleye> huon: Which is invalid
[02:39:31] <eternaleye> huon: Ah, wait
[02:39:37] <eternaleye> huon: It breaks fetch too :P
[02:39:40] <eternaleye> huon: One sec.
[02:39:48] <huon> eternaleye: I like my solution

[02:42:02] <huon> eternaleye: (specifically, magit will use explicit refspecs, so using an invalid url will protect against accidental pushes from magit)
[02:42:49] <eternaleye> Mm
[02:44:36] <eternaleye> huon: Another option might be, in your global git config, using pushInsteadOf
[02:45:22] <eternaleye> huon: Which would make any push to https://github.com/rust-lang/rust (or a suffix thereof) be rewritten
[02:45:27] <huon> neat
[02:45:29] <eternaleye> huon: Without per-repository changes
[02:46:13] <eternaleye> huon: Look it git push's help for "If there are a large number of similarly-named..."
[02:46:52] <eternaleye> git config --global url.not-a-url.pushInsteadOf https://github.com/rust-lang/rust

[10:42:11] <cmr> I'd love a persistent hashmap
[10:42:14] <cmr> If anyone wants to write one
[10:42:17] <cmr> that'd be great
[11:02:31] <bluss> that's not really possible is it? I think you'd use https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_array_mapped_trie
[11:03:16] <cmr> I guess I meant "map" and not "hashmap"
[11:03:38] <cmr> Well, I definitely did.
[11:04:27] <bluss> hamt might be the thing anyway
[11:04:55] <cmr> seems like it's pretty widely used
[11:05:01] <cmr> I feel like I saw a hamt implementation in Rust..
[11:06:09] <cmr> https://github.com/michaelwoerister/rs-persistent-datastructures is what I saw according to my browser history
[11:12:06] <bluss> it builds with some changes
[11:12:53] <bluss> ah there has already been attempts to PR that
[11:44:07] <bluss> sfackler: I think the read_all rfc needs some help, and not from me but from someone experienced in Rust I/O etc
[11:44:18] <bluss> sfackler: maybe best to open/write a new rfc

[15:15:46] <acrichto> bluss: btw with r+ privs you can just r=foo for bounces (e.g. https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/25839)
[15:15:54] <acrichto> makes it so you don't haev to wait for anyone else to wake up :P
[15:16:35] <bluss> acrichto: ok, didn't know if that would be ok, but I'll do that!
[15:16:37] <bluss> thanks
[15:16:54] <acrichto> bluss: yeah once you have r+ no need for a re-review unless something major changs
[15:17:00] <acrichto> minor test fixes are totally fine to let sail through
[16:04:52] <simukis> I fear this viewpoint might change drastically once somebody introduces (or makes a test clearly point to) a big security issue as a minor change.
[16:13:14] <sfackler> bluss: I'll take a look, thanks
[16:18:07] <SimonSapin> bluss: re https://github.com/servo/rust-smallvec/pull/7 , I don’t know if this is actually a licensing issue, but are you OK with me using this in MPL-2 code? rust-smallvec has that license because it was first in Servo
