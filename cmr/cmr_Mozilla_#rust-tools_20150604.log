[20:44:12] <acrichto> brson: ping
[20:47:48] <brson> acrichto: pong
[20:48:13] <acrichto> brson: so I got a successful MSVC nightly last night in dev
[20:48:24] <acrichto> but I realized that a failing msvc nightly would block all other nightlies from being published
[20:48:27] <acrichto> due to the way we sync nightlies
[20:48:37] <acrichto> now we're currently not gating on MSVC, so I'm curious what your thoughts on this are
[20:48:42] <acrichto> we could:
[20:48:46] <acrichto> A) start gating on MSVC
[20:48:54] <acrichto> B) not sync with MSVC when publishing nightlies
[20:49:01] <acrichto> C) hope it isn't that bad
[20:49:46] <brson> acrichto: we have to have a solution for 2nd tier (flaky) nightlies eventually
[20:50:01] <acrichto> true
[20:50:15] <brson> my pref is for buildbot to be taught to ignore failures for 2nd tier platforms when syncing
[20:50:36] <brson> a failure would dump some marker file into the temp directory to indicate that the build was done but failed
[20:50:46] <brson> then finish_dist or whatever would understand that
[20:51:02] <acrichto> hm ok
[20:51:08] <acrichto> I'll see if I can look into adding this
[21:01:22] <brson> acrichto: are we in noise pop?
[21:01:30] <acrichto> brson: nah in Rust
[21:01:39] <acrichto> brson: although niko/felix/nrc are here, but they are on the way out
