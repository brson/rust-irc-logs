[23:03:08] <cmr> no, didn't get around to it yet
[23:03:11] <cmr> sorry :(
[23:03:29] <cmr> rustdoc_ng and the builder is taken care of, and I'm making good progress on extra::url
[23:03:30] <cmr> so soon!
[23:03:44] <bjz> ok, neat!
[23:03:52] * bjz is excited
[23:04:12] <bjz> cmr: what is your interest in it, btw?
[23:04:43] <bjz> (just curious)
[23:05:07] <cmr> bjz, I want to use it to play with gl, and for the 2d flixel-or-similar clone I also plan on
[23:05:14] <bjz> awesome!
[23:05:23] <cmr> As well as my physics simulator that I'm currently studying linear algebra for :p
[23:05:36] <bjz> 2d?
[23:05:48] <cmr> yes
[23:05:54] <bjz> neato
[23:06:10] <bjz> linear algebra... heh
[23:06:17] *** Quits: paupau (posttext@moz-BFE94859.hfc.comcastbusiness.net) (Ping timeout)
[23:06:25] * bjz has done a bit too much of that
[23:06:43] <bjz> and yet at the same time barely scratch the surface
[23:07:02] <bjz> *scratched
[23:07:50] <bjz> cmr: I think brson wants a nice 2d engine/lib so we can do some sort of game jam thingy
[23:09:06] <cmr> mm
[23:09:15] <bjz> cmr: I have OpenAL btw - might be useful
[23:09:29] <bjz> need to do some examples though
[23:09:46] <bjz> and clean up the bindings/make sure they actually work :P
[23:10:39] <bjz> cmr: do you think you'd use glfw or sdl?
[23:10:47] <cmr> bjz, glfw
[23:10:57] <bjz> *squee*
[23:11:04] <bjz> :)
[23:11:25] <bjz> cmr: we need to fix an issue with constants -_-
[23:11:33] <cmr> which issue is that?
[23:11:37] <bjz> oh, sorry, I mean statics and enums
[23:11:48] <bjz> so I can use a c-style enum for glfw
[23:12:09] <cmr> Did you see erickt's work with generating to/from uint things for enums?
[23:12:26] <bjz> yes!
[23:12:40] <bjz> it would be great if we could use c_int etc
[23:12:56] <cmr> jld also has an enum representation patch
[23:13:14] <cmr> so you can say #[repr(c_int)] enum Foo { ... }
[23:13:36] <cmr> We still don't have a good solution for representing flags as enums though, besides enumset
[23:16:30] <bjz> heywait
[23:16:35] <bjz> I think it was fixed

[23:27:32] <h3r3tic> quick, set the compiler on fire! that should fix the ICE.
[23:28:00] <bjz> HIIII!
[23:28:11] <bjz> h3r3tic: long time no speaky
[23:28:37] <h3r3tic> hiiii
[23:29:00] <h3r3tic> and yeah, I knows... but now that I have a bunch of stuff se up on windows, hopefully I can finally get productive with Rust :)
[23:29:05] <bjz> how dare you fork

[23:29:06] <bjz> get of lawn you
[23:29:06] <bjz> off
[23:29:10] <h3r3tic> haha
[23:29:10] <bjz> yayy
[23:29:21] <h3r3tic> I got me some shaders, and buffers, and whatnot going
[23:29:29] <bjz> ooooh
[23:29:32] <bjz> yummy
[23:29:43] <h3r3tic> mm yeah, they're quite tasty.
[23:30:14] <h3r3tic> now trying to create a scene structure and load up some stuff via assimp
[23:32:03] <bjz> h3r3tic: what do I need to improve on in cgmath?
[23:32:13] <h3r3tic> operator overloading! :P
[23:32:18] <bjz> yeah :(
[23:32:25] <bjz> nmatsakis!!!
[23:33:00] <h3r3tic> he seems like our go-to guy with a lot of stuff
[23:33:04] <h3r3tic> maybe some bribes are in order
[23:33:13] <bjz> yeah
[23:33:26] <bjz> not that bjz dude again...
[23:33:30] <h3r3tic> xD
[23:33:39] <h3r3tic> damn him, he's trying to USE our language!
[23:33:49] <bjz> but you understand
[23:34:03] <bjz> I don't want to implement overloading for some things, but not others
[23:34:23] <bjz> it's too hard to remember what's what
[23:34:38] <h3r3tic> wut?
[23:34:42] <bjz> (what's overloaded and what isn't)
[23:35:04] <h3r3tic> vectors would be a good start :P
[23:35:20] <h3r3tic> just um, + and - xD
[23:35:26] <bjz> only for scala ops though
[23:35:35] <bjz> do you understand I can't do multiple overloads?
[23:35:45] <h3r3tic> I undertand it now that you just said it :P
[23:36:30] <bjz> heh
[23:36:30] <bjz> yerah, that's my issue
[23:36:47] <h3r3tic> well, that's it. I can't possibly program in a language without operator overloading. bye!
[23:36:55] <bjz> you can only overload one op
[23:36:55] <bjz> for a RHS
[23:36:59] <h3r3tic> bah
[23:37:37] <h3r3tic> did nmatsakis promise he'd fix that?
[23:37:57] <h3r3tic> or is it a "onoz, that's gonna explode our type system" ?
[23:38:21] <h3r3tic> or rather, name lookups
[23:38:38] <bjz> :(
[23:38:46] <bjz> it will be fixed, he says it will
[23:38:59] <bjz> brson: do you know anything of the status of this?
[23:39:01] <h3r3tic> does he like cake, or fancy coffee, or crack?
[23:39:16] <bjz> h3r3tic: kittens I think
[23:39:39] <bjz> h3r3tic: I'll take the fancy coffee though
[23:39:41] <h3r3tic> I'm afraid these may or may not survive alive in parcels. at the same time.
[23:39:44] <h3r3tic> ha!
[23:40:44] <h3r3tic> I'd get you fancy coffee, but what happened to quatform!?
[23:41:00] * bjz has been ruined by melbourne's incredible coffee
[23:41:08] <h3r3tic> and the wiki page says "Frustrum" :P
[23:41:15] <bjz> h3r3tic: yet to be created
[23:41:19] <h3r3tic> incredible coffee? :o
[23:41:23] <brson> bjz: this convo is a little opaque to me. I don't understand what problem you're referring to?
[23:41:48] <bjz> brson: multiple operator overloads for types
[23:42:09] <bjz> brson: of the utmost importance for any algebraic structures
[23:42:27] *** Joins: samx (sami@moz-D9DA5773.dyn.optonline.net)
[23:42:28] <bjz> brson: like vectors, matricies, complex numbers etc
[23:43:22] <brson> does multiple operator overloads mean overloading for different types of RHS?
[23:43:27] <bjz> yep
[23:43:40] <brson> so LHS and RHS are different. I haven't heard anything about this subject, no
[23:43:51] <h3r3tic> onoz
[23:43:58] <h3r3tic> we'll pay in cake!
[23:44:04] <bjz> for matricies you need Matrix * Matrix and Matrix * Scalar, for example
[23:44:33] <brson> that sounds equivalent to general method overloading, which we don't hvae. what happens if you don't get that?
[23:44:34] <h3r3tic> it's not BADLY needed, as e.g. GLSL disallows that, but it would be really neat to have
[23:44:35] <bjz> brson: basically we're talking about abstract algebra here
[23:44:48] <bjz> don't know
[23:45:11] <bjz> brson: the linear algebra guys complain :P
[23:45:16] <h3r3tic> bjz: so we could have Vec * Vec, Vec + Vec, etc in the meantime?
[23:45:36] <h3r3tic> sounds workable to me :P
[23:46:57] <bjz> brson: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_%28mathematics%29#Basic_operations
[23:47:09] <bjz> h3r3tic: yeah, I could do that
[23:48:33] <h3r3tic> might not be the best in terms of performance when you want to mult a matrix by a scalar, for example. but for these edge cases there could just be a regular fn
[23:48:57] <h3r3tic> and as I mentioned, GLSL already disallows vec + scalar, for example
[23:50:19] <bjz> brson: same with quaternions. you can do Quat * S, Quat * Vec, Quat * Quat
[23:50:38] *** Quits: samx (sami@moz-D9DA5773.dyn.optonline.net) (Quit: This computer has gone to sleep)
[23:50:40] <h3r3tic> and with mat4x4 * vector3, for example, you have two operations that you commonly do. multiplying as if that vector has 0 in the last coord ( used for normals ), and multiplying as if that vector has 1 for w ( used for positions )
[23:51:02] <bjz> h3r3tic: ok
[23:51:12] <h3r3tic> quat * vec is slow, though, and I'd have it as a regular fn, just to signify that
[23:51:23] <bjz> h3r3tic: could you gist the operations you want?
[23:51:34] <h3r3tic> I mean, ideally we'd have all the operators, but it's not the end of the world :)
[23:52:11] <bjz> h3r3tic: see my concern is the cognitive load of remembering what is overloaded and what is not
[23:53:02] <h3r3tic> do we need a gist for that? binary +, -, * and / for vectors, unary - for vectors; binary +, -, * for matrices, unary - for matrices; * for quats
[23:53:02] <bjz> h3r3tic: would it be nicer if you had free-standing wrapper fns like mul_s(vec, s)?
[23:53:12] <bjz> h3r3tic: or an issue
[23:53:19] <h3r3tic> I find these difficult to read :S
[23:53:21] <bjz> h3r3tic: just so I have it down in a list
[23:53:58] <bjz> h3r3tic: so if you had to choose, you'd go with vec.mul_s(s)?

[23:54:40] <bjz> cheers
[23:54:47] <h3r3tic> oh, no I mean that I find fns like that rather than operators, difficult to read
[23:54:48] <bjz> wait
[23:54:56] <h3r3tic> I'd go for free-standing ones over members any day, though
[23:55:04] <bjz> no, I mean, if we can't have overloading
[23:55:21] <h3r3tic> similarly it's dot( a, b ) rather than a.dot( b )
[23:55:23] <bjz> which brson suggests might be a possibility
[23:55:32] *** Joins: samx (sami@moz-D9DA5773.dyn.optonline.net)
[23:55:50] <bjz> h3r3tic: I was going to have a dot(a, b) :)
[23:55:58] <h3r3tic> good! :D
[23:56:16] <bjz> h3r3tic: ie. do it in a trait, then make a wrapper
[23:56:20] <h3r3tic> yus
[23:56:38] *** Joins: maik (maik@moz-C09804C4.dip0.t-ipconnect.de)
[23:56:56] <bjz> like we do in std::num
[23:57:05] <h3r3tic> yeah
[23:57:16] <bjz> that allows us to have a generic sqrt(_)
[23:58:27] <bjz> h3r3tic: in that gist, could you put in the RHSs you want?
[23:58:44] <h3r3tic> it's always the same as the original type
[23:58:58] <bjz> ok
[23:59:34] <bjz> cool, I can do that
[23:59:38] <h3r3tic> awesome :D
