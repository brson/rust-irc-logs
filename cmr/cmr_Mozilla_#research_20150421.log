[00:00:12] <roc> are you more interested in a cozy sinecure somewhere, or academia, or a startup?
[00:00:34] <burg> But yeah I'm more interested in shipping a tool or feature than writing papers.
[00:00:42] * roc guesses not academia
[00:01:06] <burg> Yeah, not my type of game
[00:01:22] <burg> I did survive though (knock on wood)
[00:02:43] <roc> cjones and I tossed around ideas for an rr-based startup a while back. I don't know what he's currently up to, but you might want to talk to him about that
[00:02:48] *** Joins: cjones (cjones@moz-5rq.tt2.193.181.IP)
[00:02:49] <burg> I have not heard of too many startups making tools for debugging or code-level activities. Mostly things like build, test, comms tools
[00:02:56] <roc> oh, there he is!
[00:03:33] <roc> burg: as you know, it's notoriously difficult to make any money in dev tools :-(
[00:04:07] <burg> That's the rub ;-)
[00:04:43] <burg> At least outside of a specific domain. Such as games, hardware, security
[00:05:26] <roc> burg: cjones and I tossed around a few ideas. One was to have a cloud-hosted record-replay debugging infrastructure for which users pay per replayed trace --- effectively, pay per bug
[00:08:14] *** terrence is now known as terrence-afk
[00:08:35] <roc> I think that debugging recorded executions is ultimately data visualization and analysis, and there could be really big wins learning from many debugging sessions what data is salient
[00:09:37] <roc> so you could build a business around collecting and leveraging that data
[00:09:55] <roc> maybe :-)
[00:10:05] <burg> Maybe :)
[00:11:24] <burg> In the second half of my dissertation I've been trying to find other ways to index into a recorded execution. Most folks only use breakpoints in gdb if there's no other option.
[00:12:30] <burg> So, looking at linking text output and profiler data to lines of executed JS in the recording, and working from visual changes back to JS code.
[00:13:02] <larsberg> burg: And enterprise; the enterprise dev tools (and components) market was pretty huge, at least for the MSFT stack and Java. Even as part of the multi-billion per year DevDiv I was pretty boggled by both the total market size and the revenues some small 5-10 person shops were making.
[00:13:32] <larsberg> burg: Though most of them were transitioning to a split small US-based shop + large russian / eastern european dev team
[00:13:51] <burg> larsberg: yeah, I think of VS and JetBrains as exceptions
[00:13:59] <roc> burg: "click on a pixel, show line of code" and "click on text log, show line of code" seem great (albeit a bit obvious ... various GPU debugging tools provide the former)
[00:14:32] <roc> larsberg: yeah, but the enterprise market is risky. You might turn into IBM.
[00:14:54] <burg> Yeah but not just line of code, but drop the debugger at the responsible statement in time
[00:14:55] <larsberg> burg: the challenge is most of them are run as wildly profitable "lifestyle" businesses until they get acquired or the founders retire to sit atop their golden thrones
[00:15:03] <roc> burg: sure
[00:15:39] <burg> pixel to code is easier in immediate mode API (well, it's still hard, but)
[00:15:50] <roc> ah
[00:15:51] <larsberg> roc: I'm most worried about the liver damage due to enterprise sales. Promotion to the MS equivalent of director required you to go "sit" with a fortune 100 company for a couple weeks and help debug. My liver has almost recovered, ~10 years later :-)
[00:16:10] <roc> burg: yeah, if you want to plumb through CSS, that is challenging :-)
[00:17:25] <burg> roc: it's possible! https://www.dropbox.com/s/wm87sy6zt5ztmop/uist2015-scry-submission-deanonymized.pdf?dl=0 and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NENGl09Xq0I

[01:30:38] <roc> burg: ah, cool
[01:35:18] <burg> roc: didn't have time to integrate replay, but it used to work. Needs worker process replay to for a good workflow IMO
[01:41:16] <roc> "worker process replay"?
[01:46:32] <burg> Er sorry, on phone. Doing the replay to collect snapshots in a background process
[01:46:46] <roc> ah
[01:46:48] <roc> yeah
[01:47:29] <burg> I started on it for WK but had to cut for time
[01:48:50] <roc> getting latency down is really important. One thing I'd really like to have in rr is the ability to fork checkpoints during recording and replay through incomplete recordings; then you could start debugging a recording at the current state, immediately
[01:53:57] <burg> Yeah, have thought about that. Especially for Timelapse which only has main frame navigations as checkpoints to start replaying from

[21:57:48] <brson> nrc: it's ok. I missed you for the discussion of beta patches though https://github.com/rust-lang/meeting-minutes/blob/master/weekly-meetings/2015-04-21.md#branching-model-for-beta

[22:16:52] <nrc> brson: sounds good, I agree having a PR rather than just a push is a good idea
[22:17:32] <nrc> I think it is worth just trying it out and polishing, rather than having too much discussion up front

[23:00:54] <pcwalton> jack: I've put my demos up on github -- https://github.com/pcwalton/Leaflet (servo-demo directory), https://github.com/pcwalton/servo-photo-gallery, and https://github.com/pcwalton/servo/tree/demos (for the -Z flag)
[23:09:25] *** Quits: bjz (bjz@moz-puppgq.tpgi.com.au) (Quit: My Mac has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[23:09:47] <jack> pcwalton: what version of servo do I need to run those?
[23:09:53] <pcwalton> jack: use servo/tree/demos
[23:09:59] <pcwalton> pcwalton/servo, demos branch
[23:10:02] <pcwalton> the last of the three
[23:10:08] <pcwalton> here are my command lines:
[23:10:18] <pcwalton> $ components/servo/target/release/servo -Z partial-display-list-construction-hack --resolution 920x1024 -y 4 -c ~/Source/servo-packages/demos/photo-gallery/index.html
[23:10:19] <pcwalton> $ components/servo/target/release/servo --resolution 920x1024 -y 1 -c ~/Source/Leaflet/servo-demo/index.html
[23:10:33] <pcwalton> be sure to use those options (the resolution doesn't matter though) because parallel layout is not good on Leaflet.js
