[17:31:51] <cmr> tjc: behavior that depends on it blocking will break if it becomes non-blocking. I think it's backwards-compat
[17:31:51] <graydon> 3346
[17:32:16] <graydon> cmr: it's not that the API will change blocking/nonblocking, it's that it won't block the _thread_ anymore
[17:32:22] <cmr> oh
[17:32:35] <graydon> currently the whole thread it's running on blocks. one should not be relying on "someone else blocked my thread in an independent library call"
