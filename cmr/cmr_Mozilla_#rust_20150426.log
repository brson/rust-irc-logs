[00:01:17] <woowe> heftig: previous borrow of `*self` occurs here; the mutable borrow prevents subsequent moves, borrows, or modification of `*self` until the borrow ends, that is the note it gives, the previous borrow is on line 46

[04:21:00] <geofft> (a la Gallina) 
[04:21:29] <aatch> geofft, for a given value of "useful", probably.
[04:21:41] <GBGamer> geofft: depends what you want to write in it
[04:21:45] <bstrie> blaenk: your program won't block until you call .output(), according to the docs
[04:21:53] <GBGamer> recursion/looping is gonna be difficult
[04:22:02] <GBGamer> Because you'd have to have a hard limit
[04:22:02] <rkjnsn> bstrie: That works for keeping the stored object from getting freed when I construct the wrapper. I was just trying to figure out if I could have the field type actually be the generic type I want to wrap (say with T=()).
[04:22:02] <rkjnsn> That would get guarantee that size and alignment would be correct, but things would break if that field's destructor was run when the wrapper got dropped.
[04:22:04] <blaenk> yeah bstrie, what of it?
[04:22:13] <geofft> Gallina supports recursion by saying that you must destructure at least one of your arguments on each recursive call

[04:24:48] <blaenk> my problem isn't blocking at all
[04:24:57] <aatch> geofft, so basically all functions must either provable halt, or provably not halt?
[04:25:08] <blaenk> what I want to do is make sure that the Command I spawn dies if my program that spawns it dies
[04:25:21] <blaenk> if you spawn a Command and there's a panic, it lingers
[04:25:22] <GBGamer> or all functions must provably halt, or else are (unhalt)
[04:25:30] <GBGamer> Like unsafe, in Rust
[04:25:38] <geofft> aatch: right. I don't immediately see why such a thing is necessarily turing-complete, but maybe I should think about it for more than 10 seconds 
[04:25:41] <bstrie> blaenk: how are you determining that the background process isn't dying?
[04:25:51] <GBGamer> And then you can build up halting programs out of unhalting functions

[04:27:09] <blaenk> if I were able

[04:29:04] <aatch> GBGamer, sure, the compiler only cares about the ones it wants to emit calls to.

[06:06:29] <aatch> reem, so I have a trait called Shape that I'm using behind a `Box<Shape>`, there are a small number of cases where I would like to know if it's a specific implementor of `Box`, but I can't for the life of me figure out how to do it.

[06:07:51] <aatch> Just doing `trait Shape : Any` (or any combination of additional bounds like 'static and Send) doesn't seem to work.
[06:08:04] <reem> aatch: Basically Any is actually useless on its own; you have to integrate downcasting into your trait. The simplest thing is to inherit from Any (or use the typeable crate if you want to run on all #[stable]) and then add an impl Shape { } block with all the downcasting methods. You have to copy the implementation specifically to your impl block.

[06:08:25] <reem> we don’t have Box<Shape + Any>, so you have to re-implement the downcasting methods on your trait object type
[06:08:41] <reem> since they’re actually static methods on the trait object type, not methods that are part of the trait itself
[06:08:46] <Sgeo> reem, :( at copying implementations

[07:51:57] <aatch> Mutabah, that requires the linkage feature though.

[07:52:36] <aatch> Mutabah, ah, then no problem.
[07:52:48] <drewm1980> aatch: but I suppose that isn't so different from just using the function call stack for that...
[07:53:34] <aatch> drewm1980, the problem with using an explicit stack is that you have less tools to tell the compiler about your code.

[07:56:47] <drewm1980> aatch: And then an "implicit stack" is the function call stack when you do recursion?

[11:26:37] <l1n3n01z> Was playing with "Rust by Example". Found that you can have reduntant matches.
[11:26:47] <l1n3n01z> Is that a bug?
[11:27:12] <Ms2ger> "redundant"?
[11:27:35] <l1n3n01z> yes, there are two matches that could match a single value
[11:28:04] <l1n3n01z> when you use a normal value to match on, the compiler complains
[11:28:18] <l1n3n01z> that it is non-reachable
[11:28:33] <l1n3n01z> but if you have a range inclusive of a normal value above
[11:28:42] <l1n3n01z> the compiler does not complain

[11:35:24] <l1n3n01z> "The first arm with a matching pattern is chosen as the branch target of the match, any variables bound by the pattern are assigned to local variables in the arm's block, and control enters the block."

[12:31:35] <weekendblues> Hey guys/gals.  I have a question about how to use crates on crates.io.  Basically, I've got the beta release of rust and I'm trying to use the rand crate so I can get at thread_rng().  When I compile using std::rand or extern crate rand the compiler tells me "error: use of unstable library feature 'rand': use the crates.io `rand` library instead"
[12:31:42] <soma> apoelstra: Oh. So when I wrote this code, are all the 'a s equivalent?

[12:32:57] <weekendblues> I'm sure I'm doing something simple wrong.
[12:33:02] <Mutabah> weekendblues: So, you have beta, are you using Cargo.toml to specify rand?
[12:33:37] <soma> apoelstra: then why do I need to put a <'a> on function foo? It seems useless
[12:33:47] <weekendblues> Yeah, I've tried that, but I'm not sure I'm doing it right.  When I do, it seems to just go for the rand that came with my beta release that rustc doesn't want to use.

[21:54:48] <Dr-Emann> Harry: Ah, no. For something like that, you might want to look to the regex crate.

[23:23:46] <reem> raph: I personally prefer the second, since I hate having to type annotate my variables.
[23:24:03] <blaenk> yeah I've always seen the latter suggested/used
[23:24:04] <reem> (it is also more immune to refactoring when you move around expressions and get rid of temporaries)
[23:24:06] *** Quits: fyolnish (fyolnish@moz-3gjd0b.so-net.ne.jp) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[23:24:09] <blaenk> same with things like parse
[23:24:25] <reem> it is also, imo, clearer, since the operation being type hinted is very close to the type hint
[23:24:36] <raph> okay, thanks. I've certainly seen lots of examples of the former :)
[23:24:58] <blaenk> I think with type ascription it'll switch to .collect(): Vec<_>
[23:24:58] <reem> for some reason people are scared of the ::<> syntax, but I personally prefer it
[23:25:10] <blaenk> same
[23:25:21] <blaenk> I use it all the time with anymap to be explicit, even if it can be inferred (on insert at least)
[23:25:53] <reem> blaenk: consider the case of x.collect::<Vec<_>>().operation_on_vec(), with type ascription you would need to add parens: (x.collect(): Vec<_>).operation_on_vec()
[23:26:13] *** Quits: Romster (Romster@moz-4g83e8.rev.eftel.com) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[23:26:20] <blaenk> I was talking about when collect was the last method in the chain heh
[23:26:21] <reem> so I would personally stick to the ::<> syntax. type ascription is most useful when the ::<> syntax doesn’t work at all, because the thing that needs to be hinted is not a generic parameter
[23:26:25] *** Joins: SpaceManiac (Mibbit@moz-g50q8a.dyn.suddenlink.net)

[23:27:53] <blaenk> idk I think it looks nicer

[23:28:00] *** Joins: slashus2 (slashus2___@moz-evfg9e.res.rr.com)
[23:28:17] <reem> it is nice for the last thing in a chain
[23:28:36] <blaenk> and what you said earlier yeah I have no problem with it otherwise
[23:28:46] <blaenk> people complain it's noisy etc but idc
[23:29:31] <reem> My biggest gripe with the conversion traits is that the ::<> syntax *doesn’t* work with them, since the generic is not on the method
[23:29:45] <reem> I would much rather being forced to specify as_ref::<str>()
[23:30:03] <Dr-Emann> yea, would love to have .into::<String>()
[23:30:12] <reem> (you accomplish this by making the as_ref/into methods actually be given on another trait which is then implemented for all types
[23:30:13] <reem> )
[23:30:15] <blaenk> reem: yeah that one caught me by surprise
[23:30:29] <blaenk> so for that one you would need type ascription, or an intermediate binding

[23:31:04] <p1start> Or UFCS, I think
[23:31:31] <reem> ya, you can do AsRef<str>::as_ref(x) instead of x.as_ref(), but… noise.

[23:31:57] <reem> actually AsRef::<str>::as_ref(x)*
[23:32:49] <SiegeLord> Do the direct dependencies compiled by cargo reference the correct filenames for the transitive dependencies?
[23:33:05] <blaenk> that time of month when p1start goes on
[23:33:27] <p1start> Would be nice if you could do something like x.AsRef::<str>::as_ref()
[23:33:31] <SiegeLord> I'm trying to figure out how to add a cargo macro for CMake... it's a bit of a pain due to the transitive dependencies, and the hashes...
