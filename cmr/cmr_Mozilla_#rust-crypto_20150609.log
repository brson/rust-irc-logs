[02:55:05] <Ilari> bascule: You happen to know reason why ignoring EC point formats negotiation extension in Curve25519/Curve448 in TLS and then sticking the raw 32/56 byte value as ECpoint in *KeyExchange would not work? Or would be somehow nasty to implement?
[02:57:41] <bascule> Ilari: sounds ok to me?
[02:58:14] <Ilari> Besides, TLS 1.3 seemingly deprecates EC point formats extension anyway.

[13:23:01] <Tiffany> how hard is it to design a hash function which hashes only a single block (i.e. leaving out the pigeon hole problem) that has no collisions?
[13:23:32] <Tobba> a perfect hash function?
[13:24:13] <Tobba> you can design those easily, but it's hard to make them secure
[13:24:30] <Tiffany> oh
[13:24:53] <Tiffany> my only experience with the term perfect hash function is those things for making no-collision no-empty-slot hash tables
[14:28:41] <Tiffany> holy hell, how are people still using MD5 and not having it all blow up in their faces

[14:35:00] <Tiffany> "On 30 December 2008, a group of researchers announced at the 25th Chaos Communication Congress how they had used MD5 collisions to create an intermediate certificate authority certificate which appeared to be legitimate when checked via its MD5 hash."

[15:12:55] <molok> hi guys
[15:13:13] <molok>  i'm a kind of noob in Rust
[15:13:50] <molok>  but i study crypto for a while, i wonder to know what's the "quests" of rust in crypto?
[15:14:05] <molok> like, things we must do or improve..
[15:14:16] <molok> sorry my poor english by the way
[15:14:46] <Ilari> molok: Things I have hit: 1) No reliable way to wipe stuff from memory. 2) No u128 type, preventing using 64x64->128 multiplier in many CPUs.
[15:15:28] <Ilari> molok: Or there is a way to wipe stuff in nightlies, but it doesn't work in stable or beta.
[15:16:01] <molok> cool
[15:16:14] <Ilari> molok: Also, LLVM optimizer is known to be problematic.
[15:16:33] <molok> problematic with what?
[15:17:16] <Ilari> Easily optimizes code without branches into code with branches. And branches are bad since those can be seen from other virtual machines (via cache-timing attacks).
[15:17:54] <molok>  interesting
[15:18:04] <molok> hey, i'll get out for launch
[15:18:06] <Ilari> => If code branches on private key bits, attackers in other VMs may observe those branches, and use that to recover the private key.
[15:18:09] <molok> be right back
[15:46:18] <molok> hi 
[15:47:35] <molok> and another question.. rust-crypto has a documentation or something like?
[15:48:00] <molok>  i saw a repo on github.. i think, let me see here..
[15:48:25] <molok> Da-genix rust-crypto
[15:48:41] <molok>  is that the official repo for rust-crypto?
[15:52:28] <Ilari> That crate yes.
[15:52:57] <Ilari> molok: Note that this isn't the channel of rust-crypto the crate (but cryptography in Rust in general).

[20:32:29] <bascule> Ilari: I just got a ping on a weird one
[20:32:55] <bascule> some Buttcoin developers want to implement their own Schnorr-based scheme using secp256k1 o_O
[20:41:28] <Tiffany> schnorr-based?
[21:03:12] <bascule> yeah, not a lot of details beyond that
[21:03:26] <bascule> more like "we're gonna make our own signature scheme YOLO!"
[21:03:42] <bascule> Tiffany: EdDSA is also Schnorr-based, FWIW
[21:03:58] <Tobba> why would you use secp256k1 in anything modern
[21:04:06] <bascule> because buttcoin
[21:04:24] <bascule> I guess they want to add an incompatible signature format which allows use of existing public keys?
[21:04:27] <bascule> which doesn't make any sense
[21:04:43] <bascule> everything will still need to support the new scheme
[21:04:50] <bascule> so you might as well change the curve too

[21:26:07] <Tiffany> what is the difference between a collision attack and a second-preimage attack?
[21:28:23] <Tiffany> oh
[21:28:39] <Tiffany> a collision is where you find a pair of messages that hash to the same value, for which you can do in 2^18 in MD5
[21:28:59] <Tiffany> whereas the more useful attack is second-preimage, where you have to find a message which matches the hash of another message which you cannot change
[21:29:44] <Ilari> Tiffany: Then there's the chosen-prefix collision, which is intermediate between the two (and solveable for MD5, whereas 2nd preimage is not).
[21:29:58] <Tiffany> oh
[21:30:55] <Ilari> Tiffany: Essentially, choosen-prefix collision asks one to "synchronize" to different chaining states into the same state.
[21:35:36] <bascule> Ilari: should the blockchainiacs homebrew their own ECC Schnorr scheme using secp256k1?
[21:35:47] <bascule> that just sounds like... such a bad idea
[21:36:07] <bascule> they need all clients to understand the scheme to switch to it
[21:36:18] <bascule> otherwise the blockchain will fork between clients who do and clients who don't
[21:36:25] <bascule> and as long as you're doing that, why not switch to Ed25519?
[21:36:38] <bascule> hey look, it's ECC Schnorr all ready-made for you, using a modern SafeCurve(TM)
