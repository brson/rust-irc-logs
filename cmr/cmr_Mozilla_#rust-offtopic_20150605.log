[00:28:42] <bstrie> steganography for turning IP addresses into haikus: http://hipku.gabrielmartin.net/#97-107-139-7
[00:29:12] <eddyb> it's a black page
[00:29:28] <eddyb> uBlock did its job
[00:29:35] <cmr> yup
[00:30:11] <aji> i know another gabriel martin
[00:30:14] <aji> not this one, though
[00:30:24] <eddyb> http://www.telize.com/jsonip?callback=init
[00:30:50] <eddyb> wait, uBlock blocks a service for getting the IP from JS?
[00:31:11] <eddyb> is that page entirely static?
[00:31:22] <Tiffany> it mentions ipv6, but all the addresses seem to be ipv4
[00:34:45] <c74d> Tobba: I guess it was Secure Boot that was blocking my NixOS image from booting; I disabled Secure Boot and it booted successfully.
[00:35:39] <c74d> Now that it's finished booting, it's producing a soft crackling from the laptop's speakers. :/
[00:36:01] <eddyb> I wouldn't have expected Secure Boot to allow non-corporate bootloaders
[00:36:05] <eddyb> but what do I know :P
[00:37:30] <c74d> Muting the master volume control in alsamixer stopped the crackling, but why would it running anything that would be playing sound immediately after boot?
[00:37:46] <c74d> s/running/be &/
[00:39:11] <eddyb> maybe it's the startup tune?
[00:39:14] <c74d> (Setting the master volume to 0, or any other number, doesn't affect the crackling though, only muting the master volume control affects it.)
[00:39:20] <eddyb> wat
[00:39:25] <c74d> eddyb: the what?
[00:39:27] <eddyb> c74d: maybe you have mic feedback
[00:40:19] <eddyb> there's an annoying thing which seems to happen with ALSA (but not pulseaudio), where anything the mic picks ends up in the speakers, more or less
[00:42:57] <c74d> …Huh. Initially, the Headphone Mic, Headset Mic, and Beep controls were muted.
[00:44:00] <c74d> *Un*muting Beep stops almost all, but not all, of the crackling.
[00:44:29] <c74d> The same seems to apply for unmuting Headphone Mic or Headset Mic.
[00:44:43] <eddyb> fn foo() -> impl Iterator<Item=u8> { (0..10).map(|i| i + 40) } fn main() { for i in foo() { println!("{}", i); } }
[00:44:50] <eddyb> this took me longer than it should have
[00:45:37] <c74d> Unmuting all three seems to stop the crackling entirely.
[00:46:16] <eddyb> wat
[00:46:54] <c74d> eddyb: well, thanks for suggesting a microphone issue, even if my solution makes no sense as far as preventing microphone feedback.
[00:47:21] <eddyb> I think ALSA just has bad defaults
[00:47:26] <fmtq> mm
[00:47:32] <fmtq> I had a weird night
[00:47:39] <eddyb> haven't had any mic-related issues with pulseaudio

[08:55:31] *** Quits: ogham (rally@moz-91e3hp.cable.virginm.net) (Quit: My Mac has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[08:56:27] <Quxxy> I would have expected you wouldn't need lifetimes in this case, though I can guess why you do
[08:56:47] <eddyb> technically, I shouldn't
[08:56:54] <Quxxy> Is the fact that it's not a method significant?
[08:56:58] <eddyb> but if I omit them, then it defaults to +'static
[08:57:07] <eddyb> Quxxy: it fucks up the usage significantly
[08:57:11] <Quxxy> Ah
[08:57:13] <eddyb> I thought I could get away without it, but nope
[08:57:22] <Quxxy> Ah well; that's life with Rust sometimes :P
[08:57:30] <eddyb> oh and
[08:57:30] <Quxxy> But even then, it's a lot cleaner than not
[08:57:32] <eddyb> fn format_months<'a, I: Iterator+'a>(it: I) -> impl Iterator<Item=impl Iterator<Item=String>+'a>+'a where I::Item: DateIterator+'a { it.map(format_month) }
[08:58:02] <Quxxy> That's... *garish*, but awesome :D
[08:58:23] <eddyb> note the nested impl Iterator
[08:58:26] <Quxxy> I did
[08:58:35] <Quxxy> Very cool
[08:58:56] <Quxxy> So I assume this is working in a branch of the compiler, then
[08:59:17] <eddyb> https://github.com/eddyb/rust/commits/calendar-driven-development
[08:59:31] <eddyb> I have been quite lethargic for the past week
[08:59:34] <Quxxy> actual lol @ branch name
[08:59:44] <eddyb> Quxxy: but I did want to start on this as soon as I saw your reddit post
[09:00:31] <Quxxy> Man, this would be *so* spiffy
[09:02:07] <eddyb> it works in methods btw, but there's no way to define a trait
[09:02:45] <Quxxy> eddyb: I assume there's some presently intractible reason, then?
[09:03:01] <eddyb> I'm considering allowing it in associated items and the methods in the same impl have to agree on its definition
[09:03:11] <eddyb> Quxxy: it means something differently in a trait
[09:03:26] <eddyb> an anonymous associated item
[09:03:27] <Quxxy> I was just thinking that it would be like an implicit associated type
[09:03:32] <eddyb> yupp
[09:03:42] <eddyb> you don't even have to use `impl Trait` in the trait impl
[09:03:59] <eddyb> you could put concrete types that do impl that trait
[09:04:13] <eddyb> using impl Trait both in a trait definition and impl would be two things
[09:04:33] <eddyb> anonymous associated items with values that are anonymized return types
[09:04:43] <Quxxy> Heh
[09:05:03] <Quxxy> You is crazy :D
[09:05:17] <eddyb> which is what got me thinking that I could do this for regular associated types first
[09:05:28] <eddyb> just have to get all the corner cases right
[09:05:51] <eddyb> Quxxy: I know how to solve the lifetime issue at the semantical level, but not the implementation
[09:06:14] <eddyb> I know all the type params of the function, but I don't know how to be contravariant over then
[09:06:16] <eddyb> OH
[09:06:20] <eddyb> Quxxy: hang on a bloody second :D
[09:06:27] * Quxxy is hanging

[09:06:46] <eddyb> there's also the issue of an implicit lifetime bound, similar to that on traits
[09:06:51] <eddyb> I'm not sure what value to give it
[09:07:26] <Quxxy> I really wish I could be of some help; I know little to nothing about the compiler's guts

[13:23:54] <eddyb> lack of namespace is great they said
[13:24:05] <eddyb> good luck cleaning this shit up
[13:25:59] <eddyb> so far, with Cargo.lock, github repos have worked so much better for me than crates.io versions
[13:26:09] <Quxxy> eddyb: Good news: I've finally managed to replace NaiveDate well enough that the tests pass again
[13:26:35] <eddyb> maybe we need some semi-automatic system to deduce ranges of commits for which multiple projects compile in combination
[13:26:51] <eddyb> but it works better than versions even without that
[13:27:10] <eddyb> some day humans will learn that version numbers are useless
[13:27:13] <eddyb> s/humans/we
[13:27:33] <eddyb> just another mistake, like OOP
[13:28:04] <Quxxy> eddyb: And the Gregorian calendar
[13:28:13] <Quxxy> And DST
[13:28:24] <eddyb> for a second there I thought you meant our DST
[13:28:26] <Quxxy> And modern English spelling
[13:28:34] <eddyb> DST is such a hack
[13:28:56] <eddyb> instead of flexible schedules, you shift *the clock itself*
[13:29:25] <eddyb> that's like moving cities instead of relocating people in buildings
[13:29:31] <Quxxy> Incidentally, all the stuff I had to replace has turned out to be a quarter of the whole program
[13:29:44] <eddyb> thankfully we haven't build anything that can really do the former
[13:29:54] <eddyb> because someone will think it's a brilliant solution
[13:30:02] <eddyb> (look at Java)
[13:30:39] <tilpner> If the alternative to version numbers is... hashing all the things, I need to see "Windows 2e08b5e0ec43d74fec0b218a54eb7acbe5085ae6"...
[13:30:53] <eddyb> tilpner: you are going to
[13:30:55] <tilpner> (Yes, I get that you're only referring to development)
[13:31:02] <eddyb> its codename is Windows 10
[13:31:04] <tilpner> (Maybe)
[13:31:09] <eddyb> it's not going to be versioned anymore
[13:31:11] <Quxxy> eddyb: Do you want me to -> impl all the things, or just the complicated ones?
[13:31:19] <Tobba> tilpner: if I worked for a company that did that I'd fuck with everyone and generate short hash collisions constantly
[13:31:32] <eddyb> Quxxy: everything where it's shorter (because you do need an associated type in order to do the method form)
[13:31:36] <WindowsBunny> eddyb: I'm sure they'll still version changes to the system API when they add new things
[13:31:45] <Quxxy> Well, I'm going to go with not-methods for now
[13:31:55] <eddyb> Quxxy: I also believe you might be able to clean up some of the less efficient or impossible things
[13:31:56] <eddyb> ugh
[13:32:01] <eddyb> I could've done that myself
[13:32:06] <eddyb> but after one method it looked horrible
[13:32:10] <eddyb> nothing fit
[13:32:29] <eddyb> WindowsBunny: versioned APIs?
[13:32:54] <Quxxy> Ok, if you want me to do methods, you'll need to give me an example of the syntax to aim for, because I'm not quite clear on that
[13:32:55] <WindowsBunny> eddyb: Well you need a way to determine whether the system has some new API or not
[13:33:08] <eddyb> just use revision numbers for those. Android's API levels seem saner than semver
[13:33:13] <Quxxy> *Also*, do you want me to replace the use of function pointers with closures just to really stress it? :P
[13:33:19] <eddyb> semver conflates API versioning and inmplementation versioning
[13:33:37] <eddyb> I wouldn't mind API levels for dependencies in Cargo
[13:33:49] <eddyb> it would be nicer if they would be named, but at least they can be looked up
[13:34:02] <eddyb> Quxxy: ugh, yeah
[13:34:09] <eddyb> Quxxy: function usage makes things ugly
[13:34:17] * Quxxy nods
[13:34:19] <eddyb> (format_months works btw, so it's not really a stress-test)

[14:00:40] <Layl> no offense to scala programmers, but that language makes operator abuse way too easy
[14:00:54] <Layl> I had a very unpleasant experience porting over some code

[14:01:06] <Layl> I can guerentuee your average haskell line isn't this bad

[14:04:23] <ogham> argh
[14:04:24] <Layl> and how is different from ->?:
[14:04:32] <Quxxy> eddyb: Actually, I changed my mind; all the intermediate Vecs are in places where I'd need to start faffing around with shared iterator state and interior mutability
[14:04:53] <eddyb> why shared?
[14:05:05] <eddyb> do you need to share iterators?
[14:05:09] <Layl> here's that line translated from Scala & Argonaut to C# & Json.NET: https://github.com/LaylConway/Thrust.NET/blob/master/Thrust.NET/ThrustShell.cs#L129
[14:05:21] <Quxxy> For something like group_by to be lazy, it has to produce sub-iterators
[14:05:33] <Quxxy> And the sub-iterators need to pull from the original source *as well* as the master iterator
[14:06:03] <Quxxy> And you need to handle things like stepping the master when the sub-iterators aren't finished yet, or stepping a sub-iterator from a previous master step
[14:06:37] <Quxxy> I have an implementation in grabbag that I've since realised is actually *wrong*... so I'm not confident I could do it without being able to compile :P

[15:59:58] <Quxxy> (Yes, I know it's wrong about Cell)
[16:00:04] <Quxxy> As for the first, I need to come up with a good example program for it
[16:00:35] <Quxxy> The idea is to use diagrams like flame graphs, with the stack as a mountain range, and heap allocations as zeppelins
[16:00:54] <Quxxy> The zeppelins are "anchored" to the ground
[16:01:31] <Quxxy> That plus the phrase "rust can *only* reason about grounded lifetimes", should hopefully explain why you can't return a pointer to the interior of a Box even though "but I know its on the heap so it should be oK!"
[16:01:39] <XMPPwocky> you and your zeppelins, Quxxy

[19:22:18] <Tiffany> http://www.colfaxdirect.com/store/pc/viewPrd.asp?idproduct=2642
[19:22:55] <Dabo> XMPPwocky, I don't know, but the unofficial FAQ literally says "It's nothing like a data race which you can never effectively test against."
[19:23:13] <aww> XMPPwocky: apparently its been benchmarked from some Nim users, but thats temporary until --nilChecks becomes a thing, and that's said to be minimal overhead too
[19:23:40] <Dabo> XMPPwocky, they are basically saying data races can never be effectively tested against
[19:23:56] <Dabo> while rust completely tests against them, so I'm not sure what they are saying
[19:24:09] <XMPPwocky> i think they mean via automated tests
[19:24:42] <aww> Dabo, maybe the data races with pointers are a different story in Nim?
[19:24:59] <aww> I know from their homepage it says something about data races being impossible in something
[19:25:00] <fkaa_> "The Rust community seems to be populated entirely by human beings."
[19:25:24] <Dabo> aww, I'm not sure, it might that, true
[19:25:31] <Dabo> I was just a bit confused by the statement
[19:25:39] <Tiffany> xmppwocky: yeah I was put off too
[19:25:43] <Dabo> I guess it is true that rust doesn't prevent data racers in unsafe pointers either
[19:25:47] <Dabo> races*
[19:25:51] <aww> Idk, Nim seems very promising nonetheless
[19:25:52] <Tiffany> -fsanitize=address has 3x overhead and makes it so you can't run your code in debuggers
[19:26:03] <Tiffany> -fsanitize=null is probably not too expensive though
[19:26:07] <Tiffany> since it only checks for null pointers
[19:26:19] <awe> aww: but when you have to write code that can't rely on a garbage collector, you're back to the same problem you had in C.
[19:26:20] <XMPPwocky> Dabo: i think the point is, "yeah okay these safety issues are real, but at least there aren't data races, because those really suck"
[19:26:23] <Tiffany> it doesn't need 20 terabytes of virtual memory for storing information about which bytes are garbage
[19:26:40] <aww> Tiffany, I think they only mentioned null because of that FAQ
[19:26:49] <Dabo> XMPPwocky, ahhh, true
[19:26:53] <Dabo> I think that is what it's saying
[19:27:00] <Dabo> thanks
[19:27:05] <aww> Really? I see it from another point of view
[19:27:15] <XMPPwocky> in unrelated news, stumpwm is neat
[19:27:34] <aww> I think they're saying "Yes we are aware of the current safety issues, here is how to deal with them now and new features to come"
[19:27:50] <XMPPwocky> > This solution trades expressivity for correctness: Not every possible data race is prevented.
[19:27:54] <XMPPwocky> hm
[19:27:59] <XMPPwocky> from http://nim-lang.org/blog/concurrency.html
[19:28:10] <awe> aww: The safety issues are unsolvable.
[19:28:24] <awe> In the general sense.
[19:28:25] <XMPPwocky> > This system requires the programmer to know which lock corresponds to which variables. 
[19:28:51] <awe> The general solution to those safety issues is what Rust does.

[19:32:19] <Tiffany> that's not true anymore, from what I'm seeing
[19:32:31] <Tiffany> both phi and the upcoming skylake architecture use AVX-512F, which is supported in GCC 4.9

[19:34:24] <Tiffany> there's some phi-specific instructions still, but AVX-512F is the important part
[19:35:08] <XMPPwocky> i can see the arguments against the use of unsigned values, but the hazard of programmers not doing bounds checks on signed values correctly also exists
[19:37:00] <XMPPwocky> for example: http://hpmod.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/tier1/utlbuffer.cpp the Get method here, if passed a negative size:
[19:37:34] *** Joins: Astrum|Lap (Astrum|Lap@moz-7enfbr.co.comcast.net)
[19:37:45] <XMPPwocky> the bounds check will always fail, the memcpy will coerce size to size_t and thus overwrite arbitrary memory
[19:38:07] <XMPPwocky> although i guess you could say that memcpy should have taken a signed size 
[19:39:10] <Tiffany> solution: do not allow implicit casts between signedness
[19:39:17] <Tiffany> which is a warning you can enable
[19:39:55] <Tiffany> why does this use an int and not a size_t?
[19:40:43] <XMPPwocky> it is a mystery
[19:40:50] <aww> awe, but those come with specific tradeoffs
[19:41:13] <awe> Yes, they do.

[19:55:37] <Tobba> so you could get in and write arbitrary files using logging commands

[19:56:04] <Astrum|Lap> I'm well aware =)
[19:56:09] <Astrum|Lap> *based
[19:56:35] <Tobba> my favorite one so far is how most server hosts will still let you upload DLL plugins
[19:56:51] <Tobba> and now that you can basically download any file off the server and valve aint fixing it, hosts tell you to put the rcon pass in the command line
[19:57:03] <Tobba> of course, when you can get a $5 server from the host and enumerate the process list, *including arguments* this goes to shit
[19:57:29] <XMPPwocky> fun fact: there is a 512kb cap for customization files (sprays, etc) the client sends to the server
[19:57:35] <XMPPwocky> other fun fact: this is enforced on the client
[19:58:01] <Astrum|Lap> we actually rented full servers

[19:59:04] <Astrum|Lap> well
[19:59:22] <Astrum|Lap> a lot of players demanded a more uniform experience from multiplayer
[19:59:52] <Tobba> the funny part is in i.e BF3 the experience became worse
[20:00:04] <Astrum|Lap> I played a lot of BF3
[20:00:11] <Tobba> because they let people buy up the official servers
[20:00:34] <Astrum|Lap> and people complained about how different servers could be (e.g. hardcore, no mini-map later on, etc...)
[20:01:09] <Astrum|Lap> also admins, man people love to complain about servers getting a say in who gets to play there
[20:01:34] <XMPPwocky> in tf2, semi-recently, quickplay changed so that only Valve servers would be used by default (unless the player changed settings), which was the worst idea
[20:01:51] <Tobba> Astrum|Lap: last I checked BF3s main problem was that all admins were essentially entitled shitler
[20:01:54] <Tobba> shitlers*
[20:02:06] <Astrum|Lap> early on 24 players was the max in tf2, you could bump it up higher, but you got shoved into another tab that no one ever went to
[20:02:07] <XMPPwocky> because, for one thing, now skill is hugely stratified- the newer players are on valve servers, most experienced players are on community servers
[20:02:44] <Astrum|Lap> the response from valve was that they designed the game to be played a particular way and... tough, it's their vision
