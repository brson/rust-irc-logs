[00:58:01] <scott> http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2015#work-compensation-remote what why does remote work pay better?
[00:58:48] <geofft> probably badly reported data, is my guess 
[00:59:03] <geofft> e.g., companies have to reach some level of maturity before they can deal with remote workers effectively 
[00:59:07] *** Quits: saml_ (saml@moz-rkfmct.res.rr.com) (Connection closed)
[00:59:14] <geofft> which is also correlated with being less stingy with salaries 
[00:59:21] <scott> hmm
[00:59:34] <geofft> people who can ask for remote work are also more likely to have seniority 
[00:59:50] <geofft> either within the company, or by virtue of not working an entry-level, needs-handholding job 
[00:59:58] <scott> yeah, that makes sense

[03:28:58] <meteredsection> I went back to some of my C++ code from last year this week; rust is ruining that language for me
[03:29:38] <scott> oh no, someone mentioned scott encodings in #haskell again
[03:29:46] <scott> one day I got pinged so many times because of that
[03:30:58] <scott> meteredsection: I find it's hard to design data structures without sum types... I always end up forced into something I know is inferior
[03:32:05] <meteredsection> what's driving me crazy is the ergonomics - I always used to dismiss people who complained about header files, syntax overhead, etc.
[03:32:30] <meteredsection> but now it's starting to bother me :)
[03:32:40] <meteredsection> I kept typing and then erasing "let"
[03:33:04] <scott> #define let auto
[03:33:18] <meteredsection> I'm one of those people who has argued that auto is evil!
[03:33:30] <scott> I use it sparingly
[03:33:36] <huon> it's fine if it's called `let`
[03:33:43] <meteredsection> huon: exactly; for some reason :)
[03:34:25] <scott> Rust's let is more like C++14's decltype(auto), I think
[03:34:32] <scott> the main difference being how references are handled
[03:34:39] <scott> but C++ makes references confusing no matter what
[03:35:52] <meteredsection> well, Rust's tendency to constantly morph types is baked into the language idiom; not being explicit about type along the way still seems much more dangerous in C++
[03:37:17] <meteredsection> maybe I'm just stubborn, and the auto crowd is right for the same reason let bindings are right
[03:38:08] <Mutabah> meteredsection: I spent a few hours making my own discriminated union type, just because it bothered me how I had to remember what fields were valid where

[04:20:42] <bstrie> what I most object to is that they hide absolutely *everything* about the returned type
[04:21:27] <bstrie> the proposed design for anonymous return types in rust has `fn foo() -> impl Iterator` in order to inform the reader that the only think that you can rely on is the fact that this type implements Iterator
[04:21:58] <bstrie> but the D approach seems to be analogous to `fn foo() -> impl` where you just have no data whatsoever
[04:23:31] <scott> that article felt like a C++ article to me. not sure if it's just my bias, but it was like "here are some features and their weird emergent behaviour, which I shall now name"
[04:23:38] <scott> cf. universal references in C++
[04:26:08] <barosl> Wut
[04:26:20] <barosl> The SO survey suggests that tabs are more prevalent
[04:26:34] <barosl> I thought we all migrated to spaces?
[04:26:34] <scott> read the next paragraph though, it's pretty funny
[04:27:02] <barosl> Hmm
[04:27:05] <scott> "Upon closer examination of the data, a trend emerges: Developers increasingly prefer spaces as they gain experience. Stack Overflow reputation correlates with a preference for spaces, too: users who have 10,000 rep or more prefer spaces to tabs at a ratio of 3 to 1."
[04:27:14] <scott> :D
[04:27:17] <barosl> That's... debatable
[04:27:24] <barosl> I won't say anything for that :P
[04:27:35] <whipsch> spaces confirmed best
[04:30:55] <Yurume> use spaces intermixed with tabs right before tab stops
[04:31:00] <Yurume> it will work wonderfully
[04:31:14] <Yurume> e.g. for ts=8, sp sp sp sp sp sp sp tab sp sp sp sp sp sp sp tab etc.

[04:35:20] <barosl> It is a bit surprising that Rust is ranked 3rd in the loved languages
[04:36:11] <barosl> I want to know what will happen after many hyped people realizing they should fight against the compiler :P
[04:36:48] <barosl> Of course there's also a possibility that the rank will even more grow...
[04:38:54] <scott> beta's been surprisingly quiet
[04:39:16] <scott> I feel like there was more buzz around the int/isize discussion.....
[04:39:29] <barosl> Haha
[04:40:58] <barosl> Only a few days passed after the beta, so I'm very optimistic to those complaint incoming!
[04:42:01] <Mutabah> I should probably port my major non-kernel projects to beta, see what explodes
[04:42:07] <bstrie> scott: there's been plenty of complaining :P
[04:42:08] <scott> stable will probably bring the real flood (of people who think 1.0 means feature complete)
[04:44:09] <barosl> What's wrong with Salesforce? Why do people hate it?
[04:44:33] <scott> I don't even know what it is, so maybe I'm lucky
[04:44:55] <barosl> Huh, I didn't know Wordpress was also getting so much hate
[04:46:16] <barosl> Searching Google, Salesforce seems to be a company management tool
[04:46:25] <barosl> Maybe that's the reason, nobody likes to be managed
[04:47:21] <scott> that's the same reason they love Rust
[04:47:40] <barosl> No, we don't manage! GC does!
[04:48:06] <scott> that's my point, they love Rust because it's not managed :)
[04:48:13] <barosl> Ah I see
[04:49:12] <barosl> But now I'm feeling some doubtful of the credibility of this survey
[04:49:23] <barosl> NotePad++ as the #1 preferred editor?!
[04:49:41] <barosl> Is that really genuinely true?

[04:50:25] <scott> it's a certain subset of developers
[04:50:36] <scott> people who were on SO and decided to do a survey
[04:50:58] <barosl> That's true, but it also reflects the people outside of my sight

[11:54:39] <libfud> do you guys have  any opinions on gtk vs qt?
[11:58:23] <WindowsBunny> libfud: I think Qt is much better than gtk
[11:58:33] <WindowsBunny> I'm just sad because Qt is much harder to bind to than gtk
[11:58:40] <sillesta> i don't think i've ever seen a good looking gtk interface
[11:58:58] <WindowsBunny> I can always spot a gtk interface on windows
[11:59:05] <sillesta> yeah^
[11:59:38] <WindowsBunny> But Qt, I can barely tell the difference between it and native
[11:59:45] <libfud> I see
[11:59:46] <libfud> so
[11:59:59] <WindowsBunny> I mean shit, Qt even respects windows themes
[12:00:04] <libfud> I'm thinking I should skip using the gtk bindings for rust.
[12:00:05] <WindowsBunny> switch to high contrast mode, and Qt goes with it
[12:00:10] <libfud> which seem like they may be incomplete
[12:00:26] <libfud> WindowsBunny: I don't like gtk's high contrast mode on linux for that matter
[12:00:36] <libfud> but maybe that was a gnome thing?
[12:00:50] <libfud> idk, other than every time I've tried gnome in the last few years that I've hated it
[12:00:54] <WindowsBunny> libfud: high contrast mode is typically poorly done

[12:06:29] <libfud> throwing lots of money at things sometimes can result in something good
[12:06:43] <libfud> ugh of course
[12:06:57] <libfud> ok, I'm *definitely* going to just freaking use Qt
[12:07:13] <libfud> I can't even build the gtk bindings for rust
[12:07:19] <WindowsBunny> libfud: C++ Qt GUI with a C ABI interface
[12:07:24] <libfud> yeah
[12:07:28] <WindowsBunny> and strict rules on keeping all logic in the Rust part
[12:07:35] <WindowsBunny> :D
[12:07:38] <libfud> yep
[12:07:50] <libfud> I have the backend mostly written already (in rust of course)
[12:07:51] <libfud> but
[12:07:53] <WindowsBunny> Pretty much the only sane way to get a good GUI in rust right now
[12:08:02] <libfud> I need to rewrite some stuff so I can implement undo/redo
[12:08:13] <libfud> but I kind of want a gui to work with for that
[12:08:37] <libfud> but I think for the time being I'll just learn Qt/C++ and use a text-based mockup to prototype stuff
[12:10:23] <libfud> the little I have interacted with gtk makes me feel a bit... yuck

[17:44:53] <tiffany> there's the occasional thing about phasing out 1024bit RSA
[17:45:18] <tiffany> you could probably break one in a month using a few thousand bucks on ec2
[17:45:34] <tiffany> if I got the correct impression from that thing I read a long time ago
[17:46:14] <tiffany> it looks like firefox is distrusting 1024-bit CA keys, garyoak

[17:46:34] <GaryOak_> oh yeah, SHA1 will no longer show as secure
[17:47:39] <tiffany> "As of 2003 RSA Security claims that 1024-bit RSA keys are equivalent in strength to 80-bit symmetric keys, 2048-bit RSA keys to 112-bit symmetric keys and 3072-bit RSA keys to 128-bit symmetric keys. "
[17:47:43] <tiffany> hmm
[17:48:04] <tiffany> "RSA claims that 1024-bit keys are likely to become crackable some time between 2006 and 2010"
[17:48:54] <tiffany> ah
[17:49:03] <tiffany> "or example as of May 2007, a 1039 bit integer was factored with the special number field sieve using 400 computers over 11 months.[1] The factored number was of a special form; the special number field sieve cannot be used on RSA keys. The computation is roughly equivalent to breaking a 700 bit RSA key. "
[17:49:20] <GaryOak_> hmmm
[17:49:54] <GaryOak_> AWS kind of changed the story on access to high scale computing power
[17:50:06] <tiffany> 400 computers over 11 months is 4400 computers over 1 month, so that's pretty enormous

[17:52:50] <tiffany> password cracking is probably more profitable
[17:53:10] <tiffany> site dumps of MD5 hashes and email addresses are a lot of potential bank logins to try
[17:53:22] <GaryOak_> yeah
[17:53:37] <tiffany> and MD5 cracking scales far better than simple multiplication
[17:54:18] <GaryOak_> but people aren't supposed to use MD5 for password hashes anymore
[17:54:39] <tiffany> at least they're using something at all
[17:54:46] <GaryOak_> that's very true
[17:54:48] <tiffany> password cracking in general scales really well
[17:54:59] <tiffany> you just bruteforce hashes and test them against a huge table
[17:55:08] <GaryOak_> in the sense that you can add more computers to the mix
[17:55:09] <tiffany> you don't need to individually break each password
[17:55:20] <GaryOak_> yeah
[17:55:43] <GaryOak_> there's websites that already do that sort of thing
[17:55:50] <GaryOak_> unless you've added a salt
[17:56:08] <tiffany> I heard that some password cracking software can bruteforce salt schemes
[17:56:11] <tiffany> I'm not sure how, though
[18:00:16] <GaryOak_> somehow deducing the salt generation?
[18:00:44] <GaryOak_> you'd probably have to crack a bunch of passwords to do that
[18:02:00] <tiffany> if they do use a salt scheme though, and the crackers managed to uncover more than just SQL injection
[18:02:07] <tiffany> they might be able to dump the file that salts passwords

[18:54:54] <scott> std::expected<T> is the name they went with for something like Result<T, std::exception_ptr>, since it's meant to wrap C++ exceptions

[19:01:37] <bombless> They really need a module system. But I don't think they can build something as crates.io

[19:06:35] <bombless> And the concept sounds good.
[19:06:41] <Astrum|Lap> but clang has had experimental support for modules for a few years now
[19:06:52] <Astrum|Lap> http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4214.pdf
[19:07:19] <Astrum|Lap> http://clang.llvm.org/docs/Modules.html
[19:07:29] <scott> Astrum|Lap: I see a meeting notes with the text "Clang has a complete implementation for C++, plan to push it for C++17"
[19:07:32] <scott> so that's good news
[19:08:04] <Astrum|Lap> ehhhhhh
[19:08:10] <scott> I guess no one's calling it a TS, so I got confused
[19:08:29] <Astrum|Lap> when most people think modules... it's not the same as what C++/clang are doing
[19:08:42] <Astrum|Lap> unless they've changed it recently
[19:08:51] <scott> I remember reading this before now
[19:09:00] <scott> the way they plan to wrap headers with modules and whatnot
[19:09:07] <Astrum|Lap> yes
[19:10:41] <Astrum|Lap> in either case, if I had it my way I'd never touch C++ again
[19:11:20] <Astrum|Lap> I wish rust was a bit further along though
[19:11:27] *** Quits: eerie (eerie@moz-inkv25.red.bezeqint.net) (Connection closed)
[19:11:39] <tiffany> clang modules will still be a huge improvement over precompiled headers

[19:11:42] *** Joins: eerie (eerie@moz-inkv25.red.bezeqint.net)
[19:11:55] <tiffany> it only really works if you have a single "god header" for your entire project
[19:11:58] <tiffany> since you can't use #include
[19:12:04] <tiffany> you have to include PCH as a compile option
[19:12:16] <Astrum|Lap> lighting your pants on fire would be a huge improvement over precompiled headers =P
[19:12:34] <scott> here we have a separate build method called metasource build which compiles roughly one directory at a time

[19:12:51] <scott> hax
[19:13:00] <tiffany> that is too hax for me
[19:13:06] <scott> it scares me
[19:13:17] <scott> there's a lot of things you think you can do in cpp files that you can't do in that situation
[19:13:21] <scott> 'using'
[19:13:33] <scott> it would affect other files
[19:14:11] <tiffany> some projects like luajit offer cat compilation as a sort of predecessor to LTO
[19:14:36] <Astrum|Lap> are there any comprehensive libraries for discovering things such as actual core count in rust yet?
[19:15:04] <tiffany> for me though, I would really like clang modules
[19:15:50] <scott> metasource build can actually *catch* errors that otherwise go unnoticed
[19:15:58] <scott> mostly related to the ODR rule as I understand it
[19:16:03] <Astrum|Lap> actually... I'm going to have to look through what intrinsics are provided by rustc
[19:16:18] <scott> err, the ODR - one-definition rule

[20:08:45] <barosl> https://github.com/blog/1986-announcing-git-large-file-storage-lfs
[20:08:49] <barosl> And https://git-lfs.github.com/
[20:09:18] <barosl> And https://github.com/github/git-lfs
[20:09:22] <VShell> barosl: GitLab came out with similar-but-more-standard functionality recently, and GitHub are sorta competing with them (for private repos).
[20:09:34] <barosl> Huh
[20:09:59] <barosl> At a glance GitLab looked great... I hope this decision of GitHub doesn't hurt them much
[20:10:08] <proc> while GitLab and GitHub are the same company..
[20:10:20] <barosl> What? Really?
[20:10:23] <proc> yeah
[20:10:28] <barosl> How?
[20:10:35] <barosl> Was GitLab acquired by GitHub?
[20:10:57] <barosl> Are you talking about Gitorious?
[20:10:59] <GaryOak_> That's not true
[20:11:02] <VShell> GitHub and GitLab are not the same company.
[20:11:03] <proc> thought the're the same
[20:11:06] <GaryOak_> GitLab != GitHub
[20:11:15] <proc> hm..
[20:11:17] <barosl> FWIW, Gitorious was acquired by GitLab
[20:11:19] <proc> sry then
[20:11:30] <VShell> GitLab just implements a product that looks very much like GitHub. :p
[20:11:32] *** Quits: eerie (eerie@moz-u71v5v.red.bezeqint.net) (Connection closed)
[20:11:58] <proc> but it would've made sense, gitlab (EP) as EP sol. for self hostet github selled to companys
[20:12:17] <proc> while I've to admit that I also like my gitlab on my server
[20:12:19] <VShell> proc: GitHub have their own self-hosted product they sell (GitHub Enterprise).
[20:12:52] <proc> k, sry for the false inform
[20:13:18] <barosl> The gif-lfs repository is starred only 64 times. Let's see how much the number grows this night :P
[20:14:07] <GaryOak_> haha
[20:14:36] <barosl> I'm riding on a hype train!
[20:14:37] <proc> :D like a concert & signing
[20:14:59] <GaryOak_> like matz/streem got so many stars
[20:15:24] <barosl> Wow, it now got 3,336 stars O.o
[20:15:39] <barosl> Is it viable? Did anyone use it?
[20:15:58] <barosl> At the time I looked at it for the first time it was just an idea repo
[20:16:15] <barosl> But it now seems to have at least an implementation
[20:16:16] <VShell> barosl: for the record, a project I was at one point involved with uses GitLab, it works perfectly. if I wanted to self-host git repositories for a company, I'd definitely use GitLab.
[20:16:20] <proc> it's like fb likes, can't do anything with em, everybody wants em and some are selling bots for those..
[20:16:40] <scott> streem is vapourware, and matz has never claimed otherwise, either, so I don't put it on him. the hype and activity around that repo was ridiculous
[20:16:58] <GaryOak_> he's still working on it though

[20:17:50] <proc> I've a install doc. of 184 lines of code
[20:17:57] <proc> you can install a complete binary
[20:18:09] <proc> but it'll then not accept for example your mariadb
[20:18:11] <proc> and use it's own
[20:18:23] <proc> (enterprise only, or build it yourself )
[20:18:31] <VShell> barosl: it used to be, it isn't so much any more - there's "Omnibus" packages for Ubuntu, Debian and CentOS that'll set it all up for you.
[20:18:44] <proc> that's what I meant with complete binary
[20:19:35] <proc> some functions like mysql/mariadb support aren't build into them & it seems that the most docs out there for the config. are based ont he self compiled version
[20:19:42] <proc> using the wrong folder locations for omnibus
[20:20:09] <proc> btw. git turned 10
[20:20:48] <VShell> ofc... really, you can just run GitLab in its own VM using its own database and you'll be generally happy.
[20:21:23] <proc> but I've to admit that the update works really well
[20:21:43] <barosl> If you want to imitate GitHub perfectly, there's always http://gogs.io/ - See the screenshots
[20:21:58] <proc> eeeh go ;)
[20:22:35] <proc> I've only needed a good web frontend wich's really good integrating into git
[20:22:43] <proc> and the possiblity to create some private gits
[20:22:58] <proc> that's why I've chosen gitlab over the already existing frontends
[20:24:26] <proc> hm, going to uninstall quassel, no spellcheck :(
[20:24:59] <proc> which is horrifying for all ppl reading my texts
