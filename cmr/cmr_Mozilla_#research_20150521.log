[06:01:48] <cjones> cool!
[06:01:55] <roc> while prepping that talk I reran performance results and discovered some pref regressions
[06:02:59] <roc> rr overhead on Octane got a lot worse. This is mainly due to Octane-Mandreel regressing by 10x when you run it on a single core (without rr)
[06:03:32] <roc> which seems a bit over the top, but oh well
[06:03:59] <roc> there's also been some changes in the balance of system calls. the JS interpreter calls getrusage all the time now, so I need to syscall-buf that
[06:04:28] <roc> also, I don't know if you noticed, but someone @twitter.com submitted a bug and PR
[06:04:34] <cjones> ah, so you’re comparing to numbers gathered against SM etc. today
[06:04:49] <cjones> so might not be an rr regression 
[06:04:51] <cjones> per se
[06:05:07] <cjones> yeah i saw that … quite interested in what they’re trying :)
[06:05:25] <roc> also I'm getting good feedback today :-). "mstange: there's somewhat of a competition going on here at the office about who can use rr the most. it's so good"
[06:06:13] <roc> yeah, might not be an rr regression in principle, in fact, it probably isn't, but I can't keep honestly testing on old Firefox builds :-)
[06:07:04] <cjones> heh, that’s great to hear
[06:07:24] <cjones> true.  at least, you wouldn’t want to post the numbers publicly, but it’s interesting to know
[06:07:59] <roc> also I was wondering if we should put the rr release packages somewhere outside the git repo

[06:09:24] <cjones> yeah, i only put them there because i lost access to my p.m.o account
[06:09:45] <cjones> somehwere with static hosting would be best, there’s not much use having them in an git repo
[06:10:03] <roc> yeah, I just don't know of a good free reliable static hosting service with TLS
[06:10:14] <cjones> a separate repo would be fine too, except there’s a point where github starts asking you questions about repo size

[22:09:53] <roc> oh man
[22:10:30] <roc> khuey|away: I sure hope that you don't hit a situation where you need to patch a series of instructions after a syscall where there's a jump into the middle of the sequence for elsewhere...

[23:13:45] <roc> khuey|away: my plan is to create a code buffer in librrpreload. rr will write stubs into it, one per patched syscall callsite. Then at the callsite we can just execute a far jump to its stub. Each stub will adjust the stack pointer downward, call the syscall hook corresponding to the instructions we replaced in the patch, then on return restore the stack pointer and jump back to the correct...
[23:13:47] <roc> ...return address
[23:21:05] <cjones> roc: just out of curiousity, which libc function is that??
[23:32:22] <roc> sigaction
[23:32:31] <roc> or whatever the internal libc function for that is
[23:33:11] <roc> I think it's special because it's a leaf function, unlike pretty much all other syscall functions, so gcc doesn't set up a proper stack pointer
[23:33:40] <roc> it was extra fun to debug because we ended up calling sigaction with garbage, and it succeeded. Until the signal was actually delivered
[23:35:28] <roc> and this was only triggered because I added one more patchable pattern (so we can patch __libc_recv) and that happened to match sigaction also
[23:36:26] <roc> the good news is that after fixing various patching issues (not even including recv yet), we can record dom/html/tests with reasonably low overhead. As long as I record only Firefox and not the test harness, due to the stupid Python busywaiting
[23:37:07] <roc> In other news, Peter Maydell filed some more issues that we should look into before releasing 4.0
