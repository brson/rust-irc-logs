[00:28:05] <Tobba> XMPPwocky: are you surprised?
[00:28:26] <Tobba> XMPPwocky: does it involve stack smashing or just good 'ol valve logic
[00:28:38] <XMPPwocky> ye olde stack buffer overflowe
[00:29:05] <Astrum|Lap> it's cool

[00:33:47] <Havvy> Internet connection be wonky.
[00:33:51] <Astrum|Lap> last line I typed
[00:34:11] <Astrum|Lap> I was being facetious though
[00:34:25] <Tobba> XMPPwocky: I think there are still some arbitrary file writing exploits
[00:34:43] <Tobba> I wonder if you could abuse some equivalent of load_plugin (I'm not aware of anything that lets you write non-text)
[00:34:56] <Astrum|Lap> I would say something about how the only thing that matters is getting the game out for the holiday season or something like that
[00:35:00] <Astrum|Lap> but we're talking about valve...
[00:35:29] <XMPPwocky> Tobba: you can have executable DOS programs, at least (like X5O!P%@AP[4\PZX54(P^)7CC)7}$EICAR-STANDARD-ANTIVIRUS-TEST-FILE!$H+H* )
[00:35:38] <XMPPwocky> executable all-ASCII*
[00:36:01] <Tobba> Astrum|Lap: there was a time someone hosted a server with a lot of players on it (fake), which would instantly delete hal32.dll if you joined it
[00:36:02] <Tobba> good times
[00:36:28] <Tiffany> that is amazing xmppwocky
[00:36:28] <Tobba> XMPPwocky: would all-ascii PE be possible? I don't think so
[00:36:47] <Tiffany> will windows still execute DOS executables?
[00:38:15] <XMPPwocky> Tiffany: my windows 8 won
[00:38:17] <XMPPwocky> 't
[00:38:22] <Tiffany> thought so
[00:38:45] <Astrum|Lap> just yours? =P
[00:38:45] <Tiffany> I wonder if anyone's antivirus beeped because you pasted that
[00:38:53] <Tobba> XMPPwocky: I think there was some bug that let you launch bat files?
[00:38:58] <Tobba> Tiffany: oh, I remember a fun fun thing
[00:39:06] <Tobba> punkbuster scans other processes for certain strings
[00:39:16] <Astrum|Lap> I know this story!
[00:39:18] <XMPPwocky> Tobba: hm. there was one with the way voice codecs worked
[00:39:22] <Tobba> Astrum|Lap: !!!
[00:39:36] <XMPPwocky> Tobba: basically- the server sends the client SVC_VoiceInit, which is a netmessage with a string inside.
[00:39:54] <Astrum|Lap> also, punkbuster is horrible, I can only imagine it was a "if you scratch my back I'll scratch yours" type scenario that lead to... any game developer ever using it
[00:39:58] <XMPPwocky> strings like vaudio_miles or vaudio_speex
[00:40:18] <Tobba> let me guess, it just loads a file with that name + .dll appended
[00:40:19] <Tiffany> I can't find anything about all-ascii executables besides DOS
[00:40:20] <XMPPwocky> intriguingly, there are vaudio_miles.dll and vaudio_speex.dll in the bin/ directory of the game install
[00:40:23] <XMPPwocky> yeep
[00:40:26] <Tobba> and if it's the max length ??? happens
[00:40:26] <Tiffany> but the results are full of junk about text vs binary
[00:40:51] <Tobba> so you can probably send like .././../foo.txt and make sure it's always 260 characters
[00:41:02] <XMPPwocky> Tobba: because of other fine Valve programming, the appending happens in a buffer that's larger than the max you can send
[00:41:07] <XMPPwocky> oh, but wait, max_path exists
[00:41:12] <XMPPwocky> so yeah that was exploitable for RCE too
[00:41:17] <XMPPwocky> they fixed it in tf2, luckily

[00:42:00] <Tiffany> why not?
[00:42:11] <Astrum|Lap> it's not just a valve problem
[00:42:14] <XMPPwocky> i mean, valve's not incompetent, their priorities are just screwed up
[00:42:19] <Astrum|Lap> it's an industry wide problem
[00:42:51] <Tiffany> maybe there should be more media coverage on the constant flow of RCEs in popular game servers
[00:42:58] <Tiffany> people assume that games don't need to worry about security
[00:43:11] <Tiffany> they need to be shown what happens when they don't
[00:43:14] <XMPPwocky> i'm actually working on that atm
[00:43:23] <Tiffany> the minecraft 1.8.4 exploit is pretty nasty
[00:43:24] <Astrum|Lap> would anyone care, Tiffany 
[00:43:27] <Tobba> XMPPwocky: write a worm
[00:43:28] <Tiffany> you could get op on any server
[00:43:38] <XMPPwocky> Tiffany: oh, which exploit is that
[00:43:39] <Tiffany> well
[00:43:41] <Tiffany> any server where you can get creative mode
[00:43:43] <Tobba> Tiffany: can op really do much more than execute arbitrary commands
[00:43:45] <Astrum|Lap> I mean if we push valve aside, companies like EA and Activision hold pretty firm to release dates
[00:43:51] <Astrum|Lap> gotta have a new best seller out every year
[00:43:54] <Tobba> err
[00:43:56] <Tiffany> tobba: what do you mean?
[00:44:04] <Astrum|Lap> they're willing to ship incredibly buggy games
[00:44:06] <Tobba> Tiffany: that was poorly worded, uh, what can an op actually do?
[00:44:07] <Tiffany> they can't really mess with the system outside minecraft, without plugins
[00:44:10] <Tobba> right
[00:44:12] <Tiffany> shut down the server
[00:44:14] <Tiffany> destroy everything
[00:44:19] <Tobba> it would've been really nasty if you could execute code, but eh
[00:44:20] <Tiffany> it depends on the server
[00:44:24] <Tiffany> it hurts big servers the most
[00:44:25] <Astrum|Lap> I don't think you can shame them into worrying about things like RCE at this point
[00:44:27] <Tiffany> since they have plugins
[00:44:29] <Tiffany> and disrupt a lot of people

[00:44:59] <XMPPwocky> at some point this stuff is going to start going straight to full-disclosure
[00:45:04] <Astrum|Lap> so... good luck, XMPPwocky 
[00:45:10] <Astrum|Lap> a few companies might take notice
[00:45:25] <Tiffany> minecraft isn't generally prone to RCE because java
[00:45:44] <Tiffany> they have logic bugs
[00:45:45] <XMPPwocky> Tiffany: but it is probably prone to logic errors because java *programmers*
[00:45:48] <XMPPwocky> :P
[00:46:04] <Tiffany> this bug I'm takling about in particular
[00:46:13] <Tiffany> so
[00:46:14] <Astrum|Lap> it's prone to logic errors because you can only type so much before your brain dies
[00:46:24] <Tiffany> first off, they never sanitized the contents of signs, because they used to be harmless
[00:46:25] <Astrum|Lap> FactoryFactorySingletonblahblahblah
[00:46:35] <XMPPwocky> TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles
[00:46:37] <Tiffany> then they made it so you could add json to signs to execute commands on right click (useful for maps and stuff)
[00:46:39] <XMPPwocky> TeenageMutantNinjaTurtleFactory
[00:46:42] <Tiffany> but they didn't sanitize them
[00:46:47] <Tiffany> so if you have a modded client, in creative mode
[00:46:57] <Tiffany> you can place a sign containing json to execute the command /op you
[00:47:06] <XMPPwocky> Tiffany: sad_trombone.wav
[00:47:11] <Tiffany> then you just right click it
[00:47:33] <Tiffany> now, this doesn't seem like that big a deal
[00:47:39] <Tiffany> but imagine this is a server which has a thousand people playing
[00:47:44] <Tiffany> and you can just wreak havoc
[00:48:12] <Tiffany> nobody really got a chance to exploit this in the wild, to be fair
[00:48:14] <Tiffany> mojang fixed it fast
[00:48:17] <XMPPwocky> how the hell do you run a minecraft server with thousands of people, a small supercomputer
[00:48:31] <Tiffany> usually by splitting them across multiple real servers, hidden behind bungee (a proxy)
[00:48:45] <XMPPwocky> ah, so sharding based on position?
[00:48:49] <Tiffany> nah
[00:48:53] <Tiffany> minigame servers, for example
[00:49:03] <Tiffany> they have 5000 people playing, but they're all parcelled out into instances of games or the lobby
[00:49:03] <Tobba> so sharding based on dimension?
[00:49:10] <XMPPwocky> i see
[00:49:11] <Tiffany> the lobby usually has a couple hundred people, but games usually have under 10
[00:49:30] <Tiffany> so you buy a couple dedis, one to host a few lobbies, and the rest for hosting hundreds of game servers
[00:49:39] <Tobba> Tiffany: seems like you'd be better off just writing a custom server
[00:49:45] <Tiffany> there's a sort of optimal point between memory overhead and N^2 performance hit of player count
[00:49:56] <whipsch> does the stock mc server still perform terribly?
[00:49:57] <Tiffany> there actually aren't really any good ones, tobba
[00:50:03] <Tiffany> define terribly whipsch?
[00:50:12] <Tobba> Tiffany: TCP
[00:50:17] <Tobba> and asinine memory usage
[00:50:35] <whipsch> Tiffany: idunno, just in general.  pretty much memory usage with (what i would perceive to be) a small amount of players
[00:50:45] <whipsch> i believe cpu usage was kinda on the high end last time i checked it out too
[00:50:53] <Tiffany> it depends a lot on what you're doing
[00:51:00] <Tobba> worldgen is crazy slow as well
[00:51:06] <Tiffany> if you're cramming everyone into a small area, you won't use much memory on terrain
[00:51:13] <Tiffany> but you'll use a shitload of bandwidth
[00:51:25] <Tobba> but I even with mods like Bioms 'O Pleny it's still terrible, so it's not due to good 'ol notch coding
[00:51:36] <Tiffany> if you're cramming everyone into a small area, you can get away with 100-200 people on a decent dedi
[00:51:53] <Tiffany> but people with low end computers such as myself will actually get pretty bad fps lag from all the player models being drawn
[00:51:58] <Havvy> Biome's 'O Plenty doesn't change the world gen algorithm. It just adds more content.
[00:52:01] <whipsch> yeah, 100-200 seems quite low to me honestly
[00:52:08] <Tobba> Havvy: it doesn't?
[00:52:15] <Tiffany> okay
[00:52:23] <Tobba> I remember it being incredibly flat among other things, which the normal worldgen shouldnt do
[00:52:28] <Tiffany> what are you thinking of to compare it with though?
[00:52:41] <Tiffany> very few games have more than a couple hundred per server, and those that do often employ sharding
[00:52:45] <Havvy> That's because they have flatter biomes.
[00:53:02] <Tiffany> tobba: the world gen can do flatter biomes
[00:53:07] <Tiffany> it's all a bunch of variables you can tweak
[00:53:26] <Tiffany> they vary globally and per-biome
[00:53:33] <Tiffany> there's multiple passes
[00:53:37] <Tobba> interesting
[00:53:42] <Tobba> I guess it is just due to notch-quality coding then
[00:53:43] <Tiffany> stone, which is perlin noise lerped every 8 blocks
[00:53:50] <Tiffany> ores, gravel, etc
[00:53:52] <Tiffany> grass
[00:54:03] <Tiffany> and then surface scatter
[00:54:06] <Havvy> Tobba:  Jeb-quality. ;)
[00:54:11] <Tiffany> trees, generated structures
[00:54:16] <Havvy> Or was it Dinnerbone?
[00:54:23] <Havvy> Probably Dinnerbone.
[00:54:36] <Tobba> Havvy: it probably still uses all the craptastically slow helper code though
[00:54:43] <Tiffany> you can't really help with the terrain gen tobba
[00:54:52] <Tiffany> voxel noise is slow, full stop
[00:55:32] <Tiffany> each chunk is 16*16*256=65536 blocks to fill in
[00:56:09] <Tiffany> and it's done using 2*2*64=256 samples of the noise function, which has who knows how many layers
[00:56:27] <Tiffany> oh, 32, not 64
[00:56:29] <Tiffany> so 128 samples
[00:56:43] <Tobba> it should be slow but not *that* slow
[00:56:50] <Tiffany> it's also written in java
[00:56:57] <Tiffany> which is literally incapable of cache locality
[00:57:15] <Tobba> true
[00:57:22] <Tobba> it takes like what, 300-500ms per chunk
[00:57:24] <Tiffany> I've worked on voxel projects
[00:57:33] <Tiffany> I've honestly given up on it being viable
[00:57:48] <Tiffany> you spend O(N^3) time and memory for O(N^2) surface area
[00:58:21] <Tobba> minecraft would also probably be a lot faster if it didn't have such a massive chunk size
[00:58:27] <Tiffany> LoD just makes the problem worse

[02:04:59] <Havvy> Oh...that's...uh....lame....
[02:05:00] <c74d> I'd tried using Nix before on this VPS, it didn't work well under the memory constraints either.
[02:05:05] <barosl> considering its massive user base
[02:05:12] <Astrum|Lap> what's wrong with #archlinux?
[02:05:13] <panicbit> You could always run a custom distro in a chroot /silly idea
[02:05:26] <Lurkin2> c74d use a smaller distro.

[02:05:52] <c74d> Lurkin2: "smaller" meaning Debian?
[02:06:02] <Lurkin2> Do it.
[02:06:14] <Lurkin2> Debian has great documentation imo.
[02:06:23] <c74d> eh. I expect I will if Arch doesn't work.

[02:06:31] <Havvy> barosl:  The users of Ubuntu aren't the kind of people who'd want to write wiki articles.
[02:06:41] <Havvy> The users of Arch Linux are the kind of people who do.
[02:07:11] <Lurkin2> I think my client has broken agent forwarding.
[02:07:32] <barosl> Havvy, Probably, but I mean, even though the small fraction of the Ubuntu users are "that" kind of people, the number would still be more than Arch's
[02:08:16] <barosl> Or... did they all escape from Ubuntu? :(
[02:08:23] <panicbit> I did :)
[02:08:26] <Havvy> Probably all escaped from Ubuntu.
[02:08:42] <panicbit> The same way as I did escape when Vista arrived
[02:09:07] <panicbit> Though, Ubuntu is not THAT bad ;P
[02:09:53] <barosl> It's sad because Ubuntu is still my go-to distro when I set up a server... I may have to finally move my fat ass

[03:13:23] <barosl> It is surprising that C# 5 (in 2012) had made a breaking change to the language!
[03:13:42] <barosl> For a such a mainstream language
[03:20:29] <panicbit> barosl: Why is the former for loop problematic? Is it because closures would take a reference to the loop variable and all modify the same variable?
[03:20:56] <panicbit> (I'm not very familiar with C#)
[03:20:57] <barosl> panicbit, You mean, the latter?
[03:21:06] <panicbit> I mean the older version
[03:21:12] <barosl> Ah I see
[03:21:15] <barosl> Yes, that's the problem
[03:21:16] <panicbit> Where the loop variable is reused
[03:21:20] <panicbit> Ok
[03:21:33] <barosl> The older version was analogous to capture-by-reference, whereas the newer is like capture-by-value

[05:37:40] <Dabo> My attempt at adding stack traces to rust error handling: https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/3ba0dd/rust_throw_like_try_but_with_stack_traces/
[05:39:15] <Dabo> because the error messages that happen when a Result is unwrapped at main() are annoying
[05:40:28] <Quxxy> Dabo: Are you on Windows?
[05:40:38] <Dabo> Quxxy, no, linux
[05:40:55] <Quxxy> Ah; you do know there's a function to get a complete stack trace, right? :P
[05:41:18] <Quxxy> So you could just grab the stack trace when you throw the error and not need the up! macro
[05:41:49] <Dabo> true, but if it's going to be custom anyways why not grab the stack trace on the way up?
[05:42:18] <Quxxy> Because you have to modify your code and it won't catch frames that just pass the Result through untouched
[05:42:44] <Dabo> that is true
[05:42:52] <Quxxy> Now, on *Windows*, it's a different story
[05:42:57] <Quxxy> We don't have working stack traces
[05:43:13] <Quxxy> So I already have a custom tryt! macro that does basically the same thing :P
[05:43:14] <Dabo> Quxxy, so my library is at least useful for a cross-platform for stack traces xD
[05:43:31] <Dabo> Quxxy, I couldn't figure out how to make it work with one macro *and* do From conversions on errors
[05:43:49] <Quxxy> I kinda just gave up and shoved everything into a unity type
[05:43:55] <Dabo> :P
[05:44:27] <Dabo> Quxxy, the throw library just provides an alternative Result type definition, and then just two macros to replace try!() with, I tried to make it a less-pain transition xD

[06:54:21] <niconii> edunham: yep, +m
[06:54:27] <edunham> (at least on freenode; i assume moz is similar)
[06:54:43] <niconii> i miiight resort to that, but for now it doesn't seem necessary
[06:55:02] <edunham> if voice was handed out liberally, it could accomplish a similar effect
[06:55:14] <edunham> yeah voicing everyone is a pain
[06:55:15] <niconii> in any case, i was taking a closer look at the spam, and from the looks of things
[06:55:33] <niconii> whatever script they're using is incredibly limited
[06:55:42] <edunham> do we require that nicks be registered to talk in channel?
[06:55:54] <niconii> edunham: in #rust, yes; it's set as +R right now
[06:56:01] <edunham> cool
[06:56:23] <niconii> if you look at the spam, you see "fingers" is the leader; obvious given they're the only one with a non-random name
[06:56:34] *** Joins: erickt (erickt@moz-njt.vqi.14.76.IP)
[06:56:34] *** ChanServ sets mode: +o erickt
[06:56:41] <niconii> but also, when they say something, the bots repeat it... but they only repeat it once
[06:56:49] <eddyb_> I noticed the nick
[06:56:50] <niconii> so they have to keep saying it
[06:57:09] <eddyb_> didn't realize the bots were repeaters
[06:57:23] <niconii> not only that, but because fingers has to say it first for them to repeat it
[06:57:30] <niconii> whoever says a message first is the leader
[06:57:40] <niconii> if you take them out, the bots will stop
[06:57:47] <niconii> because they only repeat what the leader says
[06:57:55] <niconii> it's that simple
[06:58:43] <niconii> not only that, i haven't seen them change up their ip at all
[06:59:13] <niconii> it's kind of pathetic actually, they really must just be a script kiddie
[07:02:46] *** Quits: erickt (erickt@moz-njt.vqi.14.76.IP) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[07:04:17] <niconii> anyway, i guess all we need is a bot that, if someone says something and that message is repeated by a number of other people (at least three others, i suppose) within a second, they're all banned
[07:04:56] <niconii> ...assuming they actually figure out how to get around the ip ban, anyway
[07:05:37] <XMPPwocky> don't forget to exempt playbot from it
[07:05:45] <edunham> haha, like an r9k?
[07:06:09] <niconii> edunham: something like that, yeah, though obviously less extreme :)
[07:08:38] <niconii> XMPPwocky: well, if it only bans exact matches, that means they'd have to figure out a quine where `playbot: [some code]` prints `playbot: [some code]`
[07:08:41] <edunham> could ban only if redundant phrase is over n characters
[07:09:57] <niconii> XMPPwocky: so perhaps a little too sophisticated of an attack to really worry about ;)
[07:10:26] <c74d> niconii: I believe playbot handles NOTICEs properly (i.e., ignores them), and if so would be immune to botloop quines.
[07:10:33] <niconii> rustbot's a bit more vulnerable though
[07:11:09] <niconii> c74d: it's not really a loop that's the problem, just repeating what the spammer says
[07:11:37] <niconii> c74d: the context here is having a bot that auto-bans anyone who repeats what the spammer says, so
[07:11:58] <c74d> ah, you mean manipulating playbot to get it banned, not to make it spam the channel?
[07:12:03] <niconii> c74d: right
[07:12:06] *** Quits: Astrum|Lap (Astrum|Lap@moz-skcefh.co.comcast.net) (Client exited)
[07:13:19] <Tobba> playbot isn't vulnerable to quines?
[07:13:31] <niconii> c74d: which has happened before, because of an overzealous auto-g-line and some people messing around in #rust-offtopic ;)
[07:13:54] * c74d recalls that incident.
[07:14:25] <Tobba> does playbot ignore playbot-mini correctly?
[07:14:57] <Tobba> oh right, notices
[07:15:01] <Tobba> fn main(){let(a,b,c)=("fn main(){","println!(\"playbot: let(a,b,c)=({:?},{:?},{:?});{}\",a,b,c,c);}","println!(\"playbot-mini: {}let(a,b,c)=({:?},{:?},{:?});{}\",a,a,b,c,b);");println!("playbot: let(a,b,c)=({:?},{:?},{:?});{}",a,b,c,c);}

[07:15:27] <niconii> be nice to playbot :(

[07:16:03] -playbot-mini- playbot: "Hello, world!"
[07:16:11] <niconii> see? nothin'
[07:17:45] <Tobba> I forgot it uses notices
[07:17:56] <Tobba> now I have this stupid quine that doesn't do anything
[07:19:52] <niconii> (by the way, playbot-mini didn't output anything because you forgot the : after playbot-mini)
[07:23:06] <niconii> well gee
[07:24:06] <niconii> was that all there is for spam? i don't exactly mind, obviously no more spam's a good thing, but i kinda wanted to apply my knowledge after figuring it out...
[07:24:23] <c74d> hm <https://github.com/aatxe/irc>
[07:24:55] <eddyb_> I don't see anything
[07:25:05] <niconii> c74d: oh, that's pretty handy
[07:25:07] <Tobba> possibly moved onto the firefox channels?
[07:25:20] <eddyb_> I expect everyone else sees /me
[07:25:21] <Tobba> c74d: iirc that library doesn't respond to PINGs properly
[07:25:52] <c74d> I'd try writing an anti-spam bot in Rust, but what little time I have I ought to use for packing and throwing up a website.
[07:25:59] <c74d> Tobba: oh :(
[07:26:22] <Quxxy> Nice!  I can ICE the compiler with a build script, apparently
[07:26:36] <Tobba> c74d: it looks like it has gotten a lot of updates since I used it though (but it does still seem a bit bloated)
[07:26:38] <eddyb_> so?
[07:26:54] <Tobba> like, built-in JSON config parsing *and* file reading?
[07:27:05] <eddyb_> Quxxy: can you do something you can't do otherwise?
[07:27:24] <Quxxy> No, because then I wouldn't be able to do it
[07:28:47] <c74d> Tobba: one could fork it and delete those bits if one cared to

[07:37:44] <eddyb_> https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/3b73ee/java_9s_new_garbage_collector_whats_changing/
[07:38:04] <eddyb_> remind me why anyone would want to use the JVM
[07:38:28] <eddyb_> or at least the subset exposed in Java
[07:39:39] <WindowsBunny> eddyb_: Meanwhile in the world of Rust we don't have to worry about GC
[07:41:21] <eddyb_> 100GB... that's like throwing perfectly good food in the trash
[07:41:47] <aatch> I get that frequent allocations and frees can lead to a death-by-a-thousand-cuts situation, but GC pauses are an entire different beast.
[07:42:30] <Tobba> I wonder how nasty a 100GB GC pause is, though the garbage collector should be incremental, if you have 100GB of heap there's probably lots of churn
[07:42:56] <Tobba> well reading the reddit links, minutes, apparently
[07:43:22] <aatch> It's also normally much easier (especially in Rust) to reduce the amount of new allocations, much harder to work around GC pauses (short of the sledgehammer "disable collection between these two points" approach)
[07:44:42] <brandonson> I think github might be going a little crazy with this whole rainbow thing.
[07:44:49] * eddyb_ marches on with GCiG
[07:44:53] <brandonson> I get it, but really, even when I push?  I don't even live in the US!
[07:44:54] <WindowsBunny> if it turns out you're allocating massive amounts of objects in Rust typically you can get around it with arenas
[07:45:05] <eddyb_> brandonson: wat
[07:45:11] <eddyb_> I use git gui
[07:45:20] <eddyb_> haven't seen anything odd
[07:45:32] <Tobba> bitbucket's doing it as well
[07:45:41] <eddyb_> sheesh
[07:46:53] <Tobba> now I kinda want to write a rust application with an excuse to need 128GB of memory
[07:47:02] <Tobba> ... I think I might need a machine with that much RAM first, though
[07:47:05] <eddyb_> try 700TB
[07:47:14] <eddyb_> I have the code for it
[07:47:18] <brandonson> Tobba: nah, just use swap space
[07:47:22] <brandonson> \o/
[07:47:35] <aatch> WindowsBunny, or a slab-allocator, if you have lots of churn of small objects, though that'll need placement-new to be completely efficient.
[07:47:38] <eddyb_> code that makes rustc allocate absurds amounts of space
[07:47:41] <Tobba> if your application runs well with 100GB in swap, you're probably doing something very very wrong
[07:47:50] <WindowsBunny> brandonson: only problem is that you need to make sure your memory allocations are not fragmented
[07:48:02] <brandonson> Tobba: like, allocating 100GB in the first place?
[07:48:15] <niconii> brandonson: well, github *is* a US-based company, so
[07:48:16] <aatch> Tobba, just never free anything. Old stuff will go into swap, but you'll never ask for it.
[07:48:28] <WindowsBunny> if your allocations are fragmented then you only need to use a small amount of the memory to effectively force all of it to stay in ram
[07:48:34] <Tobba> aatch: the swapping approach to garbage collection
[07:48:56] <aatch> Tobba, yes, I remember the somewhat-horrifying discussion the other day.
[07:49:03] <WindowsBunny> remember, pages can only be effectively swapped out if none of the allocations in the page are being accessed
[07:49:11] <eddyb_> Tobba: the 700TB thing is from almost two years ago when I was trying to compile a x86_16 emulator
[07:49:22] <Tobba> eddyb_: what did you DO
[07:49:27] <eddyb_> codegen'd from opcode descriptions
[07:49:30] <WindowsBunny> so what you could actually do is have multiple heaps
[07:49:36] <eddyb_> Tobba: it was before rvalue scopes
[07:49:38] <WindowsBunny> and assign a heap to each task or something
[07:49:44] <Tobba> did you encounter O(n^2) behaviour somehow?
[07:50:01] <WindowsBunny> so tasks that don't run, their entire heap can stop being accessed and all the allocated pages can be swapped out
[07:50:21] <eddyb_> so I needed a variable for each node in each possible expression tree
[07:50:26] <eddyb_> Tobba: worse
[07:50:42] <Tobba> O(n^3)?
[07:50:45] <eddyb_> probably more like VecMap
[07:50:47] <aatch> O(n!)
[07:50:55] <Tobba> aatch: that's just O(scary)
[07:51:31] <Tobba> the only time I've managed to construct a factorial-complexity algorithm was due to a bug in the language
[07:51:53] <whipsch> i wonder if i invented this, i call it the strongarmed once
[07:52:07] <whipsch> var ONCE = 1; then somewhere called repeatedly:    !--ONCE? ... : ...;
[07:52:53] <brandonson> whipsch: I don't... what does that even do?
[07:52:56] <Tobba> that's horrifying
[07:53:16] <eddyb_> Tobba: more like O((max_id - min_id)^2.5)
[07:53:30] <eddyb_> nothing saved me
[07:53:31] <Tobba> brandonson: pre-decrements once and uses side effects inside the terenary operator
[07:53:48] <whipsch> yeah
[07:53:50] <brandonson> ah, that's a ternary
[07:53:51] <brandonson> okay
[07:53:52] <Tobba> well, I'm assuming there are side effects
[07:53:58] <brandonson> was not ready it as a ternary
[07:53:58] <whipsch> it works because negative numbers in javascript are truthy
[07:54:08] <whipsch> so !-1 is false
[07:54:11] <eddyb_> whipsch: they are everywhere
[07:54:19] <whipsch> yeah eddyb_ i know
[07:54:36] <whipsch> just felt it's important to commend js on its achievements of being partially consistent with other languages
[07:54:50] <aatch> whipsch, a broken clock is right twice a day.
[07:54:53] <brandonson> whipsch: there's a video around to contradict that point
[07:54:56] <eddyb_> I thought it was C but then I saw var
[07:55:11] <whipsch> it would work in C as well i suppose
[07:55:25] <whipsch> also interestingly in js, postfix ++ also mutates the var immediately
[07:55:36] <whipsch> or --, w/e
[07:56:00] <eddyb_> Tobba: I tried moving each branch into its own function and it didn't work :/
[07:56:02] <whipsch> i like the way it looks written as that though, like a ONCE holding a sword posing
[07:56:09] <Tobba> eddyb: :/
[07:56:14] <eddyb_> Tobba: I had no way to compile my code
[07:56:27] <eddyb_> small subsets of it did kinda work
[07:56:50] <eddyb_> but took ages and weren't enough to run VGA ROM
[08:02:40] <Tobba> I wonder if things have improved
[08:03:29] <eddyb_> mmmaybe
[08:03:34] <eddyb_> rvalue scopes for one
[08:04:00] <eddyb_> some behavior depends on the number of variables in a function
[08:04:07] <eddyb_> or worse, their NodeIda
[08:04:15] <eddyb_> *NodeId's
[08:04:40] <Tobba> that seems really... wrong
[08:05:49] <eddyb_> liveness should just die
[08:06:03] <eddyb_> its job is mostly handled by borrowck nowadays
[08:06:10] <eddyb_> except maybe some warnings
[08:06:24] <eddyb_> but borrowck also does something with local variables
[08:07:29] <eddyb_> Tobba: I think the solution was a sparse map
[08:08:12] <eddyb_> liveness has a variables * mentions of variables thing
[08:08:27] <eddyb_> I had lots of both

[09:48:53] <eddyb> good job, brave new world, you took God's promise not to wipe Earth for your sins again and made it a banner for them
[09:49:16] <eddyb> US is literally Babel right now
[09:49:28] <niconii> nah, god is totes gay for noah
[09:50:37] <eddyb> are you implying a transcendent entity is sexually attracted to a human?
[09:50:59] <eddyb> nevermind there's something somewhere in the bible about fallen angels fucking women
[09:51:16] <niconii> well maybe noah was a hunk, you don't know
[09:51:17] <eddyb> then again angels don't have to be transcendent, just intrinsic to the simulation

[09:55:00] <WindowsBunny> full disclosure: I am a Russian Orthodox Christian
[09:55:04] <niconii> eddyb: same here
[09:55:13] <eddyb> WindowsBunny: russian?!
[09:55:32] <WindowsBunny> eddyb: yes
[09:55:58] <eddyb> what happened is that over time I've realized I'm so broken there's just no way I could obey all judeo-christian morals and the fineprint
[09:56:33] <eddyb> so I drifted towards an antihero "personality"
[09:56:46] <eddyb> ends justify means and everything that comes with it
[09:56:48] <WindowsBunny> eddyb: the eastern orthodox religion is divided into several patriarchates based on country
[09:57:06] <eddyb> WindowsBunny: well, duuh, but why russian for you, in particular?
[09:57:22] <WindowsBunny> eddyb: Because my Mom is Russian
[09:58:16] <eddyb> so you have reverse engineering in your blood. could explain the affinity for windows internals :P
[09:59:15] <eddyb> niconii: it also means I'm trying not to pick sides in evolution vs creationism vs aliens
[09:59:54] <eddyb> because I don't know what the fuck happened more than a few thousand years ago (and if you go that far back, data is getting sketchy)
[09:59:59] <WindowsBunny> eddyb: That's.... hmmm, would that fall under racism?
[10:00:11] <WindowsBunny> eddyb: Or is there a better term for that?
[10:00:19] <eddyb> WindowsBunny: racial superiority?
[10:00:30] <eddyb> like arians?
[10:00:47] <WindowsBunny> eddyb: Clearly I am superior, but I don't attribute it to my race

[10:04:17] <WindowsBunny> niconii: Everyone's actions are entirely selfish
[10:04:39] <eddyb> simulation hypothesis makes it hard for me to dismiss transcendent involvement of any kind
[10:05:21] <WindowsBunny> niconii: It can be argued that not having an omniscient God to punish you for all your otherwise unnoticed bad actions gives you more leeway to do bad things
[10:06:08] <eddyb> punish? lol no that would be too easy
[10:06:31] <eddyb> humans could be conditioned into righteousness by that
[10:07:09] <WindowsBunny> eddyb: Remember that in being selfish, actions can be avoided due to the unpleasantness of the guilty feeling
[10:07:23] <eddyb> what you get is a backlog of guilt
[10:07:28] <eddyb> WindowsBunny: yeah
[10:07:58] <WindowsBunny> also, classical conditioning, do bad thing get punished
[10:08:18] <eddyb> it's actually a bit more devious without instant punishment
[10:08:44] <eddyb> but, meh

[10:10:13] <eddyb> WindowsBunny: "typical"?
[10:10:59] <eddyb> the "problem" is that morality becomes fluid and that's dangerous on the short term

[12:29:05] <eddyb_> Quxxy: the lack of information implies it's bound to a context
[12:29:05] <Quxxy> The docs don't say whether or not the things it's creating are even necessarily related to the original thing
[12:29:23] *** Quits: erickt (erickt@moz-njt.vqi.14.76.IP) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[12:29:32] <eddyb_> in LLVM at least, that's *kinda* how it works
[12:30:56] <Quxxy> eddyb_: I can only work with what I know, or what's documented
[12:31:17] <Quxxy> I mean, you can apparently summon cursors out of thin air; what lifetime are *those* bound to?
[12:31:29] <Quxxy> ... 'static; stupid question
[12:32:08] <eddyb_> we should start using lifetimes to avoid ending up with values from one function in another - or worse, values from one module in another, because the latter case is parallel
[12:32:14] <eddyb_> Quxxy: ehm wat?
[12:32:25] <eddyb_> how about you read the source :P?
[12:32:40] <Quxxy> eddyb_: To be blunt: *fuck that*
[12:32:52] *** Joins: bjz (bjz@moz-pl4g2k.tpgi.com.au)
[12:32:58] <eddyb_> cursors sound like you own them
[12:32:59] <Quxxy> This is already a couple of levels down the rabbit hole
[12:33:12] <eddyb_> instead of being owned by a context
[12:33:16] <Quxxy> If I have to understand libclang just to use the bloody cindex API, I give up
[12:33:17] <Quxxy> I don't have time
[12:33:30] <eddyb_> understand? no
[12:33:31] <Quxxy> eddyb_: Yeah, I thought so too, until I skimmed the binding source
[12:33:44] <Quxxy> and it turns out to *maybe* contain pointers to a CXTranslationUnit
[12:33:56] <Quxxy> Which is about the point I just gave up
[12:34:00] <eddyb_> just peek at the implementation to see the ownership model
[12:34:07] <eddyb_> Quxxy: so kinda like

[12:34:15] <Quxxy> It's mostly just forwarding to different parts of the source
[12:34:19] <eddyb_> Box<Option<&'a Foo>>
[12:34:49] <eddyb_> it's still supportable in Rust
[12:35:01] <Quxxy> The problem is that I don't actually *know* that to be the case
[12:35:21] *** Parts: robertknight_ic (sid15951@moz-cjv40p.highgate.irccloud.com) ("")
[12:35:32] <eddyb_> *sigh* do you have a web view link to the source of the class?
[12:35:38] <Quxxy> Plus, cursors have four completely opaque fields that I have *no idea* what they do, except that one of them is *maybe* a CXTranslationUnit pointer
[12:35:46] <eddyb_> lol
[12:35:57] <Quxxy> No
[12:36:13] <Quxxy> I found a link to some of the methods, I think
[12:36:28] <Quxxy> But it doesn't matter because *right now* I've managed to get a translation unit which apparently doesn't *have* a cursor, which I thought was impossible
[12:36:32] <eddyb_> I would just download the source and open it in KDevelop
[12:37:04] <Quxxy> I'm just trying to port some Python code *sobs*
[12:37:33] <eddyb_> bad idea, Python doesn't have RAII. although, I'm not so sure about that
[12:37:41] <Quxxy> It has refcounting
[12:37:42] <eddyb_> given the whole "RC is GC" deal
[12:37:43] <Quxxy> But it's OK
[12:37:57] <Quxxy> Because the clang Python binding crashes if you let an object get deleted too soon
[12:38:03] <eddyb_> destructors/finalizer is what I mean
[12:38:07] <Quxxy> So you *already* have to write RAII-correct code
[12:38:11] <eddyb_> lol
[12:38:22] <Quxxy> Even the *official* Python binding is broken
[12:39:20] <eddyb_> I wonder if kdevelop5 is in NixOS. kinda doubt it though
[12:40:40] <eddyb_> yeah, still only 4.7.1
[12:41:08] <Quxxy> I'm on Windows, so I'd have to spin up VS
[12:41:22] <Quxxy> Not even sure which one is properly installed...
[12:42:45] <Quxxy> Though it doesn't make much difference if I can't work out why this is apparently just not doing what it's supposed to
[12:57:34] <Quxxy> Answer: I am apparently too wound up to be doing this properly; == instead of !=

[23:34:27] <eddyb> "There is Adam and Eve not Adam and Steve."
[23:35:16] <niconii> eddyb: they're still saying that old line?
[23:35:26] <eddyb> ikr, such creativity
[23:36:38] <Elaine> I'm not sure why what the creation myth has to do with marriage, marriage didn't even exist in Adam and Eve's time.

[23:39:19] <aatch> Ohhh. Elaine == cmr. I am notably less confused now.
[23:39:26] <Elaine> I even said that earlier!
[23:39:42] <fkaa> oh
[23:39:44] <aatch> Elaine, doesn't mean I saw it.

[23:40:35] <eddyb> wat
[23:41:12] <aatch> Elaine, I completely missed that.
[23:41:14] <eddyb> I must've went to the kitchen for that bit
[23:41:24] <eddyb> or took a nap
[23:41:55] <eddyb> Elaine: now why would you do that?
[23:42:07] <Elaine> Reasons.
[23:42:10] <eddyb> now I have to retroactively link up anything you've said to cmr
[23:42:26] <Elaine> You could not, if you wish.
[23:42:35] <Elaine> :P
