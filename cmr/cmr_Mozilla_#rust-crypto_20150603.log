[06:45:17] <bascule> your draft doesn't fix the real world, it makes things worse
[06:46:04] <bascule> if you are actually dealing with the same real-world problem I am, perhaps you can tell me if the client aborts before or after ClientHello

[06:52:01] <bascule> ok I'm wrong
[06:53:58] <bascule> so I meant ClientKeyExchange but...
[07:01:10] <bascule> Ilari: so like
[07:01:14] <bascule> you get what's happening, right?
[07:01:18] <bascule> Logjam happened
[07:01:26] <bascule> people are therefore trying to use stronger DHE keys

[07:17:15] <bascule> do you agree
[07:17:22] <bascule> shit shouldn't break without good reasons?
[07:17:28] <bascule> this is fucking nonsense

[07:18:13] <bascule> why the hell are people trying to shore it up besides mental mastubation?

[07:18:22] <bascule> I want it to die ina  fire
[07:18:28] <bascule> diediedie
[07:19:45] <bascule> then there's prefixing statements with things like "as it was pointed out many times"

[07:20:47] <bascule> re: https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/tls/current/msg16620.html
[07:23:21] <bascule> the way I see it, there's two options
[07:23:25] <bascule> 1) double down
[07:23:28] <bascule> 2) diediedie
[07:23:32] <bascule> why would we pick #1?

[07:24:20] <bascule> kmc: <3 network and yeah kinda, lol
[07:24:31] <bascule> I just want things to stop breaking
[07:24:47] <bascule> also TLS already has a lot of baggage
[07:25:00] <bascule> people have crazy ideas of how to fix that problem
[07:25:13] <kmc> yeah i am a little scared
[07:25:19] <bascule> but here I'm like... here's a tangible thing which is breaking TLS handshakes and we can fix it by shutting the feature "off"
[07:25:23] <kmc> it sounds like TLS 1.3 has some good ideas but could also go off the rails at any moment
[07:25:27] <bascule> err, sorry
[07:25:29] <bascule> I meant to say
[07:25:31] <bascule> "feature"
[07:25:50] <bascule> heh yeah exactly
[07:25:57] <bascule> I feel like this is the time to complain
[07:26:27] <bascule> get the proverbial train back on the rails if you can
[07:26:51] <bascule> the CFRG's poll results have been relatively uncontroversial from my perspective (lately, since they started doing polls)
[07:29:01] <bascule> I just get paid to make sure the ciphertext flows
[07:29:13] <bascule> and to me more knobs and frobs are enemies of keeping things from breaking
[07:29:55] <bascule> I am curious to hear if someone tells me a better JCE provider could fix my finite field D-H problem
[07:29:59] <bascule> because like
[07:30:10] <Ilari> kmc: Agreed.
[07:30:12] <bascule> yeah or I could use BouncyCastle and at least use the NIST curves for key exchange
[07:30:20] <bascule> Ilari: am I off-base here?
[07:30:28] <bascule> things are breaking
[07:30:52] <Ilari> Just disable all discrete/field key exchanges then?
[07:31:04] <bascule> but the problem is
[07:31:12] <bascule> that's knowledge that needs to be distributed to people
[07:31:18] <bascule> and yeah, I agree
[07:31:20] <bascule> the answer is shut it off
[07:31:32] <bascule> and if the answer is shut it off, then it should diediedie imo

[07:39:27] <bascule> or just people who put crypto-fundamentalism ahead of practical, usable cryptography
[07:40:06] <bascule> we should build the most secure system possible, no excuses! (what's usability?)

[16:37:54] <bascule> I think the most annoying thread is "I bet everyone is going to say that we need DHE in case of some ECC disaster" and then everyone repatedly proceeded to do that
[16:38:03] <bascule> most annoying *part of that thread
[16:38:42] <bascule> never mind that in the unlikely event those crypto-boogiemen come to get us, we can just... switch to RSA key exchange
[16:39:07] <Ilari> Well, there are diverse enough ECC groups in TLS already, that anything that takes them all out at once almost certaily take entiere ECC out.
[16:39:59] <Ilari> From NIST curves to brainpool/koblitz(sp?), from prime to binary.
[16:41:08] <bascule> what if it takes out DLP-based public key cryptosystems in general?! :o
[16:41:20] <bascule> uhoh, then we *have* to go back to RSA!
[16:41:37] <Ilari> Except anything that takes out DHE will very likely take out RSA too.
[16:41:44] <bascule> yep
[16:42:02] <bascule> how about instead of playing the what if game, we worry about the things that are breaking TLS today?
[16:42:24] <bascule> like too many options and legacy options that nobody uses causing real-world security problems and breakages today
[16:45:55] <Ilari> Why there isn't diediedie docs for all sorts of completely insecure codepoints in TLS?
[16:49:20] <Ilari> Complete with MNI on those.
[16:53:03] <bascule> hahaha

[16:55:40] <bascule> hahaha
[16:58:48] <Ilari> Also, wonder how long it will take to make TLS that isn't insecure. I think it is either this year or when hell freezes over. :->
[17:06:02] <Tiffany> how much can/will they change in TLS between each version?
[17:06:13] <Tiffany> like, the protocol compatibility has been broken, right?
[17:14:41] <Ilari> Tiffany: Well, TLS 1.3-latest is very different from TLS 1.2 (but downnegotiation is possible).
[17:15:23] <Tiffany> I don't suppose they'd be willing to ditch some of the ridiculous complexities like ASN.1 and X.509
[17:17:44] <bascule> lolololol
[17:17:53] <bascule> Tiffany: step one: what to replace ASN.1 with? :|
[17:18:06] <Tiffany> well, I'm biased towards capn proto
[17:18:14] <bascule> haha, me too, however...
[17:18:23] <Tiffany> not standardized
[17:18:34] <bascule> we get to the part where Cap'n Proto messages are large
[17:18:41] <Tiffany> are they?
[17:18:46] <bascule> relatively, yes
[17:19:18] <bascule> while it doesn't bother me, I'd expect someone would propose a PER-style condensed Cap'n Proto format
[17:19:24] <bascule> and then we're already back in the same mess, heh
[17:19:41] <bascule> but yes I definitely agree Cap'n Proto is better than ASN.1
[17:20:18] <Tiffany> I tried to use ASN.1 once
[17:20:21] <bascule> unfortunately the way the wind is blowing people will probably want to use JOSE instead o_O
[17:20:35] <Tiffany> I found all the documentation extremely grating to work through, since it's written in that telecommunications style that the ITU just loves
[17:20:52] <Tiffany> and all the implementations are huge bloated contraptions which I couldn't figure out how to operate
[17:21:02] <bascule> X.500 is the root of all evil :(
[17:21:33] <bascule> or should I say, the root of the DIT of all evil ;)

[17:23:29] <kmc> bascule: just gzip them >_>
[17:23:55] <Tiffany> I'm wondering how capn proto is larger than other formats
[17:24:03] <Tiffany> pointers are pretty big, I suppose
[17:24:27] <Tiffany> there isn't much wasted space since struct fields are always reorganized to optimize padding and there's never more than 63 bits of padding
[17:24:41] <Tiffany> in a single struct, that is
[17:24:50] <Tiffany> how complex is the data schema for TLS?
[17:25:01] <Tiffany> I think that if you have a simple schema the overhead for capn proto is low
[17:25:49] <bascule> Tiffany: Cap'n Proto messages are full of zero padding
[17:25:58] <Tiffany> capn proto doesn't have any of that silly integer compression that other formats love to use though
[17:26:11] <bascule> yeah
[17:26:23] <Tiffany> so there's lots of zero bits in messages
[17:26:31] <Tiffany> but it's not padding
[17:27:04] <Tiffany> I suppose you could create messages majorly composed of padding
[17:27:20] <Tiffany> but it's pretty far in the land of pathological cases
[17:27:46] <Tiffany> for example, making a struct that consists of a single bool value, and then making a list of that
[17:28:24] <bascule> well, call it what you want, it's wasted space
[17:28:24] <Tiffany> afaik, that would be 1 bit of data followed by 63 bits of padding
[17:28:24] <Tiffany> whereas a list of a regular bool would be tightly packed
[17:28:24] <bascule> I guess Cap'n Proto has a packed format already, my bad
[17:28:24] <Tiffany> huh, it does?
[17:28:35] <bascule> according to capnproto.org
[17:28:36] <Tiffany> ah
[17:28:41] <Tiffany> yeah, the section on the encoding page
[17:29:03] <Tiffany> simple run-length encoding looks like
[17:30:46] <Tiffany> oh, no it's fancier than that
[17:30:52] <Tiffany> but it's still very simple
[17:50:08] <Ilari> Heh, the few signature prototypes I cooked up used CBOR to encode stuff. :-)

[18:33:49] <bascule> then I proceeded to receive a bunch of responses to the effect of "We need this because [the ECC boogieman will get us]"
[18:34:53] <bascule> some disaster that only works on ECC and not DLP in general, therefore... added complexity in advance

[18:35:05] <bascule> I just hope the extra baggage doesn't lead to security issues for everyone who isn't using it

[22:08:21] <eternaleye> Tiffany: Crypto being classified is why "export-grade crypto" exists, because exporting military equipment.
[22:08:29] <Tiffany> the current export rules are stricter than I thought they were
[22:08:37] <eternaleye> Tiffany: Like stripping the weapons off of F-15s before selling to civilians.
[22:09:00] <Tiffany> are they not enforced very strictly, or does it all happen in the background?
[22:09:09] <Tiffany> you're supposed to notify the BIS before publishing open source cryptographic software
[22:09:20] <Tiffany> you have to get review for crypto systems with more than 64 bit keys
[22:09:50] <Tiffany> you can't export to terrorist countries, but I assume that doesn't apply to, for example, publishing something on the internet
[22:09:56] <eternaleye> Tiffany: See DJB vs. USA
[22:09:57] <Tiffany> but rather actively selling a product to such countries
[22:10:04] <Tiffany> yeah, I linked that
[22:10:18] <Tiffany> I have hits website on the matter open
[22:10:22] <eternaleye> Tiffany: Well, you're using the present tense.
[22:10:26] <eternaleye> "are they not"
[22:10:35] <eternaleye> Tiffany: That case is why it's not a thing now.

[22:10:50] <Tiffany> the wikipedia page says there are still export rules, actually
[22:11:02] <Tiffany> that case just killed ITER
[22:11:19] <Tiffany> it was replaced by EAR, which was then neutered by further lawsuits, and I think that's what we have now
[22:15:46] <Tiffany> are there details on snuffle 5.0 anywhere?
[22:15:51] <Tiffany> I can't find the original thing
[22:15:56] <Tiffany> only snufle 2005 aka salsa20
[22:18:03] <Tiffany> I found a wiki page giving a summary of it
[22:18:30] <Tiffany> it works exactly how I expected
[22:18:58] <Tiffany> ironically the article states that the source code is widely available on the internet...
[22:21:01] <Tiffany> aha, I found it
[22:21:10] <Tiffany> https://marc.info/?l=cypherpunks&m=95279178020685&w=2
[22:27:33] <Tiffany> there's more noise than I was expecting

[23:01:39] <bascule> Ilari: I think you singlehandedly convinced me FFDHE is a good idea
[23:02:00] <Tiffany> I wonder what all this stuff that this code does is for
[23:02:05] <bascule> as opposed to everyone who asked me "Have you thought about what might happen if there's an ECCpocalypse?"
[23:02:08] <Tiffany> why is x 9..63?
[23:02:20] <Tiffany> what's with these random addition and subtraction of constants?
[23:02:24] <bascule> when my very.first.post was "I know you're going to ask 'Have you thought about what might happen if there's an ECCpocalypse?'"
[23:02:27] <bascule> and I'm like
[23:02:28] <bascule> this is inception
[23:02:34] <bascule> not only have I thought about that
[23:02:39] <bascule> I thought that you might think that
[23:02:43] <bascule> and try to be pedantic about it
[23:02:48] <bascule> so I called it out in advance
[23:02:51] <Tiffany> in fact, I don't really understand why this is so complicated at all
[23:02:52] <bascule> and yet you did it anyway
[23:02:53] <bascule> o_O
[23:03:01] <bascule> at that point, I'm not having a conversation
[23:03:11] <Tiffany> had counter mode not become widespread yet?
[23:03:23] <Ilari> bascule: And well, if ECC turns out to b broken, FFDHE probably has been broken before that.
[23:03:30] <bascule> "I think X. I think you're going to say 'Have you thought about Y?'" "Have you thought about Y?"
[23:03:39] <bascule> YES. YES I HAVE.
[23:03:56] <bascule> Ilari: so like
[23:04:00] <bascule> this is key exhange
[23:04:01] <bascule> but
[23:04:03] <Tiffany> it looks like counter mode has been known since at least 1983?
[23:04:04] <bascule> if ECC is broken
[23:04:07] <bascule> and we're using ECC certs
[23:04:12] <bascule> how do we sign ephemeral FFDHE keys?
[23:04:31] <bascule> ddo we hope for a magical breaks-all-curves-ECC-vuln that *only* works against ECDH but not signatures?
[23:04:59] <bascule> or do we just also grab RSA certificates
[23:05:01] <Tiffany> are we using ECC certs?
[23:05:01] <bascule> just in case
[23:05:05] <Ilari> Are there any known curves where breaking ECDH is doable but not breaking signatures?
[23:05:06] <Tiffany> I thought everyone was using RSA certs still
[23:05:08] <bascule> Tiffany: seems like a reasonable goal?
[23:05:12] <Tiffany> oh
[23:05:16] <bascule> Ilari: I don't know
[23:05:18] <bascule> I'm just like
[23:05:27] <bascule> "We need FFDHE to defend against hypothetical pie-in-the-sky attacks"
[23:05:44] <bascule> I'm just like
[23:06:06] <bascule> if those attacks actually happened, are you actually wasting everyone's time on a backup plan that will actually work?
[23:06:14] <bascule> I don't think FFDHE is entirely unreasonabler
[23:06:17] <bascule> -r
[23:06:25] <Tiffany> why does snuffle 5.0 bother with all this nonsense if you can just hash the key, nonce, and block position together and xor?
[23:06:28] <bascule> I think the motivation is ill-considered
[23:06:31] <Ilari> There certainly are curves where deciding if four given numbers are (G,xG,yG,xyG) is feasoble, but solving for xyG from xG, yG and G is hard.
[23:06:34] <Tiffany> maybe they're red herrings
[23:06:54] *** Joins: adu (ajr@moz-0foa9t.md.comcast.net)
[23:07:17] <bascule> if we're using ECC for both key exchange and signatures, and there's a catastrophic breaks-all-curves ECC vuln, what do we do then?
[23:07:21] *** Quits: brson (brson@moz-cfhap5.mtv2.mozilla.com) (Quit: leaving)
[23:07:37] <bascule> there *might* be cases where ECDH is broken but FFDH is not
[23:07:48] <bascule> but how do we authenticate FFDH keys in that case?
[23:09:01] <Ilari> RSA? :->
[23:09:06] <bascule> :D
[23:09:14] <bascule> sure, everyone grab an RSA cert too
[23:10:39] <Ilari> And then there is possibility of ECC vuln that gets almost all curves, except very few.
[23:11:20] <bascule> I would be terribly unsurprised by attacks that work against the NIST curves and not e.g. Curve25519
[23:11:39] <bascule> but that's not the ECCpocalypse these people want to plan for
[23:12:08] <bascule> perhaps this is a question for the CFRG and not the TLS mailing list
[23:12:16] <bascule> because the answers I've received have just made me angry
[23:12:34] <Ilari> I consider the most likely scenarios with new ECC attack: 1) Breaks very few curves. 2) Breaks almost everything. 3) Breaks absolutely everything.
[23:12:44] <bascule> because people are saying the thing I already predicted they would say, pedantically, apparently not reading my email where I said "this is what I expected you would say" then you said it, as if I didn't know
[23:12:58] <bascule> if I predicted what you thought you could teach me in advance I FUCKING KNOW, GODDAMN IT
[23:13:33] <bascule> perhaps I just need to troll harder
[23:14:20] <bascule> and be like "If you attempt to educate me about FFDH as a fallback for an ECCpocalypse, you will receive a response to the effect of 'Congratulations, you get a cookie for being a moron.' If you read this block of text, you will understand why."
[23:14:32] <Ilari> And all three either break both P-256 and Curve25519 or neither.
[23:14:56] <bascule> Ilari: if you break absolutely everything, you will break signatures
[23:15:07] <bascule> and thus the whole handshake
[23:15:15] <Ilari> FFDHE can't be abused like arbitrary-group DH.
[23:15:27] <bascule> FFDHE seems... reasonably sane
[23:16:12] <Tiffany> presenting blocks of text to read is pretty hard on twitter though
[23:16:29] <bascule> technical arguments on Twitter are a great way to leave everyone frustrated
[23:16:37] <bascule> I'd say the same thing about email here
[23:16:57] <Ilari> The reason is that arbitrary-group DH can't enforce safety, even if one sent q and quickly checkable prime proofs for q and p.
[23:17:13] <bascule> I can't even prefix an argument with "I have opinion X which is disjoint from argument Y which I predict you'll tell me anyway, because Z"
[23:17:23] <bascule> responder A: "Do you know about argument Y?"
[23:17:32] <bascule> responder B: "Do you know about argument Y?"
[23:17:59] <bascule> literally happened in that thread
[23:18:47] <Ilari> Well, in complexity theory sense, primality is "quickly" decidable even without certificates. :->
[23:18:53] <bascule> first message in thread: <me> I expect the response is going to be "What if there's some catastrophic failure of ECC?
[23:19:30] <bascule> response: " Removing the negotiation option means there there will
[23:19:31] <bascule> be no backup at all in case of a flaw in the existing ECDHE
[23:19:32] <bascule> ciphersuites."
[23:19:38] <Tiffany> at least email lets you write in long form
[23:19:53] <Tiffany> even if people will stop at the first sentence to write their reply
[23:20:13] <bascule> another response "People want a backup to deal with mistrust of ECC curves and general paranoia.
[23:20:24] <Ilari> Heh, I was once asked how long an email can be. :-)
[23:20:40] <Ilari> As in, technically.
[23:20:46] <Tiffany> oh
[23:21:13] <Tiffany> I thought you were talking about someone who had grown up only knowing services like twitter (140), SMS (160), facebook (400? I don't remember), youtube (400, also don't remember)
[23:21:52] <bascule> Tiffany: I agree email is a better forum for long-form communication, but that doesn't help if people don't actually read what you're saying :|
[23:22:08] <Tiffany> I actually rarely use email
[23:22:16] * bascule uses email a lot
[23:22:23] <Tiffany> maybe I'll start using it more now that I'm getting into cryptography
[23:22:29] <Tiffany> seeing how it's the predominant form of communication
[23:22:48] <Ilari> IIRC, my answer was essentially hundreds of pages worth of text or something ridiculous like that.
[23:22:51] <Tiffany> email with latex markup is probably the optimal way to communicate for mathy fields
[23:22:58] <eternaleye> Ilari: Did you give them the full, sanity-breaking multiple-choice explanation, about "Well, first you need to know whether your mail client and the intermediary MTAs support 8bitmime, then you check for how long the standard escape sequence on your mailer is, then..."
[23:23:10] <eternaleye> Ilari: "Then you give up and drink. Heavily."
[23:23:39] <Tiffany> oh god
[23:23:46] <Tiffany> I always forget how horrifying email is as a protocol
[23:23:51] <Tiffany> or set of protocols
[23:24:04] <Tiffany> standard, that is the word I am looking for
[23:26:01] <Ilari> I think there should be at least brief look (checking technical feasibility) at integrating SIDH and RLWE to TLS 1.3.
[23:29:07] <bascule> Ilari: well, there we go
[23:29:10] <bascule> escalate to CFRG
[23:29:10] <bascule> heh
[23:30:51] <Ilari> Quick estimate: Both look possible to integrate without too much trouble.
[23:33:06] <bascule> yeah like
[23:33:15] <bascule> Ivan Ristic told me "you're not thinking 10 years out"
[23:33:19] <bascule> o_O
[23:33:33] <bascule> Ilari: RWLE is more aligned with that sort of perspective
[23:33:51] <bascule> we need finite field Diffie-Hellman, for the FUTURE
[23:34:27] <bascule> call me crazy, but I don't think it's unreasonable to expect there will be large quantum computers which can solve factoring and DLP quickly in 10 years
[23:34:50] <bascule> in the year 2025
[23:34:54] <bascule> if mankind is still alive
[23:35:32] <Ilari> Presumably QC large enough to solve practical DLPs would also utterly screw over ECC.
[23:35:46] <bascule> yup
