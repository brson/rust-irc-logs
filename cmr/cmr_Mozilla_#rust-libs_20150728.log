[19:36:10] <bluss> we still want to say [breaking-change] for any technical and minor breaking changes, right?
[19:36:23] <bluss> on the topic of Clone for Box<[T]> by reem https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/26934
[19:36:49] <reem> Oh?
[19:36:50] <bluss> oh neat, the second I say that, bors picks it up for testing..
[19:37:16] <bluss> reem: I'm not 100% sure
[19:37:19] <bluss> so I ask
[19:37:42] <reem> Have to check if to_owned now gets you another Box
[19:38:00] <bluss> it should. I didn't compile your PR but
[19:40:34] <bluss> aturon: should we say [breaking-change] in commit logs for minor changes?
[19:53:41] <aturon> bluss: i believe we're still flagging, yes; these should also be tagged `relnotes`

[22:42:06] <acrichto> Gankro: is there an outstanding issue on stabilizing drain() ?
[22:42:16] <acrichto> not in the repo, just conceptually
[22:42:34] <Gankro> acrichto: yes, I've basically punted it to "bluss's got this"
[22:42:46] <Gankro> oh sorry
[22:42:48] <Gankro> Uh
[22:43:10] <Gankro> the issue is the thing that Vec::drain accepts, as well as uniform interfaces (HashMap, BTree, etc)
[22:43:22] <bluss> oh no
[22:43:27] <bluss> hehe well then
[22:43:37] <Gankro> I personally think we should just go forward with only Vec and HashMap, and punt the rest to later
[22:43:50] <Gankro> Maybe VecDeque if that's already impl'd
[22:43:52] <acrichto> that involves answering the question though, right?
[22:43:59] <acrichto> b/c HashMap wants nothing but Vec wants IntoRange
[22:44:01] <acrichto> or something like that
[22:44:10] <Gankro> acrichto: Yeah, BTreeMap is the hard case though
[22:44:13] <Gankro> IMO
[22:44:15] <bluss> messy notes on drain https://gist.github.com/bluss/3d59e8aa5226c8b9ff57
[22:44:36] <bluss> I think hashmap should have .drain() and vec has .drain<R: RangeArgument>(R)
[22:44:49] <Gankro> bluss: agreed
[22:44:55] <Gankro> I wouldn't impl drain for linked-list
[22:45:02] <Gankro> We don't ever support indexing a linked list
[22:45:11] <bluss> um we have split_at
[22:45:16] <Gankro> Shit
[22:45:17] <bluss> that's indexing just as much as this is
[22:45:31] <Gankro> That's unstable? :P
[22:45:41] <Gankro> But servo wants it
[22:45:52] <bluss> split_off is stable
[22:46:13] <Gankro> I think aturon argued for no indexing and I argued for it in the past, so I don't have a lot of skin in this game ;)
[22:46:22] <bluss> anyway, drain-range for linkedlist is simple to define what it should do and it's O(n)
[22:46:41] <bluss> Gankro: you removed my merge for linkedlist!
[22:46:52] <bluss> anyway, those are old sins
[22:47:33] <bluss> BTreeMap: should have drain but it should have whatever arguments that range has
[22:47:40] <bluss> BTreeMap::range
[22:48:55] <Gankro> bluss: I'm still keen on iter_mut().le(0).gt(5).drain()
[22:50:14] <Gankro> got those backwards
[22:50:43] <bluss> not good
[22:50:51] <bluss> not a good argument for this syntax :)
[22:51:20] <bluss> so why isn't range syntax good for this?
[22:51:23] <Gankro> bluss: I'm in the middle of a meeting joking about ()...() right now, so I'm not paying a lot of attention :)
[22:51:36] <Gankro> bluss: I don't like passing in enums as args
[22:52:24] * bluss wants to know the joke about ()...()
[22:52:32] <bluss> ask them about {}..{}
[22:52:53] <Gankro> bluss: You can eliminate the need for a bool in rangeinclusive by forbidding unit...unit from working
[22:53:41] <bluss> that's a damn riddle, not a joke
[22:53:48] <Gankro> haha
[22:53:52] <bluss> hey pay attention to your meeting, don't mind me
[22:54:46] <Gankro> bluss: basically we had just degenerated into supporting ()...() with TLS<Refcell<bool>>, where making two ()...()'s in the same thread panics :P
[22:55:07] <bluss> o_O
[22:56:25] <bluss> in hindsight, IntoIterator would have been better for the ranges
[23:00:08] *** Quits: gleb (gleb@moz-3u1drv.rusanovka-net.kiev.ua) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[23:03:30] <Gankro> bluss: (x...y).blah() working is nice
[23:03:42] <bluss> it is
[23:03:55] <bluss> (x..) not really working is so so
[23:05:47] <bluss> (0i8..).take(128).last()
[23:07:21] <bluss> acrichto: did you imagine that .drain would be a trait method?
[23:08:00] <acrichto> bluss: didn't imagine much, just trying to clean out unstable things
[23:08:35] <bluss> ok
[23:10:28] <Gankro> bluss: fine if the DrainRangeArgs or whatever trait is unstable still?
[23:11:15] <bluss> Gankro: it would be fine, but I think we could just let it stabilize
[23:11:43] <Gankro> It feels weird to let people overload it. I dunno
[23:11:56] <bluss> Gankro: as it is now, it seems to work
[23:11:59] <bluss> oh that's a good point
[23:12:21] <bluss> I'd like to stabilize it to use in all third party libraries that use ranges in their APIs
[23:12:27] <Gankro> Yeah unstable is basically our weapon for "can't implement"
[23:12:30] <Gankro> Ah I see
[23:12:34] <bluss> so have the trait to bound on it, not implement it
[23:13:11] <bluss> but. It can't be stabilized until we know more about inclusive ranges..
