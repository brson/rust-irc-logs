[00:02:16] <Ilari> There probably are N variations of D-H, and only a few are secure. Reminds me of generic composition with ivEnc (8-12 out of 160 ways are secure) and nEnc (3-4 out of 20 ways are secure).

[00:30:49] <Ilari> I hope it won't be fireworks on the magnitude of RTCWeb a few IETFs back when they tried to agree about video codecs.
[00:31:11] <bascule> Ilari: he wants to eliminate the extra RTT
[00:33:39] <Ilari> For eliminating the extra RTT, you need to be able to have server send the correct key and auxillary data for it (certificate) in its first flight.
[00:55:34] <Ilari> Heh, reminds me that browsers even skip some TLS safety checks for speed (albeit introduce extra requirements for that in the process).
[00:58:48] *** Quits: brson (brson@moz-o67.m43.48.37.IP) (Quit: leaving)
[00:59:16] <eternaleye> Ilari: Why would there be an extra RTT? You already have some kind of shared secret; if there's any kind of extractor that gives enough bits then you can do a binding from that.
[00:59:18] <Ilari> Browsers is another place to look for proper screwed security practices.
[01:02:16] <bascule> Ilari: so I brought the Cap'n Proto "0RTT" case up to Trevor Perrin
[01:02:16] <Ilari> And X.509... The whole attitude there is completely incompatible with any sort of real security.
[01:02:20] <bascule> and he's trying to support it
[01:02:29] <bascule> it's the same use case as Axolotl, just interpreted slightly differently
[01:02:42] <Ilari> Well, I'm talking about 1RTT to a new server.
[01:02:46] <bascule> you have an introducer and you want to create a session which is known by the session principals but not the introducer
[01:02:53] <bascule> yeah Noise 1.0 already did that
[01:03:53] <Ilari> BTW, which you think is cryptowise better, SSH2 or TLS 1.2? :-)
[01:05:30] <bascule> hahahahahaha
[01:05:40] <bascule> depends if it's for remote shell sessions or browsers? ;)
[01:05:50] <bascule> but tl;dr: they both suck
[01:06:03] <oakwhiz> httpssh://
[01:06:34] <Ilari> Both may suck, but I think SSH2 is cryptowise better.
[01:07:05] <Ilari> Of course, SSH2 has its own serious problems.
[01:10:33] <Ilari> Wonder what JOSE bugs there are to irresponsibly disclose? :->
[01:17:09] <Ilari> Also, I suppose one really wouldn't want to make a page similar to that DNSSEC outages page but for PKIX. Wonder if browsers would even be able to load it without crashing.
[01:18:27] <Ilari> (I have actually seen a webpage so large that browsers have major trouble with it. And it was the sheer size of text, not media resources.)

[01:32:38] <bascule> yah
[01:32:47] <bascule> Rails is looking at switching to JWTs
[01:33:45] <Ilari> Well, at least JWTs can be signed using JWS and encrypted using JWE, so there might be some actual crypto in there...

[23:01:29] <Ilari> Oh, Dan brown thinks just 448 curve should be big-endian.
[23:01:37] <bascule> hahahaha what
[23:02:03] <bascule> I don't see his response yet
[23:02:27] <Ilari> Oh, I mixed up. Dan Harkins, not Dan Brown.
[23:10:23] <Ilari> Looking up what the "good reasons" he mentioned are: Tradition, Bignums, old ECC standards...
[23:10:47] <Ilari> I don't consider any of those to be even remotely good reasons.
[23:12:43] <Ilari> So maybe number of people who prefer BE for 25519 will be 1 and number of people who prefer BE for 448 will be 2. :->
[23:18:37] <Ilari> So far that toll has seemingly been 0 and 1.
[23:29:57] <adu> Ilari: lol
[23:30:08] <adu> LE also has tradition
[23:30:29] <adu> LE is also used in bignums
[23:32:31] <Ilari> But most "crypto" libs that have bignums do octet-encoding in big-endian.
[23:49:49] <bascule> Ilari: this poll seems to be going well otherwise
[23:52:15] <Ilari> Yeah.
[23:52:46] <bascule> I need to do another CFRG comic
[23:53:05] <bascule> "little endian" "big endian" ... "BOTH"
[23:53:31] <bascule> should totally compromise and make everyone happy by using mixed endian
[23:53:50] <mcpherrin> random bit order
[23:53:53] <bascule> lol
[23:53:59] <bascule> it'll trick the attackers!
[23:54:06] <Ilari> Also, I think the "PKIX is big endian" only holds if one is using ECDSA. And doing ECDSA with either of the curves is pretty horrifying to implement.
[23:54:43] <bascule> but small minds are haunted by a hobgoblin called foolish consistency!
[23:54:45] <adu> pdp-endian
[23:54:48] <bascule> heh
[23:55:16] <adu> it should be an S-box
[23:55:22] <adu> definitely
