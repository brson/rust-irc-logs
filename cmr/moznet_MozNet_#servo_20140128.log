[05:49:31] <hyunjunekim> jdm: Hi :)
[05:49:31] <pcwalton> there's no real reason I don't think. if you measure a performance improvement with making it a flat list then feel free to do that...
[05:49:36] <jdm> hi!
[05:49:48] <pcwalton> but we will need to keep in mind parallelism of course, we do eventually want to construct the display list in parallel
[05:50:16] <pradeep> yeah, because stacking contexts will be difficult to implement with ClipDisplayItem
[05:50:37] <sammykim> jdm: we(hyunjune and I) looked into firefox code since we had a video call. But we couldn't find why we need to implement Rust event handler for DOM elements. As we found, as long as we can get event, we can find the object from display_list hittest. And from that, I think we can restyle too.
[05:51:56] <pradeep> The DisplayItems in the ClipDisplayItem may be painted in a different order and we would need to keep track of the different layers for each ClipDisplayItem as well as for each StackingContext
[05:52:54] <jdm> sammykim: even if it's possible to make hover work without using real DOM events, we need the work anyways
[05:52:58] <jdm> so we might as well do it
[05:52:59] <pradeep> which would be a whole lot of display lists, when we really only need the start and end of the Clip.
[05:53:04] * jdm checks with smaug about the reasoning
[05:53:35] <jdm> sammykim: I mean, we need to support mouse move events eventually
[05:54:07] <jdm> so there's no reason not to implement them now along with hover support

[05:55:16] <hyunjunekim> jdm: I think that to use quard tree for hit test! and get to element!
[05:55:20] <hyunjunekim> jdm: right?
[05:55:36] <sammykim> jdm: I see, Even though we can do it without DOM event, It's not right way.
[05:55:46] <sammykim> I understand.
[05:55:54] <jdm> getting to the element is part of it
[05:56:27] <jdm> the dom event is necessary for page events like mouse move
[05:56:33] <sammykim> I consider the issue is getting event. ..
[05:57:14] <sammykim> I see, then every event has to come from dom event? or some others come from other way?
[05:57:32] <jdm> at minimum, any event that the page can cancel comes from dom events
[05:57:40] <jdm> for example, the page can cancel mouse clicks
[05:57:54] <jdm> so we need to change those to use dom events instead of just the current hit test
[06:00:50] *** Quits: ^emi (glenlivet@moz-9FE842F.cpe.net.cable.rogers.com) (Ping timeout)
[06:00:52] <sammykim> Is the hittest only for getting object? 
[06:01:42] <sammykim> Whenever we get event from dom event, then at the same time we have to know which object was hover or clicked , any other event.
[06:02:23] <sammykim> Then do we need to use hittest with the event or any other ways to do it efficient?
[06:04:07] <jdm> sammykim: I believe you can use a hittest to find the node on which to dispatch the dom event
[06:04:28] <jdm> then the event bubbles up and down the tree

[06:08:48] <hyunjunekim> jdm: I dont understand for case which are cancel evnet! If I will implemnet hover, after getting mouse point, could have hittest using quard tree! and get the target element!
[06:09:11] <jdm> hyunjunekim: so, I don't know of any way to cancel hover.
[06:09:52] <jdm> hyunjunekim: however, a page can cancel the network request if the user clicks on a link (using onclick)
[06:10:09] <jdm> we need to implement proper dom event handling for mouse clicks
[06:10:30] <jdm> we might as well use the same infrastructure to add hover support
[06:10:53] <jdm> because we will need to dispatch mousemove events anyways

[06:20:48] <sammykim> I want to clarify more. Do you consider why we have to implement dom event is that if we use another event glfw or any other, then events comes from two ways, one is glfw, other is DOM event, then does this make synchronization problem?
[06:21:44] *** Joins: dbaron (dbaron@moz-104CC309.mv.mozilla.com)
[06:22:02] <jdm> I don't think there is a synchronization problem
[06:22:11] <jdm> the compositor receives the glfw events
[06:22:51] <jdm> it instructs the correct pipeline to handle a mouse event
[06:22:56] <sammykim> Then Why is it important that which event we use?

[06:30:03] <SimonSapin> jack: correction from what I said earlier: 'position: marker' is not actually based on absolute positioning
[06:30:16] <SimonSapin> at least not anymore, in the latest draft
[06:31:02] <SimonSapin> but that draft may be incomplete compared to what’s actually needed for the web, so we shouldn’t sweat the details yet
[06:33:34] <sammykim> jdm: What we want to implement about event handler is so that we can handle dom event with abstract interface like when we develope with android and want to do something with click event, we can just implement codes in Onclick method. Do you implement the DOM event handler to do that?
[06:35:51] <jdm> sammykim: I don't quite understand.
[06:36:07] <jdm> are you saying that you want to do something special on android in the click event?
[06:37:30] <sammykim> jdm: No. I am asking about #1527 . like observe pattern
[06:37:31] <crowbot> Issue #1527: Implement vtable support for common overriding behaviours - https://github.com/mozilla/servo/issues/1527
[06:38:42] <jdm> we want to replicate the way gecko processes DOM events
[06:39:03] <jdm> so for things like HTMLLinkElement we can have a HandleEvent method that looks for click events
[06:39:22] <jdm> and same for HTMLButtonElement

[06:42:52] <sammykim> I think the mouse event can only come from operating system. Then do we implement DOM event handler to use that event (ie. x, y point or other event) as DOM event easily?

[06:45:00] <jdm> sammykim: I'm not really sure what "use that event" means - we need to make the compositor inform the pipeline or constellation of new events, passing the important information (x, y, mouse button, etc.)
[06:45:20] <jdm> then the script task creates a new dom event and dispatches it to the target element

[06:48:48] <sammykim> "use the event" means the mouse event which comes from graphic library (ie. glfw or glut ..).
[06:50:02] <jdm> the DOM event handlers won't know anything about glfw or glut
[06:50:38] <jdm> the script task will receive a message telling it to dispatch a new DOM event with certain parameters

[21:05:56] <jack> jgraham: how do i get critic to see past a rebase done before a review started?
[21:06:01] <jack> or does it do that automatically?

[21:07:23] <jack> larsberg: well, first i need to go for a run. but yes :)
[21:10:02] <Ms2ger> jack, that doesn't sound like something it can do
[21:10:10] <jdm> git users, help!
[21:10:14] <Ms2ger> Unless I'm misunderstanding
[21:10:22] <jdm> I was in the middle of a rebase and did commit --amend instead of add

[21:10:35] <Ms2ger> Been there...
[21:10:35] <jdm> so now all the changes for the current step are part of the previous commit
[21:10:39] <Ms2ger> Burn the office down
[21:10:45] <jdm> and rebase won't continue because there are no changes present
[21:10:54] * jdm gets the matches

[21:10:57] <jack> jdm: i think this will involve the reflog.
[21:11:03] <Ms2ger> How much do you care about the rebasing you've done so far?
[21:11:08] <jack> what i'm not sure of is how you get back your working tree.
[21:11:22] <jdm> maybe I can look at the difference between the commit and the last reflog step
[21:11:33] <larsberg> Ms2ger: it appears you and I share a git strategy. confused? DELETE EVERYTHING START OVER.
[21:11:50] <jdm> NEVER SPEAK OF THIS AGAIN
[21:11:53] <jack> jdm: you can also soft reset which will bust up the current comimt
[21:11:58] <Ms2ger> larsberg, do you know why git clone is so fast?
[21:11:59] <jack> but that doesn't help you either.
[21:12:04] <jdm> yeah, current commit is empty :(
[21:12:11] <jack> i think reflog plus cherry picking from the diff is probably the easiest.

[21:12:26] <larsberg> Ms2ger: no, why?
[21:12:45] <jdm> I wonder what happens if I abort my rebase
[21:12:50] <jack> i mean you could probably just git diff FOO | patch :)
[21:12:51] <Ms2ger> larsberg, because git likes to break your repo to the point where you need to reclone

[21:13:03] <jdm> Ms2ger: optimize for the common case!
[21:13:08] <Ms2ger> Exactly!
[21:13:13] <jack> if you abort the rebase you will go back to your original branch.
[21:13:25] <jdm> that might be the best choice at this point
[21:13:57] <jack> jdm: wiat a sec :)

[21:14:58] <jdm> eff
[21:15:03] <jdm> how can I go back to my busted rebase now :)
[21:15:19] <Ms2ger> Re-base.

[21:15:44] <jdm> curse my impatience
[21:17:23] <jdm> good news folks - after the next rust upgrade, lldb should Just Work
[21:17:29] <Ms2ger> Hear, hear
[21:18:45] <strcat> jdm: acrichto just has the only working copy of lldb due to bits being flipped the right way by cosmic rays
[21:19:04] * strcat would not be so optimistic :P
[21:19:46] <larsberg> jdm: woo-hoo!
[21:20:29] <larsberg> with the last rust upgrade, at least attach and some basic breakpoints on function names seem to work, which is a huge improvement over gdb-snarfed-from-xcode-4-on-OSX
[21:21:15] <larsberg> I still get tired of "Breakpoint set -n rust_fail" instead of "b rust_fail", though. and "thread set 2" instead of "thread 2"
[21:21:52] <larsberg> my fault for having code that crashes and deadlocks, though :-)
