[00:07:34] <Peach> Ok so I'm in the depths of Abstract Syntax Trees and semantic type checking
[00:08:04] <Peach> Do you have any input on the best way to do static type checking after I inferred types Elaine ?
[00:08:14] <Elaine> Depends on the type system.
[00:08:20] <Binero> What are you writing? 
[00:08:47] <Elaine> In a simple type system you can just do equality, sometimes you'll need to do subtyping which can get icky, or casts/coercions.
[00:08:54] <Peach> And as another question - do you have a dream language design that you wish for - syntax wise, feature wise etc Elaine ?
[00:09:07] <Elaine> not really tbh

[01:37:28] <aatch> OneSadCookie, I was going to make a comment about it taking 6 years to rewrite the compiler, but 1) that's actually not unrealistic and 2) you didn't say that was *all* you did.
[01:38:02] <OneSadCookie> well, it took about 2 years from start work to ship it
[01:38:20] <OneSadCookie> including adding 140&150
[01:38:24] <aatch> OneSadCookie, sounds about right.
[01:38:26] <OneSadCookie> after that, we added 330-410 support

[02:17:39] <Peach> and any idea if Swift is intended to replace C++ and other parts of OSX toolkit?
[02:18:11] <OneSadCookie> I don't imagine Apple will have anything further to do with OpenGL, Vulkan, or OpenCL.  If they were, we'd've seen it at this year's WWDC.
[02:19:22] *** Joins: cakecatz (cakecatz@moz-u6p4rc.so-net.ne.jp)
[02:19:44] <OneSadCookie> I imagine Apple intends that eventually Swift will replace all their usage of C, C++ and Objective-C.  I can't imagine that such an event is less than 20 years away ;)
[02:19:59] <OneSadCookie> heck, the Swift compiler is written in C++ ;)
[02:21:22] <Peach> haha, honestly I'm nervous for Apple now, their quality assurance appears to be going down
[02:21:42] <Peach> I don't know if they can pull off a whole new language with minimal issue
[02:22:05] <OneSadCookie> Swift's shit.  Hasn't stopped heaps of people using it, some of them even successfully ;)
[02:22:22] <Peach> Swift's "Expression too complex" http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26550775/if-condition-failing-with-expression-too-complex
[02:22:57] <Peach> Oh I bet you have a strong opinion on Swift from a technical standpoint OneSadCookie ?
[02:23:34] <OneSadCookie> fundamentally it's rust, with s/lifetimes/refcounting/ which is less safe but more familiar to program for
[02:24:00] <OneSadCookie> I'm worried most about the type-checker
[02:24:22] <OneSadCookie> Default*LiteralConvertible seems like a dumb idea (and there's a tweet going round today with nil != nil kind of stuff which shows why)
[02:24:36] <OneSadCookie> and the "time-boxed type inference" scheme is bizarre
[02:25:14] <Peach> Any idea if QA was better when Steve Jobs was around? He probably didn't have a direct influence in low level GPU/coding stuff I suppose
[02:25:56] <Peach> QA quality assurance

[02:31:33] <Peach> I'm excited to see Swift go open source OneSadCookie, any idea how that will work?
[02:31:46] <OneSadCookie> same as webkit I guess
[02:31:50] <OneSadCookie> or clang
[02:32:06] <OneSadCookie> I hope the license is MIT or something friendly like that
[02:32:21] <OneSadCookie> they've been a bit cagey about exactly what they'll pick

[02:33:35] <Peach> I totally see people branching Swift into a bunch of misc languages
[02:33:59] <Peach> The major thing Swift is good with is Unicode (I think)

[02:34:36] <OneSadCookie> making new operators seemed OK, Haskell-ish

[11:38:41] <Amaranth> Am I missing a shortcut or is cgmath::Rad::from(cgmath::deg(45.0)) really the shortest way to take an f32 in degrees and convert it to radians using cgmath?
[11:39:13] <fkaa> isn't that pretty short?
[11:39:20] <fkaa> sans the namespace
[11:39:54] <Amaranth> I suppose it's really just the wrapping in a Deg first that is throwing me
[11:40:15] <Amaranth> Eh, whatever, made a to_rad function for it
[11:40:33] <fkaa> gotta make full use of the typesystem :p
[11:41:55] <tomaka> Amaranth: the idea is that all functions that take angles are supposed to be able to take either degrees or radian
[11:41:59] <tomaka> in cgmath at least
[11:42:17] <tomaka> so you'd just need `deg(45.0)` and pass that value everywhere
[11:43:06] <Amaranth> https://github.com/bjz/cgmath-rs/blob/master/src/rotation.rs#L86-119

[11:46:31] <Amaranth> Although it looks like cgmath::Rad::from(45.0) should work? Although that'd probably trigger the cgmath::rad() version which isn't right
[11:47:06] <Amaranth> *shrug* I'm not actually sure how any of this works
[11:47:46] <Amaranth> I've been tempted to just do all the math myself a few times so I at least know what things are called and what they do but then I need to invert a 4x4 matrix and nope out
[11:48:09] <OmniMancer> I feel like you should tag that you have degrees when converting, there is no reason taking an f32 and wanting radians should assume it is degrees
[11:49:07] <Amaranth> I should probably just give up and work with radians period, was just trying to make it easier to use since people work with degrees
[11:49:35] <Amaranth> But I guess I can just do the conversion once at the API level and work with radians internally

[15:14:39] <tomaka> hm, no
[15:14:57] <tomaka> there's a ColorAttachment trait already

[15:15:23] <tomaka> and this function requires the parameter to implement ColorAttachment

[15:17:20] <tomaka> usually there's a reason why things are missing
[15:17:29] <tomaka> like it wouldn't work anyway, or a function is required, etc.
[15:17:40] <meh> I'll just add as_surface to Srgb then

[20:59:52] <Binero> I am a bit puzzled now on how to run my vertex shader without sending it vertices
[21:00:04] <Binero> I want to generate the vertices on the GPU with a few small data sets 
[21:00:37] <bvssvni> Binero: can you use a geometry shader?
[21:00:42] <Binero> All my vertex shader needs is those data sets and the index of the shader
[21:00:56] <Binero> haven't looked into that, that's not available on 3.1, is it? 
[21:01:14] <Binero> (OpenGL)
[21:01:32] <Binero> Yeah Geometry runs after the Vertex one
[21:01:42] <Binero> Yet I want to have no vertices as input and a bunch of them as output
[21:02:02] <Binero> all my vertex shader needs is 2 small data sets and it's index
[21:02:23] <Binero> I could just send a huge vertex buffer of [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7...] but that seems inefficient

[21:26:26] <Binero> I'll look into that
[21:26:35] <Binero> Haven't really done much else than vertex and fragments before 
[21:27:43] <pheleas_frog> in d3d11 you just call Draw without a vertex buffer bound
[21:28:01] <pheleas_frog> and use vertexID to decide where vert goes
[21:29:19] <Binero> pheleas_frog You can do this in regular OpenGL too I believe 
[21:29:35] <Binero> You don't need to bind a VBO, but glium seems to want one anyway

[22:49:11] <thlst> Binero, but that's the way to do it

[22:50:08] <thlst> only if you can tell glium that Point2<f32> is the same as [f32; 2]
[22:50:25] <thlst> but, anyway, you need to declare a struct
