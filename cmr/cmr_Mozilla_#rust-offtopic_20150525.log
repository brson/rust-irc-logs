[00:05:32] <Tiffany> is there a way I can programmatically create an array of [u8; 32] of [1, 2, 3 ... 32]?
[00:05:44] <Tiffany> or do I have to do a lot of typing?
[00:06:06] <bluss> create [0; 32] and then fill with values?
[00:06:48] <Tiffany> I guess that works..
[00:08:03] <bluss> one guy has implemented indexassign so it's on track to be added at some point. I think that's what you wanted to do with operator[] ?
[00:08:28] <bluss> foo[(a, b)] = 2 etc.
[00:09:41] <Tiffany> now I need to define a 32-element array that's initialized to something

[00:10:20] <Tiffany> the manual doesn't seem to have a section on array literals?
[00:10:33] <Tiffany> this is really frustrating
[00:10:45] <Tiffany> I just want to write code but at every turn I have to stop and spend 10 minutes looking something up
[00:12:24] <Tiffany> I just bruteforced the 'fill-an-array-with-this' syntax and it's apparently [V; N]
[00:12:59] <cmr> of course it is, everywhere in rust initialization matches declaration (and bluss even said how to do it)
[00:13:12] <Tiffany> oh
[00:13:15] <Tiffany> I misread
[00:14:12] <Tiffany> sorry, I guess I'm just getting frustrated
[00:14:14] <Tiffany> I should probably take a break
[00:14:19] <bluss> Tiffany: well that's what I meant by [0; 32] but if you don't know it you don't see it
[00:14:36] <Tiffany> I was vaguely remember with the syntax being something like [0, ..32] at some point
[00:14:42] <cmr> yeah, it used to be.
[00:14:43] <Tiffany> -was
[00:14:51] <bluss> Tiffany: it's not our fault you didn't spend every evening the last year with programming in rust
[00:15:08] <bluss> it's a reasonable thing to do but some choose not to for some reason
[00:19:27] <Tiffany> er.. where is DebugList?

[00:21:16] <cmr> Docs are a bit of a crapshoot right now with reexports.
[00:21:23] <cmr> but you don't need the type, just that method.

[06:08:16] <c74d> I'm surprised that no-one seems to have banned me while my irc.mozilla.org session flapped for hours.
[06:08:45] <cmr> if I had join/parts displayed, or someone pointed it out, I would have.

[06:09:23] <niconii> yeah, i don't have 'em displayed either, so
[06:11:18] <c74d> I ended up forsaking my “join all the Rust channels” policy and closing a lot of channels to make it stop flapping… I seemed to always ping-timeout while joining all the channels I was in. I don't know why; I'm in many more channels on freenode and this doesn't happen there.

[06:36:39] <c74d> taryn: Would sticking a ZNC instance between my WeeChat instance and the IRC networks mean that all three (WeeChat, ZNC, IRCd) would need to implement a IRC protocol feature before I could use that feature?

[14:09:43] <bvssvni> when moore’s law is over, the cpus will double each year :P
[14:10:39] <Sho> and intel still wins
[14:12:46] <eddyb> moore's law is cute
[14:14:46] <Tiffany> the thing that's amusing about moore's law is how all of the graphs either stop after 2011 or start biasing towards high-end CPUs after 2011
[14:16:41] <bvssvni> keep smiling!
[14:18:09] <Tiffany> hm
[14:18:31] <Tiffany> so the original paper about moore's law describes the transistor count, not density, doubling every year (later revised to two years)
[14:21:01] <Tiffany> intel's on track for transistor density that would be consistent with moore's law, but they don't seem to interested in having more than a couple billion transistors on their CPUs
[14:21:13] <WindowsBunny> moores law is gonna break down soon
[14:21:18] <Tiffany> shrinking the die instead of growing the transistors
[14:21:27] <Tiffany> probably a bit after 2020, windowsbunny
[14:21:32] <Tiffany> well
[14:21:35] <Tiffany> assuming you mean feature size
[14:21:44] <Tiffany> feature size really can't keep shrinking like this
[14:21:47] <Tiffany> MOSFETs are going to be nearly useless at 5 nm
[14:22:10] <Tiffany> as for actual transistor counts, which is how moore's law was originally defined, we're already behind
[14:22:21] <Tiffany> CPUs should have 7 billion transistors by now if that was the case
[14:22:43] <Tiffany> that's about 3 cycles behind the curve
[14:23:29] <Tiffany> er, for reference, current intel CPUs have 1.4 billion (or 2.6 billion for haswell-E)
[14:24:01] <Tiffany> also, the people who think the cycle is 18 months are even more wrong
[14:24:02] <eddyb> what if we count MIPS?
[14:24:06] <Tiffany> CPUs would have 42 billion transistors by now
[14:24:21] <Tiffany> I think that's been going up more or less linearly, not  exponentially, eddyb
[14:24:24] <Tiffany> but I can't be sure
[14:24:27] <eddyb> that's interesting
[14:24:34] <Tiffany> clock speeds plateaued 15 years ago
[14:24:46] <eddyb> it's been that long?!
[14:24:50] <Tiffany> yeah
[14:24:57] <Tiffany> there were CPUs in 2000 which ran at about 3 GHz
[14:25:01] <eddyb> I can't believe I'll be 20 later this year
[14:25:11] <bvssvni> cpus do more instructions per cycle since then
[14:25:17] <Sho> netburst was such an interesting and silly microarchitecture
[14:25:31] <eddyb> Sho: do I need to bring my popcorn?
[14:25:46] <Tiffany> the pentium 4 ran as high as 3.8 GHz
[14:25:55] <eddyb> industrial-sized pipelines are fun
[14:25:56] <fmtq> and it did it at 590C
[14:26:03] <fmtq> you could melt steel with a P4
[14:26:12] <Tiffany> they do bvssvni
[14:26:15] <fmtq> do you remember the enthusiast cooling systems for those 
[14:26:20] <fmtq> people filled their entire PC case with oil 
[14:26:22] <Tiffany> that's really what more transistors gets you, I suppose
[14:26:34] <Tiffany> fancier OoO engines, more cache, larger vector units
[14:26:38] <Sho> nah i'm at work and can't monologize, but ... it had a whole bunch of "wow that's really sexy and clever" ideas like the trace cache, but in service to wrong goals
[14:26:42] <Tiffany> more hidden registers
[14:27:07] <Sho> it's prolly entertaining to read up on
[14:27:08] <Tiffany> fmtq people still do that
[14:27:09] <WindowsBunny> I really hope Zen is properly fast
[14:27:13] <Tiffany> it's called oil submersion cooling
[14:27:22] <Tiffany> it's used for bitcoin mining on overclocked AMD GPUs
[14:27:22] <Sho> old rwt articles from back then or so
[14:27:28] <Tiffany> or was, before ASICs took over
[14:28:03] <Tiffany> it's pretty much the most efficient cooling system you can do, and it's not terribly expensive either
[14:28:20] <Tiffany> you can build it out of off the shelf parts, rather than needing extremely expensive kits
[14:28:37] <eddyb> "Zen is an upcoming chip microarchitecture created from scratch by AMD."
[14:28:40] <eddyb> you wot?

[14:29:42] <Tiffany> I want to build a submersion-cooled computer fmtq
[14:29:50] <fmtq> you are part of the problem Tiffany
[14:29:56] *** Joins: Astrum|Lap (Astrum|Lap@moz-skcefh.co.comcast.net)
[14:29:56] <Tiffany> what's the problem?
[14:30:13] * fmtq steps away slowly
[14:30:13] <WindowsBunny> submersion cooling is a great idea
[14:30:27] <WindowsBunny> The only downside is if you wanna mess with the parts, you gotta dip your hands into oil
[14:30:30] <WindowsBunny> and oil gets everywhere
[14:30:32] <fmtq> I recently met an American who believes not only in chemtrails and is against vaccines
[14:30:36] <fmtq> but believes the chemtrails _are_ vaccines.
[14:30:51] <eddyb> fmtq: I wish
[14:31:04] <fmtq> imagine we had magical vaccine spray 
[14:31:14] <fmtq> that you could protect an entire population against highly contageous diseases
[14:31:15] <WindowsBunny> fmtq: As an american, I'd just like to say I have nothing to do with those crazy people
[14:31:16] <fmtq> that'd be fucking amazing 
[14:31:34] <fmtq> WindowsBunny: dude this is dumb even for the baseline stereotype 
[14:31:57] <eddyb> fmtq: I am not even mad
[14:31:59] <WindowsBunny> I'm really glad none of the people I know are this dumb
[14:32:24] <WindowsBunny> Partly because I kill everyone I know who is that dumb, so I don't have to know them anymore
[14:32:30] <eddyb> WindowsBunny: I'm part of a pseudoscience Facebook group. as in, pseudoscience shaming

[14:40:49] <Tiffany> castlevania is, I think
[14:41:06] <eddyb> Red Alert 3 - wtf?
[14:41:11] <Tiffany> congrats eddyb, there are people who think romania and/or transylvania are fictional places!
[14:41:27] <eddyb> and two Hitman games? o_O
[14:41:32] <Tiffany> like how people who saw the titanic movie think that it's fictional
[14:42:06] <eddyb> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_%26_Conquer:_Red_Alert_3_%E2%80%93_Uprising
[14:42:10] <eddyb> it's the Soviet Union :/
[14:43:14] <eddyb> so, Hitman: Codename 47
[14:43:15] <eddyb> "In a desolated large building in the outskirts of Romania"
[14:43:37] <eddyb> I... I thought... pretty sure that's now how you're supposed to use "outskirts"
[14:43:58] <eddyb> I've heard "outskirts of town" before
[14:44:12] <eddyb> which makes sense. but a whole country? wtf?
[14:44:28] <Tiffany> usually you'd say "on the border"
[14:44:33] <Tiffany> seeing how countries have well defined borders
[14:44:37] <Tiffany> whereas towns kind of don't
[14:45:18] <eddyb> "Satu Mare, Romania" oh boy they picked such a bad place
[14:45:25] <eddyb> it literally means "Big Village"
[14:45:38] <eddyb> it sounds as stupid in Romanian as you could imagine
[14:46:08] <eddyb> well, slightly less stupid because we're used to archaic constructs
[14:47:14] <eddyb> Tiffany: ok, it is close to the border https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satu_Mare
[14:47:20] <eddyb> meh
[14:47:29] <Tiffany> maybe they were going for tone
[14:47:41] <Tiffany> "on the outskirts" tends to draw up places which are little-inhabited
[14:47:59] <eddyb> no, the center is less inhabited. kinda the center. the mountains, I mean :P
[14:48:45] <eddyb> it sounded like "the suburbs of Romania" to me. as if Romania was one big city
[14:49:04] <Tiffany> vlad the impaler
[14:49:06] <eddyb> (well, there are cities with a population larger than the whole of Romania)
[14:49:21] <eddyb> Tiffany: yupp. dracula. which means son of the dragon IIRC
[14:49:33] <Tiffany> sounds right
[14:50:17] <Tiffany> "Dracul is the Romanian definite form, the -ul being the suffixal definite article (deriving from Latin ille). The noun drac "dragon" itself continues Latin draco. In Modern Romanian, the word drac has adopted the meaning of "devil" (the term for "dragon" now being balaur or dragon)."
[14:50:21] <eddyb> his father was "Dracul" i.e. dragon.
[14:50:28] <eddyb> oh I was going to point that out
[14:51:07] <Tiffany> there's 5 stories about how he died, heh
[14:51:08] <eddyb> "balaur" is quite old, I would've expected it to be used in Vlad's time
[14:52:05] <Tiffany> killed fighting turks, killed by boyars either during war against the turks or during a hunt, killed by one of his own men
[14:52:38] <eddyb> Tiffany: funny thing, I watched the first (only?) season of Dracula TV series and then the recent movie
[14:52:52] <Tiffany> jesus
[14:52:58] <Tiffany> "Vlad Ţepeş's reputation was considerably darker in Western Europe than in Eastern Europe and Romania. In the West, Vlad III Ţepeş has been characterized as a tyrant who took sadistic pleasure in torturing and killing his enemies.[22] Estimates of the number of his victims range from 40,000 to 100,000.[23] He also had whole villages and fortresses destroyed and burned to the ground.[24]"
[14:53:26] <eddyb> turns out they're both inspired by the novel
[14:55:04] <eddyb> I didn't even consider that many of the details in the TV series were from the book - which I only knew existed
[14:55:16] <Tiffany> this is probably exaggerated quite a bit?
[14:55:23] <eddyb> Tiffany: hmm?
[14:55:31] <Tiffany> seeing how there should be mass graves outside his castle, if he actually killed that many
[14:55:44] <Tiffany> but the wikipedia page doesn't mention any
[14:55:47] <eddyb> why the castle?
[14:56:03] <eddyb> you don't kill people outside your front door, is that an American thing?
[14:56:24] *** Joins: gsingh93 (gulshan@moz-ln1ktu.st3l.iv8o.0004.2601.IP)
[14:56:47] <Tiffany> the wikipedia page says he had 20 000 impaled corpses outside his cpaital of târgovişte
[14:56:51] <eddyb> a lot of the killing could coincide with battlefields
[14:57:05] <eddyb> oh, that
[14:57:28] <eddyb> well, it's been 5-6 centuries or something like that
[14:57:32] <Tiffany> there's also the thing saying he killed 23 884 turks in a battle, but that was with armies, not by impaling
[14:57:50] <eddyb> who the fuck counted that precisely?
[14:58:00] <Tiffany> "I have killed peasants men and women, old and young, who lived at Oblucitza and Novoselo, where the Danube flows into the sea... We killed 23,884 Turks without counting those whom we burned in homes or the Turks whose heads were cut by our soldiers...Thus, your highness, you must know that I have broken the peace."
[14:58:34] <Tiffany> the cite for this letter is a huffington post article...
[14:58:37] <eddyb> 20k corpses seems like a small thing after half a millenium
[14:58:50] <eddyb> Tiffany: lol
[14:59:05] <Tiffany> I don't trust huffpo at all
[14:59:58] <eddyb> found a Romanian version
[15:00:00] <eddyb> “Am ucis ţărani, bărbaţi şi femei, tineri şi bătrâni, tot ce trăieşte în Oblucitza şi Novoselo, unde Dunărea se varsă în mare, până la Rahova lângă Chitila, Samovit si Ghighen. Am ucis 23884 de turci, fără să-i socotesc pe cei arş iîn casele lor şi pe cei ale căror capete au fost tăiate de soldaţii mei. Asta ca să ştie Inăţimea Ta că nu mai poate fi pace între mine şi Mehmet.”
[15:00:07] <Tiffany> they have a dramatic story about vlad the impaler, and there is not a single cite
[15:00:20] <eddyb> hmm
[15:00:22] <Tiffany> pretty shitty cite..
[15:00:34] <eddyb> the style seems quite modern
[15:00:55] <Tiffany> maybe it was updated by someone who thought they were going a good thing
[15:00:58] <eddyb> "tot ce trăieşte" is literally "everything that lives"
[15:01:00] <Tiffany> or perhaps it's just an outright fabrication
[15:01:17] <eddyb> "n.red."
[15:01:28] <eddyb> which is... "redaction note"?

[18:02:38] <eddyb> we already kinda sorta have something
[18:02:43] <eddyb> pczarn was working on it
[18:02:51] <XMPPwocky> so you can have, like, a private module with a public macro
[18:02:58] <eddyb> oh
[18:03:00] <eddyb> *that*
[18:03:00] <XMPPwocky> and the macro can use stuff inside the module, but otherwise it's totally exposed
[18:03:10] <XMPPwocky> er, not exposed
[18:03:12] <eddyb> that's general item hygiene and it's quite complicated
[18:03:22] <c74d> <https://codepoints.net/U+1F365> “U+1F365 FISH CAKE WITH SWIRL DESIGN”… is a thing. :|
[18:03:31] <eddyb> just the limited local variable declaration hygiene we have is nasty
[18:04:00] <eddyb> c74d: it's "naruto", apparently
[18:04:04] <c74d> <https://github.com/exebook/elfu> what
[18:04:07] <XMPPwocky> c74d: from https://plus.google.com/109925364564856140495 ?

[18:05:24] <c74d> XMPPwocky: no, I don't recall where I got it from; though whoever I got it from may have got it thence.
[18:05:47] <XMPPwocky> eddyb: where do the complications come from? iirc, "syntactic environment" is already tracked
[18:07:42] <eddyb> XMPPwocky: it's not
[18:07:51] <XMPPwocky> ah
[18:07:54] <eddyb> XMPPwocky: I mean, only a very limited kind is
[18:08:21] <eddyb> which is declaration-precedes-use
[18:08:24] <eddyb> items aren't like that
[18:09:12] <eddyb> I guess you could do it with macros because they still are declaration-precedes-use even in item contexts
[18:09:31] <eddyb> XMPPwocky: the best part about this is that you can implement it in a plugin
[18:09:32] <Tiffany> eddyb: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Night_Attack
[18:09:40] <eddyb> actually, nvm
[18:09:48] <eddyb> but you would want to create a new kind of macro_rules

[18:41:39] <Havvy> eddyb:  You didn't answer my question! :P
[18:41:44] <Sho> c74d: Plasma 5 (especially 5.3) does quite decent hi-dpi scaling in n*x steps (everything is in abstract units, vector assets scale, raster assets are present in proper resolutions, etc.) for the desktop shell
[18:42:21] <Sho> c74d: On the app side hi-dpi scaling is currently opt-in and not that many apps do it yet (and those that do still have the occasional blemish here and there where old crappy rendering code lurks)
[18:42:43] <Sho> On Wayland the compositor will upscale unscaled apps
[18:42:44] <eddyb> Havvy: I don't know. ask aturon
[18:42:46] <Sho> not on X11, though
[18:44:18] <Sho> c74d: That said even for unscaled apps the icon and font sizes will adjust, so it's just down to basic controls not actually scaling along
[18:44:29] <Sho> (except for in the apps that opt-in)
[18:49:16] <c74d> Sho: Thanks. How much worse is the situation for past versions?
[18:50:58] <Sho> c74d: Any 5.x does some attempt at handling it fine (5.3 is incrementably but notably better); 4.x does no attempt at scaling but will still let you adjust font and icon sizes in the settings
[18:51:59] <Sho> c74d: And you can manually size up, say, the panels via handles, so it could be worse
[18:52:26] <c74d> Thanks. I'm asking for someone who was trying to use KDE with a high-DPI display and finding KDE to be unspefically “not happy” with it; may I copy what you've said to that person?
[18:53:09] <Sho> Basically what's new in 5.x vs 4.x is the ability to actually render things at 2x, 3x and so forth for the elements where it makes sense
[18:53:11] <Sho> c74d: Sure

[23:08:45] <eddyb> I'm guessing a curve's parameters consist of its equation and that p
[23:10:17] <cmr> Not all ECC computations are done in Z_p.
[23:10:34] <eddyb> which is how NaCl can get away with no allocations: all the possible integers you may need to work with fit in a fixed-length array
[23:10:37] <eddyb> cmr: oh?
[23:10:53] <cmr> You can build it on top of most fields.
[23:11:03] <cmr> But yes, the modulus is a curve parameter.
[23:12:09] <eddyb> and the points on the curve are the inputs and outputs
[23:12:39] <eddyb> that's interesting... gf[4] means two points?

[23:31:51] <Tobba> linux can not do network bridges well
[23:32:10] <Tobba> now it's just dropping all ARP traffic on the floor and stomping in it, but it can send it (????)
[23:39:12] <fmtq> holy shit
[23:39:27] <fmtq> I just finished dealing with four separate people having relationship issues of some kind
[23:39:29] <fmtq> or mental breakdowns
[23:39:35] <fmtq> I will never get those 8 hours back :(
