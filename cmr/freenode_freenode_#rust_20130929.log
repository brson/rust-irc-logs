[02:17:10] <LowPotential> Hello. I'm playing around with the stuff in std::rt::io. Is the only way to create a buffer for  std::rt::io::Reader::read somethine like "let mut buff = [0, ..128]; let slice = buff.mut_slice_from( 0 )" ? I tried (what I thought was) the obvious approach of creating an owned vector with std::vec::with_capacity, but that didn't seem to work.
[02:17:52] <cmr> LowPotential: Well, if you use with_capacity, your vector still has a length of 0.
[02:17:55] <LowPotential> When I tried the owned vector, it compiled, but then the TCP library "fail!"'ed saying that the buffer was not available.
[02:18:05] <cmr> capacity and length are separate
[02:18:18] <LowPotential> cmr: This makes sense.
[02:18:33] <cmr> std::vec::from_elem(N, 0) will create a 0-initialized vector of length N
[02:18:46] <LowPotential> I'll give that a quick try.
[02:20:15] <LowPotential> cmr: That worked. Thanks!
[02:22:54] <cmr> LowPotential: np! FYI, the official channel in irc.mozilla.org has a lot more traffic
[02:25:05] <LowPotential> cmr: Ah, good to know as well.

[04:47:45] <evincar> jeaye: I see you're keeping up with the Mozillian villains.
[04:47:59] <jeaye> am I?
[04:48:28] <jeaye> Upgrading to 0.8 was a ton of work, honestly.
[04:49:08] <evincar> Fairly large diff.
[04:49:17] <jeaye> Not just that commit either.
[04:50:05] <jeaye> https://github.com/jeaye/q3/commit/02486993489d7e0c66a615b680bdf5b30588c1f7 was the big one
[04:50:20] <jeaye> Not entirely 0.8 related, but laid the groundwork
[04:50:49] <jeaye> Any new Kitten advances, my friend?
[04:52:00] <evincar> Improved the REPL a bit.
[04:52:20] <evincar> You can now ask the type of an expression.
[04:52:46] <evincar> And flow-control is no longer special. Backslash does something similar to what "do" does in Rust.
[04:53:27] <evincar> The straightforward example: \each [1, 2, 3]: sayInt
[04:53:34] <evincar> Desugars to: [1, 2, 3] {sayInt} each
[04:53:54] <evincar> Simple stuff, but it cleaned up quite a bit of code.
[04:54:49] <jeaye> ah
[04:54:58] <jeaye> Will Kitten have overloading?
[04:55:03] * jeaye noticed 'sayInt'
[04:55:23] <evincar> Yes, I've been going back and forth about it. Typeclasses seem to be the way to go.
[04:55:28] <evincar> Despite their limitations.
[04:56:10] <jeaye> A good language needs overloading.
[04:56:15] <jeaye> Rust needs overloading.
[04:56:17] <jeaye> So does Kitten.
[04:56:24] <jeaye> You heard it from me.
[04:56:29] <cmr> Yeah, Rust *really* could use overloading.
[04:56:37] <evincar> I thought Rust had it in the form of traits?
[04:56:43] <jeaye> blegh
[04:56:48] <evincar> Which, as far as I knew, are typeclasses.
[04:57:01] <evincar> Enlighten me.
[04:57:20] <jeaye> Only one version of a trait can be implemented per struct.
[04:57:34] <cmr> They are typeclasses, but that doesn't help with Add<Vec, Vec> and Add<Vec, Scalar>
[04:57:58] <cmr> Hm, that example might not make sense mathwise
[04:58:15] <cmr> But that same pattern doesn't work
[04:58:16] <jeaye> So I can't implement operator * for my matrices that take a matrix or take a vector.
[04:58:18] <evincar> Multiplying a matrix by a scalar, then.
[04:58:55] <jeaye> cmr: Exactly my point.
[04:58:58] <evincar> The trait could be multi-parameter, though, couldn't it?
[04:59:03] <evincar> You would need a functional dependency between the inputs and output of course.
[04:59:21] <jeaye> I just want proper overloads. -_-
[04:59:21] <evincar> (*) :: a -> b -> c | a b -> c
[04:59:55] <jeaye> I don't like the Foo::new_with_bar, Foo::new_with_spam
[05:00:25] <jeaye> Foo::new(bar), Foo::new(spam). Rust has clever type deduction; it can do this for me.
[05:00:30] <jeaye> Why won't it? >.<
[05:00:34] <cmr> The type system still needs a bunch of work, especially specificity rules on trait impls.
[05:00:50] <cmr> But, it's mostly good enough for now.
[05:01:26] <cmr> Can work around most problems.
[05:05:44] <evincar> And here I am thinking about Rust's model of ownership and lifetime, and how I can steal it and improve on it for Kitten.
[05:05:56] <cmr> :D
[05:06:36] <evincar> References naturally break down into an unowned-owned-shared spectrum (0-1-n)
[05:06:44] <evincar> but to my mind they only work for first-order resources.
[05:06:57] <evincar> Things that don't own other things.
[05:38:17] <evincar> jeaye: Is there a Rustful way of managing locks, pools, allocators, &c.?
[05:38:59] <cmr> (rusti)
[05:39:01] <cmr> (rustic)
[05:39:16] <evincar> Aw, rustic. :)
[05:39:20] <cmr> evincar: Locks are usually RAII
[05:39:51] <cmr> I don't think anyone has implemented a pool or allocator yet.
[05:40:07] <cmr> Certainly not enough people to have hashed out a good, idiomatic way to do it.
[05:40:31] <evincar> Half-expected that answer.
