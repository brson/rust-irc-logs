[03:01:51] <apoelstra> nrc: i see 'new' most often fwiw
[03:02:11] <strcat> I think rust is already a pretty nice language all around, for the most part
[03:02:18] <strcat> just doesn't have a great stdlib imo
[03:02:35] <strcat> there are weaknesses in the language but most are implementation bugs....
[03:02:35] <o11c> strcat: it is, it just needs a bit of stability and tools
[03:02:37] <eevee> stdlibs are important and i will be pretty sad if rust 1.0 comes out already saddled with a legacy stdlib
[03:03:04] <o11c> I think rust needs *less* stdlib, more libraries that are not strictly bound to it
[03:03:07] <strcat> eevee: if 1.0 happens in 2014, that will be the case
[03:03:27] <strcat> and sure, it can be changed, but there will be even more resistance
[03:04:04] <bvssvni> I think it is important to group modules by use
[03:04:37] <arrrrrrrrr> ercxx: You can always modify the wayland-protocol.h generator so that it converts the xml files to rust code instead of c code. that would be a nice project actually
[03:04:42] <strcat> we never ended up using the stability markers that were implemented
[03:04:49] <o11c> arrrrrrrrr: I've thought about doing that
[03:05:31] <o11c> ercxx: what exactly are you working on?
[03:05:34] <strcat> completely possible to go through the basic types/APIs and settle on a lot of stuff
[03:05:43] <strcat> but not most of it
[03:05:44] <arrrrrrrrr> it's in autoconf hell, though. so finding the actual code that generates the *.h might be the hardest part :p
[03:06:23] <ercxx> o11c: Nothing, absolutely nothing. I just wanted to take look at wayland and wanted to make a clone of simple-shm.c from weston in rust.
[03:06:47] <bvssvni> maybe one could have a simplified standard lib
[03:07:02] <bvssvni> one that abstracts over implementation

[03:09:25] <strcat> bvssvni: https://github.com/thestinger/rust-core
[03:09:33] <killerswan> and I'd probably regret trying to make one :)
[03:09:42] <strcat> although, even though the reason for it existing is freestanding rust, imo I'm making better decisions than the stdlib all around
[03:09:51] <strcat> simpler intrinsics and low-level bits, simpler Eq/Ord
[03:10:24] <strcat> the vector has 7x faster push than the stdlib... that's what you get for doing it ground up in a sane way
[03:10:33] <strcat> and really, good luck to anyone who wants to change the ~[T] representation ;p
[03:10:51] <strcat> I expect a *standard library* to provide really nice OS interfaces
[03:11:16] <o11c> strcat: but the standard library should be more than one crate
[03:11:23] <strcat> 1:1 threading, nice mutable concurrent containers, reference counting, memory mapped I/O and other blocking I/O, etc.
[03:11:26] <o11c> strcat: look at python for a generally-good standard library
[03:11:43] <strcat> o11c: sure, I've written a lot of python
[03:12:11] <bvssvni> I was hoping for some high level abstractions
[03:12:13] <strcat> python's stdlib is pretty extensive but I don't think a lot of it is designed well
[03:12:16] <arrrrrrrrr> don't look at python for good documentation, though :)
[03:12:25] <strcat> there's a reason for people using libraries like requests instead of the stdlib
[03:12:40] <o11c> so if, say, libstd provides absolutely NO io facilities, you can drop io later and implement a new one ... people can just use the old io lib
[03:12:47] <o11c> don't try to ship java's stdlib
[03:13:10] <strcat> bvssvni: sure, provide thread pools, provide TBB-like tasks with work-stealing, and so on - threads are already high level when you can't accidentally cause data races and you have concurrent containers provided for you
[03:13:19] <ChrisMorgan> strcat: most of the "poor design" in the Python stdlib is just because of its vintage.
[03:13:46] <strcat> bvssvni: the stdlib builds a complex pluggable scheduler/io system

[03:15:02] <bvssvni> strcat: maybe building a lot of libraries together would help
[03:15:16] <strcat> it's just too much to take on, and I don't think it is anything close to high quality
[03:15:24] <bvssvni> strcat: a group of libraries following some common conventions
[03:15:28] <jtbandes> is it possible to call select() with a Port<uint> and a PortOne<()>?
[03:15:38] <o11c> apparently the python 3.4 supports a new "async IO" module that is completely incompatible with previous async libraries ...
[03:15:42] <o11c> so it's not just old stuff
[03:15:47] <bvssvni> strcat: the only way I see conventions coming from is by experience
[03:15:59] <strcat> o11c: async io is weird as a whole, because platforms do it differently
[03:16:03] <o11c> BUT ... as far as splitting stuff ... python has some good stuff
[03:16:10] <strcat> and any attempt at abstraction loses the one thing that matters - performance

[03:24:49] <apoelstra> on freenode you can also connect through tor, though it's a bit silly since the hidden service is always down and you have to register with them through the clearnet anyway
[03:25:04] <apoelstra> well, down ~50% of the time
[03:25:28] <arrrrrrrrr> apoelstra: connecting over my vps would be easier but it's a bother

[06:02:03] <erickt> strcat: good evening! I ran into I think a missed optimization with iterators: https://gist.github.com/erickt/7969451
[06:02:27] <eddyb> oh. you could also run to me. because I was deep in these
[06:02:45] <strcat> erickt: hm?
[06:03:03] <eddyb> I know move_iter is very slow by design
[06:03:12] <erickt> strcat: I would expect in best case all but the one that uses copy_memory should compile down to the same code
[06:03:30] <erickt> eddyb: is it? that's surprising
[06:03:41] <vadimcn> HI
[06:03:42] <vadimcn> How do I export a Rust function so it can be called from C code?
[06:03:45] <eddyb> move_iter swaps every element
[06:03:52] <dbaupp> erickt: to be failure safe it has to be
[06:03:56] <eddyb> or was that something else
[06:03:57] <strcat> erickt: move_rev_iter is fast
[06:04:00] <dbaupp> vadimcn: `pub extern "C" fn`...
[06:04:08] <strcat> dbaupp: not just failure safe
[06:04:12] <eddyb> erickt: you want them to be all like bench_push_all_move       ... bench:      1265 ns/iter (+/- 171)?
[06:04:14] <strcat> it can go out of scope without being fully consumed
[06:04:20] *** Quits: jmgrosen (jmgrosen@moz-848F6087.sb.sd.cox.net) (Quit: jmgrosen)
[06:04:24] <dbaupp> vadimcn: with #[no_mangle] to preserve the symbol name
[06:04:31] <dbaupp> strcat: true enough
[06:04:37] <strcat> erickt: optimizing move_iter would be an algorithm change, and not the kind LLVM can really do
[06:04:47] <vadimcn> dbaupp: that's what I am doing, but it is not showing as exported symbol in the object file
[06:05:04] <dbaupp> vadimcn: is it in a public module?
[06:05:06] <strcat> if rust was going to stick with C++-style move semantics where you can move from some memory and that memory is still valid to call a dtor on, it could be fast
[06:05:19] <strcat> FWIW this also means heaps can't be as fast
[06:05:35] <vadimcn> dbaupp: no.  does the module need to be public too?
[06:05:47] <dbaupp> vadimcn: it needs to be an externally accessible symbol
[06:05:54] <erickt> eddyb: I'd love them to bench that much, but bench_push_all_move uses memcpy. I don't think llvm optimizes a for loop write down to memcpy
[06:06:12] <sanxiyn> erickt: It doesn't?
[06:06:14] <eddyb> err
[06:06:15] <dbaupp> vadimcn: i.e. either with a `pub use` somewhere that's public, or with the chain of parent modules all being `pub`

[06:06:22] <dbaupp> vadimcn: (or a combination of those)
[06:06:38] <eddyb> erickt: most of the time it's trans being very stupid
[06:06:45] <erickt> heh
[06:07:06] <dbaupp> strcat: by that you mean types have to manage indicating if they've been moved from or not themselves?
[06:07:13] <strcat> dbaupp: yes
[06:07:22] <eddyb> erickt: or, like, a missing #[inline] on the Finallyalizer's dtor - that was slowing down vec::from_elem by 20x
[06:07:32] <strcat> dbaupp: C++ types (and currently, rust types) can be destroyed safely after they are moved from
[06:07:35] <strcat> but that's going to change

[06:08:35] <eddyb> erickt: ok, this is a bug: https://gist.github.com/erickt/7969451#file-test-rs-L87
[06:08:41] <dbaupp> strcat: "that's going to change" == only in Rust? C++ has to maintain its current semantics for backward compat, right?
[06:08:48] <strcat> dbaupp: yes
[06:08:52] <erickt> eddyb: oops, good catch
[06:08:58] <eddyb> erickt: not yours
[06:08:58] <strcat> the C++ semantics are fine though... it's a trade off
[06:09:09] <strcat> dbaupp: C++ moves are much more powerful than rust moves
[06:09:12] <eddyb> erickt: it's caused by the capacity being in the allocated memory, not on the stack
[06:09:23] <eddyb> erickt: the capacity/length fields of an owned vector are aliasable
[06:09:23] <strcat> dbaupp: you can happily move something out of a vector in C++
[06:09:27] <strcat> dbaupp: from the middle...
[06:09:29] <strcat> it doesn't care
[06:09:37] <eddyb> that means you *NEVER* get bounds check elision
[06:09:37] <strcat> and destroying that vector is still always fine
[06:09:44] <eddyb> strcat: can you confirm :P?
[06:09:56] <strcat> dunno, the stdlib also generates a whole lot of invalid IR
[06:09:58] <strcat> or just bad IR
[06:10:02] <sanxiyn> strcat: How does that work? Destructors do null check?
[06:10:12] <strcat> sanxiyn: in C++, you write the move and copy ctor
[06:10:22] <strcat> sanxiyn: so, it's up to you to mark it as moved from in some way
[06:10:36] <dbaupp> erickt: btw, there also is std::iter::Extendable which allows you to write `a.extend(&mut b.iter().map(|x| x.clone()))` etc ( http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/master/std/iter/trait.Extendable.html )
[06:10:46] <strcat> a object you move from has to be destroyable - that's the only rule
[06:10:50] <erickt> dbaupp: I'll add a test case for that
[06:10:51] <eddyb> erickt: so it does a capacity check every time you call push
[06:11:10] <sanxiyn> strcat: Ok, I think I understand the rule... How is it usually done in practice?
[06:11:12] <strcat> sanxiyn: C++ copies by default (rust's Clone) and you use std::move to cast to an rvalue, which calls the move ctor instead
[06:11:34] <strcat> sanxiyn: in practice, the move ctor usually zeroes something (a ptr, whatever) and the dtor checks, or it doesn't check because it's something like free valid on null
[06:11:46] <erickt> strcat: I thought was had a compile-type fn we could call to skip generating drop-safe code for POD types
[06:12:07] <eddyb> it could be a kind
[06:12:08] <strcat> erickt: we don't really have that kind of metaprogramming
[06:12:13] <sanxiyn> strcat: Is it undefined if one does not follow the rule?
[06:12:30] <sanxiyn> Or can compiler check whether you follow the rule? (probably not)
[06:12:32] <erickt> strcat: there's owns_managed
[06:12:45] <strcat> sanxiyn: well it has to be valid to destroy, because the dtor is called

[06:15:38] <strcat> sanxiyn: yes

[06:16:08] <sanxiyn> eddyb: How does that interact with coherence?
[06:16:27] <eddyb> sanxiyn: in the general case, it shouldn't be hard to implement
[06:16:30] <erickt> strcat: we couldn't do a `if is_pod() { copy_memory(â€¦) } else { â€¦ slow â€¦ }`
[06:16:51] <sanxiyn> eddyb: I once tried to hack coherence code and I am not sure about that...
[06:17:10] <erickt> and rely on llvm optimizing away the code
[06:17:47] <eddyb> sanxiyn: Trait and !Trait never overlap. if coherence cannot understand that with less than 500 loc... there's something wrong with it
[06:17:59] <dbaupp> sanxiyn: it should be possible to be coherent: since we require either the trait or type to be defined in the current crate
[06:18:13] <dbaupp> eddyb: it's not that simple
[06:18:22] <sanxiyn> eddyb: As I understand coherence completely ignores bounds at the moment

[06:21:30] <eddyb> jtbandes: &Select or ~Select
[06:21:38] <eddyb> jtbandes: i.e. a trait object
[06:21:57] <strcat> sanxiyn: you can still write rust performing well at --opt-level=0 or --opt-level=1 by actually applying inline(always) in a clever way, and not abusing it like we did before
[06:22:00] <sanxiyn> eddyb: Do we still need explicit as &Select cast?
[06:22:06] <dbaupp> sanxiyn: yes
[06:22:07] <strcat> cost-based inline starts at --opt-level=2
[06:22:09] <jtbandes> eddyb: I tried [timer_port.x as &Select, select_port.x as &Select] – but I get "error: failed to find an implementation of trait std::select::Select for &std::select::Select<no-bounds>"
[06:22:24] <erickt> dbaupp: added Extendable to https://gist.github.com/erickt/7969451, it was about the same
[06:22:32] <eddyb> jtbandes: that means the one you got an error on is already &Select
[06:22:33] <sanxiyn> strcat: Does C++ have inline(always)?
[06:22:42] <strcat> sanxiyn: via gcc extensions it does
[06:22:44] <eddyb> jtbandes: so you don't need one of the casts
[06:22:46] <jtbandes> eddyb: I'm trying to pass this vector into select(), which wants a <A: Select>  &mut[A]
[06:22:56] <sanxiyn> strcat: Ah but C++ standard inline isn't that, right?
[06:22:56] <strcat> sanxiyn: or MSVC++ ones
[06:22:59] <strcat> easy enough to define away
[06:23:07] <eddyb> jtbandes: which one of the casts was the error pointing at?
[06:23:09] <strcat> sanxiyn: standard inline becomes an inline hint, and mostly exists to change linkage rules
[06:23:17] <jtbandes> eddyb: it was actually pointing at the select(...) itself
[06:23:28] <eddyb> jtbandes: oh. hmm
[06:23:39] <jtbandes> eddyb: I think select() doesn't expect a &[&Select] but rather a &[Select]? But I'm not sure
[06:23:42] <eddyb> jtbandes: so it's complaining that the vector elements don't implement Select
[06:23:46] <dbaupp> jtbandes: you can only use select with ports of exactly the same type

[06:36:15] <jtbandes> here's a small example https://gist.github.com/jtbandes/719a739960011a3220a8
[06:36:24] <eddyb> strcat: but did you know why?
[06:36:32] <sanxiyn> jtbandes: My understanding is that current select function is not designed to work with different kinds of ports at all

[06:36:57] <eddyb> strcat: do you have an issue I can dump my findings on?
[06:37:00] <strcat> eddyb: it has to do extra operations everywhere
[06:37:12] <jtbandes> sanxiyn: I suppose that's true, but only because of this limitation. select() only requires Select
[06:37:19] <strcat> eddyb: https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/8981
[06:37:24] <sanxiyn> jtbandes: What limitation?

[06:37:31] <strcat> eddyb: although that's not very important
[06:37:33] <jtbandes> sanxiyn: the fact that &Select doesn't implement Select

[06:37:40] <sanxiyn> jtbandes: Nothing to do with that

[06:38:02] <eddyb> it's like asking to be never optimized
[06:38:08] <strcat> the only time it really makes sense is with a recursive variant type
[06:38:23] <strcat> and 3 words isn't very big, anyways
[06:38:39] <jtbandes> sanxiyn: perhaps I don't understand fully yet. but we have "fn select<A: Select>(ports: &mut [A])" so it seems like you could use &Select in place of A
[06:38:48] <sanxiyn> jtbandes: No
[06:39:00] <sanxiyn> I think that part is where the misunderstanding is
[06:39:06] <sanxiyn> You absolutely can't use trait object there
[06:39:11] <jtbandes> why not?
[06:39:18] <strcat> jtbandes: A is a value
[06:39:20] <sanxiyn> jtbandes: It is statically dispatched
[06:39:29] <strcat> &Trait is much more restricted than a value you own
[06:39:31] <jtbandes> instead couldn't we define "fn select(ports: &mut [&Select])"
[06:39:43] <sanxiyn> jtbandes: Yes! That would be the solution

[10:27:34] <cmr> adridu59: well I don't know exactly what you're asking, there's a few ways it could be interpreted.
[10:27:54] <cmr> All threads share address space, so anywhere the heap could go is of course shared.
[10:28:06] <cmr> But most allocators use thread-local pools
[10:28:09] <adridu59> but not access?
[10:28:27] <cmr> what do you mean?
[10:28:32] <adridu59> so no shared access, I need Arc for that?
[10:28:39] <adridu59> or RWArc
[10:28:55] *** Quits: spott (spott@moz-82AAF168.hsd1.co.comcast.net) (Ping timeout)
[10:29:18] <cmr> Yes, to get shared memory in rust you need to use one of the smart pointers
[10:29:42] <adridu59> and I imagine it's race free?
[10:29:43] *** Joins: qlkzy (qlkzy@moz-A97B5CE9.members.linode.com)
[10:29:59] <dbaupp> yes
[10:30:22] <adridu59> okay
[10:30:36] <dbaupp> Arc because it's immutable shared memory, MutexArc & RWArc because they have locks around any access

[10:32:06] <cmr> mutexarc is only one can access (mutual exclusion), rwarc is multi-reader, one-writer.
[10:32:44] <adridu59> I see so there are places you would prefer mutex for safety

[10:32:56] <cmr> mutexarc should actually perform a bit better
[10:33:03] <cmr> Hm? No, they're both just as safe.

[12:04:34] <mrmonday> is there a nice way to cast from a small integer to a larger integer in rust? eg if I have let a = 4i32; let b = 4i16; a = b; I get an error. I would rather not have an explicit cast as if the type of b or a changes it would cause truncation :<

[12:09:06] <bjz> mrmonday: let x = (4i16) as i32;
[12:10:07] <ezyang> that syntax will let you cast in the wrong direction resulting in truncation 
[12:11:05] <mrmonday> that was just an example, my actual code is a little more complex
[12:11:33] <mrmonday> best option I can think of is to write some conversion functions/macros which error on big integer -> small integer
[12:11:42] <ezyang> mrmonday: If I understand you correctly, you want something like 'as', but which only works for small -> large

[12:16:02] <adridu59> its type is ~[~str]

[12:17:20] <dbaupp> ~str and &str have different representations
[12:17:28] <adridu59> works with :?
[12:17:42] <adridu59> but {} doesn't work
[12:17:45] <dbaupp> (the former is *{length, capacity, data...}, the latter is {*data..., length})
[12:17:56] <adridu59> there's an RFC to change it right?
[12:18:00] <dbaupp> adridu59: yes, vectors haven't got a std::fmt::Default implementation
[12:18:08] <dbaupp> what's "it"?
[12:18:20] <adridu59> the representation of ~str
[12:18:54] <dbaupp> that change (to {length, capacity, *data...}) also won't allow in place [~str] -> [&str]
[12:19:49] <dbaupp> although there is a proposal for ~str and ~[] to become exactly equivalent to &str and &[] (i.e. both {*data, length}), except the former owns the data, while the latter does not
[12:20:16] <dbaupp> this would make ~str and ~[] non-resizeable; they'd be replaced by a library std::vec::Vec or something

[12:37:12] <bjz> mrmonday: I used to use D

[12:47:38] * bjz breaths a sigh of relief
[12:47:45] <ezyang> for example, if I write enum List {	Cons(int, ~List),     Nil } 
[12:47:49] <Ms2ger> You just wait until they come back
[12:47:49] <adridu59> they're coming back in a few seconds lol
[12:47:55] <dbaupp> adridu59: I still don't quite understand what you mean
[12:48:04] <ezyang> does Rust /really/ represent a Nil as Cons(undefined, NULL)??

[12:48:17] <kimundi> ezyang: Ah, it's afaik hardcoded for all enum types with two variants, one unit variant and one newtype variant which contains one of the hardcoded known types that are a non-nullary pointer
[12:48:21] <bjz> ezyang: you could transmute to [u8, ..size_of]?
[12:48:27] <adridu59> well I think I'm just confused myself :p
[12:48:28] <Ms2ger> Setting umode +R on yourself helps against the query-spam
[12:48:45] <bjz> ezyang: yep
[12:49:03] <bjz> ezyang: oh wait
[12:49:13] <ezyang> Which implies that to test if ~List is NULL, I have to pointer-dereference? 
[12:49:31] <kimundi> ezyang: SOmething like that list example _could_ also benefit from the null pointer optimization, but currentl< doesn't afaik
[12:49:33] <FreeFull> I don't think ~ pointers can be null
[12:49:36] <dbaupp> kimundi: (fwiw, it actually looks at the monomorphised variants, so Either<~T, ()> is also a nullable pointer)
[12:49:37] <FreeFull> Can they?
[12:49:48] <Ms2ger> dbaupp, oh, neat

[13:48:40] <dbaupp> ChrisMorgan: what? coincidences?
[13:48:53] <yorickpeterse> Ok so probably a dumb question but I can't find this in the manual: given you have the enum `enum Foo { Bar(~str) }`, how do you get the underlying string from Bar?
[13:48:56] <adridu59> do I need to unwrap my BufferedReader? doesn't seem to work
[13:48:57] <ChrisMorgan> Oh yes, they're dangerous too.
[13:49:08] <ChrisMorgan> yorickpeterse: matching.
[13:49:16] <cmr> yorickpeterse: match f { Bar(s) => { /* s is that string */ } }
[13:49:27] <cmr> yorickpeterse: you need to "destructure" the value.
[13:49:29] <yorickpeterse> Hm, no other way to do it?
[13:49:34] <cmr> no
[13:49:42] <yorickpeterse> hm
[13:49:52] <adridu59> not sure why you want another way
[13:49:56] *** Joins: tcr (tcr@7C181A70.200CF5B8.9D2C3D3E.IP)
[13:50:06] <cmr> you can of course write convenience methods, like unwrap on Option
[13:50:27] <ChrisMorgan> Note that the pattern Bar(s) will consume `f` (this can lead to errors mentioning things like partially moved values if you want to use it again later); if you just want a reference to it, Bar(ref s) (s will be of type &~str).
[13:50:31] <dbaupp> adridu59: how are you constructing it?
[13:50:36] <dbaupp> adridu59: and what is the error message?
[13:51:06] <yorickpeterse> Ah ok, thanks

[13:51:43] <ChrisMorgan> yorickpeterse: absolutely everything with enums is implemented with match, right down to things like Option.unwrap being basically `fn unwrap(self) -> T { match self { Some(v) => v, None => fail!("â€¦") } }`
[13:51:43] <adridu59> dbaupp: got it to work, I needed to unwrap on my read_line()

[13:57:30] <yorickpeterse> ok another question (hihi): where the hell do tests go? Servo seems to smack them in src/test, but it appears to be mostly HTML files, some other repositories don't seem to have any
[13:57:37] <dbaupp> adridu59: also, it should be `for line in reader.lines() { ... }`

[13:59:51] <dbaupp> adridu59: also, if you write `let mut it = line.words(); match (it.next(), it.next(), it.next()) { (Some(a), Some(b), None) => ..., _ => () }` you save allocating a (possibly huge) vector to store the words, when you're actually only interested in the first 3 elements.

[15:57:35] <diverse> arrrrrrrrr: the reasons for `box`, is because the developers had decided not to use sigils everywhere in their code for memory allocation. Having `let foo = box 10` or `let foo = box(Gc) 10` makes more sense, because it gives programmers better flexibility and describes better to the programmer as to what the code is really doing, it's placing and allocating value in the heap someway or another.

[18:55:17] <cmr> not a bug, feature.
[18:55:46] <yorickpeterse> is it correct that if I have an enum `enum Foo { Bar(~str) }` I can't do `impl Bar { ... }` ?
[18:55:55] <cmr> yorickpeterse: no, because Bar isn't a type.
[18:55:56] <cmr> Foo is the type.
[18:55:57] <yorickpeterse> or is that possible and do I just need a different syntax?
[18:56:00] <yorickpeterse> ah
[18:56:03] <yorickpeterse> bummer
[18:59:45] <yorickpeterse> Trying to see if I can get a struct to contain multiple types as values, currently have an enum + struct for that but unsure about it
[18:59:58] <yorickpeterse> since I'd like to define methods on the possible values, opposed to just global functions
[19:02:49] <yorickpeterse> Hm, guess I can have an enum of structs
[19:03:16] <cmr> also note struct-like variants.
[19:03:23] <cmr> enum Foo { Bar { a: uint, b: int } }
[19:03:37] <cmr> needs a feature flag
[19:04:09] <yorickpeterse> well, my use case is as following: I have types (= structs) A and B, which I'd like to box in X so that I can pass them around to different functions
[19:04:21] <yorickpeterse> their behaviour would be quite different, so traits wouldn't work I think
[19:04:30] <yorickpeterse> (also they would have to be stored in a hash or something)
[19:04:48] <yorickpeterse> Now I can just create a struct with 2 fields, but that will allocate more than needed if I'm not mistaken
[19:05:00] <yorickpeterse> but with an enum it gets a bit hairy too by the looks of it

[19:05:39] <cmr> What do you mean by hairy?
[19:06:31] <yorickpeterse> You'd get something like `enum Types { TypeA(A), TypeB(B) }; struct Value { value: Type }; impl A { ... }`
[19:06:48] <yorickpeterse> the alternative is `struct Value { as_a: A, as_b: B }`
[19:07:03] <cmr> those would have to be options unless you want to have them always valid.
[19:07:29] <yorickpeterse> Doesn't that still allocate memory for all fields upon initializing the struct?
[19:08:09] <cmr> with as_a etc, yes.
[19:10:14] <yorickpeterse> hmpf
[19:10:32] <cmr> not for the Type enum though.
[19:10:41] <yorickpeterse> I guess an enum of structs work, then I just have to come up with decent names for the options

[21:55:47] <diverse> that's awesome, I'm using tmux, so that would be really helpful
[21:56:12] <arrrrrrrrr> there is a thread on stackoverflow (?) with more options
[21:56:46] <masch> arrrrrrrrr: can be very bad, too. I'm using oh_my_zsh and turned it off because It doesn't fit my way of working with multiple terminals. 
[21:57:44] <arrrrrrrrr> masch: it doesn't update existing terminals. so you have unique history until you close it.
[21:57:50] <masch> can  be really frustrating if you just want to repeat the last command in one shell, hammer <up><enter> and it executes the command from a totally different shell
[21:58:09] <masch> arrrrrrrrr: i'm pretty sure it does
[21:58:09] <arrrrrrrrr> masch: you can make it update all terminals but I don't like that

[21:59:40] <diverse> got to love configurability
[21:59:53] <diverse> everybody's computing is different
[22:00:13] <yorickpeterse> so while this is compiling, Rust doesn't have some form of dynamic method dispatch does it (based on name, not types)? e.g. some_object.call("some_method", arg1, arg2, ...);
[22:00:24] <yorickpeterse> Function pointers are an option, but they're not very elegant when dealing with methods
[22:00:38] <yorickpeterse> you'd have to wrap them which would lead to code duplication
[22:00:54] <arrrrrrrrr> btw: why can't I extern "C" on a method?
[22:01:36] <cmr> yorickpeterse: no, it does not.
[22:01:57] <yorickpeterse> hmpf
[22:02:07] <cmr> yorickpeterse: I think it could be done with some dlsym hackery.
[22:02:14] <yorickpeterse> In D I basically had some disgusting template stuff that would generate D code during compilation for this
[22:02:16] <cmr> and a bunch of compiler magic.
[22:02:34] <yorickpeterse> give it a type and it would figure out the methods, their arguments and generate a big ass switch()
[22:03:02] <diverse> maybe look at macros?
[22:03:12] <cmr> macros can't inspect types.
[22:03:16] <cmr> you'd need to give it a method list.
[22:03:24] <yorickpeterse> can you even get function argument types in Rust?
[22:03:48] <Jarrett> there aren't any variadic generics :<
[22:03:58] <yorickpeterse> as in, `fn foo(number: int) { ... }; get_types(foo); => ["int"]` or something like that
[22:04:26] <cmr> yorickpeterse: well, not exactly like that, but there is the tydesc.

[22:40:58] <cmr> I saw
[22:41:10] <cmr> Mostly by people who don't seem to know the language.
[22:41:32] <cmr> Not that I disagree it's confusing.

[22:43:36] <yorickpeterse> so in layman terms, what does the &'r actually do? The tutorial is a bit..dense
[22:43:42] <yorickpeterse> (maybe that's the current time for me)
[22:44:03] <cmr> yorickpeterse: it's the lifetime of the self pointer.
[22:44:14] <cmr> it gives it a name.
[22:44:22] <cmr> so you can return a pointer with that same lifetime.
[22:45:02] <arrrrrrrrr> and it captures self in the calling block, right?
[22:45:41] <yorickpeterse> cmr: aha
[22:48:46] <rntz> is there any reason rust doesn't consider ^L (form feed) to be whitespace?
[22:49:13] <cmr> rntz: the whitespace grammar is very strict. just like the only valid input source is UTF-8
[22:49:19] <SiegeLord> It doesn't? It doesn't consider it a newline
[22:49:27] <SiegeLord> But I think it's still whitespace
[22:49:42] <rntz> cmr: okay... that's not really an explanation, just a statement.
[22:50:17] <cmr> whitespace_char : '\x20' | '\x09' | '\x0a' | '\x0d' ;
[22:50:58] <diverse> cmr: perhaps renaming `rustpkg` to `rustcrate` and `pkgid` to `crateid` would be a more accurate?
[22:50:59] <cmr> (wow, the grammar is actually accurate this time!)
[22:51:07] <cmr> diverse: or renaming it back to cargo :)
[22:51:18] <cmr> `rustcrate` makes 0 sense as a name.
[22:51:22] <diverse> ah I remember that
[22:52:06] <cmr> rntz: I don't know what other explanation to give. It's strict about what it accepts. Why that decision was made, I don't know, probably to keep the input sane.

[23:11:40] <jack> there's a crate_name??!?

[23:15:18] <diverse> no wonder that guy is so confused.
[23:15:44] <jack> (tup has Lua, scons has python, etc)
[23:16:26] <jack> Siege: if we used pkgid within the build tooling for rust as it is now, we'd probably just use python since that's already required by the build system.
[23:16:33] <jack> and then it would work on windows without any trouble.

[23:17:37] <jack> I used `sed` for my example because I figured people would yell if I made it depend on ${FAVORITE_SCRIPT_LANG}
[23:18:06] <diverse> So we have 3 layers here, modules, then crates which hold modules, and then packages which hold crates?
[23:18:10] <rntz> does rust have "as"-patterns? (haskell uses "@" for this, sml uses "at")
[23:18:17] <rntz> er, s/"at"/"as"/
[23:18:20] <jack> cmr: we're adding support for naming sub-parts of a package now, which aren't really packages.
[23:18:23] <cmr> rntz: we use @ too
[23:18:33] <cmr> rntz: match foo { x@bar => { ... } }
[23:18:41] <jack> So I think the reason pkgid is here is jsut because no one has had time to overhaul this whole thing yet.
[23:18:51] <SiegeLord> I doubt it'll look better in any other language
