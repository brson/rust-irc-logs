[00:08:07] <mib_c7l72k> when should you send a data structure to the child through a channel as opposed to cloning the structure prior to the child into a different variable, and using the variable in the child?
[00:08:56] <cmr> mib_c7l72k: send it if you don't need to use it yourself anymore.

[00:11:43] <mib_c7l72k> but some things, such as rwarc, are cloned when sent through the channel. this case confuses me

[00:12:12] <cmr> you would only clone it if you need to use it after sending it
[00:12:16] <cmr> RWArc represents shared data
[00:12:27] <cmr> cloning it creates another handle to the same data

[01:28:00] <cmr> o11c: how do you feel about the abovementioned "inherit use"? My only reservation with it is that now you have slightly-invisible scope creep.
[01:29:01] <o11c> allowing every crate to inject? Hm ...
[01:29:10] <cmr> no, not that.
[01:29:14] <cmr> `inherit use foo;`
[01:29:20] <cmr> `foo` is now in scope in every child module.
[01:29:28] <ChrisMorgan> inherit use foo; mod bar { /* foo is in scope */ }
[01:29:30] <o11c> you mean it's not already?
[01:29:33] <cmr> no.
[01:29:39] <o11c> I would expect 'use' to do that already
[01:29:42] <cmr> `use foo;` is only in scope for the current module.
[01:29:50] <o11c> since mods aren't like python's mods, sadly
[01:30:18] <cmr> maybe we don't even need `inherit use` and that should just be the default behavior of `use`
[01:30:23] <cmr> it seems to be what everyone expects.
[01:30:26] <o11c> if modules were like python (which I wish), it would be bad to allow it at all; but since mods are more like C++ I think it should happen for all 'use's
[01:30:51] <dougxxx> wont this end up with weird behaviour? Like, 3 directories deep people using modules that were imported by some obscure parent?
[01:31:13] <cmr> That's why I originally didn't think it should be the default.
[01:31:13] <o11c> dougxxx: but the current system forces you to have global knowledge anyway
[01:31:25] <o11c> there's no such thing as a local import

[01:31:45] <cmr> self and super navigate the module tree.
[01:31:59] <cmr> our module system is very analogous to a filesystem.
[01:32:03] <o11c> I mean, every external library must be declared at the top of your crate anyway
[01:32:10] <ChrisMorgan> Not true, actually.
[01:32:12] <cmr> `mod` is a symlink, `extern crate` is a mount
[01:32:34] <cmr> no, `use` is the symlink, `mod` is like a file
[01:32:41] <o11c> ChrisMorgan: then I"m all the more confused
[01:32:43] <cmr> or, a directory, actually.
[01:32:58] <cmr> o11c: you can have `extern crate foo;` anywhere.
[01:32:59] <dougxxx> I see what you mean, but if I open a .rs and there's a call blah() in it, how do I tell where its from? At least if use is at the top, I can hunt it down.
[01:33:04] <o11c> the last big argument was over the fact that it'sd impossible to have libraries bound only to the ones who need them
[01:33:11] <ChrisMorgan> `extern crate foo;` is actually *not* required to be at the crate root, though I can't really think when it would be a better idea to have it elsewhere.
[01:33:12] <o11c> cmr: ah, extern crate is not like mod
[01:33:26] <cmr> o11c: `mod foo;` is also allowed everywhere but it creates duplicates.
[01:33:30] <ChrisMorgan> o11c: c.f. https://github.com/chris-morgan/rust-http/pull/65
[01:33:42] <o11c> ChrisMorgan: no external code should be declared at the root; it should be as close to the code that uses it as possible
[01:33:46] <o11c> unfortunately, it's not possible yet
[01:34:01] <ChrisMorgan> (An example where someone used `extern crate url;` in multiple places where putting it in the root is a better idea.)
[01:34:18] <o11c> honestly, I'm getting mroe convinced that making the root no longer exist is the best
[01:35:04] <o11c> do it (sort of) the Java way, where 'main' is still in some normal package, but you specify "this is the main package for this compilation"

[03:21:41] <sinistersnare> how can i make my input variable live for longer than the match statement?
[03:22:11] <cmr> sinistersnare: the reason it isn't working is that by saying `let input: &str = &"";`
[03:22:17] *** Joins: zztr (Thunderbir@moz-CA50D606.dsl.static.sonic.net)
[03:22:32] <cmr> you are telling the compiler to infer an appropriate lifetime, since you left one out.
[03:22:57] <cmr> so it looks at the right-hand-side of the = and sees a string literal, which is constant
[03:23:02] <cmr> the lifetime of constand data is 'static
[03:23:11] <cmr> so it gives input the 'static lifetime
[03:23:38] <cmr> but when you say input = ....as_slice()

[03:24:28] <cmr> there's also no way that code could ever work, since the string returned by read_line() has no owner.

[10:51:49] <ChrisMorgan> All that I think is necessary is removing the background-color on .content and then adjusting pre.rust, pre.line-numbers' background-color to be a bit darker so it shows better once again.
[10:52:46] <TheHydroImpulse> Gotcha
[10:52:47] <ChrisMorgan> e.g. give them #f3f3f3, what .content has at present.

[12:00:16] <eddyb> kimundi: the question was more like "how do you create a ConstInt back from the result of arithmetic"
[12:00:22] <kimundi> ah
[12:00:30] <kimundi> yeah
[12:00:31] <eddyb> but I guess we can have wrappers. there might have been another concern
[12:00:39] <eddyb> but I can't remember that one
[12:00:46] <kimundi> hm, can macros expand to types?
[12:00:52] <eddyb> kimundi: not yet
[12:00:54] <huon> eddyb: generic literals are the issue
[12:00:59] <eddyb> one of the things I'd like to do

[12:04:02] <eddyb> hmm. &[T] as &Const<uint>
[12:04:09] <doomlord_> r.e. servo's issue with fat/thin pointers - has anyone suggested some sugar to get a vtable from a trait on its own, which can be manually embedded ... then you could just make a macro to do a c++ style virtual call. is that too horrible :)   I ask because in C++ i'd always wanted to be able to change vtable pointers (i'd done it aswell with various unsafe hacks much to the annoyance of coworkers :) )

[12:04:55] <doomlord_> is what i've just suggested along the lines of 'customizing layout'
[12:04:57] <eddyb> instead of introducing awkward semanatic features for every little thing like that

[12:07:36] *** lpy_ is now known as lpy
[12:07:58] <eddyb> I was thinking we could have a builtin "shadow" Vtable struct that would have one field per method

[12:12:54] <doomlord_> so this Many thing gets the vtable ? .. but as a &'() ?
[12:13:20] <eddyb> the &'static is for optimization
[12:13:27] <doomlord_> ahh, so you can manually compose it to make a trait object for a trait call ?
[12:13:38] <doomlord_> (at the call site)
[12:13:51] <eddyb> so the virtual function only returns a nullable pointer, instead of Option<*T>
[12:14:24] <eddyb> doomlord_: I return Option<&Trait> from the dyncast. it's a macro because I can't be generic over Trait :/
[12:15:05] <doomlord_> i didn't know of 'TypeId
[12:15:24] <eddyb> pretty sure DST will allow dyncast to be a method, just like Any
[12:15:37] <eddyb> doomlord_: the magic here is that you provide a set of traits
[12:15:57] <eddyb> in C++, it would be jumping from a base class to another

[13:48:27] <ChrisMorgan> Sure. Sorry, I didn't mention the context switch.
[13:48:37] <eddyb> _Y_: swap should be implemented on &mut [T]

[16:16:29] <eddyb> I might have missed this in the past
[16:16:39] <kmc> my threshold for asking on IRC rather than further doc reading is perhaps too low... y'all are too helpful :)

[16:19:20] <bstrie> being meaner is less effort
[16:19:27] <lkuper> the helpfulness of #rust may actaully be holding back the progress of the docs

[16:22:35] <bstrie> yeah
[16:22:38] <bstrie> gotta be near-1.0
[16:22:41] <bstrie> can't wait till after
[16:23:08] <cmr> to my knowledge, everything or almost everything new has docs

[16:24:34] <lkuper> bstrie: at least, a lot of stuff was getting checked off.  the quality of the newly added docs is another question, I guess, but it's better than it was

[18:20:23] <strcat> it should follow the IEEE754 total ordering
[18:20:37] <strcat> it can implement Ord/Eq differently and have TotalOrd/TotalEq (although those will be renamed)

[18:21:18] <strcat> whether it is saner is an open question
[18:21:51] <strcat> it's not implemented by hardware though so it's going to be slower
[18:21:53] <krdln> strcat: there is? I thougt that nans and zeros destroys totalness of ordering
[18:21:58] <strcat> I measured it and it wasn't enormously slower at least
[18:22:09] <strcat> krdln: they still define a total ordering
[18:22:32] <strcat> krdln: https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/5585 I copy-pasted the definition from the standard there
[18:22:36] <krdln> strcat: oh, with total ordering not matching ==, <...?
[18:22:53] <strcat> the totalOrder function defined there is <=, and you can implement the other operators too
[18:23:18] <strcat> krdln: yes
[18:23:34] <strcat> -0.0 is considered less than 0.0 in the alternate total order
[18:23:47] <strcat> not equal

[19:34:34] <glaebhoerl> kimundi: what's the difference here https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/10 between the comments by nick29581 and the ones by jfager and alexcrichton? Is one of them commit comments and the other line comments? (which?) 
[19:34:40] <myname> lol
[19:34:52] <eddyb> glaebhoerl: commit comments and diff comments
[19:35:02] <glaebhoerl> and line comments are a fourth thing?
[19:35:12] <eddyb> line comments are most likely diff comments

[19:35:40] <glaebhoerl> OK, so nicks' comments are commit comments, and alex's are diff comments. which ones will get lost if I git push -f an updated commit?

[19:36:29] <glaebhoerl> in any case I think I'll refrain from doing that because I don't want to lose any of the comments, this is just for future reference :)
[19:36:31] <kimundi> Actually, for rfcs where discussions are the most important thing, I'd not overwrite the history

[20:57:30] <gmaxwell> So, random rust question.  Say that my program has implemented some snazzy concurrent data structure via unsafe code which handles guaranteeing that all the locking is handled correctly, e.g. like RWArc. Then some safe rust code has grabed a lock via this code... and then suffers a task failure.  Now things deadlock because nothing cleaned up the lock.  Is this an actual issue or is there something I'm missing that addresses this?

[20:57:51] <Ms2ger> I think drop() is called on task failure?
[20:58:22] <kimundi> task failure runs destructors, which should resolve these situations

[20:59:07] <kimundi> I think for RWArc it poisons the box, so if another task tries to access it after the original accessor failed, it fails too.

[22:35:07] <mib_i9zgia> does anybody have a clue?
[22:35:08] <ChrisMorgan> mib_i9zgia: by default, stdout is line-buffered
[22:35:20] <mib_i9zgia> I know
[22:35:32] <mib_i9zgia> this is why I'm using std::io::stdout().flush();
[22:35:38] <ChrisMorgan> http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/master/std/io/stdio/fn.flush.html is probably what you want
[22:36:05] <ChrisMorgan> stdout().flush() should also work. What's the problem you're experiencing?
[22:36:44] <mib_i9zgia> you're right,  std::io::stdio::flush(); does work
[22:36:53] <o11c> mib_i9zgia: which version of rust are you using? It is strongly recommend to use master, not 0.9

[22:41:01] <mib_i9zgia> from the doc, I found that stdout is a LineBufferedWriter, which implements the "writer" trait

[23:45:13] <ChrisMorgan> kmc: not exactly like that.
[23:45:54] <ChrisMorgan> Lookahead must be done very carefully on a network resource because you can't trust the buffer to be full. You need to have read it all first.
[23:46:27] <kmc> yes

[23:46:51] <kmc> I have an abstraction over a queue of ~str that lets you ask if n characters are available, and get them if so
[23:46:53] <ChrisMorgan> My test suite when complete will include things like sending HTTP one packet per character…

[23:47:08] <kmc> I've heard that's a good way to circumvent certain web application firewalls...
[23:47:20] <ChrisMorgan> Wouldn't surprise me.
[23:47:32] <kmc> what my abstraction doesn't do yet is let you ask if the next n characters satisfy a predicate and only consume them if so
[23:47:42] <kmc> you have to pull n, check, and then put them back if not, paying the copy
[23:47:50] <kmc> I think this won't matter much in my application but I can fix that later, anyway
[23:48:06] <kmc> it would involve duplicating some of the "get next character" logic, or becoming more clever
[23:48:28] <kmc> this stuff is so much more fun with explicit memory management, fsvo 'fun'
