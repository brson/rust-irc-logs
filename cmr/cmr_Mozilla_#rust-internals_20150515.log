[00:23:02] <insaneinside> cmr: fair enough.
[00:23:19] <Eridius> doener: maybe it was written based on the assumption that LLVM would optimize it away, but it seems like a very silly thing to end up doing in debug builds
[00:23:52] <insaneinside> The code in question is at line 118 in <https://pastebin.mozilla.org/8833550>.  Is there a better way to be doing this?

[00:24:17] <XMPPwocky> re: an unconditional jump on the most common path: it can have a suprisingly huge impact
[00:24:18] <aatch> Eridius, a fair amount.
[00:24:35] <XMPPwocky> i did some testing with putting the stack--check code in the alignment gap
[00:24:49] <XMPPwocky> so if the stack check failed it'd jump *backwards* to before the prologue

[00:27:53] <Eridius> how does drop glue work on DST?
[00:28:13] <insaneinside> FlexBox stores a Sized value, and returns a Ref<'a,T>.

[00:29:31] <insaneinside> this landed.. yesterday, I think.
[00:29:57] <Eridius> ok, but you don't actually need to drop an unsized value, do you? The actual value you're working with is either a &Ref, which doesn't get dropped, or a Box<Ref>, which is a sized value

[00:35:33] <Eridius> insaneinside: can you use std::intrinsics::drop_in_place() to drop the value?
[00:35:59] <Eridius> you aren't erasing the contained type, so you don't really need to store the drop glue, do you?
[00:36:04] <rkruppe> Yurume: Basically I need to know if the table in grisu.rs can be tortured to give correctly rounded approximations of all powers of ten (that fit into f64)
[00:36:30] <rkruppe> From what I understand it only stores 10^x, 10^x+k, 10^x+2k for some k > 1
[00:36:51] <insaneinside> Eridius: not sure about that -- what happens when you store a coerced value?  (I'm thinking my code my currently drop the value twice!)
[00:36:59] <rkruppe> Which would be pretty much the opposite of what Clinger's parsing algorithm needs

[00:38:29] <insaneinside> What *is* the drop flag?
[00:39:13] <Eridius> for any type with Drop, it's a field that's overwritten with a particular bit pattern when the value is dropped
[00:39:27] <Yurume> rkruppe: it is safe to do so, because it asserts that (v * 10^(x+nk)) lies in the some range (probably 4 <= .. < 2^32)
[00:39:28] <Eridius> actually, I think the entire value is overwritten with that pattern (so as to cover the drop flags of any nested types as well)
[00:39:51] <Eridius> we used to just zero out the value, and the field held a value of 1 (I think) to indicate that it was live
[00:39:57] <Eridius> but now we use a special bit pattern instead
[00:40:09] <Yurume> rkruppe: Grisu uses this product to produce *both* integral parts (simple) and fractional parts (needs to track errors)
[00:40:24] <Eridius> and there's an attribute #[unsafe_no_drop_flag] that gets rid of the drop field and requires you to write your Drop impl such that it detects the drop flag itself (e.g. because you want to just re-use an existing field)

[03:08:25] <barosl> I've just got curious, is there a reason why rustc prints just `&-ptr` when it comes to describes type mismatch in brief?
[03:08:35] <barosl> Instead of a specific type
[03:08:47] <huon> because it's meant to focus on the &?
[03:09:03] <barosl> Hmm, possibly, but what I mean is
[03:09:14] <cmr> barosl: it focuses on the "outermost" part of the type that differs, I think.
[03:09:15] <barosl>     (expected &-ptr,
[03:09:15] <barosl>         found struct `collections::string::String`) [E0308]
[03:09:15] <huon> i.e. it's detected the difference is say &i32 vs. i32, and so wants to focus on the fact that the & is wrong
[03:09:30] <huon> (especially useful for very long e.g. iterator types)
[03:09:35] <barosl> And &str vs. String
[03:09:58] <barosl> huon, But it prints &-ptr even when the two compared types are fairly distinct
[03:09:58] *** Joins: tamird (textual@moz-gkumi9.dyn.optonline.net)
[03:11:04] <barosl> If one type is String and the other is &String, it makes sense to print just the &-difference
[03:11:08] *** Joins: p1start (p1start@moz-nftjhe.org)
[03:11:24] <barosl> But I don't think comparing &str and String should be done like that, but rustc does so

[03:12:17] <barosl> Well, it would be better to file this in an issue!
[03:12:45] <cmr> barosl: what do you think it should print in that case, the full type?
[03:13:12] <barosl> Yeah, I guess &str would be more convenient

[17:02:29] <Manishearth> WindowsBunny: that's actually quite common

[17:10:26] <Manishearth> O.o

[18:40:18] <Manishearth> we don't have one
[18:40:27] <Manishearth> Eridius: no core team members in the mod team
[18:40:29] <Eridius> oh? I thought all subteams had a lead
[18:40:38] <steveklabnik> the mod team is different
[18:40:39] <Eridius> hmm, I suppose that makes sense in a way

[18:42:21] <Manishearth> oh that
[18:42:21] <Manishearth> yeah
[18:42:29] <kmc> since the CoC has included enforcement on GitHub from the start
[18:42:44] <Eridius> rather an organization Owner
[18:42:44] <kmc> it's in scope, it just has never been done :P
[18:42:46] <Manishearth> kmc: it is. We have the "email github" thing already, though that's slow.
[18:43:01] <Manishearth> kmc: one idea is to write a bot  that deletes comments as they come in
[18:43:59] <Eridius> Manishearth: I would really hope we don't get to the point where we have someone who's so intentionally abusive that they start spamming bad comments enough to be a problem that the turnaround time with GitHub support is an issue :/

[18:44:31] *** Joins: nodweber (nodweber@moz-knt.fgq.178.5.IP)
[18:44:35] <kmc> Rust is trying to replace C and C++
[18:44:43] <Manishearth> Eridius: well, moderation is a realtime thing -- and the longer you wait, the worse it gets (more people are sucked in)
[18:44:46] <kmc> now imagine the worst 0.1% of people in the world who use C and C++
[18:44:53] <Eridius> our problem so far hasn't been intentional vandals, just unrepetant offenders (the only vandalism that comes to mind is what's-his-name mass-closing all his tickets)
[18:44:54] <Manishearth> of course, we can lock the thread
[18:45:02] <kmc> and imagine some fraction are even using Rust against their preference
[18:45:07] <Manishearth> so put all the tools together, and we have something that should cover almost all scenarios
[18:46:06] <Manishearth> Eridius: intentional vandals will be a problem too. When github discussions go viral (eg someone posts on HN and then the world converges on it), I've seen venom spill out onto other threads once the first one is locked
[18:46:33] <Manishearth> But again, almost all situations with such users can be handled using a conjunction of locking and emailing GH
[18:46:50] <Amaranth> iirc the problem with a bot that deletes all comments is that github has an API access limit
[18:47:02] <Manishearth> hm
[18:47:04] <Amaranth> So if multiple people are doing it at once you need multiple bot accounts to counteract it
[18:47:04] <kmc> locking exists because of an incident where that happened, in fact
[18:47:14] <Eridius> my point is basically that writing a moderation bot like that is a fair amount of work (largely because you need to then test it appropriately), and it's unclear how likely we are to actually need it
[18:47:28] <Eridius> kmc: locking exists because of an incident with one of the github founders, I thought
[18:47:35] <Manishearth> Eridius: yea, but we can do without a bot for now, and work on it slowly
[18:47:49] <kmc> Eridius: it's not "unclear" whether some kind of solution for blocking is needed
[18:47:58] <kmc> the moderators have repeatedly been caught completely unprepared
[18:47:58] <Eridius> also, just to note, even with a perfect bot, emails would still get sent containing all of the bad comments
[18:48:02] *** Joins: Rym (y@moz-aun.38r.38.217.IP)
[18:48:10] <kmc> and it's a convenient excuse for people who are fine with the status quo
[18:48:17] <Eridius> kmc: there is a solution for blocking. It's just not great. But it exists and it should be used
[18:48:27] <kmc> the members of the moderation teem need to figure out how to enforce the CoC *before* there's another issue
[18:48:30] <Manishearth> Eridius: locking solves that; the issue is with new threads being started

[18:49:33] <Manishearth> kmc: we've already figured out deescalation and all. Unlike the previous times, deescalation can be coupled with a warning and a note that continued behavior of that kind will be met with a ban
[18:49:49] <Manishearth> That *should* cover most cases
[18:49:58] <kmc> well there are a lot of valid reasons to dislike / not use Rust, but probably the most popular *bad* reason, and one that motivates a lot of trolling, is the whole "well *I* don't make mistakes" thing
[18:50:13] <Manishearth> and if that person continues, we can email GH and then lock the relevant threads

[18:50:20] <Manishearth> kmc: lol
[18:50:23] <Eridius> I certainly hope that giving appropriate warnings from an appropriately-authoritative source (i.e. the moderation team) can deescalate

[18:51:19] <barosl> kmc, I think that's a truth to a degree. "sufficiently smart C++ programmer" will code C++ just fine, without making any mistakes ever and never :)
[18:51:22] <kmc> it's something that affects everyone, not just the people who willfully ignore advances in the field
[18:51:35] <kmc> barosl: even if it is true: A) why do you want to spend your time on that instead of, you know, solving problems
[18:51:55] <Manishearth> barosl: where sufficient = over 9000? :P
[18:52:00] <kmc> B) how many of those "sufficiently smart" programmers work for NSA/GCHQ/China/Iran/Israel, and how many work on Bash or OpenSSL
[18:52:10] <rkruppe> Though I also think the way we (i.e., a lot of people) promote Rust as /preventing/ you from making mistakes in bondage-and-discipline manner is suboptimal
[18:52:15] <Eridius> I've long thought that multithreading issues (especially data races) are the single biggest problem for the immediate future of program development. Even when you have libraries that make multithreading relatively easy (such as libdispatch on OS X/iOS), it's far too easy to screw up and access data from the wrong place. And it's one of the hardest things to debug

[19:53:34] <Eridius> hopefully the bug can be fixed

[22:38:40] *** Joins: ncarrillo (textual@moz-mke7jn.cable.rcn.com)
[22:39:15] <acrichto> doener: oh just in the sense that the "base pointer" of arithmetic comes from the slice itself, but we could ignore that entirely and just manufacture one out of thin air (e.g. 0x1)
[22:42:14] <doener> acrichto: I didn't want to tie the intrinsic to zero-sized types or "meaningless" pointers, but eddyb suggested something along the lines of translating all pointers to zero-sized items as 0x1. I didn't know where/how to implement that though. Might want to do that later, as using 0x1 instead of the actual pointer for the "start" pointer in the iterator is indeed important for best optimizations

[22:49:11] <cmr> Oh I think I was thinking of DST coercions, not Deref coercions.
[22:49:15] <cmr> Yeah definitely.
[22:49:17] <aturon> cmr: huon: that spec is correct
[22:49:39] <cmr> aturon: thanks!
[22:50:30] <acrichto> doener: so it's not undefined beahvior to use 0x1 and then gep inbounds on it?
[22:50:32] <aturon> (one open question is how/whether we might want upcasting coercions to play into this as well -- right now we have methods on e.g. Box<Any> and separately Box<Any + Send> because dispatch doesn't try to upcast away the + Send)
[22:50:45] <acrichto> doener: I figured that .iter()/.iter_mut() could just ignore the pointer in &self and always manufacture 0x1 for 0-sized types
[22:52:08] <Eridius> acrichto: I thought it was in fact undefined behavior to upse gep inbounds to construct a pointer that's out of bounds of the object, even if you never dereference it
[22:52:17] <doener> acrichto: with inbounds gep, it's undefined, but should be fine without inbounds
[22:52:27] <Eridius> (which would suggest that it's undefined behavior to use gep on a garbage pointer because there's no valid bounds)
[22:52:39] <doener> acrichto: that's what that PR does
[22:52:40] <acrichto> doener: ah ok, then it wouldn't help much for this patch, I was hoping to avoid adding that intrinsic just yet, but oh well!
[22:52:49] <cmr> Eridius: it's up to the address space to define what that means.

[23:35:30] <nrc> can anyone help me with a makefile question?
[23:35:33] <nrc> I have $(CARGO) build
[23:35:37] <huon> unwound: you're bkoporoff, right?
[23:36:02] <nrc> as a target, but make interprests build as a target rather than a literal (please excuse nomenclature mistakes)
[23:36:12] <nrc> so searches for `build` which it doesn't find
[23:36:42] <nrc> how do I get it to just execute `cargo build` (assuming $CARGO == cargo)?
[23:36:54] <Eridius> I'm confused. Where are you putting this?
[23:37:20] <Eridius> are you saying something like `all: $(CARGO) build`?
[23:37:28] <nrc> yes, exactly
[23:37:37] *** Joins: pnkfelix (pnkfelix@moz-eljppb.fbx.proxad.net)

[23:37:46] <huon> also, what's jakub-'s irc nick?
[23:38:01] <Eridius> you should say something like `all: target/debug/foo` and then have a separate `target/debug/foo:\n\t$(CARGO) build`
[23:38:25] <Eridius> or you could say `all:\n\t$(CARGO) build`
[23:38:32] <Eridius> (but I like being a little more explicit in my makefiles)
[23:38:41] <Eridius> note that if you do use target/debug/foo you'll want to mark it as .PHONY as well
[23:38:46] <Eridius> `.PHONY: target/debug/foo`
[23:38:55] <Eridius> unless you want to try and build a dependencies file so Makefile knows when it needs to be rebuilt
[23:39:02] <nrc> I have the \n\t in there and it still looks for build target
[23:39:44] <Eridius> when you say `all: foo bar` the "foo bar" are dependencies. If you say `all:\n\tfoo bar` the "foo bar" is a command. If make is looking for a target named build then you probably listed it as a dependency
[23:40:19] <Eridius> nrc: here's an example of a Makefile I have for one of my projects: https://github.com/kballard/alfred-unicode-info/blob/master/Makefile
[23:40:28] <nrc> Eridius: verbatim, I have https://pastebin.mozilla.org/8833686
[23:41:10] <Eridius> nrc: that will try and execute the line `$(CARGO) build`, which sounds fine, except you haven't defined CARGO anywhere
[23:41:10] <nrc> oh wait
[23:41:14] <Eridius> so it will actually execute ` build`
[23:41:15] <nrc> I'm being dumb
[23:41:27] <nrc> I am running this from a script and
[23:41:33] <nrc> I fogot to export CARGO
[23:41:36] * Eridius chuckles
[23:41:39] <nrc> I just set it
[23:41:42] <nrc> d'oh
[23:41:51] <nrc> thanks for helping, anyway
[23:41:52] <Eridius> the error message presumably was telling you that it couldn't find a binary named `build` to execute, rather than not being able to find a Makefile target
