[01:46:18] <gw> we need a better way to detect when it's safe to save the screenshot for reftests. it's currently so full of race conditions depending on when threads send messages to/from the compositor :(
[01:47:40] <jdm> we could just constantly save screenshots, and the most recent one will win at the time we quit
[01:47:51] <jdm> but maybe then the problem is deciding when to quit :)
[01:49:05] <gw> it's highly tempting to say something like the compositor waits for 10 frames to all render the same, then assumes it has hit steady state and saves the screenshot. I think this would be more reliable than what we currently have :|
[01:50:56] <gw> another thought could be to have a global atomic ref count that script / layout / paint increment / decrement whenever they are doing work. which I think would work fine, but not so much when we go multi-process

[02:15:08] <njn> man, rustc really needs to get smart about not recompiling every other crate if you change something that's not in a crate's public interface
[02:16:05] <njn> imagine if everything that depends on foo.h got rebuilt every time you touched foo.cpp
[02:16:32] <jdm> njn: my understanding is that it's tough because of the way cross-crate inlining occurs
[02:16:41] <jdm> we basically serialize the AST
[02:16:50] <njn> jdm: I'm surprised cross-crate inlining is a thing
[02:16:57] <jdm> it's a very important thing

[02:19:36] <jdm> njn: so we could split most of util::memory into an isolated crate, if that's code you find yourself changing often
[02:20:08] <jdm> the SizeOf trait would need to stay in util, but the rest of the memory task could be built standalone in seconds and just linked to the main servo crate
[02:20:35] <jdm> well, SizeOf could go in a memory_traits crate, too
[02:20:50] <jdm> and then you wouldn't need to build everything that depends on util, either

[12:59:44] *** Quits: mystor (mystor@moz-ldavpp.home3.cgocable.net) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[13:03:51] <larsberg> np, sorry it'll take a few hours :-/
[13:05:15] <Manishearth> Not planning to do any rustupping until later anyway
[13:05:24] <Manishearth> though I could get the nightly and do it
[13:07:12] <Manishearth> larsberg: since we already have a nightly builder, would it make sense to have a nightly valgrind-all-the-things run?
[13:07:44] <Manishearth> just so that we can bisect as needed
[13:08:13] <larsberg> Manishearth: relatedly, it'd be nice to have valgrind/perf/power/mem running, say, nightly for exactly that reason
[13:08:27] <Manishearth> yeah, that
[13:08:39] <Manishearth> by valgrind I meant memory/perf measurement
[13:08:43] <larsberg> Not sure if we want to do it on the main builders (if they're idle, which they often are around midnight US Pacific time) or not, but seems like a good place to start with them
[13:08:59] <Manishearth> isn't the nightly builder separate?
[13:09:23] <Manishearth> i.e. the doc builder
[13:09:33] <larsberg> valgrind is a suite of tools, the most commonly-used of which detect improper memory usage. There's also cachegrind which tells you about clownshoes memory accesses/memory layouts, etc.
[13:09:44] <Manishearth> ah okay
[13:09:53] *** Joins: jviereck (Adium@moz-b2q0pq.ethz.ch)
[13:10:12] <Manishearth> Yeah, setting up the build on servo-head seems to make sense, that builder is pretty idle anyway
[13:10:14] <larsberg> I guess we could try massif as well, though I haven't had a ton of luck with it (maybe njn has)
[13:10:24] * Manishearth doesn't know all these tools
[13:11:09] <Manishearth> I wonder what jmaher would say
[13:11:13] * larsberg wrote labs teaching groups of a hundred undergrads at a time how to use these tools :-)
[13:11:32] <Manishearth> hah
[13:11:36] <larsberg> which basically just means I know every possible way they fail on trivial inputs
[13:11:43] <Manishearth> lol
[13:12:13] <Manishearth> yeah, after TAing an intro CS course I now know all the ways to trick people via operator precedence and VLAs and whatnot

[18:10:50] <crowbot> Issue #5093: Servo will do reflow 3x at startup - https://github.com/servo/servo/issues/5093

[18:25:34] <larsberg> Savago: Image loading is asynchronous, even for local files; you may be hitting race conditions for when the load completes, as completing the load will force a reflow
[18:26:24] <Savago> larsberg: if we know the size of the image (e.g. the attributes width/height) do we need a reflow when we are done loading the image?
[18:26:25] <larsberg> (this is part of why I made totally hacky synchronous resource loaders that we use in the reftest codepath, just to avoid some of that madness)

[18:27:35] <Savago> larsberg: and another question: is it just my impression or the ImageCache needs some love?
[18:27:36] <larsberg> Savago: I suspect we wouldn't need a reflow, but whether incremental reflow is good enough to notice that the actual loaded width/height are the same as the ones declared on the img element and to skip the reflow is unlikely
[18:27:59] * Savago almost getting crazy trying to figure it out why cnn has some many reflows.
[18:28:06] <larsberg> Savago: ImageCache is definitely one of the poor unloved places of servo
[18:28:43] <Savago> I have the gut feeling that some of this crazyness could be fixed if ImageCache went through an overhaul.
[18:29:07] <Ms2ger> Congratulations! You own the image cache now
[18:29:25] <Savago> oh my god! What have I done!
[18:29:28] * Savago runs fast.
[18:29:29] <larsberg> It may paritally be all the image loads, honestly :-) You can rule it out by tweaking the code locally to make them synchronous - https://github.com/servo/servo/blob/master/components/servo/lib.rs#L97-L103

[18:35:39] <Savago> larsberg: another thing. WebKit has page navigation caching (e.g. when you navigate Back and Forward, it store the RenderTree/JS state/etc in memory, so navigation is instantaneous).
[18:35:48] <Savago> It would be nice to have something similar in servo.
[18:36:05] <pcwalton> we have that
[18:36:08] <pcwalton> unless somebody regressed it
[18:36:09] <larsberg> Savago: pcwalton has been looking at doing displaylist caching for back/forward navigation
[18:36:15] <pcwalton> we have it! don't implement it!
[18:36:16] <pcwalton> fix it :)
[18:36:18] <pcwalton> if it's broken
[18:36:26] <pcwalton> the pipeline stores back/forward pages in memory
[18:36:29] <pcwalton> as well as full display lists
[18:36:34] <pcwalton> this is better than what WebKit does
[18:36:37] <Savago> pcwalton: even beter (I’m supposing it should be easier to fix than rewrite).
[18:36:37] <pcwalton> because WebKit only stores the render tree
[18:36:45] <pcwalton> we however store the display list
[18:36:50] <pcwalton> so we have no need to build display lists again
[18:36:51] * jdm is not aware of any regressions in that
[18:36:52] <pcwalton> we just repaint
[18:36:55] <pcwalton> me either
[18:36:58] <pcwalton> it may already be working
[18:37:29] * Savago should re-build miniservo to test it.
[18:37:54] <jdm> Savago: you can test it in regular servo too

[18:40:34] <Savago> my build must be bOrKed (if I click in a link, the cpu spikes to 200% and nothing happens).

[18:46:20] <jack> Savago: What window manager / OS are you using?
[18:46:48] <jack> I get two reflows from i3wm because it tiles then pops out to a floating window at hte requested size.
[18:46:58] <Savago> jack: OSX.
[18:46:59] <jack> So that isn't Servo's fault at all
[18:47:30] <jack> Hm. OS X should just give you a window at the desired size. If we are asking for a window at XxY and getting a window at a different size, it might be a glutin bug.
[18:47:40] <jack> Can you test the rustup branch? It has a much newer glutin
[18:47:55] <pcwalton> Savago: yup, r+
[18:48:16] <Savago> jack: sure, is it rustup_20150311?
[18:48:34] <jack> Savago: yes
[18:50:57] <Savago> pcwalton: done.
[18:52:00] <Savago> jack: if in fact it is glutin fault, it may make sense to rename the bug to ‘research possible unneeded reflows’ or something?
[18:53:18] * jdm doesn't understand why running `./mach test tests/content/test_caption.html` triggers an overflow failure and `components/servo/target/servo -z -f tests/content/test_caption.html` does not

[18:53:44] <mbrubeck> Poll: Should `mach build` (and `mach test-ref` and others?) set a positive "nice" level by default?
[18:54:24] <Savago> mbrubeck: will it allow you to renice to a bigger priority at startup?
[18:54:27] <mbrubeck> jdm: Different "window" sizes?  Or it's in code that's not run at all in headless mode?
[18:54:49] <mbrubeck> Savago: I'm just talking about nicing rustc and test harnesses.
[18:54:57] <mbrubeck> For those of us who us our computers for other things too :)
[18:55:05] <Savago> yeah, that is the point. I want the tests to run as fast as possible.
[18:55:20] <jdm> mbrubeck: -z is headless
[18:55:29] <jdm> and the overflow is from running JS
[18:55:31] <Savago> (generally I stop and have a cup of coffee while waiting for the tests to be over).
[18:55:33] <jdm> so it doesn't make any sense to me
[18:55:42] <mbrubeck> Got it.  Well, I can just keep running `nice ./mach build`
[18:56:00] <mbrubeck> It gives me warm fuzzy feelings anyway. :)
[18:56:08] <Savago> :-)
[18:56:27] <mbrubeck> jdm: I'm building the rustup branch now, will see if I can figure anything out...
[18:57:17] <jack> Savago: well that specific double reflow may be something ew have to accept and fix upstream, but certainly you found found others that are real bugs in Servo :)
[18:57:53] <jdm> mbrubeck: gah. we build opt by default now or something
[18:58:05] <jdm> so I had to run components/servo/target/debug/servo
[18:58:17] <jdm> who made that change and didn't announce it :(
[18:58:43] <jdm> or maybe that's part of upgaded cargo or something
[18:58:43] <mbrubeck> jdm: Cargo changed to target/release and target/debug
[18:58:48] <mbrubeck> instead of target/release and target

[22:07:17] <jdm> the thing to avoid is the script task continuing to process other events after sending your message and potentially tearing down the document
[22:07:50] <gw> njn: join_layout is what you need in that case - it will block the script task until layout returns
[22:08:00] <njn> jdm: this will need to be similar to Reflow events. How is that that avoided for Reflow events?
[22:08:24] <jdm> njn: gw: join_layout requires some setup to be meaningful
