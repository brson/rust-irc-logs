[17:08:49] <lonecub2131> Hello everyone. I would like to start learning Rust. And contributing/bug-fixing Servo seems to be a decent place to start, yes? Oh and I have only worked with dynamic languages throughout my carrier and this should be fun.
[17:15:55] <bstrie> lonecub2131: hello!
[17:16:13] <bstrie> lonecub2131: which languages have you used before?
[17:16:16] <lonecub2131> bstrie: Hi
[17:16:30] <lonecub2131> PHP, Python, Javascript
[17:16:52] <bstrie> what interests you about rust?
[17:16:54] <lonecub2131> And a Linux geek
[17:18:15] <lonecub2131> I love mozilla and they believe in innovating. Plus, Rust seems something fresh
[17:18:59] <bstrie> I too came from a python/javascript/php background
[17:19:04] <bjz> we get quite a few pythoners
[17:19:05] <bstrie> with a helping of java
[17:19:06] <lonecub2131> Hahah ...
[17:19:24] <bstrie> first question: have you heard the word "pointer" before??
[17:20:10] <bstrie> because if so, then you're set. there's nothing more I can teach you.
[17:20:17] <lonecub2131> Yep. I did some reading on smart, managed and reference pointers in rust. I do have a basic understanding of pointers and memory management in C
[17:20:30] <bstrie> ok awesome
[17:20:53] <bjz> pointers are easier to understand in rust than c
[17:20:56] <lonecub2131> But, what really got me interested is the whole concurrency part in Rust. And other goodies like pipes
[17:21:07] <bstrie> bjz: I think the pythoners are the ones suffering most from painful concurrency at the moment
[17:21:16] <bjz> :)
[17:21:23] <lonecub2131> I can see this is where the future in programming is heading to. Especially in the web dev area
[17:21:46] <bstrie> lonecub2131: have you gone over the rust tutorial?
[17:21:56] <bstrie> http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/tutorial.html
[17:22:16] <lonecub2131> I try to when I find some free time. The day job keeps me busy most of the times
[17:23:05] <lonecub2131> When do you think we will be closer to Rust 1.0 stable?
[17:23:22] <saati> lonecub2131: that's still a long time
[17:23:26] <jeaye> bjz: I don't agree with that. :P
[17:23:39] <saati> look at the milestones on the issue tracker
[17:25:46] <lonecub2131> Yeeep ...
[17:28:25] <lonecub2131> Since, I have not read the entire tutorial so excuse me for being naive. But, can rust work on system subprocess at the moment? I was thinking of starting with writing some automated build tools that I use at work. Except they are in Python at the moment.
[17:28:39] <bstrie> lonecub2131: define "stable". I'm forecasting less than a year before the language itself becomes backward compatible. the libraries becoming backward compatible will take much longer.
[17:28:58] <bstrie> however, rust is being used for servo right now, so if all you care about is contributing to servo, then stability isn't an impediment
[17:30:26] <lonecub2131> I see. I mean, more like production ready however, this is already discussion on this in few forums. So, that question is redundant
[17:30:35] <bstrie> lonecub2131: are they only for personal use? I'd hate to saddle someone else with maintaining pre-alpha rust code :)
[17:31:27] <lonecub2131> LOL, yep for personal use only. I have them for my own sanity.
[17:32:28] <saati> lonecub2131: the backwards compatible milestone is pretty far away so expect the need to rewrite and update them as rust matures
[17:33:19] <bstrie> lonecub2131: I'm not certain how much support rust has for subprocesses at the moment, the I/O system is being completely overhauled right now
[17:33:51] <lonecub2131> interesting
[17:34:04] <bstrie> lonecub2131: perhaps http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/std/run.html has something
[17:35:13] <bstrie> lonecub2131: also, just so you know, the rust developers (some of whom are also servo developers) hang out on the official channel on irc.mozilla.org. so if you have a question and nobody's answering in here, try there instead (it's almost always active)
[17:36:12] <lonecub2131> Perhaps, it's better to stick with contributing to Servo. I have not even compiled it on my system yet. It will be better for everyone if I come back with non-noobish questions.
[17:36:35] <bstrie> lonecub2131: for servo development, there's #servo on irc.mozilla.org
[17:36:43] <lonecub2131> Oh nice. I will probably lurk around the mozilla irc channel
