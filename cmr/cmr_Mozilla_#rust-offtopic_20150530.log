[02:58:37] <Tobba> still

[03:02:10] <Zoxc> hey, norwegian is on duolingo now :D
[03:03:05] <c74d> In Beta, but yes.

[03:04:35] <Zoxc> Esperanto, but no Russian

[03:11:37] <c74d> Though the Irish course is missing many pronunciations even though it's out of beta.
[03:11:54] <Zoxc> french
[03:12:00] <c74d> oh
[03:12:17] <c74d> …unexpected.
[03:12:37] <c74d> That being the number-two course.
[03:13:49] <Zoxc> it's probably just not a feature of flashcards (yet?)
[03:13:58] <c74d> Zoxc: I recommend checking whether Wiktionary or some other dictionary has pronunciations of the words that Duolingo doesn't have pronunciations for.
[03:14:14] <c74d> Oh, Duolingo flashcards is something other than the normal lessons?

[06:37:43] <XMPPwocky> Quxxy: what's that do
[06:38:06] <Quxxy> Lets you embed a Cargo.toml in a source file, then run it without having to set up a whole package
[06:38:13] <Quxxy> It also caches the result
[06:38:30] <XMPPwocky> ah, neato
[06:38:56] <Quxxy> Also, just tested: cargo script --expr 42
[06:39:36] <Astrum|Lap> is setting up a package really that hard?
[06:40:14] <Quxxy> Astrum|Lap: It means having to create a directory for every little thing you want to do the moment you need an external package
[06:40:34] <Astrum|Lap> ah
[06:40:50] <Quxxy> It also precludes Rust from being used as a "script" language

[06:59:11] <niconii> i thought you meant `cargo script` itself precludes that, and got really confused, heh
[06:59:54] <Astrum|Lap> hobbled without cargo?
[06:59:58] <Quxxy> Also, you can now add line numbers to files: cat thing | cargo script --count --loop '|l,n| println!("{:>6}: {}", n, l.trim_right())'
[07:00:13] <niconii> Astrum|Lap: in the sense that you can't make use of dependencies easily
[07:00:31] <Quxxy> Astrum|Lap: Aye; cargo script alone has... *11* dependencies

[10:14:56] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: Windows 10 upgrades conhost significantly
[10:15:12] <WindowsBunny> It doesn't add support for surrogate characters though
[10:15:14] <Quxxy> WindowsBunny: Yes, now it's caught up to the 80's with not-insane selection support
[10:15:16] <Quxxy> *and resizing*
[10:15:20] <WindowsBunny> yeah :D
[10:15:37] <Quxxy> Seriously, I wanted to find and beat the halfwits going on about how great the upgrades were
[10:15:55] <VShell> I still prefer just firing up the Powershell IDE thing when I want a shell in Windows. >.>
[10:15:57] <Quxxy> It's like praising someone because, at age 30, they've *finally* worked out how to not poo all over the floor
[10:16:57] <WindowsBunny> VShell: PowerShell uses conhost
[10:17:24] <WindowsBunny> VShell: So it's no better, it just has a different shell on the inside with different commands and syntax
[10:17:51] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: Hey, if you finally figured out how to not poo on the floor, that's great news!
[10:17:57] <VShell> WindowsBunny: the Powershell ISE is its own thing and does not implement a proper terminal at all (i.e. you couldn't run vim in it), and is specifically not built on conhost.

[10:22:32] <WindowsBunny> >Many people consider CMD, PowerShell, or their favorite alternate  command line as the console, but it is more subtle than that. Each of  these are character-mode applications that run within conhost.exe, the  console host, otherwise known simply as the console.

Powershell is a set of .Net libraries that implement command processing, etc. powershell.exe is simply a small wrapper which implements a REPL on top of conhost, but there's other REPLs like the Powershell ISE.
[10:23:24] <Quxxy> WindowsBunny: Mr. Edd works at Microsoft?
[10:24:01] <WindowsBunny> VShell: This Powershell ISE doesn't ship with every windows install
[10:24:06] <WindowsBunny> because its definitely not on mine
[10:24:12] <VShell> WindowsBunny: there's even a Powershell REPL that runs in a web browser now, called Powershell Web Access.
[10:24:56] <WindowsBunny> VShell: I refuse to acknowledge the existence of PowerShell running in environments other than conhost
[10:25:03] <VShell> :P
[10:25:48] <VShell> WindowsBunny: you running Win8?

[10:27:22] <WindowsBunny> oh gawd, the gui is horrible
[10:27:47] * VShell rolls eyes
[10:27:48] <WindowsBunny> it reminds me of the aero excesses of the windows 7 days
[10:28:02] <WindowsBunny> every toolbar has a gradient
[10:28:21] <WindowsBunny> Its horrifying
[10:28:24] <Quxxy> WindowsBunny: I thought that was late 2k, early XP days
[10:28:38] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: Okay, its from XP days then
[10:28:40] <WindowsBunny> even worse!
[10:28:47] <Quxxy> WindowsBunny: Do you remember those AX libraries that implemented *every* kind of toolbar styling that MS had ever used in Office?
[10:28:55] <Quxxy> "Which year of Office do you want to look like?"
[10:29:02] <Quxxy> It was *insane*
[10:29:03] <WindowsBunny> :|
[10:29:17] <WindowsBunny> The only styling I want is the latest modern Windows styling
[10:29:30] <Quxxy> You want flat colours and buttons the size of soup cans?
[10:29:49] <Quxxy> ...on the off chance an elephant wants to operate the computer with its ass?
[10:30:22] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: I like the flat colors
[10:30:40] <Quxxy> I find metro interfaces a pain to visually read
[10:30:44] <Quxxy> There's... no definition
[10:30:48] <Quxxy> No separation between anything
[10:30:51] <Quxxy> It's just... type soup
[10:31:15] <Quxxy> But I have a special hate for the whole "buttons that look like text but aren't" shtick
[10:31:27] <Quxxy> At least fake hyperlinks were blue and underlined
[10:31:37] <Quxxy> Now it's just... random bits of text are clickable because they just are

[10:37:21] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: Hey, I have my mouse turned up to a high dpi
[10:37:27] <WindowsBunny> so buttons I can easily click on are a relief
[10:38:12] <Quxxy> WindowsBunny: Is that why the metro file dialog *in fullscreen* shows something like 1/16th the information that a default-sized Win 7 dialog does?
[10:38:46] <Quxxy> Sounds like you need to play more vidya james
[10:39:53] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: the file dialog looks fine to me http://i.imgur.com/SmUlu42.png
[10:40:02] <Quxxy> That's not the metro one
[10:40:09] <Quxxy> That's the legacy desktop one
[10:40:16] <WindowsBunny> "legacy"
[10:40:33] <Quxxy> I'm just repeating what I've read Microsoft saying :)
[10:40:55] <Quxxy> This is basically the #1 reason metro makes me *really* nervous
[10:40:56] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: I do like using a start screen instead of a start menu
[10:41:14] <Quxxy> If it was a skin for tablets, I wouldn't care
[10:41:21] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: http://i.imgur.com/BD4QbwK.jpg
[10:41:28] <Quxxy> It's the idea that this is the future: crippled usability and information density
[10:42:24] <VShell> Quxxy: Windows 10 more-or-less returns to "desktop is king" on desktops, I believe. at the least, you can actually have Metro apps in windows.
[10:42:32] <Quxxy> For me, all that does is destroy context; more than half the time, I just start stuff from Win+R
[10:43:05] <Quxxy> VShell: I would say, based on the last TP I used, that it's more usable than 8, but less usable than 7
[10:43:24] <Quxxy> They've gone back toward 7, but they still changed/worsened things relative to it
[10:43:37] <VShell> Quxxy: I'm sure you said 7 was less usable than XP, too, though. :p
[10:43:50] <Quxxy> VShell: Actually, no, I upgraded during the previews
[10:43:56] * VShell nods.
[10:44:04] <Quxxy> I was pissed that they changed the behaviour of Backspace in Explorer, but it was otherwise worth it
[10:44:16] <Quxxy> 10 I'm still bullish on
[10:44:30] <Quxxy> I can't think of a single feature from it I want
[10:44:37] <Quxxy> But I *can* think of things I *don't* want
[10:45:30] <VShell> ... Windows 10 has Cortana, to "replace the embedded search feature". wut. so... am I not going to be able to search my files unless I'm connected to the Internet?
[10:46:27] <Quxxy> VShell: When I tried to use it, it told me that it wasn't available in my country and that I should use the settings to disable it
[10:46:32] <VShell> ...
[10:46:40] <Quxxy> The settings window told me it wasn't available in my country and that I should use the settings to disable it
[10:46:46] <Quxxy> So it basically just *disabled search*
[10:47:11] <VShell> Quxxy: seriously, they're going to lose half the world to a competitor in the next decade by just focusing on NA in all their products. :/
[10:47:19] <Quxxy> VShell: Were you looking up feature lists to try and change my mind? :P
[10:47:45] <Quxxy> Not me, sadly.  I play games and I *despise* Apple, both as a company and as a fashion symbol
[10:47:47] <VShell> Quxxy: I was actually having a look to see what there is because I've only really seen blog posts about Win10 a while back.
[10:51:12] <Quxxy> I have similar problems with Android; I've been putting off upgrading since the last one deleted some data, and the next one removes SD card functionality
[10:51:41] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: winapi has a pointer type that is always 64-bit
[10:51:45] <WindowsBunny> how do I represent that in rust?
[10:51:57] <Quxxy> Blurgh; how the crap does *that* work?!
[10:52:03] <Quxxy> What is it?
[10:52:11] <WindowsBunny> PVOID64?
[10:52:33] <WindowsBunny> well, technically anything with the __ptr64 attribute
[10:52:56] <WindowsBunny> there's also __ptr32 :P
[10:53:48] *** Quits: X-Scale (gbabios@moz-qvs1f5.rev.vodafone.pt) (Connection closed)
[10:54:12] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: I guess I should just stick to representing them with u32 and u64 I guess
[10:54:22] <Quxxy> I'm looking at the MinGW headers for a second opinion
[10:54:27] <Quxxy> They have `#define __ptr64`
[10:54:34] <WindowsBunny> xD
[10:54:42] <Quxxy> And `typedef void *PVOID64;`
[10:54:45] <WindowsBunny> that's because mingw is dumb
[10:54:49] <Quxxy> So I'm wondering if the distinction is even important
[10:54:52] <Quxxy> It's possible
[10:55:03] <Quxxy> It's also possible that it's a defensive thing that doesn't *actually* matter
[10:55:03] <WindowsBunny> sizeof(PVOID64) is 8 bytes, even on 32-bit
[10:55:05] <WindowsBunny> I checked
[10:55:14] <Quxxy> Hmm
[10:55:32] <Quxxy> I suppose the real question is: does it ever need to be used as anything *other* than an opaque handle?
[10:55:55] <Quxxy> You could always do struct PVOID64<T>(u64, PhantomData<T>);
[10:56:05] <Quxxy> *blinks*
[10:56:10] <Quxxy> Wait, no, don't need the T
[10:56:18] <WindowsBunny> You mean PhantomData<*mut T>
[10:56:18] <WindowsBunny> ?
[10:56:22] <Quxxy> You'd need it for a __ptr64 equivalent
[10:56:25] <WindowsBunny> Yeah
[10:56:32] <WindowsBunny> but PVOID64 is T = () :P
[10:56:37] <Quxxy> Does it matter?  You just need to use the generic parameter for something
[10:56:42] <WindowsBunny> erm, actually T = c_void

[10:58:17] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: and worse there is __sptr and __uptr which are modifiers to represent signed and unsigned pointers
[10:58:29] <WindowsBunny> which is just weird
[10:58:43] <Quxxy> That sounds like one of those things that is just *never* going to matter in practice
[10:58:51] <Quxxy> It's like the distinction between near and far pointers
[10:58:55] <Quxxy> No one *cares* anymore
[10:59:33] <WindowsBunny> yeah, they're not even referenced anywhere in winapi
[10:59:43] <WindowsBunny> but 64-bit and 32-bit pointers are referenced a few times
[10:59:47] <WindowsBunny> including in some structs!
[11:01:17] <Quxxy> I'd probably just do generics for __ptr64 and __ptr32, and use those
[11:01:33] <Quxxy> Then, at least, there's enough information to change them later on if the semantics or sizes are problematic
[11:01:40] <Quxxy> Heck, you could even impl Deref for them if you had to :P

[20:24:21] <lahwran> are
[20:24:26] <WindowsBunny> pre-1955 it had nothing to do with homosexuality

[20:26:28] <Astrum|Lap> but there's more nuance than that
[20:26:36] <Astrum|Lap> used to mean happy
[20:27:19] <WindowsBunny> >However, according to a report done by the BBC, most children are still  using the word to mean “lame”, but now with having nothing to do with  sexuality of any sort and also not generally meant as an insulting term  against homosexuals.  
[20:27:27] <Gankro> Astrum|Lap: Words change meaning, language changes. It's not strange.
[20:27:30] <Astrum|Lap> then it goes into describing homosexuality, then as an epithet

[20:30:01] <fmtq> so anyway 
[20:30:07] <fmtq> back onto the use of the word 'gay' as an insult
[20:30:12] <fmtq> I am offended by it because it meant happy 
[20:30:13] <Astrum|Lap> I think it's a problem with the evolution of natural languages where words can be in this weird offensive area even if the denotation and connotation of the speaker aren't trying to offend at all
[20:30:14] <lahwran> certainly, but please don't wait to start avoiding these words until you have such a list
[20:30:14] <fmtq> then homosexual 
[20:30:18] <fmtq> THEN GENERAL NEGATIVITY

[20:34:01] <Astrum|Lap> what's going on
[20:34:05] <WindowsBunny> 3edgy5me
[20:34:07] <Astrum|Lap> =P
[20:34:21] <fmtq> Astrum|Lap: where in the world do you have an interest?
[20:34:33] <fmtq> like, there was an enormous earthquake in Japan today 
[20:34:37] <bstrie> fmtq: I shouldn't need to point out my dissatisfaction with the phrase "offend cripples, they can't catch up"
[20:35:17] * c74d wonders how many people other than myself have fmtq on ignore.
[20:35:17] <fmtq> oh bstrie.
[20:35:33] <WindowsBunny> c74d: Why would you have fmtq on ignore? D:
[20:35:44] <WindowsBunny> Such delightful words come out of their mouth
[20:35:50] <bstrie> WindowsBunny: you don't need a list of words, if you use a word that makes someone offend then I expect you will be informed
[20:35:53] <c74d> panicbit: I think it's very much not Obvious; I'd need to re-examine it to give exact opinions.
[20:36:03] <Astrum|Lap> wonder how many people have me on ignore... hmm
[20:36:12] <fmtq> I generally don't wonder.
[20:36:15] <fmtq> I just live in hope
[20:36:22] <WindowsBunny> bstrie: The problem is that people might get scared away by certain words and not tell me
[20:36:39] <WindowsBunny> bstrie: Or at least, that's what I'm gathering from lahwran
[20:37:01] <Tiffany> the word `the` offends me
[20:37:09] <c74d> If writing a code of conduct, I'd use a list of categories of terms, not a list of terms themselves.
[20:37:26] <fmtq> Tiffany: haha
[20:37:31] <bstrie> WindowsBunny: "We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, or similar personal characteristic."
[20:37:34] <WindowsBunny> Tiffany: Well I hate you too :D
[20:37:56] <bstrie> if you craft a pejorative based on personal characteristic, then expect to be called out for it
[20:38:11] <WindowsBunny> bstrie: And unfortunately I am not well educated in the world of insults so I don't know all the words that might be offensive
[20:38:41] <WindowsBunny> bstrie: Obviously I'll avoid anything that I know is an insult but my knowledge of that is a limited subset
[20:39:24] <Astrum|Lap> this is going to make it to another reddit sticky isn't it?
[20:39:32] <Tiffany> windowsbunny: instead of 'gay', you could say 'crap', 'awful', 'garbage'
[20:40:02] <c74d> fmtq: Hope that people will put you on ignore? Are you, by any chance, an advanced, albeit immature, Korean AI named TaeWong?
[20:40:10] <lahwran> again, it isn't a matter of offense
[20:40:20] <lahwran> and yes, exactly, WindowsBunny 
[20:40:31] <lahwran> "scared away" isn't right either, but it's closer
[20:40:32] <Tiffany> short of dumping a list of the insults you know, I don't know how you'd figure out which ones are offensive
[20:40:35] <fmtq> c74d: wait, are you the guy that was trying to work out how to airgap a Windows PC
[20:40:40] <bstrie> Astrum|Lap: more likely I'll just end up telling the moderation team to start enforcing the code of conduct in here
[20:41:05] <WindowsBunny> The moderation team needs to stalk every Rust related area and call people out
[20:41:17] <lahwran> agreed
[20:41:19] <WindowsBunny> the political correctness strike unit!
[20:41:19] <lahwran> for official ones, anyway
[20:41:20] <fmtq> oh wow, there's 111 people in here now
[20:41:25] <lahwran> political correctness?
[20:41:28] <lahwran> um
[20:41:31] <fmtq> I genuinely didn't notice it grow to that size.
[20:41:42] <fmtq> I joined this channel when it was like 10 people >_>
[20:41:52] <Tiffany> I don't know how big this channel was when I joined it
[20:41:55] <c74d> fmtq: I'm not a British domestic terrorist. :<
[20:41:56] <Tiffany> 40 people, maybe?
[20:41:58] <WindowsBunny> lahwran: Do you have a better cool name for the trike unit?
[20:42:08] <WindowsBunny> *strike unit
[20:42:15] <lahwran> well we could reclaim "social justice"
[20:42:21] <lahwran> not sure how that got tainted anyway
[20:42:27] <lahwran> somehow they made caring about people into an insult
[20:42:32] * fmtq gets popcorn
[20:42:36] <lahwran> I guess I shouldn't be surprised
[20:42:43] <lahwran> but "the social justice warriors"
[20:42:48] <WindowsBunny> Damn, I need to get some popcorn
[20:42:55] <bstrie> WindowsBunny: don't start accusing people of "political correctness"
[20:42:58] <fkaa> s/warriors/rangers/
[20:43:00] <Tiffany> fmtq: because a lot of people who call themselves social justice warriors seem to think 'justice' means 'retaliation'
[20:43:05] <lahwran> fkaa: yes!
[20:43:05] <Tiffany> er, lahwran:*
[20:43:07] <fmtq> anyway, I apologise if my abuse of Poe's law was missed earlier.
[20:43:16] <WindowsBunny> Tiffany: Exactly that
[20:43:17] <lahwran> Tiffany: I wouldn't know
[20:43:28] <fmtq> Tiffany: I said *popcorn*, you have replied to the wrong person.
[20:43:32] <c74d> WindowsBunny: now I'm imagining a motorcycle-police-esque moderation force on trikes with Rust-logo sprockets :D
[20:43:33] <Tiffany> whether those people are trolls is up for debate, although it does seem clear that they're a minority
[20:43:49] <lahwran> fair enough
[20:43:56] <WindowsBunny> But they are a loud minority
[20:43:59] <lahwran> I'm entirely unfamiliar with that minority
[20:43:59] <Tiffany> yeah
[20:44:07] <Tiffany> awful people tend to be very loud on the internet, I guess
[20:44:17] <Astrum|Lap> well since we're talking about semantics, 'social justice' is kind of an odd phrase
[20:44:19] <WindowsBunny> A loud minority that has a significant influence on the media at that
[20:44:19] <lahwran> like, I keep hearing that they exist, but I have yet to have anything but fifthhand knowledge of them
[20:44:23] <lahwran> Astrum|Lap: hehe
[20:44:35] <fmtq> I mostly come here to hide from awful people, so I assume I'm the most awful person in the room.
[20:44:37] <fmtq> it is the safest bet.
[20:44:42] <WindowsBunny> lahwran: Maybe it's because you avoid the places that they are loudest? :P
[20:44:46] <lahwran> not really
[20:44:53] <Tiffany> do you have a tumblr account, lahwran?
[20:44:54] <lahwran> I hang out in ##feminism on freenode
[20:44:56] <lahwran> and I do
[20:44:58] <Tiffany> huh
[20:45:14] <WindowsBunny> lahwran: I know you do :P
[20:45:24] <fmtq> creepy
[20:45:29] <lahwran> my only post on tumblr is kinda complainy :p
[20:45:30] <fkaa> i was surprised how far left feminism in general was
[20:45:31] <fmtq> I don't think I've been on Freenode... at all this year
[20:45:37] <lahwran> oh yes
[20:45:41] <lahwran> that part is kind of weird
[20:45:43] <Astrum|Lap> I thought tumblr was for porn
[20:46:08] <c74d> Astrum|Lap: I prefer “societal justice” personally, more precise and somewhat distanced from the original phrase, which seems to have become rather a “public baggage-cart”.
[20:46:13] <VShell> there are a number of subcommunities on tumblr which don't really interact with each other, to an even greater extent than the various subreddits.
[20:46:29] <Astrum|Lap> c74d: I'd say the problematic term is 'justice'
[20:46:34] <lahwran> yeah
[20:46:35] <WindowsBunny> I usually stick to the pony comics part of tumblr
[20:46:37] <lahwran> there needs to be more than ice
[20:46:40] <lahwran> not just ice
[20:46:43] <WindowsBunny> which is generally a pretty nice place
[20:47:21] <lahwran> I just had a bit of a panic
[20:47:23] <c74d> Astrum|Lap: in practice I'd avoid it altogether, to avoid being buried in other people's baggage.
[20:47:28] <lahwran> I thought my irc logging thing wasn't logging
[20:47:33] <Astrum|Lap> social reform advocacy would probably be a better descriptor
[20:47:48] <lahwran> turns out instead of logging to moddata/log, it was logging to moddata/log/moddata/log
[20:47:50] <lahwran> wat 
[20:48:01] <c74d> Astrum|Lap: I'd agree, though I'd still s/social/societal/
[20:48:06] <Astrum|Lap> fair enough
[20:48:28] <VShell> although that term doesn't roll off the tongue half as well. :p
[20:48:44] <Astrum|Lap> yeah, I'm not much of a wordsmith, heh
[20:49:25] <c74d> VShell: I like terms like that! Especially for emotionally-charged subjects like this.
[20:49:35] <WindowsBunny> lahwran: Perhaps call them the Newspeak Enforcers?
[20:49:42] <fmtq> who are you calling emotionally charged, c74d?!
[20:50:06] <lahwran> um
[20:50:11] <eddyb> I am emotionally charged
[20:50:14] <eddyb> FUCK OFF
[20:50:27] <fmtq> I am charged with electron transfer.
[20:50:32] <eddyb> https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues/1140
[20:50:35] <WindowsBunny> I am charged with butts
[20:50:43] <VShell> I am certainly emotionally charged, hence I try not to post opinions in places where they'll stick around forever. >.>

[20:50:54] <Astrum|Lap> =P
[20:50:56] <eddyb> hmm
[20:50:58] <fkaa> i can't get over your 3d tux eddyb 
[20:51:00] <fmtq> VShell: no definitely always publish all opinions
[20:51:02] <fmtq> it can never go wrong.
[20:51:09] <fmtq> nobody has ever been lambasted for opinions on the internet
[20:51:10] <eddyb> fkaa: don't tell anyone I've stolen it from google images
[20:51:19] <WindowsBunny> Astrum|Lap: I have a fine butt that jiggles nicely
[20:51:36] <Astrum|Lap> VShell: I used to be like that
[20:52:01] <c74d> Subject D022. Name: fmtq. Connection to TaeWong: unconfirmed. Recommendation: Keep theta team on standby.
[20:52:17] <fkaa> eddyb: first image is http://f.fwallpapers.com/images/star-wars-linux-3d-tux.jpg
[20:52:21] <Astrum|Lap> it's hard not getting emotionally invested in some conversations
[20:52:26] <fmtq> I approve of that recommendation.
[20:52:41] <lahwran> WindowsBunny: I'd call them "code of conduct enforcement"
[20:52:50] <WindowsBunny> coc enforcers
[20:53:05] <lahwran> no, coc means something else
[20:53:06] <VShell> Astrum|Lap: given that some number of them directly involve me, yes, unfortunately. :(
[20:53:09] <eddyb> WindowsBunny: coc merchants
[20:53:21] <WindowsBunny> lahwran: Especially when you say coc out loud, it sounds funny in the wrong way
[20:54:01] <WindowsBunny> Astrum|Lap: I strive to be emotionally unattached as much as possible
[20:54:03] <lahwran> well that's because "coc" means "corruption of champions"
[20:54:06] <lahwran> I mean, er
[20:54:09] <lahwran> *whistles innocently*
[20:54:15] <fkaa> eddyb: please use this http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2439/3683080779_4c28cf3ac6_o.jpg
[20:54:28] <fkaa> lahwran: ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
[20:54:37] <Astrum|Lap> I pronounce it coque for some reason
[20:54:49] <fmtq> que = ck 
[20:54:50] <fmtq> so
[20:54:58] <lahwran> what
[20:55:01] <Astrum|Lap> mmm.... no
[20:55:06] <eddyb> chequemate
[20:55:09] <lahwran> lol
[20:55:13] <Astrum|Lap> the o is different
[20:55:18] <fmtq> nope.
[20:55:23] <fmtq> maybe in your broken accent.
[20:55:23] <Astrum|Lap> like coke
[20:55:26] <fmtq> maybe in your broken accent.
[20:55:36] <eddyb> couck?
[20:55:41] <eddyb> that does sound broken
[20:55:55] <fkaa> chokemate
[20:55:57] <fmtq> I bet you don't even pronounce queue as it was defined. ku-uw
[20:55:57] <eddyb> co'uck even
[20:56:26] <c74d> “coc enforcers”, like DEA?
[20:56:57] <c74d> eddyb: a name for a cheque-processing service?
[20:57:07] <eddyb> bwahahaha
[20:57:08] <lahwran> eddyb: did you see my complaining about nvidia earlier
[20:57:12] <eddyb> lahwran: nope
[20:57:21] <lahwran> so I'm setting up to do machine learning stuff
[20:57:51] <Astrum|Lap> also, liquor doesn't have a hard ck sound, unless you pronounce it lick-ur
[20:57:59] <fmtq> lick my wot
[20:58:06] <lahwran> but as it turns out, nvidia won't let you download their stuff unless you apply for developer membership
[20:58:06] <lahwran> like
[20:58:08] <lahwran> what???
[20:58:14] <fkaa> Astrum|Lap: that's how i've pronounced it
[20:58:19] <Astrum|Lap> meh
[20:58:20] <Astrum|Lap> weird
[20:58:29] <lahwran> that's also how I pronounce it
[20:58:31] <lahwran> licker
[20:58:38] <lahwran> lickor
[20:58:45] <lahwran> more the second than the first
[20:59:21] <WindowsBunny> lahwran: lol nvidia
[20:59:23] <c74d> /ˈlɪkɚ/ ?
[21:00:53] <fmtq> seguaro 
[21:01:19] <Astrum|Lap> apparently some people pronounce it lik-wawr...
[21:01:39] <fmtq> they are wrong.
[21:03:34] <Astrum|Lap> no one is wrong when it comes to natural languages, fmtq! =P
[21:03:40] <Astrum|Lap> we just make it up as we go along
[21:03:44] <fmtq> nope
[21:03:46] <fmtq> they are wrong.
[21:04:02] <fmtq> I'm not convinced English is natural 
[21:04:29] <Astrum|Lap> well... everything is natural
[21:04:40] <Astrum|Lap> natural is a silly word
[21:06:47] <fmtq> no it isn't
[21:06:49] <fmtq> you are wrong, Astrum|Lap

[21:35:15] <eddyb> I may not have had the best intentions when picking AILS...
[21:35:44] <Havvy> Well, "std" doesn't actually mean "Sexually Transmitted Disease" anymore in the health industry. It's all about "STI" (Infections).
[21:36:07] <eddyb> come on, std is older than C++ AFAIK
[21:36:39] <Havvy> Why couldn't the first person to make a standard library be named "Stan"?

[21:38:26] <Havvy> Tobba:  Why's that?
[21:39:37] <Tobba> Havvy: the chance of the discussion sounding like its about bdsm is linearly correlated to its length
[21:40:43] <Havvy> I feel like there's a blog post making this joke somewhere.
[21:41:08] <eddyb> Tobba: that's what she said
[21:41:42] <c74d> s/slave/replica/ ?
[21:42:11] <eddyb> oh, right, master/slave. lol
[21:42:31] <VShell> o.o
[21:42:50] <Tobba> c74d: now you've just involved human cloning
[21:43:23] <c74d> Why should “replica” refer any more to human cloning than data cloning?
[21:43:51] <eddyb> c74d: why do you distinguish between the two?
[21:43:58] <eddyb> impl Clone for Hooman
[21:44:05] <Tobba> alternatively you've involved china
[21:44:07] <c74d> Because Tobba did
[21:44:30] <Tobba> "so the master sends the data to china for mass reproduction..."
[21:45:22] <c74d> referring to “cloning” of products, or?

[22:47:57] <fmtq> it didn't work
[22:48:14] <XMPPwocky> yeah mosh  doesn't seem to render things
[22:49:22] <mrmonday> awwh, that was really pretty here
[22:49:35] <mrmonday> it goes all jittery and flashy when I type, haha
[22:51:32] <c74d> I just see repetitions of “Ì¸Ì·Ì¶ÌµÌµÌ³Ì³Í Í©Í§Í¯Í”.
[22:51:45] <Tiffany>  worked for me
[22:51:54] <leftylink> in the course of grabbing https://github.com/rust-lang/rust.vim I updated all my other vim plugins
[22:51:59] <leftylink> a thing I have not done in a year and 2 months
[22:52:02] <leftylink> wao
[22:52:07] <Tiffany> http://i.imgur.com/Gzy9Q0l.png
[22:52:13] <Tiffany> it reminds me of a birthday cake
[22:52:21] <Tiffany> too bad it got cut in half
[22:52:31] <fmtq> it doesn't seem encoded properly.
[22:52:31] <zofrex> wow
[22:52:38] <fmtq> it looks like someone threw up Russian on me 
[22:52:45] <zofrex> every time I think "yup, THIS TIME I have set up unicode on my client correctly"... someone comes along to prove me wrong
[22:52:49] <Tiffany> hexchat is pretty dumb and measures the length of a line by the number of bytes
[22:53:46] <eddyb> Tiffany: wow
[22:54:03] <eddyb> and I spent the time to call the width method on each character
[22:54:07] <Tiffany> maybe the number of character
[22:54:11] <Tiffany> uh
[22:54:12] <Tiffany> eddyb that's wrong
[22:54:24] <Tiffany> it doesn't take into account kerning
[22:54:48] <eddyb> I know
[22:55:02] <Tiffany> afaik the only way to actually measure the length of a string is to tell harfbuzz to layout it before you actually go to render it
[22:55:03] <eddyb> it's still a hack, but at least I tried
[22:55:09] <eddyb> hexchat didn't even
[22:55:19] <c74d> I saw <https://i.imgur.com/xo3VXXN.png>… encoding problems?
[22:55:21] <eddyb> Tiffany: and harfbuzz is broken
[22:55:25] <Tiffany> what?
[22:55:33] <eddyb> it can't do the supercombiner
[22:55:52] <Tiffany> that's a fixable bug
[22:56:00] <Tiffany> freetype barely supports kerning at all
[22:56:02] <mrmonday> http://i.imgur.com/yMg6wZV.png <= what it looks like for me
[22:56:09] <Tiffany> and your only alternative on linux is pango
[22:56:14] <eddyb> lol, pango
[22:56:19] <zofrex> mine looks like c74d's
[22:56:27] <Tiffany> sure, cleartype does it correctly
[22:56:28] <zofrex> weechat as well?
[22:56:31] <Tiffany> I don't know if OS X's thing does
[22:56:39] <c74d> mrmonday: that low-constrast D:
[22:56:40] <eddyb> mrmonday: whoa
[22:56:45] <Tiffany> cleartype is a massive pain though
[22:56:50] <Tiffany> you need to screw around with Direct2D
[22:57:07] <c74d> zofrex: yes, WeeChat.
[22:57:09] <Tiffany> it's clearly designed for GUI rendering and not the abuses I am doing to freetype
[22:57:17] <mrmonday> c74d: it's not actually that low contrast, I have focus follows mouse, so when I screenshot stuff it looks kinda off
[22:57:35] <mrmonday> because the focus is on another window
[22:57:45] <WindowsBunny> the combining character factory in notepad++ http://i.imgur.com/dHA63G8.png
[22:57:59] <mrmonday> eddyb: good whoa or bad whoa?
[22:58:08] <c74d> …your GUI environment reduces the contrast of non-focused windows?
[22:58:11] <eddyb> mrmonday: is it UTF-8?

[22:59:39] <mrmonday> 23:59 term_charset = UTF-8
[22:59:43] <mrmonday> ^ looks like it
[22:59:46] <WindowsBunny> whats the reference rendering for that factory?
[22:59:53] <WindowsBunny> I'm using UTF-8 here
[22:59:58] <c74d> eddyb: sounds like mine and zofrex's?
[23:00:08] <eddyb> c74d: pretty much
[23:00:25] <eddyb> I just forced UTF-8 on for the channel
[23:00:29] <XMPPwocky> eddyb: everything there is u+03xx
[23:00:32] <leftylink> I wonder if there is any new vim plugin special sauce that has appeared in the last 14 months

[23:00:58] <eddyb> WindowsBunny: wait, what?
[23:01:03] <eddyb> that looks like something
[23:01:09] <WindowsBunny> eddyb: wat?
[23:01:26] <eddyb> c74d: Konversation defaults to UTF-8 but it has funky auto-detect code
[23:01:26] <WindowsBunny> I just copied and pasted what XMPPwocky sent
[23:01:30] <c74d> leftylink: I use Pathogen. I thought Vundle had been obsoleted by Plug, though.
[23:01:32] <XMPPwocky> haha, i tab over in mosh and you actually see it render in, but just as a line
[23:01:42] <XMPPwocky> like a really bad old modem
[23:01:59] <mrmonday> you guys with your fancy vim plugin managers...
[23:02:12] <mrmonday> I manually handle all my plugins in a git repo :>
[23:02:24] <XMPPwocky> i just shove stuff in ~/vimfiles
[23:02:28] <WindowsBunny> maybe it was the last character in XMPPwocky's message
[23:02:29] <c74d> I don't use a fancy plugin manager.
[23:02:41] <zofrex> can someone send some non-combining UTF8
[23:02:48] <WindowsBunny> my client put a question mark for the last character, which it often uses to substitute text which isn't valid utf-8
[23:02:53] <eddyb> WindowsBunny: OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
[23:03:01] <eddyb> that was the Konversation bug
[23:03:04] <XMPPwocky> ∰✌
[23:03:16] <WindowsBunny> eddyb: So in that case, that invalid utf-8 would make your irc client not use utf-8?
[23:03:20] <eddyb> it had to do with certain sets of characters and how it ended
[23:03:23] <eddyb> WindowsBunny: yes
[23:03:24] <XMPPwocky> i bet i know what it is

[23:03:27] <mrmonday> £ <= I don't know if that counts as UTF-8, but that always messed up whenever I didn't have my unicode settings sorted properly
[23:03:29] <XMPPwocky> what I put in is valid utf-8

The character encoding of the file needs to be declared in the transfer protocol or file needs to use a byte order mark as an encoding signature.
[23:11:28] <Tiffany> windowsbunny: that's what the real name field is for
[23:11:29] <Tiffany> heh
[23:11:33] <XMPPwocky> huh. Combining characters that your font doesn't have a symbol for
[23:11:36] <XMPPwocky> will still combine
[23:11:41] <Tiffany> your real name is apparently 'purple'
[23:11:49] <eddyb> and now I'm going to send them to someone over facebook
[23:12:09] <eddyb> oh darn it almost fits
[23:12:18] <XMPPwocky> l ᷒i ᷒k ᷒e ᷒t ᷒h ᷒i ᷒s
[23:12:22] <XMPPwocky> even the fallback font does it
[23:12:25] <c74d> OW
[23:12:27] <WindowsBunny> Tiffany: I blame pidgin
[23:12:44] <fmtq> lol
[23:12:51] <XMPPwocky> http://steamcommunity.com/id/xmppwocky
[23:12:55] <mrmonday> I'm gonna have to ignore this channel for a while so I don't end up spending hours of my life tweaking font settings again :<
[23:12:56] <XMPPwocky> oh no my showcase is gone
[23:13:00] <WindowsBunny> eddyb: That server doesn't tell me that the encoding is utf-8, so it displays like garbage
[23:13:06] <eddyb> bwahahahaha
[23:13:11] <eddyb> WindowsBunny: are you using IE again?
[23:13:17] <WindowsBunny> eddyb: no, FF
[23:13:24] <XMPPwocky> eddyb: borked in chrome too
[23:13:25] <eddyb> FF does IE compat?
[23:13:25] <Tiffany> windowsbunny: it actually deos
[23:13:36] <Tiffany> for some reason, firefox is overriding github's reported encoding
[23:13:38] <Tiffany> it thinks it's western
[23:13:44] <Tiffany> if you hit alt, you'll get the old firefox menu bar
[23:13:50] <Tiffany> from there, you can do view -> character encoding
[23:14:06] <XMPPwocky> mrmonday: at least nobody's adding ra ͅndom combining single dots so you think you have dead pixels
[23:14:15] <XMPPwocky> and then try to wipe it off and get a smud ͅge on your screen
[23:14:27] <Tiffany> that one derped up
[23:14:36] <XMPPwocky> that would be rea ̣lly unfortunate
[23:14:38] <Tiffany> it doesn't work as well with white on black text, also
[23:14:42] <c74d> Tiffany: there is no “reported encoding”, though
[23:14:43] <WindowsBunny> Tiffany: If your help regarding encoding was directed at me, I am offended that you thought I didn't know that
[23:14:54] <mrmonday> XMPPwocky: I get that all the time anyway from random bits of dust :<
[23:14:57] <Tiffany> windowsbunny: well I didn't know it at a time
[23:15:04] <WindowsBunny> a time?
[23:15:06] <Tiffany> c74d: firefox tells me it's UTF-8 in the page info
[23:15:24] <Tiffany> windowsbunny: in the time between firefox changing the UI to no longer have a menu bar and probably like 6 months ago when I found out about alt
[23:15:44] <WindowsBunny> Tiffany: noob
[23:16:07] <Tiffany> it's kind of ridiculous that they never added a way to de-mojibake a page in the new UI
[23:16:19] <WindowsBunny> mojibake?
[23:16:27] <Tiffany> when the encoding is mangled
[23:16:33] <Tiffany> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojibake
[23:16:39] <WindowsBunny> but the old menu bar is part of the new UI
[23:16:41] <WindowsBunny> just hidden :P
[23:16:51] <c74d> Tiffany: different parts of Firefox must be making different assumptions about the encoding; as far as I can see GitHub doesn't send any information about the encoding.
[23:17:01] <Tiffany> I guess so
[23:17:05] <WindowsBunny> Tiffany: I personally prefer the way I have my FF UI setup
[23:17:08] <c74d> unless GitHub sends different headers to Firefox than to Chrome?
[23:17:17] <Tiffany> I'll check
[23:17:49] <WindowsBunny> http://i.imgur.com/y61Y2s5.png
[23:18:13] <Tiffany> yeah
[23:18:20] <Tiffany> the response headers don't mention any encoding
[23:18:33] <mrmonday> ok, I added Symbola fallback, things look a little better now
[23:18:50] <leftylink> aaaaaaaah, http://vimawesome.com/ seems like a good list. excellent, I'll take a look
[23:18:51] <mrmonday> though there are still plenty of characters here which are still boxes or question marks
[23:19:06] <WindowsBunny> ew vim
[23:19:18] <XMPPwocky> WindowsBunny: banned
[23:20:41] <Astrum|Lap> ^
[23:23:02] <Astrum|Lap> to be fair it's probably a pain to use vim on Windows
[23:23:12] <Astrum|Lap> pretty blasé in the *nix world
[23:23:43] * Havvy is not a fan of vim either.
[23:23:58] <eddyb> XMPPwocky: I used to do that
[23:24:19] <Tiffany> it's not very hard to use vim on windows actually
[23:24:22] <Tiffany> I've done it at least
[23:24:32] <Tiffany> it just looks ugly as hell by default, iirc
[23:24:51] <mrmonday> using vim on windows is literally the same as every other OS :<

[23:25:18] <Astrum|Lap> perhaps
[23:25:25] <eddyb> ˛ is my favourite
[23:25:28] <Astrum|Lap> more work than nothing
[23:25:33] <Astrum|Lap> which is too much
[23:25:40] <eddyb> also ı and ȷ
[23:25:48] <eddyb> those look ridiculous in Source Code Pro
[23:26:24] <mrmonday> Astrum|Lap: it's just as much effort as on most linuxes
[23:26:37] *** Quits: genbattle (genbattle@moz-r09mao.xtra.co.nz) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[23:26:56] <Astrum|Lap> most linuxes I've used have vim out of the box...
[23:27:07] <eddyb> EDITOR=nano
[23:27:26] <Havvy> Nix uses nano by default, IIRC.
[23:27:33] <Havvy> NixOS**
[23:27:46] <mrmonday> Astrum|Lap: most linuxes I've used have a crippled version of vim which is missing most of the features by default :p
[23:28:03] <Astrum|Lap> hmmm
[23:28:17] <Astrum|Lap> whatever, crippled vim is still better than no vim =P
[23:29:17] <mrmonday> either way, it's a case of choco install vim/apt-get install vim/pacman -S vim/brew install vim/whatever
[23:29:28] <mrmonday> not so much effort
[23:30:06] <c74d> choco?
[23:30:29] <mrmonday> windows package manager
[23:31:13] <mrmonday> I believe it's being included with whatever the next version of Windows is, but I'm not sure
[23:31:19] <FreeFull> eddyb: ?

[23:46:17] <whipsch> because it looks identical
[23:46:52] <leftylink> y'all are reminding me of https://twitter.com/peterritchie/status/534011965132120064
[23:46:55] <leftylink> "Replace a semicolon (;) with a greek question mark (;) in your friend's C# code and watch them pull their hair out over the syntax error"
[23:46:56] <Havvy> whipsch:  How goes !doc ?
[23:47:17] <eddyb> oh
[23:47:32] <eddyb> ;
[23:47:41] <cmr> mrmonday: no, but oneget supports using cholately repos.

[23:47:52] <eddyb> playbot: ();
[23:47:53] -playbot- ()
[23:47:59] <eddyb> hmm, so it's the same ;
[23:48:00] <mrmonday> cmr: ah, I see
[23:48:11] <cmr> at least I think it's still called oneget...
[23:48:17] <Astrum|Lap> I've used either chocolatey or nuget
[23:48:20] <Astrum|Lap> it was miserable
[23:48:21] <eddyb> I don't know how to type that greek question mark in my greek layout
[23:48:34] <mrmonday> leftylink: reminds me of when I had to use a greek keyboard once... I spent hours wondering why the path I was entering didn't exist... I was using some funny greek i rather than an actual i :3
[23:48:43] <leftylink> :o
[23:48:45] <leftylink> my goodness
[23:49:16] <Astrum|Lap> iota
[23:49:20] <mrmonday> funny i is in the same place on the greek keyboard as normal i on a non-greek keyboard, which didn't help
[23:49:26] <Havvy> playbot: ";" == ";"
[23:49:28] -playbot- false
[23:49:40] <cmr> They look very different on my fonts.
[23:49:41] <mrmonday> Astrum|Lap: the little experience I've had with chocolatey has been fantastic
[23:49:46] <mrmonday> what was the issue for you?
[23:50:02] <Astrum|Lap> well
[23:50:06] <cmr> I've had great experiences with both nuget and chocolatey.

[23:50:10] <Astrum|Lap> may have just been my inexperience with windows in general
[23:50:17] <c74d> leftylink: the Greek question mark looks different from the English semicolon in my typeface (Ubuntu Mono).
[23:50:17] <Astrum|Lap> but the command line was confusing as hell
[23:50:22] <Astrum|Lap> couldn't figure out how to do anything
[23:51:08] <mrmonday> choco install <whatever> is simpler than a lot of linux package managers :p
[23:51:18] <whipsch> Havvy: stalled atm
[23:51:24] <mrmonday> my Windows experience is also pretty minimal
[23:51:28] <whipsch> Havvy: i experimented with doing some alternative methods of searching
[23:51:33] <Astrum|Lap> maybe it was nuget then
[23:51:39] <Astrum|Lap> two seconds, let me look it up
[23:51:40] <mrmonday> I always end up with about 5 different shells installed, and I never know which I'm meant to use
[23:51:43] <eddyb> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w41J4x2ybAA
[23:51:46] <mrmonday> and only some of them work for certain tasks
[23:51:47] <whipsch> i tried out doing fuzzy matching on full paths but something like s::v::vec takes ~400ms to search
[23:51:48] <eddyb> of course he did
[23:51:51] <mrmonday> it all gets very confusing
[23:52:23] *** Quits: killercup (killercup@moz-723bo4.dip0.t-ipconnect.de) (Quit: My Mac has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[23:52:24] <whipsch> it would probably perform much better if it was fuzzy per path segment instead of the whole thing
[23:52:46] <WindowsBunny> I'm gonna upgrade to Windows 10 shortly after it comes out
[23:52:49] <WindowsBunny> Because I want it
[23:53:01] <cmr> I've been on the tech preview since it was released.
[23:53:10] <Astrum|Lap> now I'm starting to doubt if it was nuget...
[23:53:22] <Astrum|Lap> well something had me very perplexed in the command line on windows, I know that much
[23:53:22] <Astrum|Lap> lol
[23:53:57] <mrmonday> at some point I'll probably have to learn powershell
[23:54:07] <mrmonday> and windows will become a lot easier
[23:54:11] <whipsch> eh
[23:54:15] <whipsch> powershell is kinda weird
[23:54:28] <Astrum|Lap> I was using powershell, maybe that's what it was
[23:54:40] <mrmonday> but until that day comes I'll remain confused by all the millions of bash-style shells that invariably end up appearing whenever I install Windows
