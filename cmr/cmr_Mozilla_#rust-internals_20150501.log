[00:12:04] <Manishearth> Is it possible to have inline static slices now?
[00:12:11] <Manishearth> &[] is a &[_ ; 0]
[00:15:39] <Eridius> not that I'm aware of
[00:15:52] <Eridius> you can still say something like `let foo = { static VAL: &'static [u8] = &[1,2,3]; VAL };` but that is a bit awkard
[00:15:55] <Eridius> *awkward
[00:16:19] <huon> (&[]) often functions as if it were 'static
[00:16:53] <huon> playbot: &[] as &'static [u8]
[00:16:54] -playbot- []
[00:18:10] <Eridius> huh, apparently that works for &[] but not for &[1,2,3]
[00:18:30] <Eridius> I guess because &[] is known to have no elements so it doesn't have to actually store anything anywhere
[00:19:54] <aatch> I think that, because [] is zero-sized, it gets a special pointer value.

[00:54:30] <Eridius> because statics are global values
[00:54:41] <Eridius> (although the visibility of a given static depends on where it's defined)
[00:54:50] <Manishearth> Eridius: okay, so how should I pass an &'static [] to a method
[00:55:05] <Manishearth> I cna't construct it locally
[00:55:08] <Eridius> from the earlier experimentation it seems like `&[]` works just fine

[00:55:13] <Manishearth> it used to
[00:55:19] <Manishearth> &[] is now a &[_; 0]
[00:55:34] <Manishearth> calling as_slice will create a local slice, obviously
[00:55:34] <Eridius> but & deref coercion will coerce it to a &[_]
[00:55:44] <Manishearth> that's of a local lifetime

[03:56:10] <brson> wycats: i have a [[bin]] section that defines a crate named "crater-web" but if I create [dependencies.crater-web] cargo says 'no matching package named `crater-web` found (required by `crater`)'

[03:56:46] <wycats> hm... [[bin]]s cannot define a crate from the perspective of cargo

[03:57:37] <wycats> the correct thing to do when different bins have different deps is multiple Cargo crates in one repo
[03:57:43] <wycats> you can use path= to target them

[05:17:56] <gus> brson: another thing I raised with huon recently - are we planning on doing a final update-stage0-to-next-breaking-change cycle before each release?
[05:19:06] <gus> In particular, this would allow each release to be built with itself, rather than with the version of rust one "breakage" ago.

[05:20:26] <gus> For packaging, I'm fine with bundling either stage0 blob in the Debian packaging, but if we can do the update I'm suggesting then I only need to include one stage0 architecture since I can use the resulting rustc to cross compile all the other archs.

[05:22:14] <gus> With the current practice (rustc builds with most-recent-break-1), I need to bundle stage0 for _every_ architecture, since I don't have any other compiler around that can compile the rustc source on $arbitrary_arch.

[05:25:30] <gus> To clarify: "build with previous stable"  (or rather: build "stage1" with previous stable) would be awesome and should be our long-term goal.
[05:25:34] <huon> (possibly mistaken, of course)

[08:10:19] <eddyb> p1start: what does it do then? if it took an in-pointer and an out-pointer, that would make more sense, as it would allow regenerating internal self-pointers
[08:10:58] <eddyb> is that the same Relocate I mentioned in a somewhat old internals.rust-lang.org post?
[08:10:59] <p1start> eddyb: It forces you to explicitly state moves & lets you keep track of them
[08:11:13] <p1start> It’s like Clone for moves
[08:11:25] <eddyb> you mean, like a move keyword?
[08:12:28] <p1start> Yeah, but it also lets you do extra stuff
[08:12:38] <p1start> And you only need it for !Move types
[08:12:44] <eddyb> not much extra stuff, though
[08:12:55] <eddyb> p1start: hence, my old proposal
[08:13:02] <p1start> Well, ideally Move would require Relocate like how Copy requires Clone now
[08:13:11] <eddyb> but it's useless for that unless you take an out pointer
[08:13:51] <eddyb> the main usecase is pointers to the object, that don't obey Rust rules. like a mutex

[08:15:14] <eddyb> and you can't update that if you don't know where the new location is
[08:16:00] <Mutabah> eddyb: I mentioned earlier in the RFC the hidden return value pointer used by large structures
[08:16:32] <eddyb> I have 0 context fwiw
[08:16:47] <Mutabah> Oh
[08:16:51] <Mutabah> eddyb: https://github.com/thepowersgang/rust-lang_rfcs/blob/immovable-types/text/0000-move-trait.md
[08:17:16] <Mutabah> (damnit, I shouldn't be writing a RFC while sleep deprived)
[08:18:12] <eddyb> oh, fun
[08:18:16] <Mutabah> Yeah
[08:18:37] <Mutabah> I mention the return value behavior needed for this to be erganomic in the "Unresolved Questions" section
[08:19:22] <eddyb> hehehe
[08:20:52] <eddyb> Mutabah: check this out: https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/potential-solution-for-types-that-shouldnt-be-moved-like-staticmutex/1663 (I didn't have the time to research further expansion, but the core idea seems fine and nmatsakis likes it, modulo OIBIT concerns, as with Leak)
[08:20:57] *** Quits: genbattle (genbattle@moz-ikj3l8.xtra.co.nz) (Quit: Leaving)
[08:21:46] <eddyb> the cool thing is that you don't have to care about all moves
[08:22:21] <eddyb> but only relocations: moves where the address change is observable
[08:22:57] <eddyb> you can't observe a change without an initial value, so the first borrow "locks" it in place
[08:23:51] *** Joins: avikpal (avikpal@moz-7ao.9fs.194.117.IP)
[08:24:19] <Mutabah> eddyb: So, that proposal is a lang trait that causes extended freezing of an object when its address is observed?
[08:25:05] <eddyb> yes. if you really wanted to, you could implement Relocate with custom semantics, but that's an extension of the core idea
[08:25:52] <Mutabah> hmm...
[08:26:10] <eddyb> for some types you could have a method that clears any observations of the address and returns the object by value, effectively thawing it
[08:27:12] <eddyb> since a mutex is (typically) only used after cloning an Arc to a structure containing it, the borrow rule would allow most constructor code today to just work
[08:28:51] <Mutabah> eddyb: Would making the constructor in my example work be very difficult?
[08:29:05] <Mutabah> (i.e. make 'rv' live in the return pointer)
[08:29:24] <eddyb> that wouldn't allow a bunch of stuff
[08:29:49] <eddyb> let m = Mutex::new(x); MyStruct(m)
[08:30:05] <Mutabah> Hmm... yeah
[08:30:08] <eddyb> you need NRVO... and good luck doing that in arbitrary cases
[08:30:23] <eddyb> like, I can build a Vec of Mutexes and return it
[08:30:57] <eddyb> I can't reallocate it after using any of the mutexes in it, but I don't need to
[08:31:21] <eddyb> in your case, you would need emplace for that

[09:26:09] <eddyb> Mutabah: there was a discussion some time ago in #rust-gamedev about 'self and giving it useful semantics
[09:27:40] <eddyb> one interesting proposal would be that the presence of 'self in a field's type makes it existential over the contained lifetime
[09:28:00] <eddyb> such that Struct doesn't have the field, but &'a Struct does and 'self is 'a there
[09:28:59] <aatch> One thing that would be useful is a way of being able to use an arena in a way that doesn't suck.
[09:29:28] <aatch> Right now, if you have a type that owns the arena, everything inside of it needs to be behind some interior mutability.
[09:29:39] <eddyb> the structure is also not Relocate, which means struct NotRelocate(marker::PhantomData<&'self ()>); could be a thing
[09:29:50] <aatch> The other option is that the arena is passed in from the outside, but that's awful for encapsulation.
[09:30:06] <eddyb> aatch: that is a slightly different issue
[09:30:21] <aatch> eddyb, I know. It's just been bugging me for a while now.
[09:30:26] <eddyb> where you want relocation to be possible, because indirection exists
[09:30:43] <eddyb> one proposal would be an "indirect borrow"
[09:31:53] <Mutabah> Oh well, time to delete this branch

[18:00:48] <bluss> hi
[18:01:17] <simukis> the current drain PR argument is range of UTF-8 glyphs, right?
[18:01:37] <bluss> it uses byte offsets just like slicing
[18:02:01] <bluss> maybe the docs should spell that out
[18:03:00] <simukis> hmm, so for example it is possible to do something like String::new("😃").drain(1..) which will make UTF-8 codepoint incomplete, right? Isn’t that a memory safety issue?
[18:03:11] <bluss> ah that's not possible
[18:03:33] <bluss> it makes a slice so it checks indirectly via that code
[18:03:57] <simukis> hmm, ok
[18:04:16] <simukis> thanks for your time :)

[18:05:41] <simukis> yeah, there’s also a note in documentation (lines 706-7) I missed before
[18:06:03] <eddyb> zwarich: that's a gross understatement
[18:06:04] <zwarich> (as is mentioned in the discussion)

[18:07:13] <zwarich> aturon: anyways, I knew it was going to die long ago because of who proposed the original RFC, but just wanted to clear that up
[18:11:15] <aturon> zwarich: eddyb: hey both -- so, a lot of the discussion on thread seemed to revolve around error message improvements, some of which have been made
[18:12:05] <aturon> zwarich: i'm not sure what your second comment is referring to? certainly the RFC to disable elision in these cases had some support (e.g. i was fine doing that as a temporary step) but it just never got pushed on
[18:12:05] <zwarich> aturon: but a lot of the discussion also revolved around having a bad default that causes latent problems when refactoring
[18:12:20] <eddyb> aturon: yeah, the best improvement would be proper tracking of causes for region constraints, but that's not an easy one

[18:15:08] <zwarich> eddyb: yeah, I haven't even been following, I'm sure there is a list of 10 worse things that are impossible to change because of backwards compatibility :P
[18:15:11] <aturon> zwarich: i'm sorry... obviously we disagree on this point, but i do think the RFC could have landed if it had been pushed on. but anyway, as pnkfelix points out, this is certainly lintable if it proves to be a problem for most people
[18:15:18] <eddyb> but we're all humans here (presumably), and it worked out great IMO

[18:19:33] <eddyb> aturon: having to describe Rust in Romanian is an exercise in linguistic frustration. but hey, someone has to start it :)
[18:22:56] <eddyb> aturon: and I'm very thankful for all the work done on specifying DSTs and finishing my patches. DST happens to be one of the two reasons for halting progress on a Rust kernel, we'll have to see what other cool uses come of it
