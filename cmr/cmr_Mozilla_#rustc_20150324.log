[09:34:10] <nmatsakis> eddyb: I'm not sure I follow, the cause codes definitely affect the error that gets printed out -- but in this particular case I would guess that we generate the same oblig more than once, with different cause codes

[12:56:56] <arielb1> How do you check whether types are known to match in infer without unifying anything?
[12:58:48] <pnkfelix> arielb1: uh, what does that mean?  Do you mean you want to avoid side-effects of unification?  (In which case there is the `can_equate` method)?  Or do you literally want to avoid invoking the unification machinery?
[12:58:57] <arielb1> pnkfelix: I want to avoid side-effects
[12:59:16] <pnkfelix> arielb1: okay, then I think `InferCtxt::can_equate` is what you want
[12:59:49] <pnkfelix> arielb1: although there is a caveat that I encountered last night/this morning
[13:00:04] <arielb1> pnkfelix: can_equate ignores regions, you mean?
[13:00:13] <arielb1> so it returns 'a ~ 'b
[13:00:15] <pnkfelix> arielb1: Yeah that's what I was thinking of
[13:00:20] <arielb1> I know that
[13:00:53] <pnkfelix> arielb1: So I was not able to use can_equate for the dropck code I was working on
[13:01:23] <arielb1> pnkfelix: dropck goes between typeck and regionck?
[13:01:32] <pnkfelix> arielb1: instead I did a `incfx.try(|snapshot| { ... })` to isolate the side-effects
[13:02:01] <pnkfelix> arielb1: and  did unification + the checks I needed post-unification all in the ...
[13:02:19] <arielb1> pnkfelix: now I noticed infcx.probe
[13:02:25] <pnkfelix> arielb1: this is a new part of dropck
[13:02:30] <arielb1> but can_equate just wraps probe
[13:02:34] <pnkfelix> arielb1: its getting added as part of typeck
[13:02:48] <arielb1> pnkfelix: I mean, regionck is also a part of typeck
[13:03:02] <pnkfelix> arielb1: do you need to ensure that regions are not ignored for your purposes?
[13:03:10] <arielb1> pnkfelix: no
[13:03:28] <pnkfelix> arielb1: okay then you don't have the difficulty that I had then
[13:03:43] <arielb1> how can you do things with regions before regionck?
[13:03:58] <pnkfelix> arielb1: I skolemized them
[13:04:18] <pnkfelix> arielb1: i.e. I created fresh constant-regions that cannot be equated to any others
[13:04:52] <pnkfelix> arielb1: you can see it here, it is very new code (but nmatsakis says he thinks it looks right): https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/23638
[13:11:09] <arielb1> pnkfelix: thanks
[13:11:43] <pnkfelix> arielb1: note that that dropck case is *very* special, e.g. it does not have to think about Late-Bound regions 
[13:11:47] *** Joins: Rym_ (y@moz-vsu.f6d.55.31.IP)
[13:12:30] <pnkfelix> arielb1: the code in `librustc_typeck/check/compare_method.rs` is an example of handling a much more general scenario
[13:12:49] <pnkfelix> arielb1: (but it was also way larger and harder for me to digest than what I wrote for dropck)
[13:15:28] <arielb1> pnkfelix: are late-bound regions still a deal now that we have HRLT?

[13:16:40] <pnkfelix> arielb1: TBH I don't know off-hand how all the pieces interact there.
[13:17:31] <arielb1> pnkfelix: I think the regionck system is in a slightly messy state
[13:17:58] <pnkfelix> arielb1: yes. nmatsakis may have plans for cleaning it up.

[14:06:55] <arielb1> so equality is true, false, or don't knwo

[14:07:26] <arielb1> *expect
[14:07:54] <arielb1> does can_equate do this, or treat don't know as true
[14:09:51] <eddyb> arielb1: what are you doing that requires type equality? subtyping is so much more common

[14:10:46] <eddyb> and "don't know" isn't really an option AFAIK
[14:11:29] <arielb1> eddyb: I mean, if you have $0 <: uint
[14:11:34] <arielb1> that's a "don't know"
[14:11:36] <eddyb> if it hits a type/region variable it knows nothing about, and there's no conflict... it will know more about that variable afterwards
[14:11:47] <arielb1> If you have int <: uint
[14:11:50] <arielb1> that's definitely false
[14:11:59] <arielb1> If you have uint <: uint
[14:12:02] <arielb1> that's definitely true
[14:12:07] <eddyb> arielb1: your "don't know" is actually always true AFAIK
[14:12:42] <arielb1> eddyb: If you later have a $0 <: int
[14:12:45] <arielb1> then it becomes false
[14:12:47] <eddyb> arielb1: do you want to be able to tell if type/region variables were updated?
[14:12:55] <eddyb> I think that is possible
[14:14:20] <eddyb> nmatsakis: aww I can't move object safety to astconv in its entirety... needs too much information that's not there yet
[14:18:04] <eddyb> arielb1: hmm, trait::select has an "ambiguous" flag on CandidateSet which usually gets set for ty_var(TyVar(_)), but I haven't seen anything like that in infcx

[19:46:16] <eddyb> nmatsakis: does an object safety obligation make sense?
[19:46:36] *** Joins: Rym_ (y@moz-vsu.f6d.55.31.IP)
[19:47:08] <nmatsakis> eddyb: why would you need it?
[19:47:21] <eddyb> I guess I could record all the trait objects created in a Vec and check them between collection and per-function type-checking but that seems a bit hacky
[19:47:23] <nmatsakis> I think it'd make sense if we abstracted over traits
[19:47:31] <nmatsakis> I don't get it
[19:47:33] <eddyb> nmatsakis: I want to preserve the errors
[19:47:56] <eddyb> in selection I can't error, just return Err(Unimplemented) in case the trait is not object-safe
[19:48:13] <eddyb> in astconv I can't check if it's object-safe yet, during collection, because the types of the methods are not there yet
[19:48:31] <nmatsakis> eddyb: ok, I see. hmm.
[19:49:01] <nmatsakis> eddyb: well an object safety oblig is ... probably harmless 
[19:49:14] <eddyb> nmatsakis: fn: Fn uses a specific kind of selection error, I wonder if I can do something like that
[19:49:32] <eddyb> (output type mismatch in that case)
[19:50:02] <nmatsakis> yes, plausibly we could have the confirm step generate an error
[19:50:04] <nmatsakis> or something like that
[19:50:46] <eddyb> the *existence* of the trait object type when not object-safe is wrong, and I think there's one more place during selection that can also make use of this

[19:50:56] <eddyb> mkay, I'll try to set this up
[19:51:26] <nmatsakis> it does seem like we could move the trait object stuff somewhere else probably
[19:51:39] <nmatsakis> e.g. as part of the wf obligations checking and so on
[19:51:47] <nmatsakis> we should be doing that anyway because it'd be nice if you got earlier errors
[19:51:54] <eddyb> I did not even think of wf
[19:51:59] <nmatsakis> but I am wondering if there is a subtle case where it could slip through...
[19:52:03] <eddyb> does that run before function type-checking?
[19:52:04] <nmatsakis> well, I'd probably add it to implicator, specifically
[19:52:28] <nmatsakis> which region checking uses to figure out what a type needs to be "well-formed"
[19:52:47] <nmatsakis> so that is run against the type of every expression
[19:52:52] <eddyb> I would like to close gh19482 if possible, on this branch
[19:53:03] <nmatsakis> that's what I'm talking about
[19:53:12] <nmatsakis> unforrtunately I think we're not using the implicator during wf.rs, 
[19:53:21] <nmatsakis> I want to basically remove and rewrite wf.rs,
[19:53:23] <eddyb> do regions match *at all*?
[19:53:29] <eddyb> *matter
[19:53:38] <nmatsakis> so well-formedness is more general than regions basically
[19:53:44] <eddyb> ah
[19:53:44] <nmatsakis> that is, the implicator also produces a list of obligations
[19:53:45] <nmatsakis> that must hold
[19:53:56] <nmatsakis> this was part of the implied bounds refactoring I Was doing
[19:53:59] <nmatsakis> but anyway the main point is
[19:54:04] <nmatsakis> we could walk over the types of the expressions at some point :)
[19:54:13] <nmatsakis> regionck happens to be doing it already, but maybe not the best place 
[19:54:33] <eddyb> I'm pretty sure syntactical *types* are enough
[19:54:52] <nmatsakis> that .. hmm .. may be true
[19:55:02] <nmatsakis> I am not confident though that wf.rs touches every type -- in fact I think I know of some gaps
[19:55:07] <eddyb> it's fun grepping for mk_trait and finding only astconv that produces them from something that's not already a trait object
[19:56:06] <eddyb> nmatsakis: oh, and, if I can move forward with this DST stuff in the following days, I want to try ty_traits
[19:57:33] <eddyb> nmatsakis: are Sync/Send only implemented in the libraries now? I mean, they're still part of bounds, but whether they're implemented or not is checked like a regular user trait, no?
[19:57:49] <nmatsakis> eddyb: basically yes
