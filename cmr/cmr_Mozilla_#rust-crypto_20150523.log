[00:50:30] <eternaleye> And avx512 is basically hardware chacha :P
[00:50:41] <eternaleye> So when Skylake hits, it'll be even sillier
[00:50:49] <Tiffany> is there any reason to believe that AVX-512 won't be almost double the speed?
[00:50:57] <Tiffany> or possibly more, depending on new instructions
[00:51:24] <Tiffany> I read the original salsa20 paper recently, djb described ciphers as under 1 cycle per byte as being inherently insecure, presumably because they wouldn't have enough time to do enough rounds to be secure
[00:51:36] <Tiffany> although I'm guessing that he didn't have AVX-512 in mind
[00:53:04] <eternaleye> Tiffany: Well, AVX512F doesn't have new instructions
[00:53:11] <eternaleye> Tiffany: F = Foundation
[00:53:22] <eternaleye> Tiffany: All it does is widen the registers and support those wider registers
[00:53:29] <Tiffany> oh
[00:53:54] <eternaleye> Tiffany: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVX-512
[00:54:11] <Tiffany> oh, I never mentioned the actual speed I found
[00:54:12] <eternaleye> Tiffany: Though it seems Skylake Xeons will have some extensions beyond just F
[00:54:19] <Tiffany> it got to 1.48 cycles per byte
[00:54:29] <Tiffany> according to this: https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/759.pdf
[00:54:49] <Tiffany> well, more like 1.43
[00:54:59] <eternaleye> However, CD / ERI likely won't matter
[00:55:01] <eternaleye> Nor PFI
[00:55:31] <eternaleye> However, Cannonlake's BW and DQ extensions will likely be hilarious
[00:56:03] <Tiffany> heh
[00:56:05] <eternaleye> and VBMI will just be overkill

[05:51:47] <Ilari> Okay, looks like rust nightly build failed again...
[05:52:08] <Ilari> ... The last nightly is from Monday...
[05:52:31] <bascule> I am using the stable channel now
[05:52:53] <bascule> i guess Ilari has Unusual Requirements
[05:52:54] <bascule> lol
[05:55:33] <Ilari> Also, I find allocating variable-size buffers in Rust annoying.
[05:57:46] <eternaleye> Ilari: How come?
[05:58:05] <eternaleye> Ilari: There's no shortage of libraries for it, carllerche's bytes among them
[05:58:44] <Ilari> Make a buffer lasting current function (or part of it) that can hold x Ts (where x is an variable value).
[05:59:16] <eternaleye> Mm
[06:00:20] <Ilari> And usually x is fairly small, but no fixed upper bound can be established.
[06:03:04] <eternaleye> Ilari: fn mkbuf<T>(x: usize) -> Box<[T]> { (0..x).map(|_| Default::default()).collect::<Vec<_>>().into_boxed_slice() }
[06:03:21] <eternaleye> No, I need T: Default
[06:03:23] <eternaleye> But yeah
[06:04:06] <eternaleye> Ilari: And because that's an ExactSizeIterator, it'll be one allocation.
[06:04:08] <bascule> that's really the crux of it
[06:04:19] <bascule> generics that are parametric around some sort of otherwise constant value
[06:04:42] <bascule> like, say, "sha" is an algorithm, and N is a size, like 256 or 512
[06:04:52] <eternaleye> bascule: If you have one T: Default, and one T: Clone, that really covers anything I can see wanting a local-scope buffer of...
[06:05:28] <bascule> eternaleye: I assume Ilari would like to have an ECC library that is generic around Curve25519 or Ed448-Goldilocks
[06:05:30] <eternaleye> bascule: Eh, once they fix the ICEs with arrays whose size is an associated constant, those fall out easy
[06:06:39] <Ilari> And yeah, the arrays would be for things like hash outputs or various ECC-related outputs.
[06:06:54] <Ilari> ... Sizes obviously depend on the hash function or curve used.
[06:07:30] <eternaleye> Well, if you can tolerate heap allocation, the function I just gave is pretty much optimal, modulo preference as to Clone or Default
[06:07:52] <eternaleye> If you need it to be stack allocated, then yeah, you'll have to wait on those ICEs
[06:08:48] <eternaleye> If it _is_ an associated constant, then vec![def; size].into_boxed_slice() works
[06:09:01] <eternaleye> I was assuming it was a function parameter, not a compile-time constant.
[06:09:41] <Ilari> It is likely a function return value (perhaps plus something else).
[06:10:03] <eternaleye> Sure? But both boxed and stack (by value) can do that
[06:10:26] <eternaleye> Oh, you mean the number
[06:10:36] <eternaleye> Then yeah, the function I wrote is your best bet
[06:11:48] <eternaleye> I'd still suggest trying it as an associated constant with vec![] though
[06:12:03] <eternaleye> That should sidestep the array-size ICEs
[06:12:26] <eternaleye> Because IIRC those stem from the typeck/trans phase weirdness around when things get resolved
[06:12:33] <eternaleye> and Vec is not subject to those
[06:13:34] <Ilari> The problem there is, in my libs, there are no exported per-curve types, so associated items don't work.
[06:13:35] <eternaleye> And vec![0u8; 256].into_boxed_slice() is Not Bad in terms of ergonomics.
[06:13:44] <eternaleye> Mm
[06:14:40] <Ilari> Points of Ed25519 and Ed448-Goldilocks have both the same type (similarly for their fields and scalars).
[06:16:39] <eternaleye> Mm
[06:17:30] <eternaleye> I'd have actually been tempted to have a trait EdwardsLadder with default methods, and the curves impl it.
[06:17:55] <eternaleye> (and similar things)
[06:19:28] <Ilari> Then there is Curve type that acts as factory type for all objects related to the type, and then there is factory function that makes Curve objects.
