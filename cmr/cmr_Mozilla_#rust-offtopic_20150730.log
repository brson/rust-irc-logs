[02:13:09] <c74d> that would be a viable compilation target for other programming languages?

[03:07:14] <niconii> yeah i'm definitely gonna have to find a way to summarize join/parts or something instead of filtering wholesale

[03:11:11] <Elainemo> I wanted to blow the stack and crash it
[03:11:22] <FreeFull> Peach: You'll need to limit recursion depth
[03:11:24] <Elainemo> but I got greedy
[03:11:33] <scott> Peach: Is this being compiled to C?
[03:11:57] <Peach> Elainemo: It's funny, it is real typed, I just haven't done AST checks yet :P
[03:11:59] <Peach> scott:  yes
[03:12:10] <scott> Elainemo: ^ The recursion may be optimized out
[03:12:15] <Elainemo> scott: indeed.
[03:12:40] <FreeFull> I want to try something out
[03:12:43] <Elainemo> Peach: so if you don't do "AST checks" (whatever that means), why can arrays have multiple elements of different types?
[03:12:47] <FreeFull> Something that won't crash the bot
[03:12:49] <Elainemo> How do you chose to represent the array?
[03:12:55] <scott> I also have something to try
[03:12:59] <Elainemo> What I really want to know, I guess, is do you have a uniform representation at runtime.
[03:13:17] <FreeFull> Peach: Will you bring it back up now if we promise not to break it in that way again?

[03:54:37] <Peach> typeof is a keyword
[03:54:49] <GBGamer> Peach: homoiconic?
[03:54:56] <GBGamer> like Lisp?
[03:54:58] <Peach> for new typeof returns text, but later it will return  "type" (metatype)

[03:56:42] <Peach> FreeFull: I'd say far more flexible than C++ decltype, this language is statically typed
[03:56:52] <Peach> but it looks as simple as a dynamic language
[03:57:54] <Peach> I implemented an "Any" type which is what variables are currently using - later I'll upgrade to a real type system with proper checking
[03:58:05] <FreeFull> I see
[03:58:09] <Peach> Currently it stores things as void*
[03:58:21] <Peach> but still uses real types under the hood
[03:58:25] <scott> How will you make static type checking work with the rather dynamic-seeming typeof?

[04:29:34] <aatch> GBGamer, but it's not really owned though.
[04:29:54] <GBGamer> yes it is?

[04:32:05] <GBGamer> aatch: perhaps, I'm not arguing that
[04:32:22] <GBGamer> I'd have to do some work on that
[04:32:26] <scott> GBGamer: And you end up with a partially moved structure?
[04:32:34] <scott> e.g. a Box with the contents moved out
[04:32:39] <aatch> GBGamer, if I pass an &own T to a function that *might* move out of it, I have to figure out what to do with the original contents.
[04:32:42] <GBGamer> scott: DerefMove takes self as a parameter
[04:32:47] <scott> aatch: ^ is that where drop flags come in?
[04:32:54] <aatch> scott, yep.
[04:33:04] <GBGamer> aatch: the function that takes the &own T is in charge of dropping it
[04:33:31] <aatch> GBGamer, so it's always a fat pointer, or a doubly-fat pointer if T isn't Sized

[04:33:47] <GBGamer> aatch: okay, I don't think you're getting this
[04:34:02] <GBGamer> basically, it has the same semantics as literally just giving a function a T
[04:34:20] <GBGamer> except that the &own T has a lifetime, and is a pointer
[04:34:38] <scott> GBGamer: fn deref_move(self) -> &own T { ... } // self is supposed to be dropped at the end of scope, but we return a reference to something in self?
[04:34:54] <scott> I think deref_move would have to take &own self or something at least

[04:42:20] <aatch> GBGamer, eh. I was thinking about the fact that you can actually just re-frame DSTs as existential types.
[04:42:33] <GBGamer> aatch: hmm?
[04:42:55] <aatch> GBGamer, so you have [T; N], and then [T] is actually exists N. [T]
[04:43:02] <scott> &[T] is exists N: usize, &[T; N]
[04:43:11] <aatch> scott, right, yes.
[04:43:21] <GBGamer> alright, how would we define that syntax?
[04:43:33] <scott> The representation of exists N: usize, &[T; N] is just (N, &[T; N]), i.e. the fat pointer
[04:44:10] * Peach is going to rewrite Rust with prettier syntax
[04:44:14] <aatch> GBGamer, well it's basically what we have now, it's just inferred. I realised that you can actually generalize it.
[04:44:37] <scott> err, to be pedantic I could say the representation is (N, ptr) of type (usize, &[T; N])
[04:45:03] <GBGamer> aatch: so let's say you have a 2-d slice
[04:45:08] <GBGamer> how would you define that?
[04:45:14] <scott> It generalizes semi-reasonably to higher levels of fat pointers
[04:45:19] <aatch> scott, basically.
[04:45:23] <scott> &[[T]] can be a thing, but it wouldn't handle strides
[04:45:36] <GBGamer> Peach: what exactly isn't pretty about Rust?
[04:45:44] <GBGamer> Peach: I really like its syntax...
[04:45:46] <aatch> I was thinking that `exists T. Foo<T>` would be Foo<T> + pointer

[04:46:17] <aatch> scott, yeah.
[04:46:52] <Peach> crypic short names and use of extra symbols |x|  =>    are what make Rust not super pretty
[04:46:54] <scott> The issue is if Foo<T> changes size based on T

[05:13:25] <scott> Why does a safe have a USB port?
[05:14:19] <XMPPwocky> for debugging apparently
[05:14:58] <scott> Ahhhhh. Because they expect the safe to have bugs, because they put Windows XP on it.
[05:16:01] <scott> > Unfortunately, the very existence of a fully-functional USB port brings with it a world of trouble.

[05:16:59] <XMPPwocky> lmao
[05:18:02] <Peach> Ok so
[05:18:09] <Peach> In the language I'm making
[05:18:21] <Peach> I'm totally on the fence about implicit return
[05:18:26] <GBGamer> Peach: does it have a name yet?
[05:18:31] <GBGamer> and please do
[05:19:07] <Peach> Implicit return... I'm just thinking about the whole deal - IDEs, code finding, etc.
[05:19:31] *** Quits: RC9 (RCIX@moz-7omm6s.ph.cox.net) (Quit: Leaving)
[05:19:39] <GBGamer> what's wrong with implicit return around IDEs, code finding, etc?
[05:19:40] *** Joins: RC9 (RCIX@moz-7omm6s.ph.cox.net)
[05:19:42] <Peach> also is    fn() { {let x = 0; x} }  // does x return here?
[05:20:02] <GBGamer> in Rust; yes
[05:20:22] <Peach> fn returns integer in that case GBGamer ?
[05:20:43] <GBGamer> some kinda integer, yeah
[05:20:50] <scott> It's standard expression evaluation rules. Functions just happen to return the value their block evaluates to, unless an early return happens.
[05:21:35] <Peach> GBGamer: by code finding, I mean it's harder to search for the "return" token across a bunch of files
[05:21:52] <huon> that fn takes the value of its last expression; which is the { ... } block, and that block takes the value of *its* last expression, which is x
[05:21:54] <scott> A block { stmts; expr } has the evaluation rule of executing the statements and then recursively evaluating the expr
[05:21:56] <GBGamer> I... can't say I've every searched for the return token across a bunch of files
[05:22:30] <GBGamer> is that a thing people do?
[05:22:37] <Peach> making something as important as "return"  an implicit thing, I think it may cause issues with the code base sizes I'm dealing with
[05:22:44] <scott> Peach: Rust's way has the advantage that every 'return' keyword usage is an *early* return, which are important.
[05:22:48] <Peach> GBGamer: yeah, at least me anyway
[05:22:58] <huon> static typing means implicit return has never been a problem for me
[05:23:01] <XMPPwocky> 78
[05:23:03] <GBGamer> huh, interesting
[05:23:08] <scott> return at the end is just business as usual - it's not important
[05:23:20] <GBGamer> I guess it's up to you
[05:23:21] <scott> early return affects control flow
[05:23:53] <c74d> Peach: how large are your code-bases? larger than rustc?
[05:24:01] <c74d> (and Servo?)
[05:24:21] <Peach> about as large c74d ......shockingly even large @_@
[05:24:32] <huon> how many loc?
[05:24:35] <GBGamer> what do you do?
[05:24:36] <XMPPwocky> it's not about implicit return: it's about 2 things. one, blocks (separated by semicolons) evaluating to the expression after the last semicolon. two, functions taking a block and returning (if no explicit "return") what the block evaluates to
[05:24:39] <c74d> (not that I have statistics on rustc and Servo)
[05:24:48] <XMPPwocky> there's a little more nuance there
[05:25:40] <huon> (the main part of the main servo repo is 180kloc, which isn't including any of it's 100 dependencies)
[05:26:02] <scott> How large is rustc?
[05:26:07] <c74d> Peach: would it work as well to search for function definitions, and use some editor key-command to jump to the end of a function definition?
[05:26:09] <huon> 300+ kloc
[05:27:02] <Peach> c74d: I'd like to make it so each function lets you see its return expressions and areas where it returns at a glance
[05:27:09] <huon> (the dependencies of servo seem to be about the 200kloc of Rust too)
[05:27:24] <Peach> Tokens are always faster than AST traversal
[05:27:47] <scott> End of function is always a return spot. There's no need to mark it as such.
[05:27:54] <scott> Only early returns should be highlighted.
[05:28:00] <c74d> Peach: highlight each "return foo" line and the last expression in the function?
[05:28:20] <Peach> "last expression in function"
[05:28:34] <Peach> that requires AST traversal to do right
[05:28:51] <c74d> Is your IDE not capable of that?
[05:29:02] <scott> There's no need to do it at all - the programmer already knows the end of function is a return spot.
[05:29:46] <scott> Anyway, I'm off to bed. Goodnight.

[05:47:03] <Peach> I've decided to only use trailing return types in the language I'm making
[05:47:09] <Peach> Now the question is
[05:47:19] <Peach> what about having no arrow?

[05:47:51] <Peach> what about just omitting the -> to save typing?
[05:47:56] <c74d> mm
[05:48:16] <Havvy> Peach:  You're trading readability for a minor amount of keystrokes.
[05:48:32] <c74d> I find ASCII arrows annoying to type, but you're optimizing for obviousness when reading, and this seems inconsistent with that
[05:49:26] <ChrisMorgan> Peach: TypeScript uses `function(args: Types): ReturnType`.
[05:50:11] * c74d also used a colon, a few days ago.
[05:50:16] *** Joins: swgillespie (swgillespie@moz-rn1.vmq.232.104.IP)
[05:50:43] <GBGamer> I like the colon
[05:50:44] <ChrisMorgan> C uses `returntype name(arguments)`, but don’t copy that type of thing.
[05:50:53] <GBGamer> as a C programmer
[05:50:58] <GBGamer> don't use that fucking syntax
[05:50:59] <ChrisMorgan> I’m OK with the colon in TypeScript, but it wouldn’t have been nice for Rust.

[05:54:20] <c74d> our function type syntaxes appear to have converged
[05:54:20] <GBGamer> I prefer fn (int) -> int for single params
[05:54:59] <c74d> GBGamer: I see it like, `(x) = x`

[05:55:40] <GBGamer> I disagree
[05:55:57] <GBGamer> a function is special, because they are argument lists
[05:56:02] <benh> function Foo(x, y: Foo; z: Bar): Baz; imo
[05:56:13] <GBGamer> fn(T) -> X
[05:56:23] <GBGamer> (T) is a list
[05:57:06] <GBGamer> T is a type
[05:57:58] <Peach> c74d: would it be bad to allow both ways?   fn int -> int   ?
[05:58:25] <GBGamer> well, (T) = T, so...
[05:58:30] <Peach> fn (int) -> int
[05:59:01] <Peach> Well  fn (type) -> type   IS clearer
[05:59:20] <GBGamer> imo, at least
[05:59:39] <c74d> to me, those parentheses are unnecessary noise, but I don't hold others to that opinion
[05:59:47] <Peach> function name(type) -> type { code; };     typeof(name)  would be   "fn(type)->type"

[06:00:48] <Havvy> It depends on whether there's auto-currying or not.

[06:01:42] <Peach> "f" is what?
[06:01:43] <Havvy> Peach:  You call a function with less than the full number of arguments and get a function back.
[06:01:53] <GBGamer> (f 1) becomes (f y ) { 1 + y }
[06:02:03] <Peach> uhhhhhhhhhhh
[06:02:15] <Peach> I can't see why that's a useful feature
[06:02:26] <c74d> Havvy: that's partial application, not currying
[06:02:30] <GBGamer> because functional programming
[06:02:34] <Peach> It's function overloading to the extreme
[06:02:45] <c74d> Currying is like...

[06:05:38] <Havvy> Peach:  Probably because you can't put a good name to it.
[06:05:41] <GBGamer> it's like pointers
[06:05:54] <Havvy> "Currying" is *really* *really* poorly named.

[06:06:55] <fmtq> pointers took my brain ages to accept.
[06:07:06] <c74d> rather than `gelic(|xbn| foobar(xae, xbn))`, if foobar is curried, you could instead partially apply it and just write `gelic(foobar(xae))`.
[06:07:07] <GBGamer> it took me a few months

[11:37:59] <fkaa> but why are extern "C" fn(...) functions safe?
[11:38:10] <eddyb> fkaa: because they're Rust functions
[11:38:24] <fkaa> and extern "C" { ... } functions are unsafe?
[11:38:27] <eddyb> with a different ABI
[11:38:44] <eddyb> fkaa: same syntax, different meaning entirely
[11:38:53] <eddyb> changing the ABI doesn't affect whether a function is safe or not
[11:38:57] <Quxxy> Not all `extern "C"` functions are C functions, but all `extern { ... }` functions are not-Rust
[11:39:01] <eddyb> but FFI can never be implicitely safe

[11:41:23] <eddyb> callbacks?
[11:41:25] <fkaa> yeah
[11:41:44] <eddyb> then safe is fine
[11:41:56] <eddyb> although, unsafe would allow passing in safe or unsafe functions
[11:42:11] <fkaa> but then i can't pass functions from the lua headers :c
[11:42:13] <fkaa> yeah

[11:43:45] <fkaa> what is that at the end even

[13:56:02] <wrl> anybody have opinions on protobufs vs capnproto, msgpack, etc?
[13:56:17] <wrl> will be for IPC purposes on a local machine
[13:56:46] <Tiffany> wrl: msgpack has the overhead of being schemaless, protobuf requires tons of heap allocations, I suggest capn proto
[13:57:20] <fmtq> but
[13:57:24] <fmtq> it has a stupid name Tiffany
[13:57:47] <Tiffany> iirc capn proto is made by the person who made protobuf, as its successor
[13:58:33] <fkaa> eddyb_: is it safe to re-define a c-struct in rust and use it across ffi?
[13:58:38] <fkaa> fields and everything
[13:58:52] <Tiffany> both protobuf and msgpack have a decoding phase, where it's translated from the wire representation to machine representation
[13:59:00] <Tiffany> capn proto is never translated, it's always kept in wire representation
[14:02:49] <Tiffany> the only downside to capn proto is that it's slightly inefficient bandwidth-wise, but that is the least of your concerns when doing IPC
[14:03:09] <Tiffany> unless you're using an IPC system with a fast path through registers, I suppose
[14:03:19] <Tiffany> like seL4
[14:04:00] <Tiffany> mainly, structs are padded to 8 bytes, but it's not like C, it reorganizes fields to maximize efficient packing
[14:04:05] <Tiffany> it never wastes more than 63 bits per struct
[14:04:20] <Tiffany> for this reason, capn proto has some zero padding
[14:08:05] <Tiffany> fkaa: iirc if you only use C-compatible types rust uses C padding rules, so yes

[18:21:55] *** Quits: npm (npm@moz-udo6df.hfc.comcastbusiness.net) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[18:22:21] <WindowsBunny> Peach: explicit self

[18:22:31] <Peach> struct Flower; impl Flower { fn member(self) {...} }       typeof(Flower::member) == fn(Flower) -> ()    in Rust right?
[18:22:37] <WindowsBunny> fn somemethod(&self, ...) or (self, ...) or (&mut self, ...)
[18:22:40] <Peach> I don't actually mean the syntax,
[18:22:45] <Peach> I mean the type signature
[18:23:04] <WindowsBunny> Peach: The type signature of a method is identical to the type signature of a regular function that takes the same parameters
[18:23:13] <Peach> Oh
[18:23:28] *** Joins: npm (npm@moz-udo6df.hfc.comcastbusiness.net)
[18:23:31] <Peach> So in Rust there's no distinction if it's in or out of the function?
[18:23:47] <WindowsBunny> in or out?
[18:24:07] <Peach> *in or out of the class
[18:24:07] <scott> Think of fn foo(self) as shorthand for fn foo(self: Self) where Self is the type whose impl you are in.
[18:24:21] <Elainemo> There is a distinction, but not at the type level.
[18:24:23] <scott> Likewise fn foo(&self) is fn foo(self: &Self)
[18:24:33] <scott> So self is just a regular parameter in that sense.

[18:26:36] <Peach> scott: does it go the opposite too?    if I have   function q(Flower, x, y) {}      can I call     let f : Flower;   f.q(x,y);   ?

[18:27:17] <Elainemo> Peach: Rust structs are not classes.
[18:27:27] <Elainemo> Don't call them classes, don't confuse them with classes.
[18:27:43] <Elainemo> They're product types with named fields, but they aren't speciail.
[18:27:55] * Peach is coming from C/C++ where struct and class is the same thing
[18:28:02] * Elainemo knows and doesn't care :P
[18:28:05] <scott> C++ structs are classes.
[18:28:08] <scott> C doesn't have classes.
[18:28:16] <scott> Rust structs are not classes, like in C.
[18:28:30] <scott> Classes in most languages imply some kind of virtual dispatch (or at least the possibility of it, like in C++).
[18:28:35] <Elainemo> And inheritance.
[18:28:39] <WindowsBunny> but Rust structs can implement traits and have actual associated methods/consts/types, unlike C structs which can't
[18:28:55] <scott> Well, virtual dispatch is pointless without inheritance, but yeah,.

[18:35:56] <scott> WindowsBunny: What is a COM interface?
[18:36:26] <WindowsBunny> scott: a windows standard for cross-language objects with virtual dispatch

[18:36:53] <scott> Are .NET compiled things in COM format?
[18:37:00] <Elainemo> No.
[18:37:03] <WindowsBunny> .NET isn't COM
[18:37:14] <WindowsBunny> But there are COM wrappers for some .NET things
[18:37:33] <scott> Windows has so many incompatible systems and I don't know any of them.
[18:37:39] <Elainemo> and it's easy to interface with COM objects in .NET
[18:38:29] <scott> COM is cross language with which languages, then?
[18:38:30] <niconii> first thing i thought when scott asked "Are .NET compiled things in COM format?" was "...what, like DOS .com files?"
[18:38:55] <WindowsBunny> scott: delphi, rust, C, C++, some other things
[18:39:11] <Elainemo> scott: and across C/C++ compilers too, which was huge at the time.
[18:39:26] <scott> What's the benefit of it over C ABI or whatever? Historical raisins?
[18:39:27] <WindowsBunny> scott: Anything which either has COM support in the language, or is low level enough for COM to be used manually
[18:39:31] <WindowsBunny> scott: OOP yo
[18:39:39] <scott> I said benefit. :p
[18:39:40] <WindowsBunny> a standardized OOP model
[18:39:47] <scott> So like GObject?
[18:40:14] <Elainemo> GObject doesn't define an ABI.
[18:40:31] <WindowsBunny> scott: You basically get an opaque pointer where at offset 0 is the vtable
[18:40:45] <WindowsBunny> the ABI of the methods in the vtable and the layout is well defined
[18:40:46] <scott> And vtable is non-opaque?
[18:40:53] <WindowsBunny> yes
[18:41:36] <WindowsBunny> All of COM is built on top of IUnknown which has QueryInterface for up/down/side casting between interfaces, as well as AddRef and Release for reference counting
[18:41:55] <scott> Elainemo: Is it semi-accurate to say COM is like GCC C ABI + GObject, then?
[18:42:07] <Elainemo> scott: Kind of I guess.
[18:42:52] <Elainemo> there's more to COM than just COM too, DCOM (distributed) and a bunch of other IPC stuff

[18:48:44] <WindowsBunny> And implementing COM interfaces yourself is a living nightmare without language support for it
[18:49:14] <scott> What's been your approach for Rust support? Lots of macros?

[18:53:34] <Elainemo> it becomes completely pure, not interaction with the system at all except for console io
[18:54:02] <scott> I didn't even know it had a secure mode. That should make eval bots much easier.

[19:00:50] <scott> Peach: It had something like that, and it was removed: http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.rust.devel/3674/focus=3855
[19:01:19] <scott> const fns are kind of one form of purity, and those are coming.
[19:04:44] <Elainemo> Peach: purity means something different to everyone, what most people want is actually an effect system.

[19:06:59] <eddyb> scott: const fn's are implemented, but they are not as well integrated or feature-complete as they could be
[19:07:23] <scott> I say coming because they aren't stable yet (right?).
[19:07:31] <Peach> Oh, well I mean - The programming language can check when a function has access to a global/external state, functions that have a side effect and do not always return the same result when given the same input
[19:19:07] <Elainemo> Peach: that's too limited though -- sometimes you want to be sure something doesn't allocate, or doesn't use the network, etc.
[19:19:21] <Elainemo> but not necessarily referentially transparent.
[19:19:28] <Peach> Yeah, what's the name for that?
[19:19:33] <Peach> heap pure? :P
[19:19:43] <Peach> Also, using the network would count as impure
[19:19:44] <Elainemo> I don't think it would have a name.
[19:19:49] <Elainemo> Yes, it would count as impure
[19:19:54] <Elainemo> But you don't want to always forbid *everything*
[19:20:01] <Peach> network is an external state
[19:20:04] <Elainemo> just some effects you care about.
[19:20:07] <Peach> Oh hmm
[19:20:27] <Peach> I would make it so that's only enforced when annotated as pure
[19:20:39] <Peach> and by default the language lets you be impure
[19:21:01] <Peach> and anything could be infered as pure
[19:24:31] <niconii> that's still just a pure/impure binary though
[19:25:16] <niconii> the point is you might want to enforce that a function can never use the heap, but it can use all other side-effects, and so on
[19:25:29] <eddyb> an effect system would have custom effects

[19:25:29] <niconii> but pure/impure doesn't give you that granularity
[19:25:49] <Elainemo> Or that it doesn't access outside state, but can spawn threads that share its own state.
[19:25:51] <Elainemo> etc.

[19:29:08] <niconii> hmph
[19:29:19] <niconii> on another note, i'm trying to write a general IFF parser at the moment
[19:29:50] <Elainemo> friend/foe or something else?
[19:29:51] <niconii> and being somewhat hampered by the fact that the only in-depth technical details i can find about it are buried in paragraph after paragraph of prose
[19:30:12] <niconii> ah, no, Interchange File Format
[19:30:38] <niconii> the wikipedia page talks about it a bit, but doesn't give all the details i need
[19:32:15] <niconii> actually i think the main problem is that the section headers all melt together in this thing: http://www.martinreddy.net/gfx/2d/IFF.txt
