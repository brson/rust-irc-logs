[07:56:59] <shu> pnkfelix: what were your plans for ECOOP? just drop by for a few days?
[07:57:07] <shu> pnkfelix: you mentioned you weren't going to stay for the full conference
[07:57:09] <pnkfelix> shu: yeah that was my thinking
[07:57:20] <shu> pnkfelix: how far is prague from paris by train anyhow?
[07:57:20] <pnkfelix> shu: I don't think I can justify staying for the full week
[07:57:25] <pnkfelix> shu: let me see
[07:58:29] <pnkfelix> shu: looks like an overnight trip by train

[08:01:06] <pnkfelix> shu: I've been trying to figure out what day the demo would be on?
[08:02:12] <shu> hm, the website certainly doesn't say
[08:02:58] <shu> nrc: ping?

[08:03:29] <pnkfelix> shu: maybe I should email the conf chair?
[08:04:16] <shu> pnkfelix: i guess email jan, yeah
[08:04:27] <shu> lol his title on the website is "comfy chair"
[08:12:30] <nrc> belated pong
[08:12:32] <nrc> shu ^
[08:12:55] <shu> nrc: was wondering if you happened to know what day the ecoop industry demo would be
[08:13:01] <nrc> no
[08:13:05] <shu> nrc: but i think felix'll just email jan to find out
[08:13:06] <pnkfelix> i sent an email via the link on the website ; if I don't see a response in a few hours then I'll send an email directly to Jan
[08:13:15] <nrc> I don't think the industry demo is worth being involved with, tbh
[08:13:25] <nrc> it would be better to give a talk at CUrry On
[08:13:25] <shu> oh no?
[08:13:32] <nrc> or elsewhere at the conference
[08:13:51] <shu> so that certainly does not require Silver
[08:13:59] <nrc> I imagine a proper talk would get better attendance and have better impact
[08:14:14] <shu> while we're all here, do we all agree on Bronze or are there objections?
[08:14:16] <pnkfelix> nrc: okay, so then we're just back to me needing to actually contact the ppl in charge of Curry On then i guess
[08:14:24] <pnkfelix> shu: nrc: I think Bronze is fine then.
[08:14:34] <nrc> pnkfelix: ping Jan about Curry On
[08:14:46] <nrc> he asked me to give a Rust talk there and I said I won't but someone might
[08:14:54] <shu> damn this Curry On web site is so silicon valley
[08:15:15] <shu> oh brendan is going
[08:15:17] <shu> huh
[08:15:30] <nrc> shu: yeah, I think the real advantage of silver is just not looking cheap, but I don't Mozilla really gains by trying to look 'not cheap', if you see what I mean
[08:15:54] <pnkfelix> nrc: i assume you are saying i should just email Jan directly. I can do that.
[08:16:19] <nrc> (I meanl I like ECOOP and I'd love to give them more money, but it doesn't seem like money well spent, from our point of view)
[08:16:21] <shu> nrc: it's more important to convince students we want to collaborate with we're not cheap, not the passers by and conf organizers, i suppose
[08:16:24] <nrc> pnkfelix: yes
[08:16:55] <shu> curry on looks really cool actually
[08:18:10] <nrc> yeah, I hope we're not too late for that
[08:19:11] <shu> nrc: as for appearing cheap, i mean, goldman sachs is bronze
[08:19:14] <shu> they are literally money
[08:21:38] <nrc> :-)
[08:25:58] <pnkfelix> (okay sent, cc'ed nrc)  THanks guys
[08:26:16] <nrc> thanks pnkfelix!
[08:27:06] <nrc> shu: shall I email Jan about sponsorshp?
[08:27:58] <shu> nrc: sure; you said he asked you already?
[08:28:12] <shu> nrc: let's go with bronze, with the instructions azita gave in her email
[08:29:31] <nrc> yep
[08:29:36] <nrc> shall do, sounds good

[09:02:01] <nrc> it can wait till the morning, I'm sure
[09:05:11] <nrc> shu: do you know what Azita means by "submit an invoice" - email it to her? Or do we have people/places to do that?
[09:06:41] <shu> nrc: i think it means have jan draw up some invoice for the sponsorship and email it to her to actually get the money?
[09:07:27] <nrc> Ok, good, that was what I was assuming too. Was checking I wasn't missing some US-specific or office-specific context, thanks

[13:01:52] <pnkfelix> okay, I need to make a title for a Rust ECOOP presentation
[13:01:56] <pnkfelix> for Rust
[13:02:05] <pnkfelix> now
[13:02:10] <pnkfelix> who's awake and wants to help make something catchy ?
[13:02:19] <pnkfelix> "Rust: 1.0 and beyond"
[13:03:32] <pnkfelix> larsberg: ^
[13:04:32] *** Joins: jdm (jdm@moz-ilbt2e.cable.teksavvy.com)
[13:04:41] <larsberg> pnkfelix: what's the venue? And how long is the talk? Is it at the industrial reception, a workshop, or are you doing a keynote?
[13:04:53] <pnkfelix> larsberg: definitely not a keynote
[13:05:01] <pnkfelix> larsberg: Its at "Curry On"
[13:05:10] <pnkfelix> http://www.curry-on.org/
[13:06:35] <pnkfelix> "Rust: Encoding safety guarantees in library APIs"
[13:07:42] <pnkfelix> "Rust: Power, Responsiblity, and Safety"
[13:07:51] <larsberg> So you're looking for something that's a little more industry-friendly than just the academic ECOOP crowd (assuming they attract the crowd they're looking for)?
[13:07:58] <larsberg> "Rust: Class without Classes"
[13:08:19] <pnkfelix> larsberg: I guess I just want something that's eye-catching
[13:09:02] <pnkfelix> larsberg: I don't have an abstract put together yet, so I'm also trying to make something sufficiently vague that I leave myself leeway in what I actually put in the abstract
[13:09:15] <pnkfelix> larsberg: (they need the title now, and the abstract "asap")
[13:10:20] <pnkfelix> "Rust: How Borrowing and Ownership Yield Great Power and Responsibility"
[13:11:07] <jdm> Rust: An Elegant Language, For A More Civilized Age
[13:11:34] <larsberg> "Rust: Types That Encode What You Thought You Were Doing But Actually Weren't"
[13:11:37] <pnkfelix> jdm: aww I figured Lisp still owned that thanks to xkcd.  :)
[13:12:08] <pnkfelix> larsberg: I like that
[13:12:13] <jdm> Rust: Borrow-Driven Development
[13:12:23] <pnkfelix> larsberg: (is there anyway to make it more succinct, hmm)
[13:12:33] <jdm> or Borrowcheck-Driven Development, more precisely
[13:12:47] <larsberg> Is this the first instance of Curry On? I was trying to look for last year's agenda to see if we could match tone...
[13:12:57] <pnkfelix> "Rust: (Borrow) Checks and Balances"
[13:13:17] <larsberg> "Rust: A Type System You Didn't Know You Wanted"
[13:14:02] <larsberg> Unfortunately, Phil Wadler's there and he's basically the Supreme Overlord of catchy paper/talk titles, so I wouldn't try to get too cute
[13:14:22] <pnkfelix> I think I like "A Type System You Didn't Know You Wanted"
[13:14:38] <pnkfelix> though I worry about it being too easily misread as anti-rust
[13:14:49] <pnkfelix> (or miscontrued)
[13:16:19] <pnkfelix> "Rust: Being forced to SWYM (say what you mean)"
[13:17:08] <pnkfelix> (don't worry, I won't use that; that acronym looks taken)
[13:18:11] <pnkfelix> larsberg: Okay I think I'm going to go with "A Type System You Didn't Know You Wanted", thanks!
[13:18:29] <larsberg> pnkfelix: Awesome, good luck with the talk!

[22:44:40] <roc> khuey: you added SYSEMU support to your kernel, right? But it would be easier if rr didn't use SYSEMU at all?
[22:50:27] <khuey> roc: I did
[22:50:32] <khuey> roc: and I don't think it would matter
[22:50:54] <khuey> roc: are you contemplating just switching the syscall number to something benign? or something else
[23:01:10] <roc> one possibility is to never use cont_sysemu

[23:01:31] <roc> and not use cont_syscall either (during replay)
[23:01:32] <khuey> roc: what would we do for the syscalls we want to skip?
[23:01:44] <roc> instead, just set a breakpoint at the syscall instruction we're heading for
[23:02:06] <roc> and emulate the syscall entry and exit completely, without entering the kernel at all

[23:07:51] <khuey> hmm
[23:08:22] <khuey> that would work, I suppose
[23:08:39] <khuey> I think we're going to need other kernel patches though
[23:08:43] <khuey>  the r[12] thing for instance
