[00:18:34] <mcpherrin> (at least I would, because zero-to-triangle in anything else is annoying)
[00:18:52] <mcpherrin> though I haven't really played much flappy bird so I dunno how it progresses past the third or so pipe
[00:19:02] <cmr> it doesn't.
[00:19:04] <cmr> same exact thing
[00:19:07] <cmr> until you die

[01:06:02] <mindslight> it would be pretty amazing if rust ended up in lispy low-sigil land coming from the direction of algol, but it also doesn't feel like that's going to happen by just removing pointers
[01:06:44] <jroweboy> when I use &mut unsafe { var.unwrap() } it complains that it doesn't live out the lifetime of the unsafe? block

[01:07:29] <cmr> that'd be doing something different than taking a reference to it.
[01:08:19] <jroweboy> I have to initialize the static mutable somehow, so I initialize it as None, so it is an option type. Come to think of it I proabably don't need to do that
[01:08:45] <cmr> you can do .mut_ref().unwrap()

[04:04:53] <dougxxx> jmmk: fair question; I don't really know. I would have assumed since all your modules are part of the same crate, you'd only have to call extern crate blah once. 
[04:05:10] <dougxxx> not in each file; but you do~
[04:05:52] <Eridius> the root file in your crate needs to say `extern crate foo`
[04:06:01] <Eridius> that is in fact the only place you can say it. You can't say that in any other module
[04:06:09] <Eridius> modules can say `use foo` to bring foo into scope, but that's a different action

[05:08:22] <Valloric> anyone willing to answer a newbie question?
[05:08:27] <sfackler> sure
[05:08:48] <Valloric> I'm looking at Traits and static dispatch
[05:09:09] <Valloric> let's say I have a vector of 5 items
[05:09:24] <Valloric> I want them all to be types of  Animals
[05:09:34] <Valloric> so Dog, Cat etc
[05:09:50] *** Joins: DAddYE (DAddYE@moz-98D3933F.hsd1.ca.comcast.net)
[05:09:52] <Eridius> you can't have static dispatch if they're different concrete implementations
[05:10:00] <Eridius> you can only have static dispatch if they're all the same implementation
[05:10:02] <Eridius> e.g. if they're all Cats
[05:10:11] <Valloric> that's what I thought
[05:10:30] <Eridius> you do that with generics, e.g. `fn foo<T: Animal>(v: ~[T]) { ... }`

[05:11:13] <Valloric> thanks Eridius!
[05:11:43] <nrc> heh, I was being at least 85% serious - if this were C++ I'd spend an hour and a half debugging now
[05:11:47] <Yurume> nrc: you won the correctness at cost of annoying battle with the compiler
[05:12:08] <Eridius> Yurume: better than having a use-after-free later at runtime once you've shipped
[05:12:08] <Yurume> I really appreciate that
[05:12:11] <Valloric> but can I have ~[Animal]? basically I want dynamic dispatch, but no indirection to the item
[05:12:19] <Valloric> just to the method
[05:12:22] <Eridius> Valloric: no, because each Animal impl may be a different size
[05:12:28] <Yurume> Eridius: sure, I think it is very reasonable (if not preferable) trade-off
[05:12:31] <nrc> yep, me too
[05:12:35] <Eridius> Valloric: are you willing to accept a finite, closed set of Animal impls?
[05:12:43] <Valloric> let's say I am
[05:12:46] <Eridius> Valloric: if so you can define an enum, with a variant for each impl
[05:13:08] <Eridius> enum AnimalImpl { CatImpl(Cat), DogImpl(Dog) }
[05:13:11] <Eridius> now you can have ~[AnimalImpl]
[05:13:19] <Eridius> and match on the enum variant internally
[05:13:41] <Eridius> which restores static dispatch, at the cost that a) the set of impls is fixed by this code, and b) the size of the enum is the same as the largest impl
[05:13:49] <Eridius> so if Cat is 8 bytes and Dog is 800, CatImpl is 800 as well
[05:13:59] <Valloric> thanks, that makes sense
[05:14:25] *** Joins: lawrence (lawrence@moz-D2AE8C65.chestnutresnet.utoronto.ca)
[05:14:33] <Yurume> it's 800 plus alpha, since AnimalImpl does have to store what variant is in use.
[05:14:44] <Eridius> good point
[05:14:51] <Eridius> although I'm not quite sure what you mean by "alpha"
[05:14:55] <Yurume> (sometimes alpha equals to zero, but in many case it would be 8)
[05:15:02] <Eridius> ah
[05:15:02] <Yurume> Eridius: the size of discriminator.
[05:15:09] <Valloric> how does this compare to std::vector<Animal> in c++?
[05:15:14] <Eridius> well yes, I know what the extra is. I just didn't know why you used the term alpha
[05:15:36] <Eridius> Valloric: std::vector<Animal> in C++ only holds Animals, it doesn't hold subclasses
[05:15:46] <Yurume> Eridius: since it's a variable? :)

[06:14:06] <mindslight> hm i see, because its really a slice

[06:39:49] <Valloric> what does "cannot move out of dereference of `&`-pointer" mean?
[06:40:01] <Valloric> I don't have the faintest clue
[06:41:20] <mcpherrin> You've got a &T somebody gave you, ie you don't own it.  You're trying to take part of that value and move it out.  The compiler thinks stealing is wrong so has imposed a moral judgement upon you.
[06:41:22] <Yurume> as it says.
[06:42:08] <Yurume> so you cannot move the value out of &T, so does for &mut T (yes, this is because the actual owner of T should be able to continue to use the value after the function returns)
[06:42:34] <Valloric> so I'm taking &self
[06:42:46] <Valloric> and then doing match self.contents
[06:43:03] <Yurume> for matches, it is very likely that you've omitted ref.
[06:43:04] <Valloric> and the branch is Text( x ) => x
[06:43:14] <Valloric> ah, but where?
[06:43:15] <Yurume> that should be Text(ref x) => x

[09:17:23] <dleedev> so if my function owns some_list, some_list won't have access to its tail anymore?
[09:17:33] <dleedev> after running let (_, x: ~List) = some_list

[09:18:33] <jroweboy> Is there a way to map from a function pointer to value in Rust? With a hashmap, the function pointer isn't hashable by default, but is there a way I can implement the Hash trait for a specific type of function pointers?

[10:23:16] <dleedev> I saw this in the tutorial, but it won't run:

[10:26:40] <kimundi> no
[10:26:46] <eddyb> the fact that immutable only matters if you want to change `view` to point to something else
[10:26:56] <kimundi> &T and &mut T are two different generic types
[10:27:27] <eddyb> dleedev: I guess "mutable reference to vector, in immutable local" is more precise
[10:27:28] <kimundi> (or rather, &[T] and &mut [T])
[10:28:01] <kimundi> There is no such type "mut [T]"
[10:29:22] <eddyb> mindcat: I think valgrind is derping up
[10:29:54] <eddyb> pretty sure it's talking about this https://github.com/mozilla/rust/blob/master/src/libstd/task.rs#L185
[10:30:23] <eddyb> but that's an Option represented as a nullable pointer https://github.com/mozilla/rust/blob/master/src/libstd/task.rs#L93
[10:31:05] <eddyb> and initialized with None (0) https://github.com/mozilla/rust/blob/master/src/libstd/task.rs#L104
[10:31:17] <eddyb> actually, it's a proc, it might not be a nullable pointer
[10:31:57] <mindcat> eddyb: alright...
[10:32:11] <eddyb> LLVM must be generating code that looks like it touches the uninitialized part of the value, but it's not actually doing that
[10:32:29] <eddyb> or valgrind simply doesn't have the precision to understand what's going on
[10:33:31] * eddyb wonders whether we can run valgrind on rustc

[13:18:04] <Zor> can rustc compile freestanding programs out of the box these days?
[13:18:24] <cmr> Zor: unfortunately not :((
[13:18:30] <eddyb> depends on your definition of "freestanding"
[13:18:44] <Zor> cmr: what's missing?
[13:18:46] <cmr> yeah I suppose it does.

[13:18:52] <pnkfelix> and "out of the box"
[13:18:54] * cmr was thinking -ffreestanding
[13:19:00] <Zor> yes, -ffreestanding
[13:19:00] <eddyb> it links statically by default, so a compiled program won't depend on rust-specific shared libraries

[13:20:48] <Zor> though to be more specific, I'm wondering how practical it would be to build a kernel with rust out of the box (i.e. master) today
[13:21:22] <cmr> Zor: so it's definitely possible.
[13:21:37] <eddyb> you just don't get goodies from libstd
[13:21:46] <cmr> but rustc does questionable things like emit stack size checking...
[13:21:49] <Leo`> it's possible when you don't have strange 8-bytes shifts
[13:21:55] <Leo`> :|
[13:21:55] <eddyb> :(
[13:22:02] <cmr> so the usual course of action is to compile to IR and compile it with clang
[13:22:12] <cmr> Leo`: I didn't make any headway with that btw, still weird as ever
[13:22:31] <Leo`> yep
[13:22:36] <Leo`> i'll ask acrichto about it
[13:22:40] <Zor> strange 8-byte shifts?
[13:23:11] <Zor> cmr: so you can't disable stack size checking with a flag?
[13:23:45] <eddyb> Zor: there's some kind of relocation or some other nonsense, causing Leo`s main function to be shifted by 8 bytes on master, compared to 0.8
[13:23:53] <Leo`> Zor: a bug i'm encountering in my own toy-OS in Rust

[13:24:20] <eddyb> Leo`: ahh, interesting
[13:24:42] <eddyb> so it's probably related to static linking
[13:24:51] <eddyb> Leo`: ohh, I didn't tell you about one thing
[13:24:55] <Zor> ah, that doesn't sound like much fun
[13:25:00] <eddyb> Leo`: -mrelocation-model=static

[13:25:40] <Leo`> k
[13:25:45] <Leo`> i'll try
[13:26:00] <Leo`> btw what we were saying with cmr yesterday
[13:26:01] <cmr> Zor: no, sadly. I had a patch that did it but it was deemed undesirable (which I partially agree with)
[13:26:21] <Zor> cmr: undesirable in what way?
[13:26:32] <Zor> implementation? or purpose?
[13:26:33] <Leo`> is that Rustc outputs in some way something that Grub doesn't know how to load properly
[13:26:40] <Leo`> but it could be a bug in Grub as well, or even LLVM

[13:27:31] <Zor> cmr: is it possible to just stub out functions related to stack size checking?
[13:27:38] <eddyb> cmr: ahh, that's why you were experimenting with computing stack sizes?
[13:27:47] <mindcat> did cmake for rust works?
[13:28:03] <cmr> Zor: yes, but the function prologue checks TLS for the stack size
[13:28:18] <cmr> Zor: which is unfortunate since it means you need fs set up properly etc...
[13:28:31] <mindcat> I mean, how do cmake compile rust code?

[17:30:09] <cmr> this is caused by macro hygiene
[17:30:48] <cmr> when a variable is used in a macro, the variables comes from the *current point where the macro is defined*, not the place where you expand the macro.
[17:30:51] <cmr> for example.
[17:31:23] <alan_andrade> I see
[17:32:13] <cmr> https://gist.github.com/cmr/9213728
[17:32:20] <cmr> this works because NAME is in scope when the macro is defined.

[18:31:25] <cceckman> Awesome, thanks. I'm implementing a trait on a struct, but when I try to call one of the trait's methods for another, it's saying the method is not implemented in scope.

[18:32:01] <cmr> please do.
[18:32:10] <cmr> you probably forgot to `use` the trait though.
[18:32:16] <cmr> traits need to be in scope to call the methods they define.

[18:34:50] <cmr> wrong case.
[18:34:55] <cmr> Self and self are, confusingly, different.
[18:35:07] <cmr> `self` is the receiver of the method call, the object that the method is being called on...
[18:35:16] <cmr> `Self` is the *type* that the trait is being implemented for.
[18:35:23] <cceckman> Yes- in the trait, I use the type Self, and in the impl, I use the variable &self

[18:35:32] <cceckman> Correct?

[18:37:00] <cceckman> Aha. I guess I was mis-extrapolating from some of the examples. Seems odd to have the traits have types everywhere except when talking about 'self'

[18:38:13] <cmr> but when you say `&Self` you're making sync an associated function ("static method")

[18:38:29] <cmr> it'd be called like ScreenCanvas::sync(&some_type)
[18:38:50] <cmr> where some_type is a value of a type that implements ScreenCanvas
[18:38:53] <cmr> ... if that makes sense.
[18:39:22] <cceckman> Right right right. So a method is not just a static function whose first parameter is of type &Self- it's more specific.

[20:57:23] <flan3002> I have...
[20:57:42] <flan3002> I just fear it could trigger much more dangerous bugs...
[20:57:52] <eddyb> hmpf
[20:57:57] <flan3002> But what do I have the suite for, huh?
[20:57:59] <felixc> hello, rustics! I'm looking at my first ever changes to rustc, and am wondering what the "typical" compilation workflow is. Running a full "make all" after every change is... very slow. If I just want to try a quick change (i.e. *not* run full test suites etc), is there a faster way?
[20:58:07] <eddyb> flan3002: wait, we might not want to allow this

[21:43:59] <leonvv> kimundi: I'm reading the 'tasks and communication' tutorial, but to me it seems like the only advantage of futures is that they don't block, but can't you achieve the same behavior using ports?
[21:44:11] <Eridius> leonvv: futures use ports internally
[21:44:21] <Eridius> it's just a convenient API around it
[21:44:33] <leonvv> Eridius: ah okay, thanks
[21:44:34] <kimundi> leonvv: futures are a abstraction build around message passing and tasks
[21:44:57] <kmc> a future represents a single value that may or may not be ready yet
[21:46:31] <kmc> port/chan are a communications channel through which any number of messages may be sent

[21:46:58] <mrmonday> I've been messing around with this for ages, so I'm just gonna ask - if I want a function that returns a hashmap of strings to a non-trivial struct which is constructed in a loop, what should its return type be? I've tried a million different combinations of ~, & and nothing and I can't get the lifetimes right to make it compile
[21:47:23] <leonvv> Another question: how much does it cost to set up a task? How much work do you need to do in a different task to compensate for setting it up? The tutorial talks about creating 'hundred of thousands of tasks', but is this realistic?

[21:47:43] <kmc> leonvv: and what do you mean by futures don't block? the point of futures is that get / unwrap / get_ref *do* block, waiting until the value is ready so they can return it

[21:48:28] <kmc> but the computation of that value may have occurred in another thread between when the future was created and when get() was called
[21:48:47] <Eridius> leonvv: if you're using libgreen (which is the default), tasks are relatively lightweight. They still have a full stack, but that's just a virtual memory cost (and a single page of page-backed memory to begin with)

[21:51:09] * kmc finds it frustrating that every new concurrent language needs to invent a new term for threads because "thread" is so tainted
[21:51:47] <Eridius> well, "thread" pretty much means OS-level thread
[21:52:08] <Eridius> using a different term when your thread-like object isn't necessarily an OS-level thread is a good idea

[21:53:30] <kmc> as for something you can run locally, our "rusti" binary is temporarily (?) broken, but you can use https://github.com/tarcieri/irust
[21:53:32] <saml> what's type of  loop {} ?
[21:53:54] <saml> or loop's a statement, not an expression, right?
[21:53:58] <Jemaclus> One problem is that my CSV is 1,000,000 lines long. It actually turns out that the bottleneck is simply reading each line. Is there a way to read, say, 1000 lines, process those, then grab another 1000 lines, that is faster than populating a vector then looping over that vector?
[21:54:16] <huon> saml: no, it's an expression with type `!` ("bottom", aka, does not return)
[21:54:20] <Eridius> rusti: let x = loop { break; }; println!("{:?}", x)
[21:54:22] -rusti- ()

[23:27:40] <wycats> I'm amazed that this sounds like a huge burden (as a maintainer of OSS myself)
[23:27:47] <wycats> it's a nice task for someone new to the project to take on
[23:27:49] <huon> (if we leave it deprecated for say, a month, we'll build up a lot of crap all over the place; e.g. the extra explosion would be so slow)

[23:32:32] <strcat> belongs somewhere that's not the source tree imo
