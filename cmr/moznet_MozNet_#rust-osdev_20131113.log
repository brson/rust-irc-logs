[07:30:41] <eddyb9> I'm close to finishing the damn emulator, but things keep distracting me
[07:30:56] <eddyb9> oh and the fun times of combinatorial expansions
[07:35:27] <eddyb9> at least I have a solid policy of moving the operand with a "smaller" type, or constant value, on the right

[07:42:39] <eddyb9> cmr: the code is generated from ES6
[07:43:11] <eddyb9> I mean, I have a codegen in ES6. where I can iterate over types and operations :P
[07:43:26] <cmr> heh
[07:44:27] <eddyb9> the codegen will be under 100 lines, I think. the resulting runtime could go past 1k
[07:45:38] <eddyb9> and that's without the disasm function. which I should try to optimize, but I'm lazy

[07:55:01] <eddyb9> pcwalton: hi. did you read the logs for #rust, about SLAM/BLAM?
[07:55:13] <pcwalton> eddyb9: oh, I didn't read in detail
[07:56:05] <eddyb9> pcmattman: if you missed it, someone suggested using "BLAM" for my improved version of SLAM, where B comes from my last name
[07:56:29] <eddyb9> (and SLAM stands for something different in the linux kernel)
[07:56:55] <eddyb9> pcwalton: grep for your nick in there, I "highlighted" you a few times
[07:57:02] <pcwalton> eddyb9: ok
[07:57:47] <eddyb9> pcwalton: but now I wanted to ask you a different question... you manually implemented a disassembler in your NES emulator?
[07:58:08] <pcwalton> eddyb9: I did, but it leverages a macro to avoid having to duplicate the logic
[07:58:12] <pcwalton> the instruction decode logic
[07:58:13] <pcwalton> that is
[07:58:44] <eddyb9> for common patterns? I'm not that familiar with NES :P
[08:02:30] <pcwalton> eddyb9: "instruction decode" for NES is just one byte -> instruction + addressing mode
[08:02:35] <pcwalton> but it's a big switch table
[08:02:43] <pcwalton> so I saved that work
[08:02:49] <pcwalton> addressing mode turns into a trait
[08:14:20] <pcmattman> eddyb9: I saw that :) cool!

[08:32:13] <eddyb9> I have a somewhat complete 8051 "disasm" in wiREd, NES could fit by its side
[08:32:35] <eddyb9> (I don't want to restrict myself to 32/64bit architectures)
[08:35:15] <eddyb9> pcwalton: is it a 6502?
[08:35:44] <pcwalton> eddyb9: yup
[08:35:46] <pcwalton> with the BCD mode removed
[08:36:18] <eddyb9> I think sprocketnes would be a nice benchmark. I'm afraid wiREd is bound to be slower, because of its flexibility
[08:40:00] <eddyb9> (you can use symbolic values, even if you're emulating. say, have a symbol for SP and you can detach the stack from accessible memory)

[09:18:49] <eddyb9> pcwalton: the advantage here is that you can "decompile" the entire ROM, and compile AOT
[09:19:58] <eddyb9> well, the ES6 version could leverage JIT for this. but that's past the point where speed is useful
[09:20:23] <eddyb9> especially if the emulated code relies on opcode timings
[09:23:42] <eddyb9> I can't load sprocketnes code from github in the browser on this phone :/
