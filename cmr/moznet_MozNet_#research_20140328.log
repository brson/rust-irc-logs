[10:19:36] <pnkfelix> nmatsakis: morning
[10:20:23] *** Quits: gds (user@moz-18B16713.eduroam.ic.ac.uk) (Quit: ERC Version 5.3 (IRC client for Emacs))
[10:31:12] <nmatsakis> pnkfelix: howdy
[10:31:33] <pnkfelix> nmatsakis: I figured out why I was not getting +operator status
[10:32:02] <pnkfelix> nmatsakis: my rcirc setup was joining all my channels on connect, but I was only authenticating myself after that had happened.
[10:32:29] <nmatsakis> pnkfelix: ah, a classic race condition ;)
[10:32:33] <nmatsakis> well, not quite.
[10:32:49] <pnkfelix> nmatsakis: It is sort of a race, I guess.
[10:33:03] <nmatsakis> just one that you are doomed to lose
[10:33:04] <pnkfelix> nmatsakis: although I think emacs would have just blocked
[10:33:07] <pnkfelix> nmatsakis: exactly
[10:33:14] <pnkfelix> nmatsakis: I was avoiding having rcirc auto-authenticate me because I didn't want to put my password into my publicly stored .emacs file
[10:33:46] <nmatsakis> pnkfelix: yes, this is a surprisingly thorny problem
[10:33:52] <pnkfelix> nmatsakis: But I got frustrated enough this morning to hack in `(let ((emacs-priv (concat (getenv "HOME") "/.emacs_private"))) ...)`
[10:34:04] <nmatsakis> I've been amazed by how many utilities don't seem to have a canned solution 
[10:34:06] <pnkfelix> at the beginning of my .emacs
[10:34:20] <pnkfelix> so that I can put sensitive info that won't be version controlled in there.
[10:34:21] <nmatsakis> (for extracting passwords from a distinct dotfile)
[10:34:25] <nmatsakis> yes
[10:34:31] <pnkfelix> (or at least not publically version controlled)
[10:34:31] <nmatsakis> I do sometihng similar
[10:34:42] <pnkfelix> I suppose I should now put a .git locally for this
[10:34:44] <nmatsakis> in particular my .emacs includes a versioned emacs/dotfile
[10:34:59] <nmatsakis> and then I can throw stuff in .emacs I don't want versioned
[10:35:44] <pnkfelix> nmatsakis: ah.  I usually assume that anything I put into .emacs, I will either soon throw it away, or eventually propagate it to other machines.
[10:35:46] <nmatsakis> (this also allows me to customize per-machine)
[10:35:58] <pnkfelix> yeah I have a different solution for per-machine customization
[10:36:10] <pnkfelix> (as well as per-emacs instance customization)
[10:36:44] <pnkfelix> ((the latter is sadly necessary due to emacs still being single threaded))
[10:37:09] <nmatsakis> interesting
[10:37:21] <pnkfelix> well
[10:37:25] <pnkfelix> that and I tend to abuse emacs
[10:37:28] <pnkfelix> which can cause it to crash
[10:37:28] <nmatsakis> I still consider you the closest thing we have to an emacs guru, I should probably model your setup ;)
[10:37:33] <nmatsakis> until we hire rms
[10:37:39] <pnkfelix> hmm
[10:37:42] <nmatsakis> I want to employ him on a contract basis
[10:37:47] <nmatsakis> to improve emacs rust-mode
[10:37:56] <nmatsakis> ;)
[10:38:02] <pnkfelix> there probably other very-contentious people that would be less contentious.
[10:38:12] <pnkfelix> but I won't name names.  :)
[10:38:12] <nmatsakis> (in case the wink was actually necessary to disambiguate my meaning)
[10:38:25] <nmatsakis> actually rust-mode doesn't suck so bad these days
[10:38:34] <pnkfelix> there is still some stuff wrong with the indentation
[10:38:43] <nmatsakis> I actually haven't updated to the latest round of changes
[10:38:46] <pnkfelix> but it only comes up part of the time for me
[10:38:59] <nmatsakis> (since I haven't been doing much rust)
[10:39:06] <pnkfelix> oh right, rust
[10:39:24] <pnkfelix> nmatsakis: the reason I pinged you is because you had said something about wanting to talk about various code to try to clean up
[10:39:31] <nmatsakis> yes, I do
[10:39:33] <pnkfelix> nmatsakis: but if you want to wait until later (e.g. next week)
[10:39:37] <pnkfelix> nmatsakis: that is okay with me
[10:39:44] <pnkfelix> nmatsakis: I know you've got very serious short term deadlines
[10:40:04] <pnkfelix> nmatsakis: and I have plenty of fun things to occupy me
[10:40:08] <nmatsakis> so can I ping you in 3 or 4 hours?
[10:40:16] <pnkfelix> nmatsakis: sounds fine
[10:40:20] <nmatsakis> I might or might not want to work on it then but if I did would you be around :)
[10:40:29] <nmatsakis> that said, it seems like the intel demo work is...mostly done
[10:40:31] <pnkfelix> nmatsakis: I'll probably be here for the next seven hours or so
[10:40:40] <pnkfelix> nmatsakis: Oh really?  That's great and half-surprising
[10:40:49] <nmatsakis> I'm still waiting for final word from Jas
[10:40:54] <pnkfelix> nmatsakis: but maybe you mean 80% is done
[10:40:58] <nmatsakis> but last I heard, he was seeing linear speedups on deform
[10:41:01] <pnkfelix> nmatsakis: and now all that is left is the other 80%
[10:41:10] <nmatsakis> not yet sure about Tour de Block
[10:41:19] <pnkfelix> nmatsakis: deform ... that's not the image resize benchmark, right?
[10:41:37] * pnkfelix doesn't remember "deform"
[10:41:38] <nmatsakis> no, it's the one from bug 966567
[10:41:47] <nmatsakis> ah image resize, my old nemesis.
[10:42:01] <pnkfelix> oh this one
[10:42:02] <nmatsakis> I mean, there is plenty to do on *PJS*, but intel was talking about trying to demo bug 966567
[10:42:05] <nmatsakis> and tour de block
[10:42:11] <nmatsakis> and both kernels scale well for me locally
[10:42:19] <nmatsakis> I'm waiting to hear verification that they scale well on an actual demo machines :)
[10:42:40] <pnkfelix> ah I had not seen the latest sutff you have done on #966567
[10:43:13] <nmatsakis> the crucial part was bug 983486 -- collecting parallel arenas between iterations
[10:43:24] <nmatsakis> somewhat ironically,
[10:43:37] <nmatsakis> we spent all this effort developing APIs that let people avoid GC overhead and so on,
[10:43:44] <nmatsakis> and the two benchmarks intel put forward
[10:43:46] <nmatsakis> are basically GC stress tests :)
[10:44:03] <pnkfelix> nmatsakis: well
[10:44:10] <pnkfelix> nmatsakis: you wouldn't have been able to return the new result
[10:44:12] <nmatsakis> but actually typed objects proved key to us being able to crack that nut, at least in short term
[10:44:15] <nmatsakis> yes
[10:44:15] <pnkfelix> nmatsakis: without TypedObject
[10:44:36] <pnkfelix> nmatsakis: So its a nice ... symbiosis?
[10:44:49] <nmatsakis> I mean there is no question that this API is much improved, and I think we can make it nicer still
[10:45:08] <nmatsakis> I've been working on updating typed objects to the latest spec,
[10:45:11] <nmatsakis> particularly around arrays,
[10:45:14] <nmatsakis> I have this TOWER of patches right now
[10:45:19] <nmatsakis> up to 16 and counting
[10:45:26] <nmatsakis> all blocked on a short review by waldo ;)
[10:45:55] <nmatsakis> https://bug966575.bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=8392764
[10:46:20] <nmatsakis> note that this bug https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=966575 itself includes 15 patches, but that's not the tower of patches I'm talking about
[10:46:27] <nmatsakis> anyway. refactoring is fun.
[10:46:50] <nmatsakis> this is the danger of implementing specs while they're still being, you know, spec'd
[10:46:57] <nmatsakis> I suppose
[10:47:47] <nmatsakis> but when I see the gap between my branch and the trunk I want to cry. I really should bother waldo post JS work week and see if I can get him to up priority of that patch, it's blocking a lot for me.

[12:14:23] <samth> larsberg: interesting, I haven't ever been kicked
[12:14:53] <samth> And I keep my phone on another floor during the night ;-) 
[12:15:17] <larsberg> samth: it auto-reconnects - you might only notice if your job, say, requires you to live on IRC :-) but it's funny because about 20 people disappear and then reappear on #servo when it happens
[12:15:24] <larsberg> like a party nobody else got invited to :-)
[12:16:18] <samth> larsberg: I probably just attribute that to netsplits
[12:16:53] <samth> larsberg: by the way, I saw your ICFP draft, and it's quite cool
[12:17:14] <larsberg> samth: thanks! I hope it finally makes it this year :-)
[12:17:28] <larsberg> it's hard to sell CFA-based optimizations - the world has largely moved on
[12:18:13] <samth> larsberg: the problem is that the world has moved on from fast compilers for functional languages
[12:18:18] <samth> Except ghc
[12:20:22] <larsberg> samth: true. And GHC gets an awful lot of mileage out of type-directed optimizations, some very good heuristics, and judicious use of inlining and strictness annotations 
[12:21:03] <samth> larsberg: although they had an analysis paper this year at popl
[12:22:39] <larsberg> samth: thanks! I will take a look... simon p-j is generally dismissive of analysis-based optimization techniques due to fragility w.r.t. small program changes, so I'll be interested to see what they did

[12:32:16] <larsberg> samth: found it and just made it through - it's nice work! and now I'm wondering about the higher-order case, naturally...
[12:34:20] <samth> larsberg: I was somewhat frustrated that it didn't say anything about how it would apply in any language that isn't Haskell
[12:43:33] <larsberg> samth: we've certainly found that even putting aside laziness, it can be hard to adopt GHC optimizations without having exactly their let-floater and deforestation rules, as many later optimizations rely on them
[12:43:55] <larsberg> but I can't throw stones because the #1 piece of feedback I've gotten on earlier drafts of the reflow stuff was "how would I do this in GHC? and do I need it?" :-)
[12:49:22] <nmatsakis> samth: I...find ssh'ing into people.mozilla.org and using irssi pretty tolerable.

[12:52:56] * nmatsakis wishes he had time for some papers about anything beyond work -- or even just work itself
[12:53:20] <nmatsakis> larsberg samth : so I wrote up a paper on typed objects for DLS -- but somehow I thought the deadline was mar 25, not june. I guess it's nice that it's done...3 months early.
[12:53:41] <nmatsakis> but it's good actually because I can use that time to catch up the impl with the API, which would make the paper much stronger

[12:55:07] <larsberg> nmatsakis: nice! I've been trying to pull together something like an "experience report" on Servo (possibly for PLDI) because I'd like to get somebody looking at a few more issues I haven't had a chance to look into (e.g., session types / handling our concurrency madness; extending research on task failure to have something that provably leaves the system
[12:55:07] <larsberg> running; etc.)

[13:28:38] <nmatsakis> larsberg: did you guys ever validate that a newer version of rustc addressed the hangs you were seeing?

[13:29:31] <larsberg> nmatsakis: we moved to a late-Feb. build, but honestly we've been pretty crunched getting ACID2 working for the Samsung demo early next week. After we land that work, ms2ger has another Rust update waiting to land and we should be up to mid-March and be able to test it more.

[13:33:00] <larsberg> If it addresses the hangs (which I suspect it does), that would make me a lot happier. But I also think there's room for something in-between the previous model of arbitrary, fully-linked failure and today's model of isolated failure (e.g., some kind of task group).

[13:50:34] <nmatsakis> larsberg: Yes, perhaps. I guess I still have this feeling that, if things are working, you'll have de facto task groups anyway, but if that doesn't pan out, I think we need to readdress. I still feel like we're wrestling a bit with how failure should look, but erlang's "tear it down" fast model remains the only one that seems to make sense to me overall.
