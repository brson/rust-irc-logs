[00:57:37] <Peach> How possible is it to use C without any standard library at all?
[00:58:04] <Peach> or practical I should say
[00:58:35] <Diggsey> well the C standard library is written in C..
[00:58:38] <scott> Pretty easy compared to most languages. (My experience is using it to write a simple OS, not within an existing OS.)
[00:59:12] <scott> And then you can have all the fun of designing your own stdlib with less terribleness... :)
[00:59:25] <scott> And less std...
[01:01:15] <FreeFull> C is usually the standard language for writing operating systems in

[01:03:29] <scott> No, you can never really go ASM-less. You have to interface with the machine at some point.
[01:03:40] <scott> You can do inline ASM, though. (But it isn't standardized.)

[01:43:00] <Peach> Hey
[01:43:04] <Peach> How does threading work
[01:43:17] <Peach> (No that's totally not broad)
[01:43:38] <Astraea> eh?
[01:44:03] <scott> pre-emptive threading where the OS randomly stops a thread and lets another one go (the usual model) works by... basically what I just said
[01:44:37] <scott> The CPU receives interrupts at regular intervals from a timer device and the OS can react to those interrupts and choose to do a thread switch
[01:44:55] <scott> The details of which threads to run when is a big problem in its own right (scheduling)
[01:45:07] <Astraea> actually I lied... more like 7MB per sensor per year on a phone
[01:45:21] <Astraea> average of 10 sensors...
[01:45:29] <Astraea> and I conclude this is a horrible idea
[01:45:42] <whipsch> Astraea: for one user that sounds pretty okay
[01:45:47] <whipsch> imo
[01:45:54] <scott> And of course I left out the details of thread switching, but it basically involves saving the CPU state (registers/flags) and the stack and restoring the state you saved for the thread you want to wake up
[01:45:58] <Astraea> one user?
[01:46:12] <scott> Peach: Did that help?
[01:46:27] <whipsch> Astraea: i assume you want to store data for many users (also s/users/phones), though
[01:47:31] <Astraea> well... it's more like I have a bunch of sensors
[01:47:38] <Astraea> and using a server is verboten

[02:14:38] <Peach> and if I launch a thread, does the thread use its own heap?
[02:14:47] <Tiffany> race conditions are when two threads have different behaviour based on which one runs faster

[02:15:03] <Tiffany> mutex is short for mutual exclusion, and is used to make sure two threads using it never run at the same time
[02:15:21] <Tiffany> a lock is the operation you perform on a mutex to make sure nobody else is using it
[02:16:00] <Tiffany> rust threads can be thought of as having their own heaps, but in reality they all just use jemalloc

[02:33:33] <Peach> (PS: I always google and read multiple topics before I ask here, I just like to gather as much supplementary education as possible :D )
[02:33:42] <eddyb_> but when you do UINT_MAX + 1 you get 0, as it wraps around
[02:33:51] <Peach> Oh that's beautiful
[02:34:16] <eddyb_> u32 wrapping arithmetic is modulo 2³²
[02:34:23] <eddyb_> for example
[02:34:45] <Peach> UINT_MAX*2 would do what? we use that modulo 2^32 to find out ?
[02:34:51] <eddyb_> hmm
[02:34:57] <eddyb_> honestly, I'm not sure :))
[02:35:16] <eddyb_> ah, it's the same as shifting to the left once

[02:55:28] <Mutabah> There's an RFC for it
[02:55:37] <eddyb_> I mean, C can do nasty things
[02:55:44] <Peach> So if I want a fast  safe language that also never panics, I'd have to manually make sure that the programmer checks variables so they don't overflow

[02:57:16] <Mutabah> Peach: ... because most hardware wraps on overflow?
[02:57:17] <eddyb_> Peach: bad CPU architectural design, that's what
[02:57:44] <Mutabah> With good reason, because it makes a lot of other operations easier, and simplifies the hardware

[02:58:12] <XMPPwocky> clamping can be just as bad 
[02:58:22] <eddyb_> XMPPwocky: or worse!
[02:58:54] <ChrisMorgan> Ah, manually unrolling huffman tables is fun… wonder how much faster the end result will be than a HashMap or two?
[02:59:00] <eddyb_> saturating arithmetic will likely not lead to crashes os it can remain undiscovered

[03:00:29] <eddyb_> with the same performance
[03:01:38] <ChrisMorgan> Seriously, they should have just said “if you use huffman coding, you cannot have non-ASCII characters”. That would shrink the table rather a lot.

[03:03:01] <ChrisMorgan> I wonder how many HPACK implementations actually huffman-encode things.
[03:03:14] <Peach> clamping would be much nicer than undefined behavior
[03:04:14] <Peach> Intmax+1 would be intmax
[03:04:17] <eddyb_> you can have wrapping signed arithmetic w/o UB
[03:04:25] <Peach> *really*
[03:04:29] <eddyb_> UB is C's fault, entirely
[03:04:30] <Peach> But not in C/C++
[03:04:32] <Peach> Oh
[03:04:46] <Peach> I thought it was hardware that made it undefined
[03:04:49] <eddyb_> erm
[03:04:52] <eddyb_> that would be nuts
[03:05:13] <eddyb_> I guess there is something to do with overly long shifts that may expose some internal hardware values on some CPUs
[03:05:13] <Peach> I mean "the results vary across hardware"
[03:05:21] <eddyb_> that's not what UB is
[03:05:35] <eddyb_> Peach: that's architecture-dependent behavior or w/e
[03:05:47] <Peach> lol
[03:05:56] <eddyb_> but C makes signed overflow UB *any way*
[03:06:07] <eddyb_> at least IIRC
[03:06:13] <Peach> Ok, so.... how can I make a language using C that has predictable signed overflow?
[03:06:26] <Peach> Is my only option to make a conditional check on every instruction :O
[03:06:29] <eddyb_> no
[03:06:49] <eddyb_> Peach: you can use unsigned arithmetic
[03:07:19] <eddyb_> in C++: i32(u32(a) + u32(b)) compiles to the same thing as a + b (if a and b are both i32)
[03:07:33] <eddyb_> but the compiler won't optimize assuming no overflow
[03:07:56] <eddyb_> multiplication and division are the trickier ones
[03:07:59] <XMPPwocky> whatever happened to removing the manual stack checks and using guard pages instead
[03:08:11] <eddyb_> XMPPwocky: LLVM hasn't merged the patch yet

[03:09:31] <Peach> eddyb: you're a GENIUS
[03:09:34] <XMPPwocky> i should try and revive the "+30% perf on small functions (recursive fibonacci)" trick
[03:10:35] <Peach> So for all add / subtraction operations, I can simply convert to unsigned and back
[03:10:41] <Peach> and it's always defined in C/C++
[03:10:44] <Peach> right eddyb ?
[03:11:09] <eddyb> should be, yeah
[03:11:15] <Peach> YAAAAAAY
[03:11:37] <eddyb> LLVM, for example, doesn't have signed/unsigned types
[03:11:45] <eddyb> so u32 and i32 are the same LLVM i32 type
[03:11:55] <eddyb> the opcodes differ, where necessary
[03:12:11] <XMPPwocky> basically, for a lot of small real-world functions, they take more than one cache line, or are split. what you can do is have the stack check, on failure, jump *to before the function*, where the rest of the stack check failure code is
[03:12:39] <eddyb> C sets a nsw (no signed wrap or something like that) flag while Rust doesn't, for signed arithmetic
[03:13:47] <scott> XMPPwocky: Fancy
[03:14:19] <XMPPwocky> it's just a JUMP SHORT instead of a CALL and a RETN, but it ends up giving some surprising speedups on some classes of functions
[03:14:37] <XMPPwocky> actually, why is the RETN/RETQ even emitted

[03:32:14] <XMPPwocky> DSPs, btw, often have saturating arithmetic for that reason
[03:32:22] <Mutabah> Peach: Probably, it'd be better to force acknowledgement of what operation you want
[03:32:29] <XMPPwocky> even in signal processing it just clips instead of inverting phase

[04:16:03] <Peach> accuracy is important
[04:16:22] <Peach> I should just say "the focus isn't low level bit twidling"
[04:16:30] <Peach> (but you can in the language)
[04:16:39] <Peach> Also, Javascript makes no sense
[04:16:51] <Peach> Someone copy paste this into your browser title bar:
[04:16:52] <Peach> javascript:alert(2+ 40);
[04:21:44] <XMPPwocky> so here's a fun fact. if you have dkim on your domain, and send mail from that domain to a mailing list
[04:21:51] <XMPPwocky> gmail users will get your messages marked as spam
[04:22:19] <XMPPwocky> because the From header doesn't validate with DKim
[04:22:56] <aatch> Peach, ok. How does this relate to 128-bit integers?
[04:24:05] <Peach> Oh I guess it's just a separate question aatch , since people aren't use the language for low level programming or data base storage, I was wondering if it's reasonable to have no 128-bit integer type
[04:24:13] <Peach> (Does Rust have a 128 bit integer type?)
[04:24:43] <Havvy> Peach:  No.
[04:24:45] <aatch> Peach, nope, because no platform that Rust supports has native 128-bit integer support.
[04:25:32] <Peach> Ah ok, I'll just support a simple bigint type and call it a day then :D
[04:25:56] <aatch> Peach, ah, but if you want performance, a bigint is not the way to go.
[04:26:10] <Peach> big int for storage not performance
[04:26:53] <Peach> for my use case anyway
[04:26:57] <Peach> *big int is just for
[04:27:33] <aatch> Peach, oh, so in addition to a regular native integer?
[04:27:40] <Peach> Yep
[04:27:53] <aatch> Ok, that makes more sense.
[04:30:27] <Peach> I want to make a language that's used for scientific experiments related to graphics and user interfaces
[04:30:55] <Peach> a language with a high level media related library that makes it easy to do complex things without additional setup
[04:31:13] <Peach> I want things like siggraph papers to always have a working demo
[04:31:14] <Astraea> fran has already been made tho

[04:31:57] <Peach> It's specifically for implementing things like siggraph papers Astraea - graphics and image processing related things
[04:32:04] <Peach> ^ Astraea 
[04:32:22] <Astraea> I was making a joke
[04:32:46] <Peach> So things like high level OpenGL wrappers, built in geometry processing, all major siggraph related things gathered in one language
[04:34:21] <Peach> And to have no build system - projects would be written in a new language that's like C++ minus the boilerplate syntax and people could just download projects, double click on a main file in the top level of a project folder and the project would run
[04:34:33] <Peach> So no build systems, no difficult setup
[04:35:34] <Mutabah> so... cargo run
[04:35:36] <Peach> You see a paper that you like -> go to the github page -> download the project -> double click the projectname_main.xyz file in the root folder and BAM you see a nice demo with pretty graphics
[04:35:55] <Mutabah> Of course, that requires the correct handler to be installed
[04:36:21] <Quxxy> Imagine if there was a program that would run Rust programs for you... some kind of... "cargo script", perhaps
[04:36:31] <Quxxy> Then you just download a Rust program, double-click *that* and have it run
[04:36:44] <Gankro> Man using browser interface on this Firefox phone is pretty hanky.
[04:36:53] <Gankro>  
[04:37:10] <Peach> The goal is that you can test out people's projects regardless of OS
[04:37:20] <Peach> sort of like how javascript makes it easy to see a demo
[04:37:34] <Peach> I think offline programs should be as easy to run and test
[04:37:49] <Quxxy> What's wrong with Python?
[04:38:11] <Peach> Well you can't use it for performant interactive 3D like siggraph projects often are about
[04:38:33] <XMPPwocky> pypy exists and is arguably good
[04:38:36] <Quxxy> Ok, what's wrong with Java, then?
[04:38:54] <Peach> and Python doesn't have good IDEs and it doesn't have a huge library of open source high level 3d algorithms that are easy to use
[04:39:16] <Quxxy> PyCharm works just fine
[04:39:18] <Peach> Java is tedious and bloated to use as prototyping language, and it doesn't have a huge library of open source high level 3d algorithms that are easy to use
[04:39:33] <Quxxy> But neither does your hypothetical language, *either*
[04:39:44] <Peach> Quxxy: you don't know that
[04:39:46] <Quxxy> So that doesn't really enter into the equation since *someone* is going to have to write them anyway
[04:40:03] <aatch> Also, isn't SIGGRAPH all about *developing* those algorithms?
[04:41:03] <Peach> aatch: there are essential algorithms that those are all built on and currently there is no automatic way to easily interface with OpenGL/GLSL / shaders  etc. you have to build toolkits yourself from scratch

[05:40:20] <aatch> I've definitely written code where it would be useful, but I don't really miss it. It also wouldn't fit in well with Rust's overflow checking (but that's kinda orthogonal).
[05:41:56] <aatch> It's mostly because I tend to use `u32` instead of `usize` to save space when I'm confident that `u32` is plenty big enough.

[06:14:00] <Mutabah> It's a poke at theoretical CS

[06:15:11] <Mutabah> The idea of proving an algorithm, but missing a language quirk, or just a bug in the implementation that makes the proof not apply
[06:21:30] <ChrisMorgan> eddyb: I’ve now benchmarked my HPACK huffman table implementation; it starts at 10× as fast as hpack::huffman and steadily increases as the input size goes up. It’s 15–25× on typical inputs and on the input \x00\x01...\xfe\xff, it’s about 50× as fast. (This is where both are producing Vec<u8>; hpack::huffman does so exclusively, while mine uses iterators). So not quite plural
[06:21:32] <ChrisMorgan> orders of magnitude as you predicted, but close enough, I suppose.

[06:58:48] <Mutabah> (rough figures) - So the airport pretty is pretty close to the main body of the city, becuase it's the only real place it can be, due to the hills blocking it in
[07:02:51] <ChrisMorgan> Melbourne is a remarkably practical arrangement, geographically. Probably the most so of all of Australia’s major cities. It could still expand hundreds of kilometres in any direction except for the bay without impediment.
[07:04:11] <ChrisMorgan> Sydney, by contrast, is split by its bay and constrained by geography so that it can’t conveniently grow any further at all.
[07:09:33] <Peach> can I call software "technology" ?

[07:10:13] <Mutabah> sure
[07:12:21] <niconii> i tend to think of technology more in the conceptual sense, like collective knowledge developed over time to solve problems
[07:14:15] <niconii> i don't think technology is really just physical objects... if you wiped all of our machinery and buildings and stuff off the earth, we'd still be able to rebuild them because our knowledge of those things and how they work still exists
[07:15:08] <niconii> (...which is also kind of a problem i have with post-apocalyptic works where we get sent back to the stone age or middle ages or whatever)
[07:16:49] <Mutabah> niconii: The knowledgebase may be there... but in a equipment wipeout, rebuilding would be hard
[07:16:55] <Mutabah> because the complex tools would be lost
[07:17:21] <niconii> true, it's a matter of bootstrapping back up to those complex tools
[07:17:35] <Mutabah> It is, and having the knowledge to do that bootstrapping
[07:17:41] <niconii> but it'd take a *lot* less time to do that than it did to invent those tools in the first place
[07:17:53] <Mutabah> Quite likely, but it would still take a while
[07:18:00] <niconii> right
[07:18:09] <Mutabah> and requires enough social stability such that people can work on rebuilding that

[13:24:48] <fkaa> eddyb: were you talking about generators in rust a while ago?
[13:24:52] <fkaa> `yield` and such
[13:24:55] <eddyb> yeah
[13:24:58] <eddyb> I have a plan :D
[13:25:01] <fkaa> :)
[13:25:02] <eddyb> it involves the MIR
[13:28:34] <eddyb> fkaa: this gist has a bunch of expansions to generators that allow async/await https://gist.github.com/eddyb/822c658190ccf18058db
[13:29:10] <fkaa> awesome :o
[13:35:39] <fkaa> so, what's everyones taste in music?
[13:35:48] <Elaine> I've been digging Pretty Lights the past few days.
[13:35:56] <wrl> pretty lights is dope
[13:36:07] <wrl> i've been super into the new funkstörung album lately
[13:40:54] <zofrex> right now I'm listening to Korn, but that's not representative
[13:42:05] <zofrex> my taste goes all over, this week I've been mostly listening to 90s throwback rock (blink 182, jimmy eat world, incubus, stuff like that)

[13:58:50] <fkaa> anyone else getting double errors and warnings from everything?

[13:59:19] <fkaa> http://puu.sh/j8AQ5/9406398ba3.png
[13:59:50] <Quxxy> fkaa: I think that's the fault of cargo
[14:00:24] <Quxxy> It does parallel builds under some circumstances, but I'm not sure why it'd be compiling a crate twice simultaneously
[14:04:54] <fkaa> found it https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/851
[14:04:57] <fkaa> weird
[14:09:31] <eddyb> Quxxy: sure it will
[14:09:48] <eddyb> dependency trees can result in even half a dozen copies of a crate being built
[14:09:59] <eddyb> different versions
[14:10:17] <eddyb> fkaa: that looks like a race
[14:10:23] <eddyb> rather than just double errors

[14:23:22] <ChrisMorgan> eddyb: … but thankfully in Rust such things will work together acceptably. I could go mumbling something about a Node project I worked on which had four mutually incompatible versions of a library (something like 0.4, 0.6.X, 0.8.1.1 and 0.8.1.2, and yes, they really did all have important breaking changes with each other) which are both accidentally and intentionally mingled…
[14:23:47] <eddyb> type safety <3
[14:24:10] <fkaa> eddyb: do you have an RFC for generators as well?
[14:24:10] <eddyb> worst thing that could happen is they would each claim control of the same C library
[14:24:27] <eddyb> fkaa: not yet
[14:24:37] <eddyb> I didn't even fully expand my prototype
[14:24:50] <eddyb> it should be desugarable to something that compiles on 1.0
[14:25:01] <eddyb> (by hand, at least)
[14:26:02] <eddyb> right now I'm doxing my future classmates :D
[14:26:25] <Elaine> no you aren't, you're stalking them
[14:26:27] <Elaine> HUGE difference :P
[14:26:36] <Elaine> unless you are doxing, which isn't very nice.
[14:26:44] <eddyb> Elaine: I am looking them up in the bacalaureat results
[14:27:00] <Elaine> doxing is releasing information publically, not just looking stuff up.
[14:27:02] <eddyb> and building a table of their highschool and county
[14:27:13] <eddyb> I will put it in a gist :P

[14:27:45] <eddyb> anyway, I already found someone who was in the same highschool with me

[20:59:30] <Astraea> row-ah-no-k
[20:59:38] <Astraea> I think is a bit more accurate
[20:59:53] <Astraea> or maybe row-uh-no-k
[21:00:01] <Astraea> somewhere around there
[21:00:06] <Astraea> how are you pronouncing it, Sho ?
[21:01:23] <Sho> i think i was more at ro-wan-okhe
[21:01:30] <Sho> -oakeh
[21:01:31] <Sho> dunno
[21:02:18] <Astraea> well I find it pleasing to say anyway, opinions may differ =)

[22:25:20] <Astraea> so is apple just incapable of keeping documentation in the same place or do they like making all links to their documentation become dead after a few months

[22:57:32] <Layl> Apple is incapable of keeping documentation.
[23:14:32] <dfockler> oh yeah their docs are awful
[23:21:28] <c74d> Peach: something like this: <https://bpaste.net/show/3d0c6ef200a6> (was there anything particular you'd want in such an example snippet?)

[23:52:49] <c74d> Naturally, the more noteworthy things (some form of dependent typing; pattern matching/parser DSL) would, I expect, be the most difficult to implement, and the last to be finalized.
[23:54:05] <c74d> (Not that everything in there is at all final either. Particularly, the enum-class thing is an awfully verbose extension of Haskell `data`, and I hope to slim it down at some point.)
[23:56:01] <c74d> I think I got the name enum-class from confusing Scala case-class (which it resembles) with C++ enum-class (which it doesn't).
