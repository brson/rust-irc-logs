[08:25:08] <eddyb> yay another idea of mine shows up in the wild. and I didn't even get to build a regular 3D printer http://markforged.com/
[09:16:36] <eddyb> cmr: gotta love radio waves
[09:17:34] <eddyb> there's one spot in the hallway where I get full 2G signal strength
[09:17:55] <eddyb> move half a meter, drops so much I can actually miss calls :(
[09:18:13] <eddyb> aaaand for some reason orange doesn't send SMS notifications when that happens. lovely
[09:20:36] <Seldaek> eddyb: I get notifications but it's still enraging to know a call didn't come through while the sms can
[09:21:06] <Seldaek> orange too for that matter.. though it got better last couple years, in which country do you suffer them?
[09:21:06] <eddyb> haha yeah, that actually happened to me, the guy sent me an SMS because he thought I closed my phone
[09:21:14] <eddyb> Romania
[09:21:39] <Seldaek> eh ok, didn't know  they expanded that far
[09:22:35] <Seldaek> but they are so cheap it's hard to justify paying for the other companies, even when the network sucks at times
[09:22:40] <eddyb> I have other choices, but orange was convenient because I had like a thousand minutes (to talk to my then-gf) and almost a GB of 3G internet, all for 5€
[09:23:41] <Seldaek> meh I pay what must be 16-17eur for 1gb & unlimited sms, no minutes 
[09:24:04] <eddyb> but she left me and I don't need 3G internet anymore (not to mention that my N900 has been shelved ever since the USB port broke)
[09:24:15] <eddyb> Seldaek: sheesh, cheaper here. though it may be exclusive to students
[09:25:32] <Seldaek> and yet this is dirt cheap what I pay.. swisscom would probably be 3 times the price for the same.

[09:26:04] <eddyb> for 20€ (or was it 40€?) there's LTE here
[09:26:07] <Seldaek> but that's just different markets/cost of life shit

[12:10:44] <eddyb_r> so... I guess I'm fine :D
[12:12:47] <eddyb_r> huon: I have this hack that I use
[12:13:03] <eddyb_r> freenode webchat with safe authentication
[12:13:32] <eddyb_r> then ghosting the IRC client at home
[12:13:40] <eddyb_r> when it reconnects I get to see the IP

[12:18:13] <eddyb_r> no programs to install
[12:18:59] <eddyb_r> ahh, but it's not irssi so I can't use the console. I can probably tunnel VNC but... lol
[12:25:48] <eddyb_r> oh, oh, and he said he's giving me a rasPI to play with

[18:45:15] <eddyb> cmr: haha http://www.gizmag.com/microengine-combustion/31261/
[18:48:09] <cmr> science!
[18:50:34] <eddyb> now if that research was opensourced and anyone could 3D print the prototype...
[18:50:55] <eddyb> you'd get comments figuring all the details out
[18:50:56] <cmr> 3d printers aren't anywhere near that precision
[18:51:04] <eddyb> yeah, I know, speculation
[18:51:08] <cmr> certainly not ones at costs reachable by mere mortals.
[18:51:44] <Havvy> The new 100 x 100 x 5 micrometer micro-engine is made of layers of polymer membrane 530 micrometers thick.
[18:51:53] <Havvy> Those numbers don't add up...
[18:52:12] <eddyb> but, imagine, during the course of hours, hundreds of people coming up with theories, testing them, and reaching the result
[18:52:19] <eddyb> not unlike some reddit threads
[18:52:37] <eddyb> cmr: then again, I dream too much :(
[18:53:30] <Havvy> In any case, this looks like another accidental discovery that will pay off big
[18:54:40] <eddyb> maybe before we play with nanobots we should have microbots
[18:54:47] <eddyb> roboplankton?
[18:56:19] <Havvy> roboplankton sounds like death of the oceans.
[18:56:46] <eddyb> only if it reproduces itself in mass numbers
[18:57:48] <eddyb> but storing energy as oxygen + hydrogen bubbles and burning that sounds... decent
[18:57:52] <eddyb> nothing too exciting though
[18:58:01] * eddyb loses interest
[18:59:10] <tiffany> havvy: missing decimal point?
[19:00:57] <eddyb> "These types of muscles are called asynchronous muscles" from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bumblebee#Flight
[19:01:01] <eddyb> i.e. not supported by Rust
[19:02:14] <cmr> lol
[19:02:34] <Havvy> tiffany:  That could explain it.
[19:06:04] <tiffany> eddyb: ad-hoc experimentation conducted by uninformed people has a lot of room for disaster
[19:06:26] <tiffany> the misrepresentation of research in the media is bad enough as it is
