[00:53:09] <pcwalton> uhhhh
[00:53:14] <pcwalton> we are dumping layout trees always
[00:53:17] <pcwalton> even if we don't have debug on
[00:53:22] <pcwalton> which is like 80% of reflow time

[00:57:15] <jack> sad face. i lost all my tabs.
[01:00:31] <jdm> hasn't that always been the case?
[01:00:42] <jdm> those debug!() things with the long list of statements as the argument?
[01:00:59] <jack> they used to only execute if hte debug! triggered
[01:01:01] <jack> maybe that changed.
[01:01:45] <jack> Why doesn't Firefox have "Here are the tabs you had hte chance to restore"
[01:01:56] <jack> Why is nightly using the same data as Beta?
[01:02:07] * jack mourns the loss of his tabs
[01:03:53] <pcwalton> we are about 34x slower than Gecko just on constraint solving
[01:03:59] <pcwalton> too many virtual calls
[01:04:13] <jack> Seems like that is fixable.
[01:04:30] <pcwalton> yeah, I'll be working on it for the next few days
[01:04:33] <pcwalton> the traversals are not good
[01:04:58] <jack> tjc: were you able to reproduce hte errors I saw. I still can't figure out how to get debugging for rustpkg.
[01:05:14] <tjc> jack: I haven't yet, I've been working on something else, but...

[01:06:02] <jack> maybe i need to blow away my entire build dir.
[01:06:08] <tjc> yes, entirely possible
[01:06:14] <tjc> well, you can get away with just blowing away the Rust libraries
[01:06:18] <tjc> you don't want to have to rebuild LLVM :-)
[01:06:45] <jack> I did that before.
[01:06:59] <jack> I even rebuilt LLVM
[01:07:01] <tjc> hmm
[01:07:11] <tjc> did you check the date on the rustpkg library?
[01:07:29] <jack> i ran make with VERBOSE=1 and watched the rustc lines.
[01:07:32] <jack> --cfg debug is not there.
[01:07:47] <tjc> can you paste one of the rustc lines?
[01:07:50] <jack> configure happily tells me that i successfully set CFG_ENABLE_DEBUG=1
[01:08:16] <jack> I'll do that in a second. My computer crashed so I am at a disadvantage at hte moment.
[01:08:57] <tjc> ok, no rush

[02:39:01] <pcwalton> sure
[02:39:30] <pcwalton> jack: there is no real reason constraint solving should be slow in servo, if anything we may be able to make it faster by devirtualizing the fast paths

[02:39:50] <pcwalton> I'm going to hammer on it

[02:54:42] <jdm> oh noooooooooooo
[02:54:47] <jdm> I found the logic error, I think
[02:55:03] <jdm> we have this port on which to wait for the layout task to signal that it's done
[02:55:17] <jdm> and we also send a message on the regular script task channel that indicates that reflow is complete
[02:55:23] <jdm> and we don't synchronize between the two
[02:55:51] <jdm> so if you call join_layout then initate a new reflow, the subsequent completion message (for the previous reflow) makes us think the new one is complete
[02:56:14] <jack> i put debuggin in the rust makefile
[02:56:17] <jack> cfg: enabling more debugging (CFG_ENABLE_DEBUG)
[02:56:17] <jack> cfg: CFG_RUSTC_FLAGS=
[02:56:17] <jack>  
[02:56:31] <jack> that is an echo right after the line that stes CFG_RUSTC_FLAGS
[02:56:44] <jack> so basically if it's already set, make ignores the whole thing?
[02:56:55] <jdm> jack: how's it being set?

[03:45:41] <jack> did ms2ger's patches already land?
[03:45:47] <jack> why are those in there
[03:46:01] <pcwalton> jack: it seems like you spend so much time on the build system
[03:46:08] <pcwalton> I sympathize :)
[03:46:16] <jdm> jack: those are in there because I wouldn't land them without a test
[03:46:23] <jdm> and good thing I did, because they didn't work at all :)
[03:46:44] <jdm> the test I added reliably triggered our dom/layout races

[23:59:35] <pcwalton> on it
[23:59:50] <lbergstrom> thanks
