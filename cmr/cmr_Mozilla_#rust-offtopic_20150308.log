[00:45:45] <WindowsBunny> if it takes more than a minute to do the math you're doing it wrong
[00:45:46] <scott> that's the thing, the tip4commit email doesn't even show the conversion to a reasonable currency
[00:46:36] <Tobba> eddyb: I wouldn't say it is, considering they just seem to claim any unspent tips
[00:46:51] <Tobba> I don't think this even covers the cost of the power required to send the email

[04:11:58] <scott> I also just realized the purpose of concepts is very analogous to the purpose of adding optional static typing to dynamic languages
[04:13:38] <scott> with concepts you can move errors from template expansion time to template definition and use time, just like optional static typing lets you move runtime errors to compile time
[04:14:13] <scott> in both cases it turns into an effort to make your duck typing explicit rather than implicit, whether your duck typing is at runtime (like Ruby) or compile time (like C++ templates)

[06:21:21] <bruda> Seems like there's not much need for anything besides vim. Not even a graphical desktop.
[06:21:23] <adu> but I still make mistakes because I can never remember what mode I'm in
[06:21:50] <adu> you don't know how many times I've pasted something in vim, and it starts showing up after the i
[06:21:50] <bruda> Yea it gets me sometimes too but I have vim setup pretty well. It shows the mode, has the colors, etc.
[06:21:54] <FreeFull> adu: You should always put yourself into normal mode by hitting esc
[06:21:59] <Astrum|Lap> adu: hit escape a few times and you'll usually be fine... usually
[06:22:11] <scott> when you get good at vim, there's basically nothing to remember. you're always in normal mode unless you are actively inserting or selecting
[06:22:13] <adu> FreeFull: I know in theory how vim works, but I don't like the modes
[06:22:16] <FreeFull> And for pasting, use   "*p or "+p
[06:22:23] <Astrum|Lap> some people rebind caps lock as escape
[06:22:28] <Astrum|Lap> makes it easier
[06:22:32] <scott> I do that
[06:22:34] <adu> I like emacs because there's only 1 mode
[06:23:00] <Astrum|Lap> adu: that's a shame because I've been thinking heavily about making a modal editor for a while now =D
[06:23:04] <Astrum|Lap> specifically for rust
[06:23:05] <FreeFull> adu: Do you have caps lock rebound as ctrl then?
[06:23:17] <adu> scott: which one is the normal mode?
[06:23:35] <FreeFull> adu: The non-insert one that takes commands
[06:23:40] <scott> adu: the one when every key you type is interpreted as a command
[06:23:50] <adu> FreeFull: no
[06:23:51] <Sergio> Astrum|Lap: Why not write a vim plugin?
[06:23:53] <scott> the real value of vim is the normal mode command language, because it's composable
[06:24:10] <Astrum|Lap> Sergio: it'll be very, very, very different from vim
[06:24:12] <FreeFull> I need to learn to use visual select mode when it's actually convenient
[06:24:23] <scott> you learn 5 'verbs' and 5 'text objects/motions' and you know 25 commands suddenly
[06:24:23] <Astrum|Lap> the only real similarity would be they're both modal editors
[06:24:47] <scott> FreeFull: I find I never use `v`, always `V` (line-wise selection)
[06:25:07] <FreeFull> scott: I just tend to never use anything whatsoever
[06:25:09] <adu> scott: I know 'i' and 'wq'
[06:25:14] <Sergio> The only mode I don't really use ia 'replace'.
[06:25:19] <FreeFull> Having line numbers on the left helps
[06:25:29] <scott> Sergio: I like coming up with scenarios where replace mode is useful :P
[06:25:33] <Sergio> adu: 'wq' won't work in normal mode.
[06:25:45] <FreeFull> :wq, not wq
[06:25:51] <adu> Sergio: what do you mean, I use it all the time
[06:25:57] <Sergio> adu: FreeFull ^
[06:25:59] <Astrum|Lap> :set nu
[06:25:59] <FreeFull> If you don't want to enter : mode, ZZ
[06:26:00] <adu> isn't that normal mode?
[06:26:04] <bruda> I've basically got some different delete methods down and some general navigation. But the more I learn the more hooked I am.
[06:26:04] <scott> adu: vim doesn't really become better than other editors until you learn more of the basic normal mode commands
[06:26:20] <Sergio> adu: That would be command mode.
[06:26:21] <scott> it actually took me a few separate passes of trying out vim before I really stuck with it
[06:26:26] <FreeFull> And ZQ is :q!
[06:26:41] <adu> scott: like what? rectangle-delete? auto-comment?
[06:26:51] <FreeFull> You save yourself from hitting enter
[06:26:54] <Astrum|Lap> it's difficult to get into vim because it's pretty unique
[06:27:04] <Sergio> FreeFull: I use ZZ
[06:27:07] <bruda> vi is older than disco ain't it? lol
[06:27:08] <Sergio> Oh, you said that allready.
[06:27:09] <Sergio> already*
[06:27:10] <Astrum|Lap> it's by far the biggest modal editor, and practically speaking the only one
[06:27:18] <Astrum|Lap> Bruda: long lineage
[06:27:25] <bruda> Astrum|Lap: very long
[06:27:28] <Astrum|Lap> currently we have vim, before that vi, before that... ex? then ed
[06:27:29] <FreeFull> Sergio: I tend to forget about it
[06:27:31] <adu> you're not going to convince me, I don't want to learn vim
[06:27:32] <scott> adu: no, really basic stuff like `w` to skip to the start of a word, `da(` to delete a (foo, bar), `da"` to delete a string literal, `f,` to jump the nearest comma, etc, etc
[06:27:34] <FreeFull> Even though I know that it exists
[06:27:43] <Sergio> It saves me quite a bit of time.
[06:27:48] <Sergio> In aggregate, of course.
[06:27:56] <FreeFull> Do you use more advanced ex commands, sometimes?
[06:28:08] <Sergio> Sometimes.
[06:28:23] <Sergio> Very rarely do I enter ex mode.
[06:28:26] <FreeFull> Fun fact: inside vim and vi, there is another editor, called ex
[06:28:31] <Sergio> I usually do it by accident.
[06:28:31] <Astrum|Lap> I really would like to work on my editor =/
[06:28:49] <FreeFull> Sergio: ex is really useful if the terminal is borked or such
[06:28:56] <FreeFull> Or if you're just feeling like it
[06:29:01] <Sergio> Yeah
[06:29:17] <FreeFull> Astrum|Lap: Why don't you?
[06:29:24] <Astrum|Lap> I've been slammed with work
[06:29:26] <Sergio> If there's something I'll be doing in ex mode often, I just write it into my vim config and nmap it.

[06:29:37] <Sergio> 7 days a week!

[06:29:41] <FreeFull> Ouch
[06:29:51] <Astrum|Lap> lol Sergio 
[06:29:58] <Sergio> I joke, but actually, that sounds rough.
[06:30:01] <Sergio> Is this a job?
[06:30:04] <Astrum|Lap> yeah, it's been like this for two months now
[06:30:10] <Sergio> Like, a full-time go-into-the-office kind?

[06:30:42] <Astrum|Lap> no where you've heard of

[06:31:18] <Astrum|Lap> it's an engineering firm with a relatively large manufacturing staff, but only 5 salaried employees

[06:31:32] <FreeFull> Astrum|Lap: Why do you tolerate this?
[06:31:59] <Astrum|Lap> no one else will hire me and I'm inexplicably addicted to food
[06:32:16] <adu> what I am interested in is what is the appeal of vim?
[06:32:16] <Astrum|Lap> I've tried to quit but the doctor yells at me, something about malnutrition =P
[06:32:42] <FreeFull> adu: It's great at editing text =P
[06:32:46] <bruda> zsh + vim + gpm + irssi
[06:32:54] <bruda> = win
[06:32:55] <bruda> :P
[06:32:57] <Astrum|Lap> adu: it's an interesting editor in both an historical and technical aspect
[06:33:02] <scott> adu: I already tried to describe it above: "the real value of vim is the normal mode command language, because it's composable" and "you learn 5 'verbs' and 5 'text objects/motions' and you know 25 commands suddenly"
[06:33:23] <Astrum|Lap> also what scott said
[06:33:26] <scott> it has a really concise command language that literally multiplies your learning
[06:33:31] <Sergio> It's just really great.
[06:33:44] <adu> composable and historical
[06:33:47] <Sergio> I'm excited for neovim.

[06:35:22] <Mutabah> *sigh* fucking hell, just had a use-after-move bug with C++
[06:35:24] <Sergio> Simply for the sake of there being one?
[06:35:37] <Sergio> Mutabah: Valgrind.
[06:35:47] <Astrum|Lap> vim has a lot of baggage and neovim isn't going to fix that
[06:35:48] <scott> can valgrind catch use after move?
[06:35:56] <Astrum|Lap> let's be honest, how well does it work on windows
[06:36:09] <FreeFull> It works alright
[06:36:12] <scott> I guess in some cases, like a moved-from string or vector would have its buffer deallocated
[06:36:12] <Sergio> Astrum|Lap: Frankly, I don't care about Windows.
[06:36:20] <bruda> baggage? vim?
[06:36:21] <FreeFull> Mutabah: Ouch
[06:36:23] <bruda> :P
[06:36:23] <Sergio> I haven't used Windows in many years.
[06:36:25] <Astrum|Lap> some people do though, Sergio 
[06:36:30] <Sergio> Developers? Rarely.
[06:36:47] <Sergio> A developer on Windows is usually developing WIndows apps, which Visual Studio is very good for.
[06:37:03] <Astrum|Lap> I'd still pick vim over visual studio
[06:37:10] <Astrum|Lap> if it was decent anyway
[06:37:14] <bruda> I only kept windows around for games. But it remained dormant forever thanks to Steam.
[06:37:24] <Astrum|Lap> second point, who iterates on the concept of a modal editor?
[06:37:28] <Astrum|Lap> vim is incredibly stable
[06:37:31] <Sergio> Astrum|Lap: neovim?
[06:37:34] <scott> Astrum|Lap: "vim has a lot of baggage and neovim isn't going to fix that" <- I'm curious why you think this. isn't removing baggage one of neovim's main goals?
[06:37:40] <Sergio> scott: It is.
[06:37:47] <Astrum|Lap> there are tons of non-modal text editors with different features, bells, and whistles
[06:37:54] <bruda> if you want to drop baggage, skip vim and go right for vi :P
[06:38:04] <Sergio> Astrum|Lap: There are, but most of them do not have wide adoption.
[06:38:22] <scott> and "who iterates on the concept"? vim itself, for one, was an iteration of vi
[06:38:22] <Sergio> I really only know of Eclipse/Netbeans, Sublime, and Atom.
[06:38:25] <Sergio> (And VS)
[06:38:36] <scott> vim isn't the golden pinnacle or anything
[06:38:39] <Astrum|Lap> scott: they're removing code baggage, not historical baggage
[06:38:41] <bruda> Atom is nice. But slow as hell.
[06:38:50] <Sergio> bruda: I wouldn't know.
[06:38:54] <scott> Astrum|Lap: they're breaking compatibility, too, where it makes sense
[06:38:55] <Sergio> Textmate used to be big on Mac.
[06:39:00] <bruda> bulky too with it depending on Node.js.
[06:39:02] <scott> pretty sure they already ditched ex mode iirc
[06:39:08] <Sergio> bruda: They're using Io.js now.
[06:39:12] <Astrum|Lap> they ditched ex mode?
[06:39:14] <Astrum|Lap> huh...
[06:39:20] <bruda> Sergio: oh they switched? nice. I hope it works out.
[06:39:32] <scott> to be clear, ex mode doesn't refer to :colon commands in general
[06:39:37] <Mutabah> Sergio: Valgrind wouldn't help - It was a std::string which zeroes after move
[06:39:38] <bruda> in Arch it still pulls in Node.js for me.
[06:40:00] <Astrum|Lap> anyway, imagine if we only had visual studio
[06:40:22] <bruda> visual studio is nice. I used to use it for vb6 in college about 15 years ago.
[06:40:33] <Astrum|Lap> what if there were no other IDEs
[06:40:37] <Astrum|Lap> would it be good today
[06:40:38] <bruda> I'd cry
[06:40:40] <Astrum|Lap> or barely tolerable
[06:40:52] <Astrum|Lap> as much as I love vim, it needs competition
[06:41:00] <bruda> Because vs doesn't support Linux and I'd have no IDE
[06:41:08] <Sergio> Astrum|Lap: Well, there's Emacs.
[06:41:17] <Astrum|Lap> modal editor competition I should say
[06:41:20] <FreeFull> I know someone who runs vs in wine
[06:41:20] <Astrum|Lap> emacs is a whole other beast
[06:41:25] <scott> evil-mode? :)
[06:41:36] <Astrum|Lap> that's just copying =P
[06:41:51] <scott> emacs with evil-mode basically provides everything I like about vim, except for a few minor differences that turned me off initially
[06:42:05] <bruda> now I keep wondering what emacs is like.

[06:42:18] <Sergio> Of course!

[06:42:29] <bruda> Yea I got the vim one.
[06:42:35] <Sergio> bruda: Emacs is the software you use if you want to make your fingers do funny things.
[06:42:50] <scott> that's why you get evil-mode
[06:43:00] <FreeFull> Sergio: The problem is emacs was designed for different keyboards from what we have today
[06:43:06] <bruda> vim makes my fingers do natural feeling things.
[06:43:09] <FreeFull> Remapping caps-lock as ctrl helps
[06:43:34] <Astrum|Lap> FreeFull: pretty sure vi had slightly different keyboards as well
[06:43:39] <FreeFull> vim doesn't make use of much chording
[06:43:43] <Astrum|Lap> but if I remember correctly emacs had a crazy number of modifier keys
[06:43:48] <scott> I used to have caps lock as control when I used emacs (without evil-mode)

[06:44:41] <Sergio> org-mode is awesome, from what I've heard.
[06:44:45] <scott> if it wasn't for neovim I'd be considering switching to emacs+evil-mode more seriously
[06:44:58] <bruda> if shortcuts cause pain, I'll stick with vim :P

[06:45:49] <bruda> yea vi is pretty snappy

[06:46:03] <FreeFull> Sergio: Not vi, vim

[06:58:08] <scott> I only switched from Arch to Ubuntu a few months ago after years of Arch
[06:58:12] <scott> Arch is still on my laptop, too
[06:58:31] <bruda> I use arch on my server, my gaming rig, and my little Aspire One.
[06:59:02] <FreeFull> I can't imagine myself using *buntu again
[06:59:17] <bruda> Ubuntu or Mint is what I usually recommend to new users.
[06:59:36] <scott> FreeFull: that's how I used to feel... and I'm not sure I even know why that feeling changed
[06:59:39] <FreeFull> Once octopi builds, I'll have to update or remove a lot of the packages I've installed from the AUR =P
[06:59:44] <bruda> Then the dirty ones come to me and discover Arch.
[07:00:32] <bruda> I haven't looked at octopi lately but I think you'll have to switch it to search AUR.
[07:00:46] <scott> I guess I haven't been experimenting lately. I used to try lots of different WMs and DEs and all sorts of other things
[07:00:56] <bruda> and you'll see the updates thing at the bottom of the window when there's packages from AUR with updates.

[07:01:30] <bruda> I completely wiped my Arch install on my rig today. Built a system from scratch to play with console based setups, etc.
[07:01:59] <bruda> mouse support in a tty with irssi, vim, tmux, etc is kinda interesting.
[07:02:17] <bruda> elinks for browser
[07:02:27] <scott> you know you could replace that all with emacs ;)
[07:02:34] *** Joins: johnsoft (johnsoft@moz-69mrig.res.rr.com)
[07:02:43] <bruda> emacs does irc and web browsing too?
[07:02:54] <scott> ERC, evil-mode, emacs for windowing, and whatever emacs' web browser is named
[07:02:58] <scott> emacs has you covered
[07:03:09] <bruda> interesting.
[07:03:20] <FreeFull> I don't have mouse support in vim turned on
[07:03:44] <bruda> I just copied the default vimrc from the /user/share/vim/vim74 folder into my user dir.
[07:03:54] <bruda> save it as ~/.vimrc
[07:04:03] <bruda> that enables all the good stuff for vim.
[07:04:09] <bruda> in Arch that is.
[07:04:09] <FreeFull> I wish elinks had support for images, like links2 and w3m do
[07:04:16] <scott> the key to my finally getting into vim permanently was not adding a single line to my vimrc I didn't understand
[07:04:21] <FreeFull> And better javascript support
[07:04:29] <scott> and not jumping into plugins until I really needed a certain thing
[07:04:37] <bruda> scott: read the example config. It should be pretty straight forward.

[07:07:25] <scott> aren't they sort of going that route with the developer version of firefox or whatever that was?
[07:07:38] <bruda> thats for web development, or so I thought.
[07:07:58] <scott> right
[07:08:20] <scott> that's the kind of IDE I'd expect from Mozilaa
[07:08:23] <scott> Mozilla*

[07:08:59] <bruda> Well. Mozilla is backin the rust project too right? Rust could probably use a formal IDE too right?
[07:09:25] <bruda> Something built from the ground up with rust in mind.
[07:09:45] <scott> perhaps
[07:10:06] <scott> IDE tools, at the very least, to be used in existing IDEs
[07:10:30] <bruda> they at least provided syntax files for a few popular editors.
[07:10:45] <bruda> And Atom has basic support for rust if you add its packages.
[07:10:50] <scott> hopefully rustc ends up working like clang with libclang
[07:11:02] <scott> I have a plugin that gives me C++ semantic completion in vim using libclang
[07:11:10] <bruda> I haven't done a lot of C. But I heard clang was good.
[07:11:38] <bruda> I'm basically coming from Go myself right now. Though I have a history of all sorts of various languages.
[07:11:52] <scott> the guy that made said plugin is active on the rust issue tracker, so maybe he'll do it again for rust :)
[07:11:56] <bruda> pretty much everything but C/C++/java.
[07:12:19] <FreeFull> I haven't tried racer yet
[07:12:22] <FreeFull> I should at some point
[07:12:38] <scott> ah yeah, I forgot that existed
[07:12:42] <bruda> racer is in Atom. Though I'm not sure if I actually seen it in action.

[08:21:46] <scott> prvalue is 'pure rvalue' which is probably what you think of when you think of rvalue (has no 'permanent storage' or whatever - I forget the details)
[08:22:29] <scott> xvalue is an 'eXpiring lvalue', which is like something you casted to && with std::move or an lvalue returned from a function but not assigned to anything

[14:03:49] <Tobba> so it wouldn't be a problem with LED

[14:04:12] <eddyb> FreeFull: that's what I heard, too
[14:04:29] <eddyb> but I was wondering if it's not as bad as backlights
[14:04:52] <FreeFull> I think the different colours wear out at different rates too
[14:05:27] <FreeFull> And the subpixels have interesting shapes, sizes and layouts
