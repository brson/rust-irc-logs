[02:50:21] <c74d> adu: it's too Universal a serial bus for my taste -- one risk is that a device connected via USB could pretend to the other device to be a HID, and enter malicious commands.

[09:37:03] <Yurume> yay
[09:37:14] <Yurume> I've fixed kcov
[09:37:17] <huon> Yurume: nice!
[09:37:31] <Yurume> kcov was broken due to its lack of PIE support
[09:37:53] <Yurume> I tried a bit and finally fixed kcov to add that
[09:38:53] <Yurume> hmm, it still has some issue with the debuginfo
[09:39:35] <Yurume> but at least, it now supports PIE
[09:52:22] <eddyb> http://www.realfarmacy.com/happens-decide-create-food-security/ the agenda of that site aside... nice garden :d

[10:13:45] <eddyb> great, I've got graydon answer to a reddit comment of mine
[10:14:02] <Yurume> oh?
[10:14:07] <eddyb> I'm afraid to read that
[10:14:18] <eddyb> it's likely going to point out how I was 120% wrong
[10:14:29] <Yurume> ah, https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/2x2pon/what_significant_languageruntime_features_were/cpej667?context=3 this.
[10:15:16] <eddyb> actually, it's just some history
[10:15:23] <eddyb> hmm
[10:16:04] <eddyb> I guess timelines confuse me

[19:07:12] <Astrum|Lap> eh, I'll take random coincidence where I can take it
[19:09:45] <Yurume> how about 2015-03-14.15926535... (approx. 2015-03-14 03:49:20.527...)
[19:09:57] <tiffany> heh
[19:11:20] <Ketsuban> Every day is actually tau day because it's exactly one orbit around the Sun from itself.

[20:00:22] <Tobba> for some reason I feel like writing a coreboot replacement in rust
[20:00:24] <Tobba> this is a terrible idea.
[20:01:19] <Tobba> though people love to point out how it's like 1M lines of code, most of it is absolutely terrible C code which has been copy n pasted all over

[20:02:55] <Tobba> actually tbh the code in itself isn't that bad, but the duplication is asinine
[20:02:59] <eddyb_> Astrum|Lap: uhm...
[20:03:15] <eddyb_> Astrum|Lap: I think tau would actually be waay more suited for a wedding
[20:03:21] <eddyb_> I guess it depends on the climate
[20:03:42] <eddyb_> it might still snow here in the next few weeks
[20:04:35] <Tobba> actually I take that back, coreboot has some pretty bad code

[20:19:47] <tiffany> why is that tobba?
[20:19:54] <Tobba> I have no idea
[20:19:59] <Astrum|Lap> well the weather is pretty variable here, but currently it's 68F/20C
[20:20:03] <eddyb> tiffany: ^C^V
[20:20:07] <tiffany> fotr had about 30K duplicated lines out of 200K total
[20:20:08] <Astrum|Lap> so... nice wedding weather
[20:20:09] <Tobba> you have some things like fsp_sandybridge, which is just a stripped down version of "sandybridge"
[20:20:21] <eddyb> Tobba: #[cfg]
[20:21:04] <Astrum|Lap> only down side is they'd have to wait until 2031 for a more proper tau day
[20:22:44] <eddyb> Astrum|Lap: how so?
[20:23:02] <Tobba> I'm not sure but I'm using simian
[20:23:07] <Tobba> I think this number may be a bit inflated
[20:23:10] <Astrum|Lap> pi day is (was) good this year because of how we strange americans write dates

[20:29:55] <fmtq> no
[20:29:57] <fmtq> the thought never counts.
[20:30:04] <fmtq> it is -NaN

[20:30:33] <Tobba> oh, huh

[23:16:58] <Dr-Emann> Hey, I can't count to 24 factorial either. 
[23:18:28] <reem> I just switched back to chrome and I forgot what it was like for Activity Monitor to just be constantly spammed with Google Chrome Helper processes
[23:18:33] <reem> :/
[23:21:02] <Tobba> reem: you are now experiencing the magic of "but we use shared memory!" * about 50MB of it
[23:21:20] <Tobba> it's pretty bad on windows
[23:23:51] <reem> It's fast and doesn't leak gigabytes of memory like safari (a hilarious bug causes OS X safari to leak unbounded amounts of memory if you keep tabs open for a long time), so I guess I can't complain too much.
[23:24:16] <reem> I've had safari use 80 GB of virtual memory before
[23:25:05] <Tobba> chrome used to leak a gigabyte per day or so
[23:25:10] <Tobba> it was pretty nasty, but they got most of that fixed
[23:42:28] <eddyb> http://www.zoso.ro/gand-seara/
[23:42:40] <eddyb> okay, the machines breeding humans thing is *slightly* scary

[23:52:49] <Tobba> eddyb: hah
[23:53:05] <Tobba> the funny thing is also that most dating sites tested and realized the algorithm doesn't matter anyways
[23:53:10] <Tobba> or doesn't seem to
[23:53:55] <Tobba> iirc they tried just making it output gibberish with interesting changes in the results
[23:54:37] <Astrum|Lap> ugh, I hate libraries with unintelligible identifiers
[23:56:22] <Astrum|Lap> I swear this identifier is just random words concatenated together
[23:56:45] <FreeFull> It's funny to think that Chrome used to be good with memory and Firefox used to be horrible
[23:56:57] <FreeFull> It all turned around
