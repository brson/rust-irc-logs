[08:07:56] <shinglyu> Hi
[08:08:00] <Manishearth> o/
[08:08:08] <shinglyu> I am reading this article: https://blog.mozilla.org/research/2014/08/26/javascript-servos-only-garbage-collector/
[08:08:27] <shinglyu> And this confuses me: "As in C++, the fields of Node are included in-line with the fields of Document, without any pointer indirection"
[08:08:33] <Manishearth> oh
[08:08:35] <Manishearth> so
[08:08:49] <Manishearth> struct Node {something: u8}
[08:09:20] <Manishearth> struct Document {parent: Node, somethingelse: u8}
[08:09:21] <shinglyu> So is this a automatic optimization done by the compiler?
[08:09:42] <Manishearth> will be stored as struct Document {parent: {something: u8}, somethingelse: u8}
[08:09:48] <Manishearth> which in memory is just two u8s
[08:09:54] <Manishearth> shinglyu: not even an optimization
[08:09:56] <shinglyu> Ah!
[08:10:02] <Manishearth> shinglyu: nothing is a pointer by default
[08:10:05] <Manishearth> unlike Java and all
[08:10:06] <shinglyu> I see
[08:10:13] <Manishearth> so nesting structs is a flat operation
[08:10:18] <shinglyu> so they are placed in the memory next to each other
[08:10:50] <Manishearth> note that when I say `parent` there, I mean the parent type (eg an HTMLElement is an Element is a Node, so each one is a child of the other in that sense)
[08:11:08] <Manishearth> for storing a pointer to a parent node we will use a JS<node>
[08:11:10] <Manishearth> shinglyu: yep
[08:11:26] <shinglyu> So if we have a nested struct, it will be flattened
[08:11:34] <shinglyu> kind of like serialization (?)
[08:11:57] *** Joins: Temur (Tarmashirin@moz-t3l.8bd.217.117.IP)
[08:14:58] <Manishearth> serialization?
[08:15:01] <Manishearth> but yes, it's flattened
[08:15:06] <Manishearth> how else would it be stored?
[08:15:18] <Manishearth> if you're not allowed to insert random pointers, that's the only way to store it :p
[08:16:26] <shinglyu> My first intuition is that we store a pointer to a Node struct created somewhere else
[08:16:35] <Manishearth> nop
[08:16:37] <Manishearth> *nope
[08:16:46] <Manishearth> Rust and C++ do not put random pointers around
[08:16:48] <Manishearth> Node is Node
[08:17:01] <Manishearth> Box<Node>, JS<Node> JSRef<Node> are all pointers

[08:19:55] <shinglyu> Does it make sense to use a pointer instead (perhaps in other kind of language?) in any case?, or is it simply a stupid idea?
[08:21:12] <Manishearth> not a stupid idea
[08:21:19] <Ms2ger> Well, this is simulating inheritance
[08:21:22] <Manishearth> in a language like Java, you GC everything anyway, so a pointer is fine
[08:21:45] <Manishearth> Ms2ger: I think he's asking about the language "feature" of flattening, not our usage of it
[08:21:49] <Ms2ger> Oh
[08:22:00] <Manishearth> shinglyu: but note that indirection can get costly
[08:22:38] <Manishearth> in lower level languages like C++/Rust you want to use pointers when you have stuff that you can't, or don't want to, put on the stack
[08:22:50] <Ms2ger> Right, then Java would store a pointer, but that's more because all object types are really Gc<Option<T>>
[08:22:55] <Manishearth> yep

[08:23:55] <Manishearth> Ms2ger: wait, why refcell?
[08:23:56] <Ms2ger> Note that we can't use a pointer for the Node fields, because then we couldn't cast a pointer to a Node to a pointer to a Document
[08:23:57] <Manishearth> oh right
[08:24:01] <Manishearth> mutability
[08:24:11] <Ms2ger> Manishearth, what else do you use RefCell for? :)
[08:24:34] <Manishearth> no I was thinking in the Java frame of mind and was like "why do we need refcounted interior mutability here?"
[08:24:44] <Manishearth> and then I realized that that's exactly what you were saying
[08:24:50] <Manishearth> well, perhaps it would be Cell though
[08:25:11] <Ms2ger> Mm, probably
[08:25:36] <Manishearth> shinglyu: note that since Node is the first field to the Document, and since memory layout is flat, a variable which is a Document can be treated like a Node without any issues
[08:26:01] <Manishearth> which is why all our casts are simple transmute (where transmute just is a way of telling the compiler to treat a variable of type A as type B)
[08:26:09] <Manishearth> well, all of our up casts

[08:27:17] <Manishearth> yes
[08:27:24] <shinglyu> And what happen to the rest of the Document's field when we cast it to Node?
[08:27:30] <Manishearth> nothing
[08:27:32] <Manishearth> they stay in memory
[08:27:38] <Manishearth> it's just not accessible anymore

[08:29:02] <Manishearth> it's JSRef<T>, remember
[08:29:32] <Manishearth> so, when we cast it, the fields of Document which were on the heap aren't accessible through the new Node pointer
[08:29:40] <Manishearth> but they are accessible through the old Document pointer
[08:29:50] <Manishearth> (JSRef<Node> and JSRef<Document>, that is)
[08:29:54] <shinglyu> Oh ok
[08:29:57] <Manishearth> and they are still known to the SM GC
[08:30:09] <Manishearth> it's just that locally we lose access
[08:30:13] <Manishearth> leaks are handled by the GC
[08:30:24] <shinglyu> So even if we are done with the JSRef<Node>, thie JSRef<Document> will still be live

[08:40:07] <shinglyu> From the first paragraph of "Auto-generating field traversals"
[08:40:32] <shinglyu> it seems like we still have cycle collection?
[08:41:30] <shinglyu> But I think the previous section "Memory management for the DOM" is saying that cycle collection is bad, and we want a better way to do this?

[08:54:42] <Manishearth> shinglyu: I believe the SM GC is cycle collecting ( Ms2ger ?)
[08:55:14] <Manishearth> I think the blog post is saying that we don't create an auxiliary GC to manage the DOM
[08:55:19] <Ms2ger> "cycle collection" is a term that's typically used for a particular kind of system based on refcounting
[08:55:20] <Manishearth> not sure
[08:56:04] <Ms2ger> The GC doesn't really collect cycles; it just collects everything that isn't rooted, so it doesn't even notice there are cycles in the dead objects
[08:58:11] <SimonSapin> SpiderMonkey’s garbage collector is a "tracing" garbage collector
[08:58:31] <SimonSapin> while CPython for examples uses reference counting with a cycle collector.
[08:58:38] <SimonSapin> these are two kinds of garbage collectors
[08:58:48] <Manishearth> ah okay
[08:59:02] <Manishearth> so SM just goes around marking rooted stuff
[08:59:14] <Manishearth> and cleanung up non-rooted stuff
[08:59:19] <Ms2ger> Well, two kinds of automatic memory management
[08:59:26] <Manishearth> what does cycle collecting do?
[08:59:34] <Ms2ger> "garbage collection" is often reserved for the tracing kind
[09:00:00] <Ms2ger> So if you have a dead cycle with refcounting, none of the objects reach a refcount zero
[09:00:18] <Ms2ger> CC detects that case, and force-deletes those objects
[09:00:31] <SimonSapin> Manishearth: I don’t know how CC works in CPython
[09:00:54] <Ms2ger> Manishearth, also, r? #5741 :)

[09:03:46] <Manishearth> later, studying
[09:05:31] <shinglyu> I read the whole blog post again, now I believe it's trying to say "Instead of ref counting + cycle collector, we use the hooks in Encodeable trait to let GC know all the pointers between DOM objects"

[14:48:06] <jdm> marcusklaas: so, you'd like tips on 1) how to find something more challenging to work on, 2) suggestions for something more challenging, 3) all of the above?
[14:48:34] <marcusklaas> Both, if possible :-)
[14:48:52] <larsberg> hiji1: I'm on 2.2.2 of git on my OSX box with no problems
[14:49:42] <jdm> marcusklaas: we have a "E-less easy" label which is correspondingly more challenging than E-easy, as one option
[14:49:45] <hiji1> larsberg: could you copy paste me the output string please?
[14:49:59] <larsberg> hiji1: git version 2.2.2
[14:50:02] <jdm> for more challenging than that, there are two main ways
[14:50:19] <hiji1> larsberg: thanks!
[14:50:23] <jdm> you can run load random pages and see what breaks, than start investigating solving them :)
[14:50:29] <marcusklaas> jdm: are those issues that one could work on without in-depth knowledge of servo?
[14:50:50] <jdm> marcusklaas: yes. they have similar level of detail in the descriptions as E-easy issues.
[14:51:00] <jdm> they're designed as a stepping stone
[14:51:33] *** Quits: Rym (y@moz-uso.r81.55.31.IP) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[14:51:38] <jdm> marcusklaas: another way to find things to work on is to choose your favourite DOM API and start working on missing pieces (compare the webidl file to the one in the appropriate spec)
[14:52:05] <jdm> marcusklaas: and finally there's the "trawl the issue tracker using labels that interest you" method
[14:52:34] <marcusklaas> Alright cool
[14:53:11] <marcusklaas> I don't have any API in mind, but I'll think about it. Will look at the E-less easy label for now 
[14:53:13] <jdm> marcusklaas: also note that issues marked as C-assigned may not have been touched for some time, so you can often take them over
[14:53:36] <marcusklaas> What's the time I should consider
[14:53:39] <marcusklaas> A week or two?
[14:54:26] <jdm> marcusklaas: that would obviously depend on how much time you would expect to have available each day :P
[14:54:55] <marcusklaas> Sorry, I meant before taking over an issue that is already assigned ;-)
[14:55:07] <jdm> oh, right
[14:55:23] <jdm> yeah, if it's been 3 weeks with no update, taking it over should be fine
[14:55:36] <marcusklaas> Cool
[14:55:50] <marcusklaas> Thanks for all the tips jdm
