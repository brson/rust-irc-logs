[02:13:56] <jack> is there a way to get stack bounds now that we don't have segmented stacks? Here's hte old code that does this in servo: https://github.com/mozilla-servo/rust-mozjs/blob/master/rust.rs#L62-L79
[02:14:59] <acrichto> jack: does that not still work?
[02:15:22] <acrichto> we still have "stack segments" in the sense of a custom allocated stack
[02:15:25] <jack> Well for starters, borrow is completely different now
[02:15:37] <acrichto> it's the same idea though
[02:15:38] <jack> I can no idea how to convert this because I can't figure out wtf that code is doing.
[02:15:42] <jack> the type signatures make no sense
[02:15:55] <acrichto> let mut task = Local::borrow(None::<Task>);
[02:16:02] <acrichto> task.get().coroutine.get_ref().get_stack_bounds()
[02:16:13] <acrichto> or the related field/function
[02:16:27] <jack> I have no idea how I would have figured that out. what does borrow do? why do you pass such a weird thing to it?
[02:16:36] <jack> why is that weird thing named "unused_parameter"
[02:16:43] <acrichto> well these are all runtime details
[02:16:56] <acrichto> not exactly designed to be discoverable

[05:40:31] <dbaupp> ktt3ja: btw, https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/10956
[05:40:53] <ktt3ja> acrichto: `rustuv_handle_type_max` is used here: https://github.com/mozilla/rust/blob/master/src/librustuv/uvll.rs#L390-L395, and it's #[test], right?
[05:44:52] <acrichto> ktt3ja: yes
[05:44:58] <acrichto> it's just used during unit testing
[05:45:39] <ktt3ja> what's the difference between #[test] and #[cfg(test)]?
[05:46:35] <strcat> #[test] defines a unit test, #[cfg(...)] conditionally enables some block of code
[05:47:50] <ktt3ja> ah k
[05:48:18] <dbaupp> and the test cfg is set implicitly when some compiles with --test (others are either set inside the compiler like `unix`, `windows` etc, or can be set on the command line with `--cfg foo`)
[05:50:19] <ktt3ja> what do you mean by "set implicitly"?
[05:51:09] <dbaupp> i.e. the compiler detects the --test flag and sets the test cfg, the user doesn't need to do `--test --cfg test`

[05:53:22] <ktt3ja> oh, so you gotta do `--cfg` manually for others?
[05:56:23] <dbaupp> yeah, if you want a custom one
[05:57:18] <dbaupp> ktt3ja: e.g. https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/10545 in the first code example, one would compile with `--cfg hide_payload` to get the items marked as such
[06:00:52] <ktt3ja> where does `cocoa` come from? I looked around and couldn't find it https://github.com/mozilla-servo/rust-alert/blob/master/macos.rs#L12-L14

[06:21:35] <ktt3ja> a question for dead-code pass: should a type be live just because it's a field of a live struct?
[06:25:23] <dbaupp> definitely
[06:26:28] <ktt3ja> ah k
[06:29:37] <ktt3ja> I never marked struct fields because I assumed that the types used for fields would be used somewhere else before you can create the struct in the first place, but issue #10956 found the exception to my assumption :x
[06:30:13] <dbaupp> ah, because FFI creates the values of that type?
[06:37:16] <ktt3ja> dbaupp: I'm not familiar with FFI, so I'm not sure if this's what you mean. This function of `cocoa::base` returns an NSAlert pointer: https://github.com/mozilla-servo/rust-alert/blob/master/macos.rs#L42, but I guess it doesn't export the NSAlert type
[06:39:23] <acrichto> ktt3ja: I think you may need to add #[allow(warnings)] to src/etc/combine-tests.py
[06:39:37] <acrichto> your PR has bounced a few times on windows for the same reason
[06:39:40] <acrichto> not sure why it's bouncing

[12:39:11] <cmr> io time shouldn't change memory usage though?
[12:40:35] <cmr> in particular *time* measurement has never been a concern of mine.
[12:40:46] <cmr> this particular benchmark has memory usage as its prime concern.
[12:41:00] <cmr> There are more interesting benchmarks for time.
[12:41:14] <cmr> (such as `fn main() { }`)
[12:44:26] <cmr> dbaupp: do you have any thoughts on a good way to display more benchmark information?
[12:44:46] <cmr> I'd like to spend a day or two this break on getting more bench reporting.
[12:45:42] <dbaupp> we now have sane access to the benchmark data from the buildbots
[12:45:44] <dbaupp> fwiw

[12:47:54] <cmr> well, the bench runner should factor that out?
[12:47:59] <dbaupp> what we need is a small set of relevant benchmarks that cover a cross-section of libraries and compiler code-gen
[12:47:59] <cmr> what sorts of deviation are you seeing?

[12:48:23] <dbaupp> something like http://speed.pypy.org/
[12:48:47] <dbaupp> but we don't really have much "real world" non-microbenchmarks written with idiomatic & up-to-date code.

[22:32:40] <brson> i can't do two builds of rust at the same time without running out of memory
[22:32:57] <brson> i used to do 4
[22:33:17] <strcat> with how much memory?
[22:33:21] <strcat> I can only do one with 4GiB
[22:33:31] <strcat> my desktop has more but I've never tried building rust there ;p
[22:33:34] <brson> 8GB
[22:34:10] <strcat> oh and if I don't have a swap file or overcommit on full (non-default), I run out of memory doing *one* if I have ffx and some terminals open
[22:34:16] <dbaupp> cmr: would it be possible to do a memory profile of a full make?
[22:35:11] <strcat> it'd be really nice if deriving didn't hardcode libstd paths ;p
[22:35:47] <dbaupp> do we want to replace it with needing the traits in scope?
[22:37:51] <dbaupp> currently librustc apparently only takes 1.4GiB to build, so we appear to be using more memory at some other stage
[22:38:44] <strcat> 1.4GiB of *RES*
[22:39:03] <strcat> I can build it fine with no swap if I turn overcommit to full instead of the default of heuristic
[22:39:10] <strcat> it happens when it forks gcc
