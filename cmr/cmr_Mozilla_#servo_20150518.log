[00:02:14] <klusark> Yes
[00:04:28] <KiChjang> there's a guide for handling new dom objects and how to properly place them in memory
[00:04:43] <KiChjang> there should be one in the github wiki but i can't find it

[00:05:50] <KiChjang> yeah that one

[00:08:47] <KiChjang> an optional parameter would ideally be an Option type in rust

[00:09:11] <klusark> but, for actually checking if it has a value or not
[00:09:57] <KiChjang> you can use a match block like what you just described
[00:10:11] <klusark> ok
[00:10:48] <KiChjang> i imagine it would look something like Ok(width) => image.setWidth(width);
[00:11:01] <KiChjang> and then None => {}

[00:15:29] <KiChjang> @gw: yeah i totally forgot about that
[00:17:25] <KiChjang> i'm guessing that you should do something similar to what the Width method is doing
[00:17:54] <KiChjang> instead of calling Width, you should do the entire element casting and set_uint_attribute()

[00:31:03] <KiChjang> i'm not sure if i got everything correct for the semantics of rooting an object
[00:31:38] <klusark> So, my way doesn't seem to work. When I print the values of width and height I get 0, regardless of what I set it to in the constructor
[00:31:43] <KiChjang> but if you root a DOM object, then the computation is going to be costly because you're basically calling a JS function
[00:32:09] <klusark> actually, if I set it manually, it still is 0...

[01:58:17] <gw> larsberg: no worries! it was trivial once the logging was working again :)

[01:59:36] <larsberg> gw: in retrospect, that probably would have been a better use of my time than spending a day trying to get ndk-gdb to work without a real project around and then shaving the resulting field of yaks
[02:00:10] <larsberg> but at least we have a couple of coats of yak fur available for the next workweek, so there's that :-)
[02:00:15] <gw> larsberg: sooner or later we are going to need ndk-gdb working well, so it's probably worth it

[02:01:30] <fabrice> gw: larsberg: do you know about jimdb?
[02:01:51] <larsberg> fabrice: mwu pointed me at it and mbrubeck also mentioned it's pretty fantastic, so I'd like to steal it.
[02:02:08] <gw> larsberg: cool. profiling on android at the moment might be a bit misleading, as android isn't properly going to sleep while waiting for OS events at the moment, but that shouldn't be too hard to fix
[02:02:08] <fabrice> larsberg: yep it's wonderful. see https://wiki.mozilla.org/Mobile/Fennec/Android/GDB
[02:02:38] <gw> fabrice: it was mentioned, but I haven't looked into it yet. sounds great though!
[02:02:39] <larsberg> Our problems are more mundane, though - our current build infra doesn't keep around the android projects it generates, doesn't set debuggable=true, etc. :-)

[02:20:22] <Nashenas88> My code fixed a test such that the test suite no longer times out, but a test inside should still fail. It looked like this before: [harness_name]\n type: testharness\n  expected: TIMEOUT, and I’m writing this: [harness_name]\n type: testharness\n  expected: OK\n  [test_name]\n    expected: FAIL
[02:21:21] <Nashenas88> better formatting: http://pastebin.com/gQJtr3g9
[02:21:40] <Nashenas88> Is what I did right? (mostly worried about the OK since I read we’re supposed to remove OK statuses)
[02:23:06] <KiChjang> Nashenas88: i a test is expected to be OK, you can just delete the lines in the .ini file
[02:23:35] <Nashenas88> KiChjang: The test is failing, but the harness used to timeout, and now it doesn't
[02:23:56] <Nashenas88> Should I mark the harness as OK or delete the expectation for the harness?

[03:01:55] <Nashenas88> Do I need to implement https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/comms.html#parse-a-websocket-url's-components word-for-word? My confusion is that some of the steps are covered by UrlParser::parse
[03:02:14] *** Quits: r0e (rohinpatel@moz-0jfkf9.wireless.ubc.ca) (Quit: Lost terminal)
[03:02:38] <Nashenas88> and it’s also asking that I, “12. Return host, port, resource name, and secure.” would it just suffice to return a Url object?
[03:03:02] <Nashenas88> Actually, nvm, I’ll submit a pull request and discuss it during review.
[03:04:36] <KiChjang> Nashenas88: rust has tuples, so you can definitely return something like (host, port, resource_name, secure)
[03:04:41] *** Joins: rohinpatel (rohinpatel@moz-0jfkf9.wireless.ubc.ca)
[03:05:16] <KiChjang> however, failing an algorithm is usually done by returning an Err
[03:05:34] <Nashenas88> KiChjang: My question was more if I am required to follow that algorithm explicitly, since half of what it does is covered by UrlParser::parse
[03:06:16] <KiChjang> which of the steps are covered by URL?
[03:06:20] <Nashenas88> Currently, the constructor for WebSocket uses a Client, which takes in a Url object, and not a host, post, resource and secure
[03:06:54] <Nashenas88> Parts like “8. If there is no explicit port, then: if secure is false, let port be 80, otherwise let port be 443.”
[03:07:37] <Nashenas88> and secure comes from “5. If the scheme component of the resulting parsed URL is "ws", set secure to false; otherwise, the scheme component is "wss", set secure to true.”
[03:08:19] <Nashenas88> Url sets the default ports if none are defined (though I’m doing it through UrlParser::scheme_type_mapper
[03:09:25] <KiChjang> if that's the case, follow the spec by the word
[03:09:33] <Nashenas88> ok
[03:09:48] <KiChjang> there's a good reason why its functionality is duplicated
[03:09:56] <Nashenas88> Should I also return the url in the tuple? Currently the constructor is using this to connect: http://doc.servo.org/websocket/client/struct.Client.html#method.connect
[03:10:04] <KiChjang> or if you think there's an error, you can file a bug to WHATWG
[03:11:06] <Nashenas88> KiChjang: no not at all, it’s just my first time following something like this, I wasn’t sure if it’s part of the spec or if the variable names and internal return types are more of a suggestion

[03:16:10] <KiChjang> oh wow, it looks like the current implementation of the connect() function isn't to spec
[03:16:21] <KiChjang> http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-4.1
[03:17:05] <KiChjang> this here explicitly dictates that the connect method must be supplied with a tuple containing what you've described
[03:17:20] <Nashenas88> ahhh, hance my confusion
[03:17:22] <Nashenas88> hence*
[03:18:26] <Nashenas88> so, should I continue with my current issue (maybe return everything plus the Url, and add a todo?) or should the new issue be a blocker for this one?

[13:43:26] <KiChjang> Suffice it to say that on Monday, Canadians might be sleeping
[13:43:28] <KiChjang> in. Or maybe they’re relaxing with friends and family. Barbeque is
[13:43:30] <KiChjang> popular. So are fireworks. Or maybe they’ll be working on that pet
[13:43:32] <KiChjang> side-project. Maybe they’ll finally water the plants. It’s really

[16:55:04] <seanmonstar> Yes, the answer is dont
[16:55:09] <seanmonstar> I know it sounds jerkish
[16:55:42] <seanmonstar> But look at the docs of Accept 
[16:55:44] <Manishearth> don't listen to him he uses rust stable builds
[16:56:00] <seanmonstar> Using the types means you don't have to parse at run time
[16:56:08] <Manishearth> (but you should totally listen to him, http is terrible and headers are terrible and types are all that will keep you sane)
[16:56:09] <seanmonstar> And you can't write typos with Types
[16:57:21] <Manishearth> seanmonstar: isn't there a way to parse for a given type though?
[16:57:28] <aweinstock> technically, you can make typos with types, but the compiler will (almost always) catch the typos
[16:57:35] <KiChjang> okay, then it looks like i'll have to convert step 1 of this spec https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-fetch into QualityItem types

[17:34:18] <BenB> Manishearth: with pleasure. you're taking this feedback to improve, so I feel this is useful. thanks for that.
[17:34:36] <Manishearth> :)
[17:35:08] <BenB> Manishearth: you probably want a specific build flag that enables Android. Normally, the target is the same machine type as the builder, unless specified otherwise.
[17:35:31] <zmike_> pcwalton: at the time self.window.present(); is called in compositor.rs, is all the opengl rendering stuff complete for the current frame or is it still working in some of the threads?
[17:35:39] <mbrubeck> BenB: We already use `./mach build --android` to enable our special Android build steps, so this could be added to that.
[17:35:48] <BenB> mbrubeck: great
[17:35:51] <pcwalton> zmike_: there is never any guarantee that some thread is not using OpenGL
[17:35:52] <Manishearth> mbrubeck: That doesn't fix Cargo complaining
[17:35:54] <pcwalton> for example, consider OpeNGL
[17:35:56] <pcwalton> err
[17:35:56] <pcwalton> WebGL
[17:35:57] <pcwalton> sorry
[17:35:59] <Manishearth> that should be in dependencies.android
[17:36:04] <Manishearth> but I think Cargo fetches everything in the lockfile
[17:36:19] <zmike_> I'm not interested in whether it's using opengl, just whether servo is actively operating on the current frame
[17:36:40] <mbrubeck> Manishearth: ah, yeah
[17:36:49] <pcwalton> zmike_: in that case, it should always be finished with the current frame
[17:37:02] <Manishearth> for example iirc a Servo build pulls in winapi because lockfile
[17:37:55] <mbrubeck> BenB: Did you manage to work around the issue? There's some `git submodule` command that should work in 1.7
[17:37:57] <BenB> Manishearth: mbrubeck has a point that the build could adjust the Cargo.toml file based on the flags.
[17:38:53] <BenB> mbrubeck: yes, git 1.7 has a "git submodule sync" without --recursive and a "git foreach --recursive". I worked around it by simply removing the files from the Python script. that got me past this.
[17:38:56] <mbrubeck> BenB: Maybe `git submodule sync support/android-rs-glue"
[17:39:02] <Manishearth> noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
[17:39:03] <mbrubeck> cool
[17:39:10] <Manishearth> don't magically edit Cargo files
[17:39:12] <Manishearth> Cargo doesn't like it
[17:39:44] <BenB> Manishearth: I don't even know what Cargo is, so I can't comment on that :)
[17:40:07] <BenB> (much less of its likes and dislikes and favorite flavors :) )
[17:40:35] <Manishearth> rust package manager
[17:41:02] <Manishearth> It's also the grumpy cat of Rust, so it dislikes pretty much everything
[17:41:08] <aweinstock> combination package manager/build system, I thought? (kind of like haskell's cabal)
[17:41:23] <Manishearth> yes
[17:41:35] <Manishearth> it's actually pretty good

[21:07:01] <zmike_> gw: heya...high-level early morning technical question for you
[21:07:23] <zmike_> is the swapbuffer call when using the embedding api time sensitive?
[21:08:24] <gw> zmike_: depends on what you mean by time sensitive. it will block if vsync is enabled (which it probably won't be on an embedded application). it will return immediately if vsync is not enabled
[21:08:42] <zmike_> I meant in terms of when the swap is executed
[21:08:52] <zmike_> ie. calling it in the present callback vs calling it slightly later
[21:10:06] <gw> zmike_: the earlier you can call it the better in terms of latency, but it shouldn't affect correctness of the image or anything like that
[21:10:07] <zmike_> I am trying to find some possible reasons why I get a black rect on startup when using the embedding api

[21:30:17] <zmike_> I wish there was a diff tool for frames in this
[21:30:38] <zmike_> oh there is
[21:32:50] <gw> zmike_: in frame 4, the last draw call has texture id 6 bound, but I don't see where the image data is being set for that texture?
[21:33:11] <zmike_> gw: this is in the first trace I sent?
[21:33:15] <gw> yep
[21:34:54] <gw> texture id 6 does get bound as a render buffer texture a bit before that, which seems odd too, as I think that is the active draw target while also being bound as a shader sampler texture, if I'm reading the trace correctly
[21:35:36] <zmike_> it looks like 5 isn't doing much either
[21:35:49] <gw> it might be worth adding some logging of texture ids as they are bound to render targets / samplers during the frame, to see if there is a wrong texture id being used somewhere
[21:35:55] <zmike_> hm
[21:36:08] <zmike_> I would think that would be noticeable in running servo main though?
[21:36:08] <gw> yes, texture id 5 does seem redundant
[21:36:22] <zmike_> because that starts up fine
[21:37:07] <gw> zmike_: well, servo just renders straight to the default frame buffer, it doesn't bother binding render buffers etc

[21:38:49] <KiChjang> does anyone know where i should file a bug for the Mime crate?

[21:39:51] <KiChjang> lemme see...
[21:40:02] <zmike_> gw: I'm checking against servo main
[21:40:08] <zmike_> and it's completely different haha
[21:40:32] <KiChjang> mbrubeck: ahh yes that's correct
[21:40:59] <mbrubeck> Hmm, this assumes that all the floats for a given flow have the same WritingMode, which is not true: https://github.com/servo/servo/blob/master/components/layout/floats.rs#L119-L120
[21:41:31] <gw> zmike_: yep. I would try logging out texture IDs that are being bound as render targets and/or samplers, and see if there is some mismatch there
[21:42:05] <mbrubeck> But I'm not sure whether we should store each float's PlacementInfo in *its* writing mode, or convert them all into one writing mode stored in Floats...
[21:42:13] <gw> zmike_: it's also not clear to me from that trace where the actual rust-layers render is occurring? (this is using the hw accel compositing path, right?)
[21:42:14] <mbrubeck> I'll try the second option for now
[21:42:22] <zmike_> gw: yes, it's using that
[21:42:28] <zmike_> I think each frame is a rust-layers render
[21:42:36] <zmike_> for frames 2-5
[21:42:47] <zmike_> there's the makecurrent in the app through the cef callback
[21:42:50] <zmike_> then rust-layers
[21:42:56] <zmike_> then swap at the end back in the app
[21:43:32] <zmike_> it's a bit strange though since a trace of servo-main loading the same page on startup has frames of ~3k calls for the renders
[21:46:10] <gw> zmike_: yep. I can see a small # of calls to draw a 4 vertex tri strip, which is probably rust-layers blitting the tile quads. however, that happens when texture id 8 is attached to the render buffer, which is definitely not what's being used as a texture sampler in the final draw calls
[21:46:31] <zmike_> super weird
[21:46:52] <zmike_> why would it behave differently when embedded?
[21:47:56] <zmike_> gw: I'm putting some logging in, what specifically are you suggesting I log? places where textures get bound and ?
[21:47:59] <gw> zmike_: not sure. perhaps also log out (1) when the render buffer gets bound (2) when the rust-layers draw occurs (3) when the render buffer is unbound (4) when the resulting texture is bound to the sampler. perhaps the ordering is not what you expect?
[21:48:42] <gw> zmike_: and log the texture IDs that are used as frame buffer attachments, sampler bindings in those cases

[22:02:32] *** mut_mbrubeck is now known as mbrubeck
[22:02:33] <gw> zmike_: well, for one example, if the toolkit is binding / unbinding the renderbuffer, and then later on the servo rust-layers call happens, it won't end up in the expected texture

[22:44:58] <zmike_> ah, it didn't affect rendering at all
[22:45:16] <zmike_> but it's actually binding something now

[22:45:33] <gw> zmike_: cool. do you have access to an amd gpu per chance?
[22:45:44] <zmike_> nope
[22:45:51] <zmike_> just intel
[22:46:13] <mwu> need testing on an radeon?
[22:46:23] <zmike_> rrrr I've been trying to make another apitrace dump but it refuses to do the dump
[22:46:24] <zmike_> wtf
[22:47:09] <gw> mwu: was just going to suggest zmike_ tried http://developer.amd.com/tools-and-sdks/opencl-zone/codexl/ for his opengl issues if he had an amd gpu - it is a bit more robust and detailed than apitrace
[22:47:17] <zmike_> ah
[22:47:22] <zmike_> yes, I was looking at that the other day
[22:47:37] *** Joins: wolfviking0 (wolfviking0@moz-8hd.3b6.246.162.IP)
[22:47:38] <zmike_> it crashes on linux anyway though because it's a binary build that's way too old for any modern system
[22:47:41] <mwu> oh
[22:47:55] <zmike_> FINALLY
[22:48:14] <mwu> I'm running the mesa drivers so that probably won't help
[22:48:36] <gw> yea it requires the catalyst blob unfortunately

[22:53:04] <gw> zmike_: that still has the same problem - near the end of the trace, it attaches texture 23 to a renderbuffer. then straight away it binds texture 23 as an input sampler for the final quad, but nothing gets drawn to that render buffer in between :(
[22:54:31] <zmike_> may have figured htat out too...
[22:56:28] <zmike_> gw: which particular frame were you looking at?

[23:02:18] <zmike_> gw: so in that case it should have attached texture 23 to the renderbuffer and then let servo do its rust-layers thing?
[23:02:42] <gw> zmike_: From that trace, that's what I would assume should be happening, yep
[23:02:48] <zmike_> super weird
[23:03:09] <zmike_> because I'm definitely making that call when I get the paint callback
[23:03:41] <zmike_> and then unbinding and queuing the final render when I get present()

[23:07:39] <zmike_> oh
[23:07:43] <zmike_> gw: I know what this is
[23:07:51] <zmike_> what you're seeing is actually another gl context
[23:08:12] <zmike_> I'm using a widget that has its own gl context, and I'm creating a shared gl ctx off of that for servo
[23:08:32] <zmike_> so what you saw in that frame is the widget's gl ctx binding
[23:09:35] <gw> hmmmm. ok. it still looks odd to me, but perhaps apitrace is getting confused by the multiple contexts

[23:10:04] <zmike_> well the way the widget is supposed to work is that it has a callback during which it sets up all the render stuff
[23:10:09] <zmike_> and you do your gl operations then
[23:10:18] <zmike_> but servo can't do that since it has its own paint callbacks
[23:10:41] <zmike_> so the widget still calls its own render callbacks and sets up its rendering but then does nothing with its own ctx
