[05:15:22] <c74d> I've previously only seen people (who cared about the subject) either being pro-(IEC *bibyte units, metric *byte units) and anti-(JEDEC-style *byte units), or pro-JEDEC-style and anti-IEC/metric.
[05:16:07] <scott> because kibibytes are unambiguously 1024-based and kilobytes are ambiguously either 1000- or 1024-based depending on who you ask
[05:16:37] <scott> and I've never had a use for 1000-based prefixes for bytes, so all I want is 1024
[05:17:04] <scott> the downside is some people won't know what you mean by kibibytes (though it's easy to google)
[05:17:51] *** Joins: theme (theme@moz-i3mhhb.asianet.co.th)
[05:20:13] <c74d> I suppose I agree, though in my personal use I tend toward the metric units where available, merely because (though I resent it) powers of 1000 are more intuitive for me than powers of 1024.
[05:20:31] <Yurume> scott: I think "many people" wouldn't know. SI prefix is so widespread enough that using a different definition for those is bad.
[05:20:59] <Yurume> at least, kibibyte etc. is not for the common consumption.
[05:21:08] <eddyb_> Yurume: that's just sad
[05:21:27] <scott> if you want to be clear, KiB and kibibyte are the way to go

[17:28:58] <UberLambda> Do you have any idea about if the Elm debugger needs to re-evaluate all previous events to go back in time?
[17:29:21] <UberLambda> It seems like it doesn't store any state, but instead it reapplies all events to a base state
[17:29:33] <UberLambda> This seems *really* wasteful
[17:34:58] <XMPPwocky> so... rusti?
