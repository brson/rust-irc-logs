[00:31:15] <Gankro> acrichto: who was that travis guy who's sometimes in here?
[00:31:30] <acrichto> henrikhodne
[00:31:44] <acrichto> Gankro: https://github.com/henrikhodne
[00:31:57] <Elainemo> haha, excellent avatar.
[00:32:16] <Gankro> acrichto: hmm, not in #rust
[00:32:25] <Gankro> I fear we will never get a response from travi
[00:32:27] <Gankro> s
[00:32:30] <acrichto> yeah haven't seen him around in awhile
[00:32:39] <acrichto> Gankro: maybe trying pinging that travis thread?
[00:33:58] * Gankro realizes its literally only been a week
[00:34:01] <Gankro> feels longer
[04:37:28] <Gankro> acrichto: any news on the new markdown lib?

[05:02:20] <acrichto> no new news on that as far as I know, I think it still may need to be relicensed to MIT
[05:02:37] <Gankro> acrichto: I thought that had been agreed on?
[05:03:37] <acrichto> I think?
[05:03:41] <acrichto> hasn't changed in-repo though

[17:53:35] <acrichto> brson: nrc: wycats: vadimcn: thoughts on moving cargo install into FCP?
[17:53:54] <wycats> acrichto: can you TLDR me on the salient changes since our discussion at the WWW
[17:54:26] <acrichto> wycats: cargo install == make install, there's no `cargo install --update` or `cargo install --list`
[17:54:45] <acrichto> or we may have --list still
[17:54:57] <brson> acrichto: i'm ok with fcp, though i would like to rereview before it's approved
[17:55:09] <acrichto> wycats: also a few extra options to place outupt in various locations
[17:55:43] <wycats> acrichto: I don't really understand why you would have uninstall/install but not update
[17:55:46] <wycats> just to slap people?
[17:56:21] <acrichto> wycats: it'd be helpful to put this on the RFC
[17:56:32] <acrichto> wycats: there's basically 0 support for updating crates
[17:56:53] <nrc> acrichto: +1 - no new comments for 9 days
[17:57:17] <wycats> acrichto: link me again?
[17:57:29] <acrichto> wycats: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1200
[17:58:59] <wycats> https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1200#issuecomment-126040146
[17:59:43] <acrichto> wycats: thanks!
[18:01:14] <wycats> I actually care less about `--list` than `update`
[18:01:21] <wycats> but my point has always been:
[18:01:27] <wycats> if we support `uninstall` we need metadata
[18:01:37] <wycats> if we need metadata we need a better reason than S&M to not expose it
[18:03:04] <acrichto> wycats: some are saying I believe that we shouldn't have metadata at all or cargo should have an option to not install the metadata
[18:03:56] <wycats> I don't think the feature is useful without an uninstallation
[18:04:12] <wycats> it is very annoying to install things into your system and have it just splat things there
[18:04:24] <wycats> I would be opposed to a cargo install without uninstallation
[18:04:36] <wycats> too easy to permanently FUBAR your system
[18:04:55] <acrichto> yeah I feel the same

[18:07:58] <brson> agree about uninstall
[18:10:00] <nrc> +1
[18:10:34] <nrc> my view on update is that we can always add it later, get install and uninstall working first
[18:11:22] <Elainemo> nrc: I disagree with that approach, when applied to Cargo.
[18:11:28] <Elainemo> Cargo is the tool that everyone uses every day.
[18:11:36] <Elainemo> When a half-baked feature lands, people still want to use it because it's useful.
[18:12:15] <Elainemo> But then they get burned and a wave of "cargo sux" propagates.
[18:13:15] <nrc> right, but adding update to the RFC now isn't going to get it implemented any faster and the risk is that we design up front, realise we want to change stuff and then get stuck with something which really does suck
[18:13:42] <Elainemo> fair enough
[18:19:16] <Elainemo> prototypes are important.
