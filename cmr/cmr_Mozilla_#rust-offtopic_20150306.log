[17:37:42] <WindowsBunny> there's already an irc library in rust

[17:38:00] <WindowsBunny> because there's no sane GUI toolkits :D
[17:38:03] <Astrum|Lap> actually IRC is a bit dated
[17:39:04] <c74d> Zoxc: My WeeChat has a listing of highlights (the "hotlist"). I've seen WeeChat called a Quassel ripoff, so you might like it (maybe with its Qt UI).

[17:46:02] <scott> Qt is best
[17:46:09] <tiffany> bombless: out of all of those, wxwidgets is the only one which appears to be modular enough to use in games
[17:46:17] <WindowsBunny> Too bad Qt is so very C++ :(
[17:46:17] <c74d> bombless: For GUI applications? I'd say Qt.
[17:46:23] <tiffany> but that's only because it spams the hell out of virtual classes
[17:46:24] <WindowsBunny> Qt is wonderful though
[17:46:30] <scott> tk and wx are pretty underpowered in general, gtk+ doesn't do native-look cross-platform well
[17:46:35] <c74d> bombless: I don't know iup though.
[17:46:37] <scott> I'm not familiar with iup
[17:46:41] <WindowsBunny> gtk looks awful on windows
[17:46:41] <tiffany> iup is old
[17:46:47] <WindowsBunny> and if you use gtk on windows i will stab you
[17:46:54] <tiffany> the screenshots were very ugly
[17:47:27] <scott> as far as I'm concerned Qt has been the only reasonable cross-platform option for quite some time
[17:47:51] <scott> that or just targeting each platform with a different toolkit (native winapi, os x, gtk for linux)
[17:47:53] <WindowsBunny> Qt just works so well on windows
[17:48:05] <tiffany> oh, there we go
[17:48:17] <WindowsBunny> scott: Someone should write a rust UI library that wraps the native UI toolkits :D
[17:48:19] <tiffany> IUP has gtk and native windows backends
[17:48:32] <tiffany> so the reason it looked super ugly last time I looked at it was probably because I was looking at the motif backend
[17:48:52] <WindowsBunny> any rust gui programs will look ugly on windows because they don't have manifests
[17:48:52] <tiffany> http://webserver2.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/iup/
[17:49:11] <WindowsBunny> and so end up loading old versions of the system ui libraries
[17:49:14] <tiffany> er.. click on gallery

[17:50:06] <scott> I think with Qt it's not entirely automatic
[17:50:17] <tiffany> they must have updated the site last time I looked at this
[17:50:18] <scott> you still have to add mac drawer widgets and stuff conditionally, afaik
[17:50:23] <scott> but it *lets* you do so, unlike gtk
[17:50:27] <tiffany> it gave me the impression it hadn't been touched in over a decade
[17:50:38] <lahwran> but like, the main ui for quassel feels very odd
[17:50:47] <lahwran> like, why are all the sidebars detachable? super tacky
[17:51:04] <lahwran> or well, why are they always detachable
[17:51:11] * c74d wonders why it is that GTK seems much more common for non-DE-affiliated Linux GUI programs than Qt.
[17:51:15] <lahwran> being able to move them around is cool. having "grab me" headers looks awkward
[17:51:33] <tiffany> because GTK is C, c74d
[17:51:39] <lahwran> that was my first thought too
[17:51:46] <lahwran> but it doesn't sound right to me
[17:51:49] <scott> Qt isn't even C++

[18:44:34] <cmr> WindowsBunny: might we need a C++ stub?
[18:44:44] <WindowsBunny> cmr: Nah, we can just explicitly link it
[18:45:01] <WindowsBunny> The functions are C style
[18:45:04] <WindowsBunny> just with mangled names
[18:45:07] <cmr> ah ok
[18:45:11] <cmr> I see now
[18:45:16] <WindowsBunny> and they even have the type signatures right there :|
[18:46:00] <cmr> Are there any licensing issues I need to be worried about when filling in the stuff?
[18:46:10] <cmr> I asume bindgening the headers is not acceptable
[18:46:35] <WindowsBunny> licensing issues?
[18:46:40] <WindowsBunny> um
[18:46:42] <WindowsBunny> idk
[18:46:47] <cmr> welp
[18:46:54] <cmr> let's pretend this conversation didn't happen :P
[18:46:56] <WindowsBunny> Microsoft doesn't allow redistribution of the libraries and headers themselves
[18:47:00] <cmr> right
[18:47:12] <WindowsBunny> But they don't say anything about bindings
[18:47:36] <XMPPwocky> i wonder if bindings are considered, like, "facts"
[18:47:50] <XMPPwocky> because fundamentally they're just a description of the interface various .dlls expose
[18:47:52] <cmr> XMPPwocky: according to oracle and the courts, you can copyright APIs, so ... no.
[18:48:13] <WindowsBunny> but we're not implementing their API
[18:48:15] <cmr> or patent, or something silly
[18:48:17] <cmr> yeah
[18:48:20] <cmr> I don't know
[18:48:21] <WindowsBunny> we still depend on microsoft's code
[18:49:06] <WindowsBunny> if only we had a lawyer to help clarify :D
[18:49:13] <XMPPwocky> i mean, i don't see a huge difference between "if you get the exported symbol from foo.dll named DoTheThings, push things onto the stack, then jump to its address, you'll get something interesting back"
[18:49:18] <WindowsBunny> cmr: In the meantime we'll just assume it is legal
[18:49:32] <XMPPwocky> and extern "stdcall" { fn DoTheThings(a: u32) -> u32; }}
[18:49:51] <WindowsBunny> XMPPwocky: But if we use the same parameter names, and struct field names
[18:50:08] <XMPPwocky> try
[18:50:09] <XMPPwocky> tryue

[18:57:31] <WindowsBunny> I use notepad++
[18:57:41] <WindowsBunny> visual rust is still too clunky

[19:01:25] <cmr> I would die if the visual studio debugger + profiler worked nicely with rust.
[19:01:50] <WindowsBunny> cmr: The proper way to do it is link.exe

[19:02:03] <scott> I actually have no strong opinions when it comes to IDEs, except for the fact that I can't live without vim keybindings, so that kind of limits my options
[19:02:05] <cmr> ricky26: you are my potential hero
[19:02:49] <WindowsBunny> once we can build with link.exe, then we just need to do what clang does and emit codeview debug info
[19:03:11] <WindowsBunny> later on llvm will add support for proper PDB debug info and we can upgrade to that

[20:06:02] <tiffany> consistency trumps all
[20:06:09] <c74d> tiffany: structural editing?
[20:06:19] <tiffany> c74d: where you manipulate the AST instead of a stream of bytes
[20:06:22] <tiffany> or characters
[20:07:07] <WindowsBunny> c74d: I hate formatting which has ridiculous amounts of horizontal indenting
[20:07:08] <tiffany> to integrate with existing languages you need a tool which can figure out a project's current formatting rules, though, which can be very idiosyncratic
[20:07:29] <tiffany> emacs can try to figure out formatting rules from the current buffer

[20:16:45] <cmr> (and can be fixed with more regex)

I think the only "syntax" is a `:` operator (equivalent to Idris `$`), parentheses, and square brackets.

[20:19:52] <XMPPwocky> cmr: now you have 2^N problems

[20:21:05] <scott> maybe http://concatenative.org/wiki/view/Front%20Page
[20:21:10] <tiffany> you could try out one of the many concatenative languages, such as factor, cat, kitten, or of course the classic forth
[20:21:15] <cmr> I'm been digging J
[20:21:17] <c74d> scott: Yes, though it'd only be needed where Idris `$` is. 
[20:21:18] <tiffany> that wiki is a good source too
[20:21:19] <scott> I recommend Factor is you want high-level and Forth if you want low-level
[20:21:25] <scott> if*
[20:21:44] <XMPPwocky> forth is concatententigaive?
[20:21:47] <XMPPwocky> concatenative, evne
[20:21:51] <scott> yes
[20:22:02] <tiffany> if you want to start at the equivalent of lambda calculus, this is a great resource: http://tunes.org/~iepos/joy.html
[20:22:06] <scott> it's probably the 'original' concatenative language

[20:22:25] <c74d> tiffany: Are there concatenative languages with strong expressive typing? I looked into Forth last time you and eddyb were talking about it, but stopped when I saw the creator's opinion on typing.
[20:22:36] <tiffany> yeah
[20:22:36] <scott> cat has static typing
[20:22:45] * WindowsBunny gives cmr exactly enough alcohol to achieve ballmer's peak
[20:22:47] <tiffany> forth is kind of an odd duckling
[20:22:51] <scott> I'm interested in concatenative + static typing. I haven't explored that enough
[20:22:56] <tiffany> it's also very old, so you have to forgive it a little bit
[20:23:04] <scott> Factor does number of arguments checking, which is hard enough
[20:23:10] <c74d> (Do I need to know mathematics to use this Joy?)
[20:23:17] <tiffany> you can build very strongly statically typed languages with very simple type inference with concatenative languages
[20:23:25] <tiffany> c74d: are you familiar with lambda calculus?
[20:23:31] <c74d> Not at all.
[20:23:34] <tiffany> oh
[20:23:41] <tiffany> it's the basis of a lot of computing theory
[20:23:48] <tiffany> it's a language in which the only construct is the lambda
[20:23:52] <tiffany> no values or anything
[20:23:54] <tiffany> very pure
[20:24:31] <tiffany> you can toy with it in haskell or idris easily enough
[20:24:41] <tiffany> church encoding can be implemented rather cleanly in either
[20:24:44] <scott> or any language with closures
[20:24:49] <tiffany> church encoding being a way of encoding values as lambdas
[20:25:25] <scott> when I first was learning this kind of stuff I wrote tons of lambdas in Ruby =)
[20:25:35] <tiffany> a church numeral is a function that takes F and X, and does F(F(...N...F(X))) 
[20:25:59] <tiffany> so to convert it to a 'native' number type, you run N (+) 0
[20:26:16] <tiffany> a church list is similar, it's equivalent to a closure over foldr
[20:26:39] <c74d> So an Idris Nat is a Church numeral with F=S and X=Z?
[20:26:52] <tiffany> kind of
[20:26:59] <tiffany> they're both unary, at least
[20:27:02] <scott> Idris isn't using Church encoding, but you could
[20:27:06] <tiffany> yeah, that
[20:27:20] <tiffany> that page I linked actually provides an algorithm for converting arbitrary lambda calculus expressions into concatenative expressions
[20:27:25] <tiffany> using a set of 5 combinators
[20:27:31] <scott> with Church encoding you can encode nats as functions instead of a new data type
[20:27:37] <tiffany> which, later in the page, it is shown that those 5 combinators can be defined from just two
[20:28:14] <tiffany> the implementation of my programming language is currently little more than what is described on that page btw
[20:28:36] <tiffany> I've been having too much fun with combinators to actually make a practical programming language
[20:28:42] <scott> heh heh, my old gist about curried lambdas in Ruby: https://gist.github.com/tsion/194556
[20:28:53] <tiffany> I tried some lambda calculus in lua once
[20:28:55] <tiffany> very verbose
[20:29:31] <scott> my Ruby stuff is fairly concise thanks to my automatically-currying lambda defining thing
[20:29:59] <tiffany> one downside to concatenative languages is that implicit currying is more or less impossible
[20:30:07] <tiffany> you can explicitly curry using the cons combinator, though
[20:30:28] <scott> you mean partial application?
[20:30:33] <tiffany> yeah
[20:30:38] <WindowsBunny> cmr: I wonder how slow building the library will be now :D
[20:30:46] <WindowsBunny> coherence checking will probably be even worse!

[20:33:33] <scott> what is the meaning of uncat?
[20:33:43] <scott> it can't be an inverse of cat
[20:33:52] <tiffany> oh
[20:33:54] <tiffany> yeah, it can't
[20:34:02] <tiffany> it could rip off the first element in a quotation, though
[20:34:08] <scott> uncons does that
[20:34:18] <tiffany> no, uncons only works if the first element is quoted
[20:34:21] <tiffany> cat does not quote, cons does
[20:34:40] <scott> I thought it was like x [y] cons ==> [x y]
[20:34:46] <scott> [x] [y] cat ==> [x y]
[20:34:54] <scott> [x y] uncons ==> x [y]
[20:35:03] <tiffany> it's [a] [b] cat -> [a b]; [a] [b] cons -> [[a] b]
[20:35:16] <tiffany> [[a] b] uncons -> [a] [b]
[20:35:17] <scott> sure, but [a] need not be a quotation for cons
[20:35:34] <scott> 1 [+] cons ==> [1 +]
[20:35:37] <scott> partial application
[20:35:40] <tiffany> sure, you could create a version of uncons which works for quotes where the first element is not quoted
[20:35:53] <tiffany> but the type description I wrote is more restrictive than that
[20:36:03] <tiffany> I don't know how to write a type description that would work for ripping apart lambdas
[20:36:45] <scott> being able to inspect the lambda structure probably wreaks havoc with parametricity and other properties
[20:36:46] <tiffany> scott: in my interpretation, 1 is a function which pushes the quoted version of itself onto the stack
[20:36:57] <tiffany> so it does need to be a quotation for cons
[20:37:12] <tiffany> yeah, it kind of borks everything
[20:37:24] <scott> tiffany: it is in the syntax, but I was thinking about what's actually on the stack
[20:37:24] <tiffany> the abstraction property of lambdas is kind of fundamental in the lambda calculus
[20:37:39] <scott> a quotation also is a thing that just pushes itself on the stack
[20:37:41] <UberLambda> Would a central framework to manage UI events make any sense on a linux box? I was thinking of writing a sort of daemon that could associate an event to some actions
[20:38:02] <UberLambda> E.g. xorg keypress "something" -> launch gui
[20:38:20] <tiffany> I think that already exists
[20:38:37] <scott> hrm
[20:38:42] <scott> tiffany: I think I get it
[20:38:57] <UberLambda> Well I hope this could help with the fragmentation of my configs
[20:39:01] <scott> if the stack is [Num 1, Quot [Call "+"]] in some made up syntax, cons would change it to [Quot [{- thing that pushes Num 1 -}, Call "+"]]
[20:39:06] <UberLambda> one daemon to rule all uis
[20:39:33] *** Joins: mkcp (mkcp@moz-5ln.0t9.55.68.IP)
[20:40:07] <scott> if you can get away with the thing that pushes Num 1 literally being Num 1 then it's no issue
[20:40:19] <scott> but that might not make sense
[20:40:26] <scott> anyway
[20:40:54] <tiffany> yeah
[20:41:09] <tiffany> I wrote a number function which accepts either Number x or Quote [Number x]
[20:41:14] <tiffany> and unwraps it
[20:41:42] <tiffany> downside: doesn't work too well with pattern matching on my stdlib functions

[20:41:50] <tiffany> upside: it works pretty well for semantics
[20:41:52] <scott> that still feels like x vs [x] to me
[20:42:12] *** Joins: UberLambda (uber@moz-g2e3je.clienti.tiscali.it)
[20:42:29] <tiffany> imagine it as a function
[20:42:30] <scott> maybe I would call it Num x on the stack and NumLit x in the syntax/quotations
[20:42:31] <tiffany> 1 = [1]
[20:43:05] <tiffany> does that have any benefits over just using quotes, though?
[20:44:04] <scott> a quotation is a fundamentally different thing in my mind
[20:44:21] <cmr> yay it builds
[20:44:26] <cmr> wow that was tedius
[20:44:33] <cmr> so tedious I forgot how to spell it
[20:44:46] <scott> a function "1 2 +" would be compiled [NumLit 1, NumLit 2, Call "+"] and the stack would go [] => [Num 1] => [Num 1, Num 2] => [Num 3]
[20:45:28] <scott> [1] meaning "Quot [NumLit 1]" would push 1 on the stack when explicitly called
[20:45:52] <scott> Quot [Num 1] seems to be what you meant in "1 = [1]" but I would consider that a type error unless I reimagined my implementation a bit
