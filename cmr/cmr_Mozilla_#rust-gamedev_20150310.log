[05:18:58] <Aaron> I wonder if there are any games I could try out that only use piston/sprite or something.
[05:19:45] <Aaron> It took pretty minimal changes to get working: https://github.com/AerialX/Piston-Tutorials/commit/1a931966c335abb16fb197e5fa8d6527038e8ee5
[05:20:19] <Aaron> (also had to make changes to some opengl crates for webgl support)
[05:23:02] <kvark> Aaron: I don't know any significant opengl_graphics app. rust-snake works with it, but it has gfx-rs as a dependency in order to support run-time switching
[05:23:28] *** Joins: dougxxx (dougxxx@moz-0js00c.iinet.net.au)
[05:24:07] <kvark> It would be awesome to get Hematite running in the browser, but that requires either porting gfx-rs, or rewriting Hematite to use gl-rs directly. Both tasks seem not trivial.
[05:24:26] <Aaron> Yeah, apps that need OpenGL directly would use either gfx-rs or glium I guess. Also they'd probably need some shader changes.
[05:25:15] <kvark> there is also Playform, which doesn't use either gfx-rs or glium. Maybe give that a try?..
[05:25:23] <Aaron> Was just wondering if anything 2D used the sprite crate, since that'd be somewhat abstracted over the graphics backend.
[05:25:56] <kvark> Aaron: ok, then stripping rust-snake out of gfx-rs dependency might be the shortest path
[05:26:08] <Aaron> Cool, might look into it!
[05:26:56] <Aaron> Hematite would definitely be nice, I guess you'd have a better idea than me about what it takes to get gfx-rs working with WebGL/GLES2.0 :P
[05:29:26] <Aaron> The most annoying part seems to be having to change up shaders, really. The rest is usually pretty compatible with OpenGL ~3.1ish.
[05:30:12] <Aaron> Maybe some texture format issues if you rely on some specifics. And if the game does anything async that would have to go...
[05:30:17] <kvark> I haven't looked at our GLES compatibility at all, and I don't believe anyone else did. If it's only about shaders, then this doesn't sound too bad.

[05:32:23] <Aaron> Compile times are kinda long due to the need to use release mode.
[05:32:46] <kvark> why is release required?
[05:33:16] <Aaron> Debug mode spits out incompatible IR.
[05:34:18] <kvark> hmm gfx-rs took less than 10 seconds to compile in release with all the dependencies
[05:34:18] <Aaron> It's finicky because of the need to be compatible with LLVM 3.5
[05:34:38] <Aaron> LTO needs to be enabled too :P
[05:34:46] <kvark> what is it?
[05:36:04] <Aaron> What is what?
[05:36:10] <kvark> LTO
[05:36:17] <Aaron> link time optimization
[05:36:28] <Aaron> In cargo.toml, [profile.release]\nlto = true
[05:36:37] <kvark> huh
[05:37:00] <kvark> does it propagate to dependencies?
[05:37:29] <Aaron> It pulls in dependencies by basically linking everything in and then running the release optimizations on the entire codebase.
[05:37:46] <Aaron> So it's able to inline things cross-crate and such.
[05:38:18] <Aaron> The reason the emscripten stuff requires it is that it's a convenient way to get rustc to spit out a single LLVM IR file of the entire program, which can then be fed to emscripten.
[05:38:38] <kvark> Ah, ok. Thanks for the explanation!
[05:39:02] <Aaron> With lto=true and opt-level=1 the piston tutorial/example takes about 40s to build for me.
[05:39:24] <Aaron> Just the final step, not including all dependencies that cargo's cached.
[05:40:33] <Aaron> Without opt-level=1 (so the default 3) it takes about twice as long. It's somewhat painful to work with, but doable... I'd like to work on not requiring LTO though, and fixing the debug issues.

[13:54:09] <jfo> I'm having a hard time to figure out how to create an alpha texture in glium from Vec<u8> 
[13:54:20] <jfo> could you give a hint how to achieve this?
[13:54:31] <tomaka> there's no "alpha texture" or "color texture"
[13:54:38] <tomaka> you only have the choice between the number of components
[13:55:06] <tomaka> I guess you want a Texture2d and you have just a Vec<u8>?
[13:55:37] <jfo> the problem is more how to create the appriopriate Texture2dDatasource for any raw data
[13:55:39] <jfo> yes
[13:56:10] <tomaka> you can either create a wrapper type and implement Texture2dDataSource on it
[13:56:25] <tomaka> or do some quick & dirty things: https://github.com/tomaka/glium_text/blob/master/src/lib.rs#L186-187
[13:56:43] <tomaka> Texture2dDataSource is implemented on Vec<Vec<u8>>
[13:56:50] <tomaka> so you can turn your Vec<u8> into a Vec<Vec<u8>>
[13:57:00] <tomaka> that's obviously not optimal, but it works

[14:04:03] <tomaka> ok
[14:04:19] <tomaka> beware that OpenGL textures must be uploaded from bottom to top
[14:04:47] <tomaka> make sure that your data is correct, or your texture will be flipped
[14:05:11] <tomaka> on the other hand, it's not really a problem if your texture is flipped as you can just adjust textures coordinates when you draw
[14:05:47] <tomaka> the implementation for Vec<Vec<u8>> automatically flips it

[14:19:09] <jfo> I wondering why you want to want to change the top/bottom origin of textures at all. It's maybe confusing for first time opengl users that tex coordinates have their y coordinates direction opposite to the default view-projection. but then just flip one or the other if they *should* be consistent   
[14:20:30] <tomaka> well, I don't want to write in the docs "all textures are flipped when you use glium"
[14:20:31] <jfo> i mean its not really the business of an opengl abstraction library :)
[14:20:59] <tomaka> for Vec<Vec<>> this is debatable
[14:21:16] <tomaka> for the types of the image library, I prefer if they are like OpenGL expects them to be

[14:28:05] <WindowsBunny> tomaka: I already flip my texture coordinates when drawing images
[14:28:20] <WindowsBunny> so if glium flips the images while loading them, that is gonna confuse me
[14:29:16] <tomaka> well, opengl says "texel 0 is at the bottom-left of the tetxure"
[14:29:34] <tomaka> glium says "if you pass a image::ImageBuffer to glium, it will create a texture from it"
[14:29:38] <jfo> tomaka: but opengl doesnt *expect* it. It's just handy for a case where you, say, have unit quad vertices and want to use the same value for position and texture lookup

[14:29:50] <tomaka> conclusion: "texel 0 is at the bottom-left of the ImageBuffer that you uploaded"
[14:30:06] <WindowsBunny> I just want it to do the most efficient thing
[14:30:29] <tomaka> there's an issue open to load images from bottom-to-top
[14:30:43] <tomaka> jfo: it's just like window coordinates where the -1 y coordinate is at the bottom
[14:31:04] <tomaka> sure you can multiply your output y by -1 and just consider that -1 is at the top
[14:31:21] <tomaka> but taht doesn't remove the fact that in OpenGL the -1 coordinate is that the bottom
[14:33:02] <tomaka> https://github.com/PistonDevelopers/image/issues/258
[14:34:41] <tomaka> I'm not a fanatic of the "y is at the bottom" concept, but the best efficient thing to do is to load your image files from bottom-to-top instead of loading them top-to-bottom and inverting your coordinates
[14:34:49] <tomaka> best and most efficient*

[18:27:20] <Codenator> for example I wont add state true now but render later
[18:29:56] <WindowsBunny> You can to partially initialize a struct?
[18:30:25] <WindowsBunny> Codenator: Rust doesn't allow things to remain undefined
[18:30:33] <Codenator> this is wath I ask about ))
[18:30:40] <Codenator> a ok thanks
[18:30:53] <WindowsBunny> So you'll have to set them to some default value

[18:31:13] <palodequeso> You may want to think about laying out your data initialization differently

[18:31:53] <palodequeso> seems like bad practice though
[18:31:56] <cmr> Partial initialization is fine for as long as any use of it is only reachable through a complete initialization
[18:31:56] <WindowsBunny> if you want to pass myvar to any other functions, it has to be fully initialized by that point
[18:32:03] <cmr> sure.
[18:32:31] <WindowsBunny> cmr: Can you do that for types that impl Drop?
[18:32:38] <palodequeso> WindowsBunny: that makes sesne.
[18:32:39] <cmr> Yep
[18:32:51] <WindowsBunny> cmr: Does it only drop after it is fully initialized?

[21:03:26] <tomaka> I think the stack overflow in glium could maybe have been caused by the fact that I had recursive Arcs
[21:04:08] <tomaka> The Display object stores a Arc<DisplayImpl>, DisplayImpl stores a list of VertexArrayObject, and VertexArrayObject stores a Display

[21:05:13] <tomaka> The loop was broken because destructors of buffers and program destroyed vertex array objects
[21:05:39] <tomaka> but maybe that's the cause of the overflow
[21:05:39] <kmcguire_> soon as rust recompiles i think tomorrow if i can resolve the ice i can actually start testing the patch to ensure that everything works correctly
