[01:55:52] *** Joins: Murarth (Murarth@moz-jpotpi.phnx.qwest.net)
[01:56:16] <bluss> Peach: casts are used to invoke well defined conversions of values. What they compile to depends on the implementation

[01:57:38] <WindowsBunny> Peach: The casts do have an effect when casting between numeric types
[01:57:47] <WindowsBunny> It'll do an actual conversion, and not just reinterpret the bits
[01:58:19] <WindowsBunny> Peach: But for pointers, all pointers in C have the same representation, so it's effectively a no-op
[01:58:34] <bluss> WindowsBunny: that's not strictly true
[01:58:53] <bluss> since the C language allows for pointers to have different representation
[01:59:31] <aatch> On modern general-purpose CPUs, a pointer cast should be a no-op.
[01:59:55] <WindowsBunny> ^
[02:01:02] <aatch> Similarly, on pretty much any system casting between a signed and unsigned integer of the same widths is a no-op
[02:02:16] <aatch> If you can find a (real) CPU that doesn't use two's complement integers, I'll be impressed.
[02:02:26] <WindowsBunny> aatch: Define real
[02:02:57] <WindowsBunny> Perhaps a CPU with at least 1,000 chips sold in the past 10 years?

[03:42:12] <Peach> Can someone explain generators in python and why they're useful?
[03:43:13] <Mutabah> Peach: Iirc, generators are functions that have a "yeild" statement in them
[03:43:50] <Mutabah> They are iterables, and iterate over values returned via the 'yeild' statement (terminating when the function would return)
[03:48:46] <aatch> Peach, generators work by allowing a function to pause and be resumed later.
[03:49:41] <Peach> The language construct of generators just confuses me so much @_@
[03:50:03] <aatch> Peach, when they "pause" they can also produce a value at the same time.
[03:50:43] <Mutabah> Peach: If rust supported them, the function would be translated by the compiler into a struct, with (most) local variables becoming fields on that struct
[03:51:30] <aatch> Peach, it's kinda like the function is returning, but instead of going "I'm done! Here's the answer", it goes "Here's the next bit of the answer, tell me when you need more"

[09:21:31] <Havvy> Lemme guess: Game only wants Japanese players.
[09:21:41] <niconii> pretty much
[09:22:16] <niconii> that's kinda how most japanese browser games seem to go, madoka magica online was the same way

[09:23:15] <niconii> they have servers, but rather than "only this many people can be playing on a server at the same time"
[09:23:16] <aatch> Havvy, I think that's stupid too.
[09:23:58] <niconii> it's "you choose a server permanently, there's a limit based on how many people have ever chosen that server, and that's it"
[09:24:53] <niconii> as soon as a certain number of people have selected that server, no one can join it ever again, even if all but two people stop playing the game forever
[09:25:14] <niconii> it's bizarre
[09:26:46] <niconii> and that also means the game can just... fill up
[09:27:06] <niconii> all of the servers can fill, and then no one can join kancolle ever until they set up more servers
[09:27:33] <niconii> right now all but one are full
[09:28:07] <niconii> rather, that is, no *new* users can join kancolle
[09:28:34] <aatch> niconii, but what if that guy that played once for 20mins 4 years ago decides to come back!
[09:30:09] <niconii> well, he still *could* come back if they just didn't have this silly system and people could just join on demand
[09:30:21] <niconii> it's such a silly way of doing things
[09:32:06] <niconii> especially since kancolle shouldn't even really need more than one or two servers

[13:50:11] <zofrex> what's the middle ground between REST and security when it comes to sensitive data being passed for 'read' requests?
[13:50:25] <zofrex> e.g. you have an endpoint that's like... "Does this credit card exist in our system?" for example
[13:50:34] <zofrex> with REST purity, that should be a GET request
[13:50:52] <zofrex> but the security stance is that you should never pass sensitive data in a GET request
[13:59:35] <Mutabah> zofrex: Well... depends, how sensitive is it in the areas it would be exposed by GET?
[13:59:47] <Mutabah> Logs are probably the only place it matters
[14:00:45] <fmtq> authentication matters a lot.

[14:58:42] <Peach> 5+6+7+8+9 = 7*5
[14:59:51] <Peach> So in a consecutive set -  a+b+c = (The middle number * the length of numbers being summed)
[15:00:08] <Peach> is this true guys? Anyone know about this? Elaine maybe?
[15:00:12] <niconii> well, yeah, in general, (a-b) + (a+b) = 2*a
[15:02:36] <Peach> I'm terrible at math proofs niconii , I don't understand how your example verifies my question : (
[15:02:53] <Havvy> Peach:  Get a: 8 and b: 1
[15:02:56] <niconii> and that'll be (a-n) + ... + (a-1) + a + (a+1) + ... + (a+n) = a + ((a-1) + (a+1)) + ... + ((a-n) + (a+n)) = a + (2*a) * n
[15:03:08] <Havvy> You get 8-1 + 8+1 = 2 * 8
[15:03:15] <Havvy> a.k.a. 7 + 9 = 2 * 8
[15:03:21] <Havvy> So 7 + 9 + 8 = 3 * 8
[15:04:11] <Havvy> It's also the reason that 1+2+...+99+100 = 5050 is knowable by doing (100+1)/2*100

[15:14:53] <zofrex> I can think of a less notation-y way to prove that, Peach
[15:15:11] <zofrex> For any set of numbers, the total of the numbers is "the number of numbers" times by "the average of the numbers"
[15:15:33] <zofrex> And, in any odd-numbered sequence of numbers where each number is +1 the number before it, the average of the sequence is the middle number
[15:17:32] <Peach> Hmmm I think's it's really just the lack of a math cheatsheet for factoring rules etc. zofrex , symbols don't confuse me unless there things like E sumation or "set includes" symbols
[15:18:08] <Peach> ()*+-/ ^= is pretty simple
[15:18:24] <Peach> It's just those durn ungoogleable advanced equations
[15:18:34] <Peach> Like for example, I always wanted to make a path tracer
[15:19:06] <Peach> and then I saw this equation: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendering_equation

[15:19:54] <Peach> Why must sciencey people NEVER use understandable abbrevations for variables?
[15:20:00] <Peach> I think that practice is so evil
[15:21:01] <zofrex> when I do my own maths I often use words instead of letters for that reason
[15:21:16] <zofrex> but once you're used to / familiar with the letters, it is a lot terser to just use letters. you get used to it with repetition.
[15:21:42] <zofrex> also, if you want to make a path tracer, a good way to get started on projects like that is find a university coursework for it that's available online :D
[15:22:07] <Peach> I can't ever ever get used to terseness
[15:22:26] <Peach> Using symbols with actual words makes a ton more sense to me
[15:22:30] <Peach> In CS and in math
[15:23:37] <Peach> (firstnum * middlenum)+(lengthofset) 
[15:24:00] <Peach> is much simpler than like    (x*y)+(gaeh34463ygv)
[15:25:09] <Peach> Ok, so guys, for a programming language syntax,
[15:25:26] <Peach> do you think it's a good idea for casting to look like:
[15:25:30] <Peach> x.int    
[15:25:41] <Peach> instead of   (int*)x   or    x as int
[15:26:15] <niconii> well, my first concern is with floats
[15:26:27] <niconii> how does that work exactly? 1.0.int?
[15:26:50] <Peach> The language will allow literals to be casted like that
[15:27:14] <Peach> design wise I'm not sure if that's a good idea, but I think it's cool :P
[15:27:23] <Peach> "hi".length()
[15:27:23] <niconii> would anything else use the dot syntax? or just casting
[15:27:28] <Peach> anything
[15:27:37] <Peach> 10.cos();
[15:27:44] <Peach> 10.sqrt();
[15:27:50] <niconii> might get a little iffy then
[15:28:06] <Peach> why is that?
[15:28:07] <Havvy> So it's just a special method then?
[15:28:10] <zofrex> you can do that in Rust
[15:28:36] <eddyb> GAH
[15:28:36] <niconii> it's just that if casting and method syntax are too close together, it could get a bit confusing
[15:28:42] <eddyb> Google is useless
[15:28:57] <eddyb> what's the name of that platform for speech recognition and natural language input
[15:29:02] <eddyb> that was demoed recently?
[15:29:21] <Peach> niconni - what about    int(x)   float(x)  ?
[15:29:34] <Peach> * niconii
[15:30:02] <niconii> i think python uses stuff like that
[15:30:18] <niconii> can't say i'm a big fan of it though

[15:38:36] <niconii> i guess the `0 as i32 << 4` one isn't really ideal
[15:40:16] <eddyb> niconii: I forgot what the bad case was
[15:40:33] <eddyb> Peach: that the choice of syntax is problematic
[15:40:59] <eddyb> you have a type at the end of an expression
[15:41:05] <Peach> AH
[15:41:16] <bluss> `if 0 as usize > x`  is ok but `if 0 as usize < x` is not :(
[15:41:28] <eddyb> lol
[15:41:31] <niconii> aha
[15:41:35] <bluss> I guess you don't need to cast 0, but it might a foo instead
[15:41:40] <niconii> yeah, alright
[15:41:43] <eddyb> bluss: that's a worse case than I expected
[15:42:42] <niconii> even so, i dunno it bothers me too much; i have a habit of putting parens around stuff like casting anyway
[15:43:30] <Peach> type(x) is the most compiler friendly way to do stuff
[15:43:44] <eddyb> Peach: except it's a function call
[15:44:11] <eddyb> C++ is complicated
[15:44:23] <eddyb> type(x) is not a cast, is creating a new value based on an existing one
[15:44:36] <eddyb> static_cast<T>(x) is a cast
[15:45:12] <eddyb> I want to see `as` stop being used except for integers and raw pointers
[15:45:18] <eddyb> and even then...
[15:45:24] <eddyb> we now have const fn
[15:45:47] <eddyb> it would be possible to define functions that do the right conversions for integers and raw pointers and also floats
[15:46:05] <niconii> pretty much my main reason for liking `as` is "it looks nice" so

[15:50:59] <Lurkin> Why do we need another language?
[15:51:05] <Lurkin> Curious.
[15:51:20] <Peach> Cause C++ is the only option currently for high performance high level programming Lurkin 
[15:51:25] <Peach> and C++ has confusing syntax
[15:51:36] <Peach> especially for people who just want to make a game
[15:51:50] <Peach> and C is much simpler but has corner gotchas
[15:52:16] <Peach> and both languages have no standard library that let's you do simple things like "open an OpenGL context" cross platform
[15:52:46] <Peach> and I think manually finding SDL etc. just to get input and graphics working is too much of a chore
[15:53:12] <Peach> So it's a fast language that abstracts stuff away so much you don't even need to know most of the libraries you're working with
[15:53:39] <Peach> You just go:   media.openwindow   , set OpenGL context etc.
[15:53:56] <bstrie> Peach: why not jai? :P
[15:54:06] <Peach> Jai is too low level bstrie,
[15:54:18] <bstrie> then why not C#?

[15:54:48] <Peach> cause I'm not making a simple 2D game, I'm making a full complex 3D game
[15:54:56] <Peach> I need full performance
[15:55:28] <bstrie> if you need that kind of performance then you won't be able to avoid low-level features like jai has
[15:56:15] <Peach> The focus of jai isn't high level enough though, I'm making something that does let you get low level but has most of what you need automatically included

[15:57:16] <Peach> Rust is far too complex for high level gamedev, the syntax is not straightforward enough to have someone use it like a scripting language bstrie 
[15:58:11] <zofrex> you can do pretty high level stuff in Rust, it enables decent separation between the nitty gritty low level and the nice to work with high level
[15:58:15] <Peach> and for Jai - Jonnathan Blow himself isn't looking at the big picture, no game dev should ever WANT to try to work with Freetype etc. directly - People want an easy, open source system, batteries included that let's you say:   Here's a font file, make a nice unicode font with tightly packed texture atlas
[15:58:21] <zofrex> for the super high level stuff you probably want to drag in a scripting language, like Lua
[15:58:41] <zofrex> I have an in-progress example using piston for the heavy lifting and javascript for the scripting
[15:59:03] <zofrex> I do not recommend my approach
[15:59:11] <bstrie> Peach: if you just want batteries-included, making an entire language seems like the nuclear option compared to just writing those libraries in a language that already exists
[16:00:10] <Peach> Nope bstrie - the point is not to just bolt on stuff until it works, it's about having one clean interface that interoperates well with itself and has clean syntax throughout
[16:00:25] <Peach> and having good compiler error messages
[16:00:44] <bstrie> do you have a design document?
[16:00:48] <Peach> error messages that are also AWARE of the libraries you're using and give you context sensitive warnings and errors
[16:01:15] <Peach> Yes I do bstrie 
[16:02:04] <Peach> No see the idea is - To have a statically typed full performance language that is AS easy to use as a scripting language but zero performance cost zofrex 
[16:02:21] <bstrie> Peach: can we see the design document?
[16:02:53] <Peach> bstrie: it would be better to see a demonstration :P

[18:47:32] <Tiffany> they tend to perform really poorly unless the original medium has a low signal to noise ratio
[18:48:31] <Tiffany> in some cases you can make them better by applying domain knowledge, to get some real structure out
[18:48:48] <niconii> i think the object in this case is more to produce funny results than convincing ones, though
[18:49:00] <Tiffany> well, what signifies a funny result?
[18:49:31] <Havvy> Something that makes you laught.
[18:49:36] <Havvy> "When the court decides not to hear cases on issues that haven't already internalized functional programming.
[18:49:36] <Havvy> " for instance.
[18:50:06] <Tiffany> I guess I don't find markov bots very funny

[20:04:56] <niconii> it's funny, but at the same time... that's not so bad advice, come to think of it......
[20:07:14] <niconii> you'd probably only want to use it where you actually have a reason to be using their camera though
[20:08:03] <niconii> of all the lame excuses for messing with people's privacy, "we're tracking your eyes to figure out when to run the garbage collector!" is probably one of the worse ones...
[20:10:50] <wrl> the best time to do a GC is "make your gc better"
[20:11:49] <XMPPwocky> you know what i want? /preemptible/ concurrent GC
[20:12:01] <wrl> has anybody done that yet?
[20:12:07] <wrl> also what would a preemptible GC look like?
[20:12:20] <wrl> what in particular would be getting pre-empted
[20:12:35] <XMPPwocky> the actual collection
[20:12:58] <wrl> well, but like
[20:13:00] <XMPPwocky> for consumer stuff, the most noticeable part of collections isn't the hit on throughput, it's the jitters
[20:13:05] <wrl> the sweep phase, then?
[20:13:45] <XMPPwocky> exactly
[20:14:03] <wrl> if the GC is concurrent does that mean it would be running in its own thread?
[20:14:23] <wrl> because, if so, there's no need to make the sweep pre-emptible, the GC thread can just free things at its leisure and that shouldn't tie up the other threads
[20:14:47] <XMPPwocky> hm, that's right
[20:15:10] <wrl> but putting the GC in its own thread complicates the mark phase
[20:15:15] <wrl> at least, that's my understanding
[20:15:48] <XMPPwocky> like, even if you need a write barrier, which hurts perf
[20:16:18] <XMPPwocky> avoiding stopping the world is, i suspect, pretty noticeable just in ui responsiveness
[20:17:19] <XMPPwocky> i /suspect/ some of this is why android still feels much worse than iOS devices with the same hardware perf. even though ARC can sometimes be deferred, it's not stopping updates

[21:40:33] <Lurkin> Do you read rust left to right.
[21:40:39] <Lurkin> Or like C
[21:40:43] <Elaine> left to right.

[21:42:42] <Elaine> or have questions?
[21:43:43] <Lurkin> No I just need to keep failing I think, just been a month and I don't feel like I've gotten anywhere.
[21:44:23] *** Joins: Binero (Binero@moz-rp278g.access.telenet.be)
[21:44:25] <Lurkin> I don't know any languages, just trying to build some sort of ftp
[21:44:45] <Elaine> oh!
[21:44:54] <Elaine> well, good luck :) it's a lot of fun once you get the hang of it
[21:45:36] <Lurkin> Thanks :)
[21:46:11] <brandonson> bluss: that's not quite true, is it?  won't u64 as u8 fail if the value is too large?
[21:46:17] <fkaa> it's the funnest language i've worked with :)
[21:46:29] <fkaa> beats trying to jungle dependencies in c++
[21:46:30] <brandonson> ahh, it had been days since I did that, too
[21:46:44] <bluss> brandonson: that conversion is well defined for the whole range
[21:47:13] <bluss> brandonson: but sure, I'm not sure it's 100% true but integer casts are not checked or panicking in any way right now
[21:48:08] <fkaa> barosl: who is the kawaii person on homu's profile?
[21:48:27] <mbrubeck> playbot: (0./0.) as u8
[21:48:28] -playbot- 0
[21:48:46] <Tiffany> niconii: running the facial recognition to see when the user is looking would probably cause so much GC throughput as to defeat the point, heh
[21:48:47] <mbrubeck> playbot: (1./0.) as u8
[21:48:48] -playbot- 0
[21:48:53] <mbrubeck> fascinating
[21:48:53] <bluss> mbrubeck: hm that's one of the bad ones right
[21:49:11] <bluss> mbrubeck: integer to float casts have serious problems :(
[21:49:14] <bluss> to/from
[21:49:44] <Tiffany> xmppwocky: I'd rather have per-thread GC, and then spam threads
[21:49:46] <mbrubeck> Well, that was pretty much what I expected to get.  Anything else would have been more surprising.
[21:50:12] <Tiffany> I imagine very tiny heaps are easy to GC quickly
[21:50:18] <bluss> mbrubeck: no, rust may be allowing this unsafely
[21:50:26] <Tiffany> latency would be a minimum, and you'd never stop the world
[21:50:54] <bluss> mbrubeck: see https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/tackling-undefined-behaviour-casts/2263  it's tricky and probably a memory safety hole in rust
[21:52:49] <mbrubeck> ouch
[21:56:12] <Lurkin> For opening a file is it better to use std::fs::File or nix::fnctl::open
[21:58:12] <mbrubeck> Lurkin: File is a portable high-level API that works with Rust's Read and Write traits.  That's what I'd normally use.
[21:58:47] <mbrubeck> Use nix if you need to do something Unix-specific that the standard API doesn't support.
[21:59:26] <Lurkin> Ok I will absolutely use File but for the sake of wondering are they the same thing called in different ways?
[22:00:25] <mbrubeck> Lurkin: On Unixy platforms, File::open and nix::fcntl::open both call the libc `open` function under the hood, yes.
[22:02:02] <Lurkin> Thanks, you've just blown my mind.

[22:10:33] <Elaine> hm, strange.
[22:11:19] <Layl> could anyone suggest an audiobook on audible similar to Ghost in the Wires?
[22:11:51] <mbrubeck> Finally, something actually offtopic.
[22:12:15] <Elaine> haha
[22:14:43] <brandonson> semi-offtopic: compiler warnings for tab characters are a little ridiculous
[22:15:07] <Layl> so, anyone got a suggestion?
[22:16:22] <mbrubeck> Audible doesn't have The Cuckoo's Egg...
[22:17:24] <Layl> I don't think that's at all available in audiobook form
[22:18:11] <mbrubeck> Maybe http://www.audible.com/pd/Nonfiction/No-Place-to-Hide-Audiobook/B00MEL9RTI ? I haven't read it.
[22:22:35] <Layl> hm, is that a book following someone on the red team in a similar way to ghost in the wires?
[22:22:47] <Layl> looks like it but I can't entirely make it out from the preview
