[00:01:22] <Tiffany> it looks like the encrypted static key is failing to decrypt for some reason

[00:10:45] <eternaleye> Tiffany:     whispering, murmuring, or rustling; "the susurrus of the stream"
[00:10:58] <eternaleye> Tiffany: To me, that reads more like any form of "white noise"
[00:11:41] <eternaleye> Tiffany: Similarly, continuous quiet sounds are sometimes referred to as "low-level background noise"
[00:18:26] <Tiffany> why does ed25519 exist?
[00:18:55] <Tiffany> can't you just take a curve25519 keypair, swap it around, and use the public key to sign and private key to verify?
[00:19:08] <bascule> Tiffany: no?
[00:19:14] <Tiffany> why not?
[00:19:15] <bascule> you'd need the shared secret to verify
[00:19:30] *** Joins: erickt_ (erickt@moz-4hh.6p3.217.74.IP)
[00:19:44] <bascule> if you have the shared secret, you can make arbitrary ciphertexts that are authentic

[00:20:01] <bascule> you arrive at a symmetric secret, and the goal is for it to be asymmetric ;)
[00:20:39] <Tiffany> RSA keys can be used to sign, can't they?
[00:20:42] <bascule> yes
[00:20:45] <bascule> slowly
[00:20:46] <bascule> heh
[00:21:05] <bascule> you can use PKCS#1v1.5 (ugh) or PSS (better!) for RSA signatures

[00:26:37] <eternaleye> Tiffany: RSA being capable of signing by reversing is a property of RSA, not of asymmetric crypto in general
[00:26:50] <eternaleye> Tiffany: Not only does it not hold universally; it's actually exceedingly rare
[00:27:29] <Tiffany> yeah, I guess I had that confused
[00:27:40] <Tiffany> I don't understand EC very well

[01:08:43] <Tiffany> huh
[01:09:05] <Tiffany> how does converting from one form to another in the case of curve25519 -> ed25519 work?
[01:11:21] *** Joins: skeuomorf (skeuomorf@moz-a3f.lok.32.197.IP)
[01:11:42] <bascule> Tiffany: curve25519 -> ed25519 works fine, but ed25519 -> curve25519 potentially loses the sign
[01:12:08] <bascule> which is annoying, because ed25519 keys are usually generated from a "seed"
[01:12:32] <bascule> Trevor Perrin suggested a reformulation of EdDSA to avoid that, but I'd just suggest making sure your Ed25519 keys are always positive, then it won't be a problem

[16:36:21] <bascule> Ilari: people could actually try to implement them? ;)
[16:41:14] <Ilari> I don't see much nastyness implementation-wise, other than the inappopriate blinding in Dan Brown's scheme and the hash extension in DJB&co scheme.
[16:47:53] <bascule> heh
[16:49:19] <Ilari> Well, if one (thinks he) has constant-time inversion, one can just skip all blinding in DB scheme. Of course, that's slow, and relies on the fact that the inversion is actually constant-time...
[17:02:03] <Ilari> And well, I don't see much difference between Dan Brown's scheme and just plain ECDSA with deterministic generation of k.

[19:19:41] <Ilari> And what scares me about TLS 1.3 is handshake restart and 0-RTT data transmission.
[19:28:19] <Tiffany> anyone have something to say about tox?
[19:28:20] <Tiffany> it looks nice
[19:37:14] <Tiffany> oh..
[19:37:18] <Tiffany> I'm looking at the protocol docs
[19:37:22] <Tiffany> and they're really awful
[19:37:33] <Tiffany> I don't think it has forward secrecy, but it's hard to tell, because the documentation is terrible
[19:39:41] *** Joins: vks (quassel@moz-ftij2a.pools.vodafone-ip.de)
[19:51:24] <Ilari> And it has screwed up key exchange too?
[19:53:46] <Tiffany> it looks like they use crypto_box with only slightly-ephemeral keys
[19:53:59] <Tiffany> the keys last for the length of a "session" which is of an unspecified length and may be arbitrarily large
[19:54:28] <Tiffany> they, of course, call this "perfect forward secrecy"
[19:58:54] <vks> Tiffany: Who are you talking about?
[19:59:40] <Tiffany> vks: tox is supposed to be a sort of peer to peer skype replacement, and I am skeptical of their crypto
[20:02:08] <vks> Tiffany: Are you going to open an issue on their github?
[20:13:41] <Tiffany> I don't know, maybe
[20:14:07] <Tiffany> there's already an issue closed in 2013 where someone asked about perfect forward secrecy and they claimed to already have it
[20:14:15] <Tiffany> I might bump that issue with some proper questions
[20:14:43] <Tiffany> as far as I can tell, they keep the ephemeral keys around for the length of the session, in contrast to what noise does, where it throws them away after the handshake

[21:15:35] <Ilari> RLWE is pretty fast, but has quite large keys, and is based on lattices, which seem bit suspect at the moment.
[21:16:36] <Tiffany> do I need to start a new git repository in order to add simple command line tools to access the functionality in my library?
[21:16:51] <Tiffany> I'm not really sure what cargo can and can't do
[21:18:21] <Ilari> At least there are path dependicies.
[21:18:34] <Ilari> So multiple crates can live in a single git repo.
