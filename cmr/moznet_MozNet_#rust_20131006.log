[01:14:24] <ractchet> Hello currently I use c# at work for most of the code I write. I am looking at a new language to pick up and play around with. Should I be concerned about rust changing a lot  between now and version 1.0. Enough to break my code to the point one of my toy projects would be dead or anything like that.

[01:42:18] <Eridius> thanks
[01:42:27] <SiegeLord> Did C types used to be in the prelude?
[01:43:08] <Eridius> no
[01:43:55] <SiegeLord> Not even back in pre 0.1 Rust?
[01:44:19] <Eridius> well I just did a `git log -Slibc --follow -- prelude.rs` and saw nothing interesting
[01:44:27] <Eridius> there used to be a `pub use libc;`, but that's not very helpful
[01:45:09] <Eridius> why do you ask?
[01:45:41] <SiegeLord> Just wondering why some things got included in the syntax files
[01:46:01] <Eridius> SiegeLord: because they're common types that are commonly `use`'d

[04:32:29] <tiffany> which means defining a struct separately and then wrapping it with something with a slightly different name in the enum
[04:32:30] <tiffany> which irks me

[04:33:12] <SiegeLord> It's one thing to say that maybe the feature is unnecessary, it's another to say "maybe they are buggy, we're not sure"
[04:33:47] <tiffany> it'd be nice if enums had anonymous values
[04:33:59] <Eridius> what do you mean?
[04:34:29] <tiffany> like, instead of struct Foo {...} enum Bar {FooT(Foo)} I could use enum Bar{Foo}
[04:35:01] <tiffany> wrapping it in a name is only useful if the original type doesn't fully describe it (but it does in this case) or you intend to use the type multiple times

[04:43:48] <SiegeLord> Hmm, this is interesting
[04:43:57] <SiegeLord> So text editors support all sorts of line endings
[04:44:02] <SiegeLord> But rust only supports LF
[04:44:26] <SiegeLord> So you can have a program that appears to have code, but is actually all commented out
[04:45:07] <SiegeLord> I wonder how I should approach this from a syntax highlighting point of view
[04:45:21] <Eridius> yeah, it is kind of odd that rust only obeys LF, but this was brought up sometime in the past few weeks IIRC and it was decided to leave it like that
[04:45:24] <Eridius> not sure why
[04:45:53] <Eridius> SiegeLord: given how most editors seem to syntax-highlight on a per-line basis instead of as one massive string, I'm not sure you can solve this in an editor
[04:46:20] <SiegeLord> Well, in this case I'm writing the lexer myself... so I can do whatever
[04:46:28] <Eridius> what are you writing?

[06:34:54] <thewonderidiot> I'm thinking about trying to do a basic plugin system using std::unstable::DynamicLibrary. I'm assuming I'll need to put #[no_mangle] on the functions I want to be able to find
[06:35:18] <Eridius> thewonderidiot: maybe make them extern "C"?
[06:35:25] <thewonderidiot> but I'm curious if there's a way to make the plugins all see a common Trait definition -- say I want them to all implement the same interface
[06:35:35] <Eridius> have that trait be defined in a library they all link to?
[06:36:05] <thewonderidiot> alright, was wondering if there was a better way to do that than dedicating an entire shared library to a trait definition
[06:36:37] <Eridius> well it has to be something they can all link to. I don't see an alternative
[06:37:08] <Eridius> I mean theoretically weak linking is an alternative to having something to link against, but I don't see how to make that work with Rust

[06:41:20] <Eridius> if the API for your plugin uses built-in types or types from std/extra, then there's no problem
[06:41:38] <Eridius> but if your API wants to use types defined in your program, the plugin has to be able to see the same types somehow, which to me means the type has to be defined in a shared library
[06:41:58] <cmr> Yup, makes sense.
[06:42:01] <thewonderidiot> right.

[06:45:41] <cmr> plugins are for external projects that want to hook into it.
[06:45:43] <cmr> (ie, rustle)
[06:46:25] <cmr> that's the only project that approached me about hooking into rustdoc, so I added the plugins :p
[06:46:26] <dbaupp> cmr: hah; I pushed a commit that made the pulling configurable: `"pull_from": {"name": "mozilla", "branch": "master"}` in the config should replace the old hardcoded behaviour

[11:31:20] <maik> just try to move only chan into a cell
[11:32:23] <cuttle> ok
[11:33:07] <maik> its probably let c = std::cell::Cell::new(chan); and then c.get();
[11:33:13] <kimundi> cuttle: I'm not entirely sure but I think the problem is: lex takes chan by value, which means it would get moved the first time the spawn-function gets called. Because the function that spawn takes can in principle be called multible times, this is forbidden, because it wouldn't have a chan to move into lex the second time
[11:33:44] <cuttle> ah
[11:33:47] <cuttle> should I change pub fn lex(input : ~str, output : Chan<Token>) {
[11:33:57] <cuttle> to pub fn lex(input : &str, output : Chan<Token>) {
[11:34:03] <cuttle> or something
[11:34:07] <dbaupp> maik: (it's c.take(), btw)
[11:34:28] <dbaupp> cuttle: yes, if you don't need ownership of `input` then &str is better

[11:34:51] <dbaupp> also, you can use `do std::task::spawn_with(chan) |chan| { ... }` to avoid the move error
[11:34:55] <dbaupp> (and yes, that would work)
[11:35:09] <dbaupp> https://github.com/mozilla/rust/wiki/Doc-under-construction-FAQ#once-functions contains a discription btw
[11:35:21] <kimundi> The workaround is to use Cell, which is basically a container where you can put antype into and out. You put chan into a cell, and in the spawn-function you take it out again and pass it to lex. Then it works the first time it gets called, because the cell did contain a chan, and should it ever be called twice, which won'T happen with spawn, it would raise an runtime failure because the cell became empty

[11:36:29] <cuttle> ok cool, thanks
[11:38:07] <cuttle> cool, it works now
[11:38:46] <kimundi> Is there any working way right now to cast a traitobject to an traitobject of a supertrait?
[11:39:25] <kimundi> Like: trait Foo {}; trait Bar: Foo {}; &Bar -> &Foo
[11:39:33] <strcat> kimundi: doubt it, because trait objects aren't considered as implementing the trait(s)
[11:39:38] <strcat> would need a special case
[11:40:44] <kimundi> Not talking about them implementing the trait, just construct a new trait object based on another one
[11:42:52] <dbaupp> how are the vtables of parent-traits represented in child trait objects?
[11:43:17] <strcat> not properly ;p
[11:43:18] <cuttle> is taking a Chan<Option<T>> a recommended way to have a stream of things that eventually stops?
[11:43:35] <strcat> trait inheritance doesn't fully work with trait objects
[11:43:58] <kimundi> Hm... I wounder if I can fake it... The compiler knows the memory layout of both vtables... If I construct a temporary &Foo object on the stack, replace the &self pointer in it with the pointer form a &Bar, and transmute the lifetime to match the &Bar... Hey that could work!
[11:44:47] <dbaupp> cuttle: you can just close it (by moving it out of scope), and the Port should be calling .try_recv which gives None when the stream is closed.
[11:45:00] <cuttle> oh, try_recv

[12:58:15] <doomlord_> dbaupp - from what i knew the layering possible should work: i thought another library can define a trait for operations, and impl that for another crates type. thats enough to get data interoperability?
[12:59:23] <dbaupp> it won't get you overloading
[12:59:27] <dbaupp> (operator overloadign)
[12:59:38] <doomlord_> the idea was that you *could* structure a complete 'standard vector maths library' (for libextra) this way, but then other libraries could either be refactored to use the same underlying type, or impl the data accessors
[13:00:29] <doomlord_> ^impl the standard data accessors for their own types.. whatever they yse

[13:15:06] <lhk> the rust website advertises compatibility with c++
[13:15:17] <lhk> is this a goal or a fully implemented feature
[13:15:28] <lhk> i would like to use qt with rust
[13:15:43] <doomlord_> thats a stretch :(
[13:15:52] <lhk> do you know of any drawbacks or problems ?
[13:15:55] <doomlord_> its highly interoperable with *C*
[13:16:19] <doomlord_> its hard to make C++ bindings because the type system is different 
[13:16:44] <doomlord_> C++ libraries use templates and overloading that can't translate directly
[13:17:09] <brson> lhk: that section is under 'compilation model', it's not really implying anything about the ffi, but more that developing Rust is like developing C, vs. something like python
[13:17:26] <brson> it should probably be removed though. it's misleading
[13:17:35] <brson> all the copy on rust-lang.org needs rewriting
[13:17:50] <lhk> hm, that's a pity
[13:18:02] <brson> lhk: but to answer your question, Rust can't yet call C++ directly
[13:18:03] <lhk> the language looks really beautiful and i would have been glad to get rid of c++
[13:18:04] <doomlord_> if you can make C bindings with swig...
[13:18:31] <lhk> sure, creating bindings would be possible
[13:18:33] <doomlord_> i've experimented with limited C++ bindings but no way would it handle Qt
[13:18:42] <brson> In the future we'll probably have the capability to inline C++ into rust, but still probably not call C++ directly. More likely we'll be able to generate C swig bindings, call those from Rust, then inline it all
[13:19:03] <lhk> im afraid, i will stick with c++ then

[18:24:51] <tacoman> cmr: thanks. is the core language still changing a lot, or is it mostly the stdlib?
[18:25:00] <rust_noob> cmr: thanks! is this going to change a lot in the next few months?
[18:25:03] <cmr> tacoman: mostly stdlib, but there are still changes to come to the core language.
[18:25:10] <cmr> rust_noob: probably not too much.
[18:25:17] <rust_noob> ok, nice!
[18:25:27] <tautologico> the language feels much more stable now than when I looked at it (about pre-0.6)
[18:25:46] <nejucomo> Is there a 10k foot view of expected changes for 0.9 and 1.0 to the language (not stdlibs) ?
[18:25:55] <nejucomo> Oh, maybe there are github milestones...
[18:26:00] * nejucomo checks.
[18:26:12] <tautologico> I think 1.0 is not right after 0.9
[18:26:17] <cmr> nejucomo: privacy, closure reform, maybe DST.
[18:26:20] <cmr> tautologico: correct.
[18:26:26] <cmr> nejucomo: those are the ones I know of
[18:27:08] <cmr> rust_noob: see also https://github.com/steveklabnik/ruby.rs
[18:27:14] <nejucomo> Hm.  The GH milestones are more abstract than I expected.
[18:28:05] <nejucomo> tautologico: Yeah, I assumed there would be the typical asymptotic approach to 1.0.  ;-)
[18:28:45] <nejucomo> Oh, there is a 0.9 milestone…  I just didn't see it because GH filters milestones with no associated issues.
[18:29:09] <cmr> Issues are tagged for releases later in the cycle, to keep track of what people want to accomplish for the release.

[18:42:01] <SiegeLord> Thanks
[18:42:02] <spott> I've found a bug in the compiler

[18:42:28] <tjc> spott: I think this is a known bug, but let me double-check
[18:42:33] <tjc> still happy to hear your question in general!
[18:42:46] <spott> I don't think that the rust code SHOULD compile cleanly, but it probably shouldn't die.
[18:42:52] <flaper87> acrichto: are you familiar with the HomeIo code ?
[18:43:03] <cmr> spott: the problem is that the 'self lifetime isn't defined anywhere.
[18:43:10] <spott> ah

[18:44:52] <flaper87> acrichto: do you know if it is possible to run a timer without descheduling ? It would involved changing the home and then start the watcher
[18:45:08] <spott> but I can't think of anything that needs to be done much better.
[18:46:16] <acrichto> flaper87: from what I understand a timer needs to talk to libuv to do anything and to do that it's gotta be on the home scheduler.
[18:46:27] <spott> I just wanted to make sure that I submitted everything that was needed by you guys to understand the bug.
[18:47:28] <flaper87> acrichto: correct. The part I'd like to get rid of is the `deschedule_running_task_and_then` which is what all libuv ops use right now
[18:47:44] <spott> cmr: so, I'm still struggling with lifetimes, they seem to be treated like types (inside the <>), so I keep thinking that they should be inferred
[18:48:04] <spott> which I assume they are, but just not always
[18:48:41] <acrichto> flaper87: hmm I'm not sure I understand the question, everything deschedules because some callback *should* get called at some point to reawaken the thread
[18:50:01] *** Joins: nsf (nsf@moz-EEF3238A.convex.ru)
[18:51:12] <flaper87> acrichto: correct, and that just works. Thing is that for the SelectInner implementation of UvTimer, I need a way to start the libuv watcher without having to deschedule the current task. That will allow the task to then block on a port.recv and the timer itself and resume as soon as one of them wakes the task again
[18:51:18] <flaper87> hope that makes more sense
[18:51:20] <tautologico> there are many situations where the compiler can't guarantee the lifetime of a particular object
[18:52:10] <acrichto> flaper87: yeah sorry I don't think I'll be much help here :(
[18:52:15] <acrichto> I need to learn more of the runtime code
[18:52:28] <flaper87> acrichto: no worries, I'll play with it more and then share my findings

[18:53:05] <fhahn> hi, I'm wondering if there is a limit for the fractional part of a f64? f64.to_str() seems to only return 8 fractional numbers
[18:53:19] <cmr> fhahn: probably just a deficiency in our to_str
[18:53:34] <cmr> StrConv, the code that does that, is... scary

[20:35:46] <spott> ah, nevermind

[20:36:40] <aatch> myname, yeah, I just made the comparison for the sake of size.
[20:36:40] <spott> the flipside of that is that you don't assume 1.0 is f64 and not let it be downconverted to f32
[20:37:14] <spott> you don't say anything about 1.0, and figure out the type later by inference

[20:41:36] <JakeDust> is it possible to call fortran shared libraries from Rust (i.e. BLAS/LAPACK), or I'd have to use the C interfaces (CBLAS/CLAPACK)?
[20:42:07] <aatch> JakeDust, Rust currently only supports the C ABI
[20:42:13] <aatch> for externals
[20:42:15] <engla> spott: it's only wise to keep char separate from the integer types
[20:42:18] <tikue_> rusti: ~"ACTION".starts_with("ACTION")
[20:42:18] -rusti- ~true
[20:42:21] <spott> but 'h' is either u8, u16, u32, etc,
[20:42:29] <engla> right 'h' is always char
[20:42:49] <spott> but 'h' is in the ascii, u8, u16, etc charater set
[20:43:09] <aatch> spott, unicode is complicated, and 'char' in rust is a unicode codepoint
[20:43:25] <engla> it's just a separate type spott 
[20:43:51] <aatch> there may be entries for 'h' in lots of character sets, but in Rust, we use the representation from Unicode

[20:45:10] <engla> :)
[20:45:24] <spott> sorry, it just seems inconsistent to fix 'h' to a type, but not 1.0, or 1.
[20:45:35] <spott> oh well
[20:45:40] <aatch> spott, think of it as fixed to a type class
[20:45:58] <aatch> 1 is always an integer, 1.0 is always floating point and 'h' is always a character
[20:46:10] <spott> aatch: I think fortran function calls use the C ABI 
[20:46:13] <aatch> it's to do with semantics.
[20:46:14] <engla> and they only mix by explicit casts
[20:47:20] <aatch> semantically, it doesn't matter if 1 is in an i8, i16, u32 or whatever unless you hit the limits of the type (which rust does try to warn about/prevent)

[20:49:34] <aatch> spott, that's the point. By making it a seperate type, you can't do things like arithmetic
[20:50:06] <aatch> we don't fix it to 'char' we fix it to a character type. It's just that there is only one option.

[21:53:19] <aatch> bstrie, to be honest, that's why I abandoned D. I mean, I don't hate C++, but D didn't seem to add much.
[21:53:29] <lkuper_> Someone asked me what we had that D didn't, recently
[21:53:45] <aatch> lkuper_, plenty. CTFE is a major one.
[21:53:49] <lkuper_> and I've never looked closely at D, but pattern matching was the first immediate thing that came to mind
[21:53:54] <doomlord_> safety without GC, right ?
[21:53:56] <bstrie> aatch: other way around :P
[21:54:01] <myname> pattern matching <3
[21:54:04] <aatch> bstrie, just noticed that
[21:54:20] <doomlord_> CTFE=?
[21:54:22] <myname> if you ever drop pattern matching, i'll immediatly leave
[21:54:32] <aatch> doomlord_, compile-time function execution
[21:54:35] <lkuper_> aatch: without googling that, I'm trying to guess...compile-time something something?
[21:54:35] <myname> doomlord_: are we talking at now?
[21:54:36] <lkuper_> aha
[21:54:48] <bstrie> myname: GOOD WE HATE PATTERN MATCHING, WE'RE REMOVING IT NEXT WEEK. GTFO!!!
[21:54:56] <bstrie> myname: j/k we're ML nerds
[21:55:05] <lkuper_> aatch: as in macros, or as in some partial-evaluation optimization thing?
[21:55:10] <sp3d> the latter
[21:55:21] <aatch> what sp3d said.
[21:55:28] <cmr> what aatch said
[21:55:43] <bstrie> lkuper_: CTFE is to D as memory safety is to rust
[21:55:53] <aatch> But combined with a couple other D features you can do some awesome things.
[21:55:56] <sp3d> imo CTFE is a poor excuse for a proper staged language--a half-baked implementation just adds significant mental complexity to actually using the compile-time execution features, but you can't really *rely* on it for program structure the way you could in a staged language
[21:56:21] <lkuper_> bstrie: wait, what?

[21:57:15] <aatch> sp3d, true, and I think that Rust's syntax extensions allow for a lot of advantages. Especially when we eventually have compiler-plugins
[21:57:28] <lkuper_> so CTFE is super-important to D folks?
[21:57:34] <sp3d> honestly, I don't think rust really has anything in its toolset for dealing with the problems that staged languages do
[21:57:40] <lkuper_> but the question was, "what does Rust have that D doesn't?"
[21:57:55] <aatch> lkuper_, I know. I mis-read and accidentally de-railed
[21:58:00] * aatch is sorry
[21:58:04] <lkuper_> ah!
[21:58:08] <sp3d> *but* it doesn't attempt to, so perhaps such a thing is orthogonal enough to bolt on later without too much bloodshed
[21:58:28] <bstrie> lkuper_: to answer your actual question, D is just as memory-unsafe and data-racey as C++
[21:58:39] * lkuper_ nods.
[21:58:41] <sp3d> syntax extensions do cover some of the cases I guess, but more as a way to avoid CPP macros
[21:58:45] <bstrie> lkuper_: also, their only guarantee of memory safety is via GC
[21:58:56] <SiegeLord> Well, in principle D has a safe subset...
[21:59:22] <aatch> lkuper_, decent closure support, from my memory, D's support is... lacking.
[21:59:27] <lkuper_> so for this crowd, I probably don't need to make a list of things Rust has that D doesn't
[21:59:47] <bstrie> lkuper_: but yeah, D also has a lot of things that rust doesn't have
[21:59:54] <SiegeLord> It's opt-in though, and as bstrie said, requires GC
[21:59:55] <bstrie> the typical classes and inheritance setup, etc
[22:00:10] <bstrie> really really robust CTFE support
[22:00:19] <bstrie> for people who aren't satisfied with C++ templates
[22:00:20] <lkuper_> but, aside from pattern matching, the other things that came to mind were (local, anyway) type inference, typeclasses, default methods...
[22:00:25] <doomlord_> is there a FAQ for rust-skeptics perhaps.   "What does Rust do that D doesn't."  "What does Rust do that C++11 doesn't" etc
[22:00:35] <lkuper_> and then I realized that all the things I was listing were things that Haskell has
[22:00:36] <sp3d> don't forget Go
[22:00:39] <bstrie> haha
[22:00:46] <aatch> To be honest, I do prefer traditional class-based OOP
[22:01:00] <SiegeLord> Typeclasses is another thing, although D has something similar to C++ concepts
[22:01:13] <SiegeLord> It's not the same thing, and is also opt-in
[22:01:19] <lkuper_> but this turned out to be exactly the right thing to say to be convincing, because she was a haskell programmer 
[22:01:39] <aatch> lkuper_, also, D does have local type inference the same way C++ does (now)
[22:01:43] <bstrie> lkuper_: does haskell not do function level type inference?

[22:02:18] <bstrie> like me some function sigs

[22:59:18] <bjz> I can imagine its the same for linux folks
[22:59:30] <dandy> bjz, is that because of mac or because of unit though?
[22:59:33] <dandy> unity*
[22:59:34] <bjz> myname: ^_^
[22:59:35] <tiffany> my game engine only runs on linux and OS X right now
[22:59:39] <eevee> i'm on linux and it's a little less encouraging to see indie titles boast "cross-platform!  download here for windows, here for mac"
[22:59:41] <jeaye> tiffany: :)
[22:59:41] <aatch> myname, I like simulation games, so you don't always need decent AI
[22:59:44] <bjz> dandy: unity probably
[22:59:50] <aatch> myname, Kerbal Space Program for example
[22:59:50] <bjz> dandy: and mono

[23:01:45] <aatch> myname, I wouldn't mind attempting a DF-like. Though I am well aware that matching Toady-one's efforts is a non-goal
[23:01:52] <eevee> i keep dabbling with the rather more ambitious amulet
[23:01:55] <eevee> maybe more today
[23:02:07] <myname> jeaye: i got hooked up un termbox a bit and i made some simple bindings already, but good to know people work on ncurses

[23:02:51] <myname> aatch: well, i would do it if i have some good ideas on what to make different

[23:04:23] <aatch> Toning down a lot of the extraneous stuff and making it possible to run a fortress more efficiently
[23:06:08] <aatch> Basically, keep the difficulty, just add more tools. So it's easier to see why dwarves might be killing each other, some things to help ease up on the micromanagement
[23:06:39] <aatch> Especially micromanagement of basic details like food and drink stocks.
[23:07:53] <myname> well, dfhack and dwarftherapist are helping a lot
[23:08:05] <myname> bad thing, at least the later doesn't work via ssh
[23:11:06] <jeaye> I've considered making a multiplayer nethack. 
[23:11:22] <myname> a roguelike came in my mind, too
[23:11:33] <myname> but i am lacking good ideas there, too
[23:11:41] <Amaranth> jeaye: I thought Morrowind, Oblivion, and Skyrim all use the same content formats
[23:11:48] * myname has pretty low vreativity
[23:11:48] <Amaranth> For models, scripts, etc
[23:11:49] <myname> *c
[23:11:59] <jeaye> Amaranth: No clue.
[23:12:04] <Amaranth> So OpenMW is probably a relatively simple conversion away from being OpenSky
[23:12:27] <jeaye> I know that Skyrim did a 100% rewrite of their renderer.
[23:12:31] <aatch> myname, my problem isn't ideas, it's having the focus to sit down and implement them.

[23:13:03] <myname> it may be the next semester
[23:13:04] <cmr> I have a really cool idea but it involves incredibly complex maths to implement, and it's beyond my grasp of understanding.
[23:13:16] <Amaranth> jeaye: I'm pretty sure that's right, the tools for modding and mod management and directory layouts and such are very similar and people were using Oblivion tools to make Skyrim mods before the construction kit was released.
[23:13:17] <myname> but usueally, most of the time i'm busy doing nothing
[23:13:19] <Earnestly> jeaye: Skyrim used Gamebryo with some additions for dragon events 
[23:13:20] <jeaye> cmr: Sounds neat. Let's do it.
[23:13:32] <myname> cmr: share it
[23:13:35] <Amaranth> Earnestly: I'm pretty sure Skyrim is a custom engine
[23:13:47] <cmr> jeaye: I'm going to be prototyping it sometime in this year ;)
[23:14:01] <cmr> myname: I can't explain it succicintly, it'd probably take a good 10-15 minutes

[23:14:45] <aatch> myname, I tend to start out and work out a basic plan, realise that it'll take a long time to get all the stuff in place before I get to what I actually want to do and lose all motivation.
[23:15:03] <jeaye> cmr: ncurses-rs is fully implemented now. I'm just writing a few more examples.
[23:15:09] <Earnestly> Amaranth: Same as Gamebryo with some tweaks, renamed Creation
[23:15:13] <cmr> jeaye: Oh no, it's graphical.
[23:15:23] <jeaye> cmr: I mean for TWiR
[23:15:29] <cmr> Oh
[23:15:31] <cmr> Heh
[23:15:35] <jeaye> :D
[23:15:43] <jeaye> cmr: Is it 3D?
[23:15:48] <myname> aatch: i make it that way: get euphoric, start implementing fancy stuff, come to something that is neccessary but really really boring, drop the whole project
[23:15:50] <cmr> That reminds me, anyone have announcements or projects for TWiR?
[23:16:01] <doomlord_> TWiR=?
[23:16:07] <Earnestly> Amaranth: Run strings over TESV.exe :p
[23:16:08] <doomlord_> ThisWeekInRUst
[23:16:10] <doomlord_> ok
[23:16:34] <cmr> jeaye: no. the gist of it is a 2d space shooter, but instead of playing on a plane, you're playing on a projection of a net of a mesh that can be shaped by players, but they can't actually see the mesh, only experience the effects of the projection.
[23:16:41] <Amaranth> Earnestly: It's got enough improvements I guess they can get away with calling it custom
[23:16:42] <cmr> Something to do with manifolds
[23:16:50] <cmr> And potentially noneuclidean geometry
[23:16:59] <doomlord_> hehe
[23:17:08] <Earnestly> Amaranth: Oh yes, gamebryo, since like Oblivion/Morrowind has recieved loads of updates and features.
[23:17:16] <myname> it sounds disgusting and amazing at the same time

[23:17:24] <myname> i approve
[23:17:57] <myname> aatch: i thought about making a programming game out of Armok
[23:18:08] <doomlord_> i wondered if you could make a gameworld where the speed of light is dramatically slower to cover the  effects of network lag
[23:18:14] <Earnestly> Amaranth: So, really, saying Gamebryo is what Skyrim uses is almost like saying, DOS is what Windows 7 uses.  (I can’t make the same joke about Unix because well, it is still the same D:)
[23:18:23] <cmr> The reason it's in 2d is that the maths for doing it in 3d would probably be new research, and also way too mindbending to be playable.
[23:18:46] <Amaranth> Earnestly: I was going to use the GoldSrc/Source split as a comparison
[23:19:15] <Earnestly> Amaranth: Sort of, not as much of a change, but yeah
[23:20:14] <Amaranth> In any case, making OpenMW into OpenSky shouldn't be too hard
[23:20:17] <tiffany> cmr: a 3d version sounds like fun
[23:20:33] <myname> cmr: make it in ncurses!
[23:20:44] <myname> because everything is better in terminals
