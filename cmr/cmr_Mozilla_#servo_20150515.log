[01:32:08] <pcwalton> servo's about to do a lot less painting on incremental updates :)
[01:33:14] <WriterOfAlicrow> So what's the plan in terms of making getting servo into a proper web browser? (e.g. Firefox).
[01:33:20] <jdm> gw: that being said, the prototype object is coming from    251 	        let proto = with_compartment(cx, scope, || GetProtoObject(cx, scope, scope)); in ServoHTMLParserBinding.rs
[01:33:23] <jdm> so that's disappointing :<
[01:33:33] <WriterOfAlicrow> (Or some new browser)

[01:43:56] <WriterOfAlicrow> So... all that's needed to fix scrolling is to add a multiplier, right? Sounds pretty easy.

[14:49:33] <larsberg> tomaka: do you have any tricks for keeping around the temp dir from android_rs_glue? ndk-gdb gets annoyed when there's no ApplicationManifest.xml, but the apk builder stuff appears to blow away all of those generated files after producing the APK
[14:50:07] <tomaka> hmm
[14:50:43] <tomaka> rewriting the apk-builder as a wrapper around cargo would solve the issue
[14:50:57] <larsberg> It's probably more complicated than that for debug builds anyway, since I'd like to be able to script passing that project path to ndk-gdb. Maybe not doing it in a temp dir but instead in the target output dir, at least for debug?
[14:51:00] <tomaka> (wanted to do that for months now, but I don't have the time)

[16:15:19] <waddlesplash> but I'm wondering how much there is "easy meat" left
[16:16:02] <kmc> Manishearth might know
[16:16:24] <Manishearth> about?
[16:16:28] <Manishearth> njn's work?
[16:16:31] <kmc> the state of servo memshrink
[16:16:36] <kmc> whether we have low hanging memory-fruit
[16:16:37] <Manishearth> don't know
[16:16:57] <kmc> ok
[16:17:11] <kmc> waddlesplash: if you ask again at another time there may be more people around who know
[16:17:13] <larsberg> waddlesplash: I wouldn't call anything "easy," but there are still a bunch of places where we're not as aggressive as we'd like to be. e.g., not using too many graphics buffers; avoiding extra string copies; storing more of our servo-side Rust data inline with DOM objects; more data structure optimization, particularly for small things; etc.
[16:17:27] <Manishearth> njn's work, I think there's still more work on profiling to be done
[16:17:32] <larsberg> So there's "low-hanging fruit" but none of it is particularly easy, AFAIK
[16:17:39] <waddlesplash> ah, oh well
[16:17:50] <Manishearth> as in the dynamic memory improvements
[16:17:58] <kmc> fruit that appears to hang low but is actually pulled up every time you reach for it by unseen wires
[16:18:01] <kmc> u
[16:18:02] <kmc> whoops
[16:18:09] <waddlesplash> It doesn't help that I have <2h/week for learning Rust/Servo. :P
[16:18:16] <Manishearth> I have a design in mind for a *static* memory improvementifier that tracks unused clones and whatnot
[16:18:22] <kmc> good
[16:18:25] <Manishearth> however
[16:18:37] <kmc> btw if someone finds out what % of our memory usage is DOM text itself, please let me know
[16:18:44] <Manishearth> that procedure needs yak shaving
[16:18:52] <kmc> cause I want UTF-8 DOM, which would shrink that by 2x, but I don't think it's a large overall share
[16:18:58] <waddlesplash> can't you dump the heap and inspec it?
[16:19:15] <Manishearth> Until ast_map does proper parenting (I tried to make it work but it failed), I can't efficiently write the unnecessary clone lint
[16:19:33] <waddlesplash> or are the concepts of "heap" and "stack" totally different in Rust than in the C-family
[16:20:01] <Manishearth> I think we could dump it
[16:20:20] <Manishearth> kmc: by DOM text do you mean text in the DOM, or DOM `Text`?
[16:20:33] <Manishearth> for the former, we should wait till heapsizeof gets here
[16:20:36] <Manishearth> (needs rustup)
[16:20:42] <kmc> text in the dom itself
[16:20:46] <Manishearth> for the latter, that should be easy
[16:20:48] <Manishearth> ah
[16:20:57] <kmc> waddlesplash: no, at runtime Rust executes very much like C and C++ 
[16:21:10] <kmc> which is how we're able to re-use tools like LLVM, gdb, kcov, etc.

[16:26:20] <wolfviking0> Hi, I am playing with Servo, and I add a flag for switch between skia and cairo backend, it’s seems working but cairo seems to be slower but everything is working on OSX. Now I am trying to make it work on Ubuntu and I have some trouble with the linker. It seems I need to pass -fPIC to the linker, but I am not sure where I can do that inside servo, or inside a cargo.toml file. Any suggestion ?
[16:27:38] <Manishearth> kmc: have any ideas for how to write an unused clone plugin?
[16:27:52] <Manishearth> I was thinking of using exprusevisitor, but the ast parenting is broken
[16:28:05] <Manishearth> (ast_map's parent() is the parent Item, not the parent Node)

[16:44:36] <kmc> I remember that you started working on a UTF-16 DOMString a while ago
[16:44:51] <kmc> but another option is lazy transcoding, so only the strings actually touched by JS get inflated
[16:44:54] <wolfviking0> for cairo I add this line inside the build.rs env[CFLAGS] = ()

[21:20:44] <aweinstock> Manishearth: I added some print statements to a local copy of glutin, it seems like the numpad keys are being tested for, but the numbers in x11-rs/keysym.rs (for XK_KP_[0-9]) are inconsistent with the actual numbers being generated
