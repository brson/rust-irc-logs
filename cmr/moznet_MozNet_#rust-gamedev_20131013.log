[02:33:15] <bjz_> in a ridiculously awesome way
[02:33:25] <cmr> I should study raytracing, I have no idea how it would even work.
[02:34:42] <h3r3tic> simple raytracing is simple. but if you want to learn proper monte-carlo path tracing, then http://graphics.stanford.edu/papers/veach_thesis/ is an *awesome* source
[02:34:48] <bjz_> Luqman has a raytracer
[02:34:49] <mcpherrin> A simple raytracer is only 200 lines of code
[02:34:53] <bjz_> in rust
[02:35:15] <bjz_> it's apparently much simpler than rasterising geometry
[02:35:24] <bjz_> just loads slower
[02:35:27] <mcpherrin> Arg, my internet is dying so my messages are much delayed.
[02:35:49] <bjz_> mcpherrin: are you sure you're not on mars?
[02:35:52] <mcpherrin> Luqman: You in south bay tnonight?  Path tracing party?
[02:36:21] <dbaupp> a really simple one is 1 line https://github.com/huonw/card-trace/blob/master/mini.rs :P
[02:36:24] <mcpherrin> bjz_: Only if the caltrain goes a lot further than I thought.
[02:36:24] <bjz_> he's not here :)
[02:36:36] <mcpherrin> gah see I can't even work irssi over this lag
[02:36:57] <h3r3tic> that's a rather long line! :P
[02:37:37] <mcpherrin> Hmm maybe I should code golf a raytracer
[02:39:25] <dbaupp> h3r3tic: (more reasonably, https://github.com/huonw/card-trace/blob/master/bin.rs )
[02:39:55] <h3r3tic> hah, that's slightly more readable :D
[02:41:19] <mcpherrin> What's the weirdest language I can write a raytracer in?
[02:41:26] <mcpherrin> I'm on a train and need something to entertain myself
[02:41:28] <dbaupp> malbolge
[02:41:33] <h3r3tic> was about to say the same
[02:41:44] <h3r3tic> or perhaps unlambda
[02:41:47] <mcpherrin> Haha, I am not coding in malbolge
[02:41:59] <mcpherrin> I'd prefer something not deliberately created to be obtuse
[02:42:07] <h3r3tic> TECO then.
[02:42:09] <mcpherrin> But maybe something not designed to be programmed
[02:42:17] <h3r3tic> yeah, TECO.
[02:42:34] <dbaupp> mcpherrin: tsuR; it's like Rust, but you run it though rev | tail -r before compiling
[02:42:46] <mcpherrin> dbaupp: haha.
[02:43:16] <mcpherrin> I wonder if I can use IPv4 ping latency to implement geometry in a ray tracer
[02:43:35] <mcpherrin> first ping to get back is the surface that's "in front"
[02:47:13] <sp3d> how would you map ipv4 to a 2D space in a way likely to provide coherent latency surfaces?
[02:48:23] <mcpherrin> sp3d: that's why I say "I wonder"
[02:48:29] <sp3d> haha ;)
[02:49:21] <mcpherrin> I could map IPv4 into a 3D space in a way such that IPs lexicographically close are nearby in 3space
[02:49:35] <mcpherrin> Space filling curve, probably
[02:49:39] <sp3d> maybe you could do tracerts to each host though, and use the latencies between subsequent hosts for some aspect of the bounced path?
[02:50:05] <mcpherrin> Nearby IPs are likely to have similar latency
[02:50:28] <sp3d> the problem with a space-filling curve is that a lot of IP allocation is either on big power-2 boundaries or linear within smaller blocks
[02:51:03] <sp3d> (I'd expect IPs allocated to the same party would respond with similar latency and over similar routing)
[02:51:15] <mcpherrin> Yes, sure
[02:51:37] <mcpherrin> I don't know if there's anything interesting to render here
[02:52:13] * mcpherrin goes back to other idle thoughts
[02:57:39] <cmr> h3r3tic: sure, simple
[02:57:43] <cmr> I just don't know much maths
[02:57:46] <cmr> Especially in this area.
[02:57:54] <cmr> Never really thought about the problem either
[02:58:11] <cmr> Honestly I sorta prefer the ignorant admiration, makes things seem much more magickal ;)
[02:58:59] <h3r3tic> for starters, you only really need ray-sphere intersections and some basic vector math
[02:59:31] <cmr> if it's anything more than scaling or addition, it's past my current knowledge :p
[02:59:43] <cmr> I know how to perform the dot product but have no intution about it.
[03:00:32] <h3r3tic> raytracing is the perfect way to gain some :)
[03:00:38] <cmr> Cool!
[03:00:49] * cmr adds it to his short list

[05:43:22] <Amaranth> It's not 100% true but raytracing is basically doing it "the right way" and rasterization is a bunch of hacks to approximate that which are really complicated. That's why a simple ray tracer can be so small.

[05:46:34] <tiffany> well ray tracing does it backwards

[05:47:03] <tiffany> photon mapping is closer, but it still uses traditional rendering after doing lighting

[06:38:29] <cmr> Though they could probably do GS on the GPU, but would you really want that?
[06:39:05] <tiffany> I don't like how intel refuses to update the gl version of their gpus after they're released
[06:39:09] <tiffany> amd and nvidia do, but intel doesn't
[06:39:29] <cmr> It's not just hardware deficiencies?
[06:40:21] <tiffany> I don't know.. it seems like intel would have to be doing something wrong for their gpus to not be able to handle new gl stuff

[06:55:06] <h3r3tic> tiffany: ray tracing ( path tracing ) only seems to do it backwards. there are many ways to solve the rendering equation, and due to light transport reciprocity, you can approach it in either direction, or anywhere in between.

[06:56:52] <h3r3tic> Amaranth: you don't /strictly/ need compute shaders for these, but it helps perf if you can utilize local store memory

[06:59:19] <h3r3tic> cmr: not many folks care about tesselation because everyone was targeting the 360 and ps3 for a long time. you need to reinvent your content pipeline around tesselation, and then it doesn't quite work on platforms without support for it. maybe it will change with the advent of the ps4 and xbone. anyway, tesselation has a few obvious use cases e.g. in water or terrain rendering.
[06:59:54] <cmr> Yeah, I can definitely see why it'd be useful.
[07:00:10] <cmr> The inverse wasn't obvious to me.
[07:00:21] <h3r3tic> well, it's also kinda slow
[07:00:37] <h3r3tic> and with plenty of VRAM, we can just do the classic approach of pre-tesselated meshes and LoDs
[07:01:05] <h3r3tic> if you use tesselation, there's some extra copying of vertex data involved
[07:01:52] <h3r3tic> not quite as much as in the case of geometry shaders, but enough to slow things down
[07:02:05] <cmr> The only thing I really know about tesselation is the cool looking DX11 demos nvidia had of it.

[07:12:47] <h3r3tic> cmr: oh yeah, another reason why fine tesselation is not very popular is the extra pixel shading cost. even pixel-sized triangles are rasterized as 2x2 quads; that and some inefficiencies in the GPU mean that e.g. if you have 1 pixel - sized triangles, you're paying up to 8 times as much in pixel shading cost as you should.
[07:13:07] <h3r3tic> combine that with an expensive shader, e.g. using tiled forward, and you're screwed xD
[07:22:08] <cmr> I'd ask why a triangle would turn into a quad but I am probably not ready for the answer yet
