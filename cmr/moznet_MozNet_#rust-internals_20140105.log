[06:47:24] <acrichto> jack: yes, you have to explicitly call shutdown()
[07:00:15] <jack> acrichto: why not have that done in the destructor?
[07:00:55] <acrichto> jack: brson and I are wary to have destructors surprisingly start blocking the program
[07:00:59] <acrichto> we would rather make the blocking explicit for now
[07:01:26] <acrichto> I should probably update the documentation
[07:01:26] <jack> acrichto: seems reasonable.
[07:01:35] <jack> I was just curious.
[07:01:46] <acrichto> but oh man we have documentation
[07:01:46] <acrichto> http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/master/green/struct.SchedPool.html
[07:02:09] <jack> Servo upgrade is mostly working. We have a sporadic segfault on startup (that disappears in gdb) and we're missing large chunks of the HTML in layout i think.
[07:02:34] <acrichto> hm that segfault sounds mysterious
[07:02:49] <acrichto> it *might* be related to https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/11315
[07:02:51] <acrichto> but I kinda doubt it
[07:03:10] <sfackler> jack: have you tried turning on core dumps?
[07:03:30] <jack> acrichto: when does the parent exit there?
[07:03:51] <acrichto> jack: it *should* be when all children have exited, but there is a race in the current impl
[07:03:59] <jack> i think the function called by native::start doesn't exit until termination

[07:05:35] <jack> i can hand apply the patch and see if it fixes it.

[07:05:56] <acrichto> otherwise sfackler's suggestion of core dumps is good
[07:06:02] <acrichto> it helped me track down like 3 bugs in libuv so far
[07:06:58] <jack> sfackler: how do i turn them on?
[07:07:06] <sfackler> jack: ulimit -c unlimited
[07:07:55] <sfackler> if you're on osx it'll put the dumps in /cores/
[07:07:59] <acrichto> you can also enable them on startup for macs with some weird configuratin file
[07:08:41] <jack> acrichto: https://gist.github.com/metajack/8265331
[07:09:07] <jack> looks like it's in the parallel selector matching.
[07:09:31] <acrichto> doesn't look fishy from a runtime perspective
[07:10:33] <jack> that might be what's causing most of the page to disappear too.

[10:07:27] <dbaupp> eddyb: \o/
[10:07:32] <dbaupp> eddyb: this is your self patch, right?
[10:07:42] <eddyb> nope
[10:07:58] <eddyb> I wish, that one needs nmatsakis' cleanup redesign
[10:08:41] <eddyb> dbaupp: my "disowning visitor" PR failed because of *only* an unneeded import in rustpkg. rustdoc apparently isn't affected at all O_O
[10:10:10] <dbaupp> oh ok
[10:10:23] * dbaupp was excited for a second
[10:12:30] <dbaupp> eddyb: wait... are you ignoring the warnings or removing the (apparently) unused import?
[10:13:12] <eddyb> removing the import. the warnings in *tests* are not fatal and not caused by me
[10:14:15] <eddyb> I think syntax::ast_util had only one exported trait, which made an ast_util::* import look useful. and I removed that trait >_>
[10:16:03] <eddyb> dbaupp: r? https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/11161
[10:16:38] <eddyb> cmr reviewed, pcwalton sent it to testing so I can find *one* fatal warning, third time's the charm :P
[10:17:14] <eddyb> (I usually am OCD about warnings, but I think I removed that silly trait way after I updated rustpkg initially)
[10:17:55] <dbaupp> so the only change from the previous run is removing that one import?
[10:18:14] <eddyb> dbaupp: mhmm
[10:19:06] <eddyb> should've done it last night, but I needed the noisy fan running so my laptop doesn't overheat when I test it locally
[10:19:36] <eddyb> dbaupp: the nice thing is that it removes a lot of @T that would have to be replaced with P<T>
[10:20:41] <eddyb> I kinda want to future-proof indirection in the AST and do some tests to prevent mass allocation and freeing (emplace folding ;))
[10:21:42] <eddyb> it might not be possible to do emplace with @T, only Rc<T>
[10:22:30] <dbaupp> Well, it'll soon be completely impossible to use @
[10:22:31] <dbaupp> ;)
[10:22:38] <dbaupp> (r+ btw)
[10:23:07] <eddyb> you may have heard my ideas about the magical P<T> before - one of the ones I haven't written down is using an u8 refcount. which might not do much, considering padding, unless it goes in padding itself
[10:24:20] <eddyb> (since most refcounts are going to be 2 - one from the AST itself and one from the ast_map. the ast_map is semantically storing WeakRef's, but to implement it as such is actually slower and it uses more memory)
[10:24:36] <eddyb> dbaupp: thanks
[10:25:24] <dbaupp> If the refcount goes after the data then it'll not always take a full word 
[10:25:42] <eddyb> yeah, that's what I was thinking

[10:26:41] <eddyb> oh, oh, I almost forgot this one: the ast_map can sometimes (always?) be represented by a vector (and a base ID. though, no, it's always linear)
[10:27:13] <dbaupp> I thought ID's always started at 0?
[10:27:23] <eddyb> we're using a SipHash HashMap for something that's technically a vector
[10:27:46] <dbaupp> In theory extra::smallintmap may be a drop-in replacement
[10:28:14] <dbaupp> oh, I was going to r=pcwalton,cmr that one, not plain r+
[10:28:17] <dbaupp> meh
[10:28:25] <eddyb> cmr, technically
[10:29:45] <eddyb> I have to find a way to benchmark it. I know how to do it without knowing the ID range beforehand (visiting isn't *that* cheap) and it shouldn't be less efficient than the HashMap
[10:31:31] <eddyb> as long as you "insert" everything immediately after getting the ID for it, it's just a push. otherwise you might need to pad the vector with node_invalid (which I'd have as the first variant so it's just a 0 :P)
[10:31:39] <dbaupp> in what instances do the NodeId's not start at 0?
[10:32:53] <eddyb> loading from metadata, but it's just inserted at the end of the current map, not mapped separately
[10:33:06] <dbaupp> so... what's the problem?
[10:33:41] <dbaupp> isn't the map already filled from 0 at that point?
[10:33:53] <eddyb> nah, I just originally thought there would be a problem
[10:34:23] <eddyb> but you still need to pad with a node_invalid sometimes, if you're not inserting in the right order
[10:36:00] <eddyb> like, inserting 2, 0, 1 will produce [node_invalid, node_invalid, node_whatever] after inserting 2 and then the node_invalid positions are replaced with the actual nodes for 0 and 1
[10:36:31] <dbaupp> there's actually vector functions for that
[10:36:44] <eddyb> grow_fn?
[10:37:01] <dbaupp> yeah
[10:37:25] <eddyb> well, yeah, I know I would use something like that
[10:37:39] <dbaupp> well, grow_set
[10:37:44] <eddyb> or that
[10:37:46] <dbaupp> is the most useful one
[10:39:09] <eddyb> 0 memory management in-place folding sounds like a better win. though from what I remember, @T not moving by default might make that impossible
[10:58:24] <eddyb> task 'rustc' failed at 'node_span: cannot get span from node_local', /home/rustbuild/src/rust-buildbot/slave/auto-linux-64-nopt-t/build/src/libsyntax/ast_map.rs:521
[10:58:27] <eddyb> erm, what?
[10:59:39] <eddyb> dbaupp: I want backtraces in failures
[10:59:48] <dbaupp> <3 gdb
[11:03:18] <eddyb> how... how is that thing my fault?
[11:04:14] <dbaupp> because you broke something
[11:04:16] <dbaupp> apparently
[11:04:57] <eddyb> grepping by error strings is a bad idea
[11:05:26] <eddyb> dbaupp: middle::liveness has that error message by it cannot be created by anything. yay dead code >_>
[11:05:32] <eddyb> s/by/but/
[11:12:12] <eddyb> dbaupp: side by side diff (kdiff3 to be precise) between debugging tool is my new favorite toy
[11:21:54] <eddyb> so either I broke something else... or an ast::Pat's ID goes back to an ast::Local
[11:23:48] <eddyb> there's no.... Pat in the ast_map o_O
[11:24:57] <eddyb> how is this supposed to work? they have their own IDs
[11:26:16] <eddyb> self.insert(pat.id, node_local(ast_util::path_to_ident(path))); :/
[11:28:33] <eddyb> I have two options: put all patterns in the ast_map or remove them all from ast_map

[12:17:53] <dbaupp> eddyb: why did your change need that fix?
[12:18:30] <eddyb> dbaupp: because I removed @ast::Pat from borrowck and left it with a node ID, which didn't have a span on it

[12:45:55] <eddyb> dbaupp: I did add a comment
[12:46:23] <eddyb> and then I realized you might be referring to the fact that only borrowck needs the original pattern (its span to be precise)
[12:46:30] <dbaupp> yeah, but it doesn't actually say why the @Pat needs to be there at all
[12:46:34] <dbaupp> just why there's an Option
[12:46:53] <eddyb> dbaupp: node_local is obtained from a pattern
[12:47:20] <eddyb> it should just be node_local(@Pat), span is the reason it can't right now

[17:41:56] <larsberg> jack: hrm, at least for me, the selector matching-related crashes similarly die in the atomics code: https://gist.github.com/larsbergstrom/8271341
[17:42:33] <larsberg> we're corrupting *something* horribly :-)
[17:45:14] <jack> yes, it dies in arc in my stack trace
[17:48:34] <larsberg> this one was interesting because it's a plausible pointer (i.e., < 2^48), unlike the crash in the AtomicPtr earlier
[17:50:05] <larsberg> I'm not convinced I believe the core file because the pointer is to valid memory in the heap in this one

[19:47:04] <nrc> when compiling a field access |e.f| I can easily get a node id for |e| and a name for |f|, how do I then get a node id for the definition of |f| ?
[19:48:11] <nrc> I think I need the struct that |e| will point to, but I don't see an easy way to get that without doing a deep re-process of |e| - I don't see a convenient map anywhere
