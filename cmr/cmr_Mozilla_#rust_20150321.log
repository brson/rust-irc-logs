[00:16:31] <insaneinside> bstrie: I'm not sure I agree that it's just a documentation bug; shouldn't I be able to document my macros like the standard library does -- i.e., without cluttering *examples* (which are supposed to be short, sweet, and simple) with things like `#[macro_use] extern crate bob;`  and `fn main() { ... }`?
[00:17:30] <sfackler> insaneinside: you can hide all of that by prefixing the lines with "# " (note the space)
[00:17:31] <insaneinside> bstrie: Besides, if we're giving an example of something *in a library*, shouldn't rustdoc assume that the example assumes that we already have an `extern crate bob` somewhere?
[00:17:46] <insaneinside> sfackler: interesting, but.. hrm.
[00:17:50] <sfackler> insaneinside: it does, but it's not annotated with #[macro_use]

[00:18:52] <sfackler> yes
[00:19:02] <insaneinside> okay. :)

[01:03:28] <Alto> Hello, I am trying to use libsyntax to validate generated Rust in tests, is it possible to get errors from the parse_*_from_source_str functions instead of printing errors and panicking?
[01:04:17] <ELD> @bstrie: That's the idea. It's for an undergrad class called "Elements of Computing Systems." Our ninth project is a paper and presentation about a significant advance in compilers or programming languages. I figured Rust would be a good one because, paradoxically, it doesn't bring too many new features, it just brings them all together. It's also an up-and-coming language and I wouldn't mind showing other people what it can do. :)
[01:04:37] <bstrie> ELD: awesome :)
[01:05:00] <bstrie> Alto: we have libraries that currently do autocompletion from rust, they must be doing that sort of thing somehow
[01:05:39] <ELD> @bstrie: Yep :) I'm really looking forward to the finished language. I'm working on a CommonMark Markdown parser on the side right now. It'll hopefully help me wrap my head around the type system and such.

[01:38:36] <chickensalad> if your use-case doesn't care about those low-chance cases, then write wrapper code to unwrap explicitely?
[01:38:50] <Mutabah> KallDrexx: .iter()?
[01:38:52] <scott> chickensalad: let ref x = foo; is the same as let x = &foo;, but the point of ref is to make bindings inside a more complex match be references (eg. let (ref x, y) = pair;), so I recommend not using ref at the top level of a pattern like that
[01:38:54] <chickensalad> the problem is that someone would care about that, and then this way they can handle it?

[01:55:19] <steveklabnik> becuase a mutable binding can be reassigned, it doesn't mean you can mutate the contents
[01:55:29] <Sergio> But the idea here is two-fold: 1) you might want to name your struct's field something different than the JSON field, and 2: you might want to make some of these optional. In Rust, you can deal with the second one using Option<T>, and perhaps you eschew the notion of the first one or use a simply decorate #![json(map: user_name -> "username")].
[01:55:32] <Sergio> decorator*
[01:55:36] <steveklabnik> & does an immutable borrow
[01:55:50] <steveklabnik> so let mut x = &5 <- a mutable binding to an immutalbe pointer
[01:56:02] <reem> Sergio: There are a lot of magical (very convenient) APIs in other languages that are much more expensive than they look in rust terms
[01:56:03] <steveklabnik> what you want is let x: &mut Box<Foo>; <-

[01:56:49] <Sergio> reem: I don't think the reflection here is very expensive. Nonetheless, you can accomplish this statically in Rust.

[02:22:03] <pyon> But for Copy...
[02:22:07] <Sergio> I've gown so pesimisitc about Rust interfaces being pretty recently. :(
[02:22:27] <pyon> Why?
[02:22:32] <pyon> Rust is more expressive than ever.
[02:22:34] <pyon> At least that's my impression.
[02:22:53] <Sergio> But so verbose.
[02:23:01] <lfairy> pyon: if you run `rustc -Z unstable-options --pretty=expanded` on your source file, you can see what it expands to
[02:23:15] <pyon> Checking.
[02:23:31] <lfairy> pyon: looks like it bounds F: Copy, not F::T: Copy

[02:24:32] <Sergio> Meh, it's mostly the unwrap() stuff that annoys me.
[02:24:33] <pyon> Ironically, F: Copy should be irrelevant.
[02:24:44] <lfairy> so yeah probably a bug
[02:24:46] <pyon> Because F itself doesn't appear in PairFoo.

[02:31:12] <scott> Sergio: I think some of that will be resolved when HKTs are added (map on Vec<T>, at least, should be doable)
[02:31:29] <scott> implementing multiple traits at once is a neat idea
[02:31:54] <pyon> Wait, is it guaranteed that HKTs will be added at some point in time?

[02:33:13] <pyon> HKTs would greatly simplify my work. I'm trying to make a library of purely functional data structures, and at many points I want to parameterize over whether the recursive knots are Boxes or Arcs.

[03:40:50] <Sergio> What does that mean?
[03:41:28] <porglezo1p> Unless there's an O(1) insertion operation that preserves the sort for the state you're dragging along, you have to deal with that insertion.
[03:41:45] <Sergio> There is?
[03:41:51] <porglezo1p> Say you have 1 4 5 7 carried along with you.
[03:41:56] <Sergio> Quick-select happens in place.
[03:41:59] <Sergio> You don't carry anything along.
[03:42:08] <Sergio> You know how many elements you want.
[03:42:42] <Sergio> You create an array of that size. When you find an element (on the iteration after quick-select) that is <= the element you find in quick-select, you simply add it to the array you created O(1).

[03:56:41] <porglezo1p> And that's O(n log n), correct?
[03:57:14] <pyon> Depends on the priority queue's guarantees.
[03:58:32] <porglezo1p> But priority queues will _generally_ be O(log n) insertion.
[03:58:39] <pyon> Asymptotically optimal priority queues have O(1) inserts, merges, and O(log n) removes.
[03:58:54] <porglezo1p> Okay.

[03:59:52] <porglezo1p> In that case, the best I can think of is O(n log m), where you push and pop as you go along.

[05:22:11] <dpc_> This is for staff that is only referenced from externals or internal assembler code.
[05:22:16] <Mutabah> actually, yes, if it's public rustc shouldn't prune it
[05:22:27] <dpc_> From perspective of the compiler or even linker these might not be refereneced at all.

[06:10:24] <ChrisMorgan> acrichto: it seems to me that the “byte literals are explicitly sized &[u8; N] instead of &[u8]” has been miscarried in the five months between when the RFC was written and accepted and when it was implemented, for as I recall the changes array literals and our whole &[T], &[T; N] and [T; N] attitude have changed since then, so that [u8; N] would be the expected way to do it now rather than
[06:10:26] <ChrisMorgan> &'static [u8; N]. I really don’t perceive the arguments on &'static [u8; N] vs. [u8; N], though, so I may have missed something one way or the other.

[09:16:29] <kerble> Just came against this, it makes sense but it's a little weird that struct field ordering should ever matter...      let f = Foo { a = bar, b=bar.method() }      fails, because bar is moved to a, works if you swap the field order. Not a complaint, just a curiosity.
[09:16:35] <auihn> Still no plans for an API dealing with pipes on a higher level than using libc? For 1.0..
[09:16:51] <auihn> Does anyone know a crate that does this, otherwise?

[12:51:01] <kimundi> But you don't generally need to use it for vague space optimizations from using a pointer vs directly by value, unless you your have prfiled it and are absolutely sure it improves matters
[12:51:08] <bluss> iopq: so ::rand::thread_rng() would work, or "use rand" followed by rand::thread_rng()
[12:51:26] <bluss> iopq: because paths are not anchored at the global root by default
[12:51:27] <oakwhiz> kimundi: do you mean like how pointers are always fixed size, but they can point to something of variable size?

[13:00:13] <pieter> kimundi: E.g. say I have a struct that's composed out of a number of other structs. The size of the outer struct should be the combined size of all inner structs if the fields aren't boxes (so e.g. A { x: B, y: B, z: B } where size of B = 10 would become 30 bytes). Recursively this can create very large structs.

[13:01:18] <oakwhiz> pieter: I think it depends on how big
[13:01:57] <oakwhiz> if there is an array or other variable-size field involved then I would use a box then
[13:02:07] <pieter> I guess. I get that Rust/LLVM takes care of stack allocations and stuff like that, optimizing this. However when you put something like that in a Vec and it needs to resize, it does need to copy a lot of memory.
[13:02:14] <pieter> Ah yes :).
[13:02:34] <bluss> but you could have a vector of Box<Foo> too
[13:02:54] <kimundi> oakwhiz, pieter: Worrying about stack copies and such is generally put aside in Rust unless it happens to be a big problem that crops up in profiling the code. The general thinking is that most structs are comparatively small; the size is only an issue if you move the data a lot, which due to references is not that common; llvm optimizes and inlines away a lot of the code, and makes functions use out pointers anyway where its needed.

[13:51:41] <bluss> if you call thread_rng more than once it will still only init once
[13:51:52] <bluss> so like I said, it's not surprising if thread_rng is much faster.

[14:55:28] <rovar> bluss, I see.  So I just need a String which is large enough to contain my longest line, and clear it out between each iteration
[14:55:41] <rovar> then I can use String.len to collect the offset
[14:55:44] <rovar> of the next line. 
[14:55:55] <bluss> yes. You don't need to worry to much either, because the string will just reallocate to fit if needed
[14:55:55] <rovar> that should do nicely
[14:56:23] <bluss> but to truly be just one allocation, you need to guess correctly on the first ::with_capacity() :-)

[16:53:48] <burntsushi> kl4ng: ah i see, you probably need `impl<T: Ord + Eq + Debug> Node<T>`
[16:54:14] <burntsushi> kl4ng: note that `Debug` is in `std::fmt`
[16:54:18] <burntsushi> i don't think it's in the prelude
[16:54:22] <burntsushi> can't remember
[16:54:39] <kl4ng> ok, ill try that. when would i need to use #[derive(debug)] then? also, what do you mean by 'prelude'?
[16:55:41] <burntsushi> kl4ng: i see. i'm not being very careful, sorry about that. you'd want `derive(Debug)` when you want to print out an entire `Node`
[16:55:51] <burntsushi> kl4ng: but it looks like you only want to print `val`?
[16:56:11] <burntsushi> kl4ng: in that case, you wouldn't actually need to derive Debug

[16:58:28] <dcb> burntsushi, oopq: ok thanks.  Something happened to the type inference on the latest nightly WRT literal byte strings.  I'm trying to see if I can track down a small case
[16:58:53] *** Joins: eerie (eerie@moz-nu5r7u.red.bezeqint.net)
[16:59:10] <burntsushi> dcb: my suggestion should work. byte strings now have type `&'static [u8; N]` instead of `&'static [u8]`
[16:59:14] <kimundi> Noc: As far as I can tell, the closure there causes the borrow error, which is weird because as far as I c an tell, it does not borrow slice :)
[16:59:28] <burntsushi> dcb: this can cause problems because there are many impls on `[u8]` that aren't on `[u8; N]`
[16:59:48] <dcb> burntsushi: yah, this is causing problems in an assert_eq! statement
[16:59:49] <burntsushi> dcb: so just convert your fixed size array to a slice: `&b"blahblah"[..]`, which will have type `&'static [u8]`
[17:00:05] <dcb> burntsushi: OK thanks
[17:00:20] <Noc> kimundi: Yeah, it seems weird. Even if I assign the result to a tempoary variable it still happens.
[17:00:31] <burntsushi> kl4ng: check out the docs here: http://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/fmt/ if you scroll down a bit, there's an example for implementing `fmt::Display`, but it should be exactly the same for `fmt::Debug`
[17:00:45] <kl4ng> alright, sweet. thanks!
[17:00:46] <kimundi> Noc: yeah, you need to have the closure and the temporary variable in their own block for that to work
[17:01:10] <burntsushi> kl4ng: btw, "prelude" is the set of things that are automatically in scope in every Rust program. you can find it here: http://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/prelude/v1/
[17:01:34] <burntsushi> kl4ng: since `Debug` isn't listed there, you will need to do `use std::fmt;` and then use `fmt::Debug` OR `use std::fmt::Debug;` and use `Debug`.

[18:04:46] <jmesmon> Is the RFC process documented somewhere? I'm having trouble understanding why sometimes RFCs are closed as "postponed" and have another RFC opened with the same topic that links back to the original RFC. Wouldn't it make sense just to tag the original as posponed instead of opening a new one?

[19:36:39] <trishume> bluss: ok thanks, I thought I was just really bad at Rust. Now I’m back to thinking I’m just kinda bad. It’s weird though because those structs in the library are meant for caching.
[19:37:23] <bluss> you can keep the cache separate from where you store the connection
[19:37:49] <trishume> iliekturtles: yah it doesn’t compile without them (not that it compiles with them). As bluss noted the prepare method borrows the connection with the lifetime of the connection.
[19:38:07] <trishume> bluss: oh ok I see, so it can be resolved provided I just use a separete struct.
[19:38:33] <kimundi> leifw: Yes that is the issue, you can reject such types by adding the additional bound 'static

[22:16:44] *** Joins: zmack (zmack@moz-4b0.o8l.26.188.IP)
[22:16:44] <leifw> for example, I want to return an iterator of Future<String>, but -> Iterator<Future<String>> is clearly not correct because Iterator takes no type parameters

[22:17:02] <ogham> leifw: You're probably looking for Iterator<Item=T>
[22:17:26] <sfackler> reem: postgres-macros should work on osx now
[22:17:27] <ogham> But that's a trait, so you can't return it directly. You'll need to either return the full type, or box it
[22:17:28] <burntsushi> leifw: keep in mind that `Iterator<...>` is unsized, so to return it, you'll need to box it: `Box<Iterator<Item=T>>`
[22:17:40] <leifw> thanks
[22:18:04] <bluss> leifw: returning iterators is not as well supported as it should be. future rust will improve it
[22:18:06] <ogham> mjboa: Right now you have lit.or_else(|| failure_case).map(|decision| success_case)
[22:18:07] <reem> sfackler: nice, thanks
[22:18:08] <bluss> for now, it needs boxing
[22:18:14] <burntsushi> leifw: there is some plan to fix that by implementing "abstract return types," but the RFC was postponed to post-1.0. (this is also useful for returning unboxed closures.)

[23:34:30] <reem> this is also why Either uses the first type param for errors, since you couldn't write a sensible Monad instance if it was the other way around

[23:35:37] <reem> there was concern over the order of type params in Result for this reason
[23:35:51] <reem> but we realized that it's fine, since we don't have to have the same currying-based implementation as Haskell
[23:36:19] <reem> e.g. you could impl<E> Monad for Result<*, E> (* is straw syntax)
