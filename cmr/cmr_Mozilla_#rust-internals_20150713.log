[00:13:29] <SimonSapin> Are fn types Clone? I’m getting error: no method named `clone` found for type `core::iter::FlatMap<core::slice::Iter<'_, core::ops::Range<usize>>, core::ops::Range<usize>, fn(&core::ops::Range<usize>) -> core::ops::Range<usize> {core::clone::Clone::clone}>` in the current scope
[00:15:21] <SimonSapin> I’m trying to clone the result of sequence.runs.iter().flat_map(Clone::clone) , with sequence.runs a Vec<Range<usize>>
[00:16:03] <huon> you probably have to cast to an actual function pointer, rather than the unique type functions have
[00:16:27] <huon> Clone::clone as fn(&Range<usize>) -> Range<usize>

[00:31:50] <SimonSapin> eddyb: can I have FnMut + Clone, other than by implementing FnMut myself?
[00:32:35] <eddyb> SimonSapin: doubtful :/
[00:32:52] <eddyb> oh, wait
[00:33:05] <eddyb> SimonSapin: couldn't you use .cloned()?
[00:33:25] <SimonSapin> eddyb: FlatMap still wants an FnMut
[00:33:29] <eddyb> sequence.runs.iter().cloned().flat_map(id)
[00:33:41] <eddyb> where fn id<T>(x: T) -> T {x}
[00:33:53] <eddyb> id should be Copy + Clone
[00:34:51] <SimonSapin> eddyb: same error
[00:35:13] <SimonSapin> couldn’t / shouldn’t closures derive Clone?
[00:35:33] <reem> (and Copy, please)
[00:35:39] <aatch> Clone isn't a lang item, therefore the compiler doesn't know about it.
[00:36:25] <eddyb> SimonSapin: how so?
[00:36:33] <eddyb> SimonSapin: oh, what huon said
[00:36:43] <eddyb> SimonSapin: id as fn(_) -> _
[00:36:53] <eddyb> instead of just passing id to flat_map
[00:37:25] <reem> aatch: Copy: Clone now, and Copy is known to the compiler. Technically speaking you’re right, but in principle Clone is part of the language as a result of that bound.
[00:37:55] <eddyb> yeah, rustc can definitely "steal" Clone from there
[00:39:19] <eternaleye> Shouldn't FnMut only be Clone if its state contains only Clone types?
[00:40:04] <eddyb> eternaleye: FnMut is a trait
[00:40:12] <eternaleye> eddyb: T: FnMut then
[00:40:35] <eddyb> T: FnMut doesn't change anything about T: Clone
[00:40:48] <eddyb> closures in particular might, they make this tricky
[00:40:59] <eternaleye> eddyb: I'm meaning the case where |x| foo( x, y ) where y: !Clone
[00:42:27] <eddyb> eternaleye: yeah, that's a closure, not necessarily tied to the Fn* traits
[00:42:56] <eternaleye> Mm
[00:43:07] <eddyb> copyability/cloneability of closures would also depend on capture mode
[00:43:27] <eternaleye> eddyb: I guess I was focused on SimonSapin's original question, "can I have FnMut + Clone, other than by implementing FnMut myself?"
[00:43:32] <eternaleye> eddyb: Which to me says 
[00:43:42] <eternaleye> "Is there a way to have a cloneable closure"
[00:43:59] <eddyb> he literally meant a type that implements both FnMut and Clone
[00:44:25] <eternaleye> "Other than by implementing FnMut myself" - the only existing impl is closures, no?
[00:44:39] <eddyb> functions pointers do that in the absence of higher-ranked regions or whatever they're called
[00:44:40] <eddyb> eternaleye: no
[00:45:09] <eddyb> Fn* traits are implemented by fn item types, fn pointer types, closures, the traits objects themselves, abstractions like FnBox, etc.
[00:45:14] <SimonSapin> eddyb: It worked after making id non-generic. Thanks eddyb.
[00:45:16] <eternaleye> Mm
[00:45:38] <eddyb> on unstable, any user type can implement the Fn* traits, they're just traits
[00:45:45] <eternaleye> eddyb: I was under the impression that pretty much all of those were either Fn or FnOnce
[00:46:11] <eternaleye> eddyb: And the "on unstable" one is "implementing it yourself" - exactly what he wanted to avoid
[00:46:34] <eddyb> eternaleye: the standard library can use unstable code
[00:46:42] <eternaleye> Mm
[00:46:45] <eddyb> and thus can have abstractions like FnBox

[00:47:25] <eternaleye> eddyb: Mm, although I suppose FnOnce: FnMut
[00:47:27] <eddyb> that was just an example
[00:47:41] <SimonSapin> eternaleye: clonable closures would work, yes. But since I suspected closures are not clonable in current Rust I asked about other things
[00:47:45] <eddyb> no, FnOnce is at the bottom of the hiearchy. or at the top, I guess
[00:47:57] <eternaleye> eddyb: Yeah, realized after sending I got it backwards
[00:48:05] <eddyb> FnMut: Fn: FnOnce... maybe?
[00:48:27] <eddyb> I'm not sure how to guide myself, I only know FnOnce is the base trait because it defines the Output associated type
[00:48:29] <SimonSapin> My end goal was to clone a FlatMap, which contains a generic field F: FnMut
[00:48:53] <eternaleye> eddyb: Something which wants to call a FnMut can call a Fn, something that wants a FnOnce can call either.
[00:48:54] <SimonSapin> so #[derive(Clone)] on FlatMap only applies when F: Clone
[00:49:37] <eternaleye> eddyb: The shorter the name, the more restricted the impl and the less restricted the caller
[00:49:41] <eddyb> eternaleye: how does that make sense with what I said? it has to be stricter semantic-wise
[00:50:03] <eddyb> self -> &mut self -> &self
[00:50:28] <eddyb> although, Fn: FnMut: FnOnce seems backwards
[00:50:53] <eternaleye> eddyb: No, not really
[00:51:01] <eddyb> at least closures implement as many as possible, and fn item/pointer types implement all of them
[00:51:02] <eternaleye> eddyb: Any FnMut can be called only once
[00:51:14] <eternaleye> eddyb: But FnOnce _must_ be called only once
[00:51:23] <eddyb> eternaleye: I was thinking in terms of default impls, I guess
[00:52:10] <eternaleye> eddyb: Yeah, default impls don't work with Fn* because of the inverse constraint behavior on impls and callers
[00:52:15] <eddyb> that's the counter-intuitive bit, no default impls for the methods

[05:46:19] <Quxxy> What is it about closures that is *not* correctly inferred if you don't write a closure in argument position.  This has gotten me a few times before, and it came up in an SO question yesterday and I don't get what's going on.  I asked in #rust with no response; figured if anyone would know, someone in here would
[05:47:54] <aatch> Quxxy, gh26085 is probably relevant
[05:47:55] <[o__o]> Closures should always implement the all applicable Fn* traits.: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/26085
[05:48:26] <Quxxy> That actually seems to be the opposite problem
[05:49:35] <aatch> Quxxy, then what's your issue?
[05:50:51] <Quxxy> It came up in this question: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31362206/.  First it complains about expecting a bound lifetime, but getting a concrete one, then if you hint that one of the arguments is a &, it then complains that the appropriate trait isn't implemented
[05:51:04] <Quxxy> Shoving the closure into argument position fixes the problems, I'm just not sure *why*
[05:56:47] <aatch> Quxxy, oh, in that case, it's just the whole "doesn't implement `Fn` because it mutates the environment", at least for the second case.
[05:58:13] <aatch> Quxxy, so the issues are unrelated, the first one is because it *can* infer a concrete lifetime for the closure, so it does. But that doesn't match the bound on the function signature.
[05:58:57] <aatch> Quxxy, the second one is that because the closure modifies the environment, it *can't* implement `Fn`.
[05:59:01] <Quxxy> So the compiler only takes the trait into account for the purposes of inference if it's used as an argument?
[05:59:18] <Quxxy> (Yeah, I keep forgetting the mutation thing, since I missed it when I boiled the example down to something I could actually compile)
[05:59:59] <aatch> Quxxy, more that it's a bit eager to nail down the types involved.
[06:00:46] *** Joins: RC9 (RCIX@moz-432.dfa.8.198.IP)
[06:02:20] <aatch> Quxxy, what's happening is that we're resolving the types for the closure argument, then checking it against the later usage, in an argument position, we'll check the closure type against that first, then check everything else.
[06:02:46] <aatch> Quxxy, it's just a side-effect of the order in which we do things.
[06:04:09] <Quxxy> Ok; so by the time the constraint on the argument type comes into play, it's already too late to change its mind about the arguments
[06:04:21] <Quxxy> (By argument type, I mean the argument into which the closure is passed)
[06:04:35] <Quxxy> (Too many arguments :P)
[06:05:14] <aatch> Quxxy, I think so. (It's pretty complicated, so I might have the wrong idea)
[06:05:26] <Quxxy> Ok; thanks
[06:06:13] <aatch> Quxxy, thinking about it (and looking at the code), it's actually most likely that the bound from the function isn't taken into account.

[15:37:37] <pnkfelix> eddyb: I believe catching duplicate entries in the error code lists was still a goal
[15:38:05] <pnkfelix> eddyb: or rather
[15:38:08] <pnkfelix> eddyb: (and also)
[15:38:19] <imperio> eddyb: I'll write another macro/function which will allow to do it but without warning
[15:38:25] <eddyb> imperio: so when you have duplicated codes, is it in the same piece of code, or are the different uses of the same error code across different functions?
[15:38:26] <pnkfelix> eddyb: we wanted to safe guard against the same error code being used for two distinct warning messages
[15:38:34] <imperio> it darkens the code but if you really wants to avoid compilation warnings...

It occurs to me that it's slightly inconsistent to say that `unsafe` code can't trust generic trait implementations to be correct, but it *can* trust concrete implementations to be correct. That is, in either case you're trusting Safe code to be correct to avoid Undefined Behaviour. The only difference is a matter of scale (one-to-one vs one-to-many)
[17:19:15] <Gankro> and the ability to potentially review the code in question. (which certainly doesn't seem like an *insubstantial* difference)

[17:23:08] <Gankro> e.g. you can call with_capacity, get the ptr, and it has exactly `capacity` elements allocated

[17:24:05] <pnkfelix> arielb1: what's an example of that?
[17:24:08] <Gankro> Do crates have a parent/child relation?
[17:24:26] <arielb1> pnkfelix: I think the rule is that you shouldn't trust things that are not trustworthy
[17:24:53] <pnkfelix> arielb1: I cannot tell if you are writing that in jest or in sincerity
[17:25:00] <arielb1> I mean, having unsafe code that trusts `sort` to e.g. actually sort a list of u32-s is fine
[17:25:02] <pnkfelix> arielb1: i.e. it appears oxymoronic

[17:25:42] <pnkfelix> arielb1: or are we talking about an impl of a trait that has a `sort` method ?

[17:26:00] <arielb1> pnkfelix: I am talking about libstd's sort
[17:26:11] <pnkfelix> arielb1: okay then yes I'm on board with that
[17:26:23] <arielb1> pnkfelix: "trust" and "trustworthy" are infosec definitions
[17:26:25] <pnkfelix> arielb1: but it seems obvious that libstd is part of the trusted computing base (TCB), right? 
[17:26:47] <arielb1> B is trusted (by A for C) if B can violate C
[17:27:08] <arielb1> (and A can allow it)
[17:27:28] <arielb1> that's a "factual" definition
[17:27:45] <arielb1> by it, a computer trusts everyone with a 0-day
[17:27:59] <arielb1> B is trustworthy (by A for C) is a policy decision

[17:28:44] <Gankro> arielb1: So it's ok to unconditionally trust everything exported by std?
[17:28:59] <arielb1> Gankro: for what?
[17:29:17] <Gankro> Anything it claims to do can be relied on for memory safety in unsafe code
[17:29:22] <aturon> Gankro: isn't the point just that you can trust known code, but can't trust unknown code?
[17:29:48] <arielb1> "that's a policy decision"
[17:30:13] <Gankro> aturon: my concern about that is that it substantially expands the scope of "things that can make the badness happen"
[17:30:14] <aturon> Gankro: (in terms of the one-one/one-many distinction you were making)
[17:30:55] <Gankro> Not that we honestly review more or less seriously when `unsafe` is touched, in my experience
[17:31:10] <aturon> Gankro: put differently, you want it to be the case that your safe abstraction can never have UB regardless of any *parameters* instantiated by safe code
[17:31:24] <aturon> Gankro: but if you use e.g. Vec internally, that is not controlled by a parameter,

[17:33:51] <huon> Gankro: nagisa (in rendered form, http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#inline-assembler-expressions )
[17:33:55] <pnkfelix> and the logic of those checkers in turn relies on correct usage of `unsafe impl` by the code that is part of the client context
[17:33:57] <arielb1> libstd *should* be mostly trustworthy
[17:33:57] <arielb1> there may be buggy areas, through
[17:33:57] <arielb1> I mean, you should be able to mostly trust libstd to comply with the documentation
[17:33:57] <arielb1> aturon: libpng is known code
[17:33:57] <arielb1> it isn't particularly trustworthy
[17:33:57] <arielb1> you shouldn't trust unknown out-of-crate safe code for memory-safety
[17:33:57] <pnkfelix> Gankro: ^
[17:33:57] <aturon> Gankro: (glad to hash this out in person if that'd be helpful)
[17:34:17] <Luqman> nagisa: and a pull to link to it from our docs already!
[17:34:33] <Gankro> aturon: Nah I just need to stew on this
[17:34:50] <pnkfelix> Gankro: If we didn't require the `unsafe` in `unsafe impl`, then we would have a leak where we would be relying on the correctness of client code that didn't include the word `unsafe`
[17:34:50] <aturon> arielb1: sure, there are best practices, but Gankro is trying to define formally what must be true of a safe abstraction over unsafe code
[17:35:06] <arielb1> aturon: "formally"?
[17:35:10] <pnkfelix> imperio: looking
[17:35:27] <aturon> arielb1: heh, ok "formally" might be a stretch :)
[17:35:30] <arielb1> it isn't UB to have unsafe code that trusts the response from an HTTP
[17:35:40] <arielb1> from an unauthenticated HTTP connection
[17:35:43] <Gankro> pnkfelix: I totally agree with unsafe trait/impl; I have just become slightly disillusioned with *concrete* safe code :P
[17:35:44] <arielb1> not a wise idea, through
[17:36:28] <aturon> arielb1: the whole notion of "trust" here is based on results that could lead to UB in the guts of the unsafe code
[17:37:19] <aturon> arielb1: IOW if the result can't lead to UB internally, no trust is needed
[17:37:52] <arielb1> aturon: I don't see how a buffer overflow is different from mmap-ing and running code you got from teh interwebz
[17:38:10] <arielb1> or even writing it to a file and then running it
[17:38:21] <arielb1> (except the latter can be done in safe code of course)
[17:38:36] <pnkfelix> imperio: I fear you missed part of the idea with factoring those error messages into an enum
[17:38:42] <arielb1> Rust's standard libraries should provide a "safe interface"
[17:38:51] <aturon> arielb1: the idea is that "safe" in Rust should ultimately have a formalizable meaning
[17:39:06] <pnkfelix> imperio: in particular, it would be nice if the error message you emit *came from* the enum variant
[17:39:08] <aturon> which does not exclude all of the silly things you might do, but does exclude certain classes of them
[17:39:13] <arielb1> aturon: should it?
[17:39:14] <imperio> pnkfelix: ooooh
[17:39:22] <imperio> hum...
[17:39:27] <pnkfelix> imperio: what you have here, you construct the enum variant, and in parallel you construct an error message.
[17:39:31] <aturon> arielb1: yes. that's pretty much a foundational principle of the language.
[17:39:36] <imperio> you mean I pass it inside the num or I generate it from the enum variant ?
[17:39:40] <arielb1> I think there should be a formalizable "completely-safe"
[17:39:48] <arielb1> which is a standard libstd etc. should go for
[17:40:29] <pnkfelix> imperio: i'll write a comment on the PR
[17:40:36] <imperio> pnkfelix: I think I got what you mean, I generate message from my centralized function then
[17:40:36] <arielb1> which is linking-preserved and fulfilled by all unsafe-free Rust code
[17:40:57] <imperio> pnkfelix: I'll wait your comment then
[17:40:58] <aturon> arielb1: where "unsafe-free" permits using std?
[17:41:13] <arielb1> aturon: linking-preserved
[17:41:22] <aturon> arielb1: std isn't unsafe-free :)
[17:41:24] <arielb1> if A is completely-safe, and B is completely-safe
[17:41:45] <arielb1> aturon: unsafe-free -> completely-safe (when linked with completely-safe crates)
[17:42:24] <aturon> i'm afraid i don't follow. i'm trying to ask if you consider std to be a special case, considered completely-safe by fiat despite the use of unsafe
[17:42:33] <arielb1> aturon: it isn't
[17:42:43] <arielb1> there's a runtime definition of complete-safety
[17:42:50] <arielb1> which libstd satisfies
[17:42:59] <arielb1> and unsafe-free Rust satisfies
[17:43:09] <arielb1> and is closed under linking
[17:44:01] <arielb1> of course libstd satisfying it needs a proof
[17:44:15] <aturon> arielb1: i see, i was taking the above as definitional. i don't understand the difference between what you're proposing and the long plan of record, though?
[17:44:25] <arielb1> long plan?
[17:44:46] <arielb1> maybe its just us calling UB "unsafety" that confuses me
[17:44:51] <huon> arielb1: so you're taking "bugs exist" as the reason that std isn't completely-safe? (is fine, just trying to be clear)
[17:45:06] <arielb1> huon: if there are bugs in unsafe code in libstd, then it isn't completely-safe
[17:45:15] <arielb1> I mean, memory-safety-critical bugs
[17:45:17] <huon> yes, that's what I said :)

[17:45:51] <aturon> arielb1: ah, ok. we often use UB as a proxy/shorthand since most (all?) failures to be safe can be weaponized to produce UB
[17:45:53] <arielb1> if sort can occasionally drop elements, that doesn't invalidate complete-safety
[17:46:20] <arielb1> drop=lose, not duplicate without calling destructors here, ofc.
