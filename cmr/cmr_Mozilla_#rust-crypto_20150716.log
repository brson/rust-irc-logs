[00:00:08] <Ilari> bascule: I have seen OpenSSL build where P-521 is faster than P-384 (because the latter is optimized like crap).
[00:17:04] <Ilari> Basically, various HTTP intermediaries get all sorts of cases in HTTP just plain wrong, resulting variety of problems.
[00:29:32] <Ilari> Oh, a lot of B-571 use is apparently some retarded OpenSSL default.
[00:35:26] <Ilari> Hey, it is OpenSSL. :->
[00:37:26] <bascule> Ilari: I mean, I'd be fine if the only options were Curve25519, Goldilocks, and P-256, heh
[00:37:34] <bascule> I included the others to be less controversial
[00:37:48] <bascule> Brian Smith was down to nuke P-521 but people were immediately like nooooo don't take my P-521
[00:39:52] <Ilari> Also, P-384 pretty much has to be there at least as a vanity curve. :->

[00:42:06] <Tiffany> you can tell someone was mashing their number row instead of using an actual rng just by the number of threes and fours...
[00:42:40] <Ilari> Looks pretty much the last point there is if the curve codepoints should be ECDH-specific or not.
[00:43:18] <Tiffany> it would be nice if the internet was more federated in nature, so that instead of aggressive caching you could just run local nodes

[01:44:15] <bascule> here comes Dan Brown to fuck everything up again
[01:45:17] <Tiffany> does anyone actually use camellia?
[01:45:33] <Tiffany> there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with it, although there's very little reason to use it over AES
[01:46:14] <Ilari> Hah, reminds me of that firefox quirk that caused a lot of Camellia use. :-)
[01:46:35] <Tiffany> what quirk is that?
[01:46:54] <Tiffany> I've seen some cipher suites enable camellia simply because it's not broken
[01:47:10] <Ilari> Earlier versions of Firefox advertised Camellia before AES, leading a lot of servers to take Camellia when both supported AES.
[01:50:20] <Tiffany> the situation in South Korea is pretty depressing
[01:50:54] <Tiffany> the vast, vast majority uses IE on Windows because the only way to buy stuff online is to use the ActiveX plugin which implements SEED and the national identity system
[01:51:06] <Tiffany> and none of the browser vendors really care to change this
[01:51:22] <Tiffany> NSS apparently had SEED support for a while, but it wasn't useful, because it was only part of what the ActiveX plugin did
[01:52:45] <Tiffany> I'm not sure why browser vendors are uninterested in implementing it
[01:53:13] <Tiffany> is it because it's specific to South Korea? or because they're philosophically opposed to the national identity system?
[01:53:50] <Tiffany> or because the developers are mostly not in South Korea and therefore don't care very much
[01:54:07] <Tiffany> is GOST used in this way? I hope not
[01:55:44] <Yurume> Tiffany: the very introduction of SEED itself is not a problem, as it was probably a result of US export control over cryptos. the problem persists because both the gov't and the industry does not prefer to move on...
[01:56:50] <Tiffany> I was under the impression the main problem was the ecommerce regulations as a whole, which includes that sites must record your identity, in addition to requiring SEED for financial transactions
[01:57:00] <Tiffany> SEED isn't that big of a problem, it's just a codepoint and a block cipher
[01:57:07] <Tiffany> I think OpenSSL might support it..

[01:58:30] <Tiffany> I think there's been something or other about adding payment options for phones in SK as well
[01:58:34] <Tiffany> I'm not sure how that works
[01:59:05] <Tiffany> since phones cannot, of course, run ActiveX on account of not running Windows
[01:59:20] <Tiffany> not counting Windows Phone, which I doubt has ActiveX anyway
[02:00:36] <Tiffany> are there other nightmares similar to SK ecommerce?
[02:00:54] <Ilari> Heh, reminds me of "mobile authentication" here. No idea how that works exactly.
[02:02:06] <Ilari> Also, if one has smartcards, the UX for SSL client certs isn't _that_ horrible (if you don't, it is fucking horrible).

[05:00:12] <Ilari> Dunno how true those security level estimates are. It is not like there is a way to verify those exactly.
[05:11:11] <Ilari> bascule: Yeah, I don't have much confidence in binary curves. And if I was to pick elliptic curve for wider breakage case, I would pick prime curve with few isogenous curves (in case one can walk isogenies to find vulernable curve).
[05:11:46] <Ilari> Because if it only has a few isogenous curves, it is more unlikely that weak curve is among those.
[05:14:23] <bascule> Ilari: haha yeah, it's also like... does it really matter?
[05:15:14] <bascule> Goldilocks isn't technically "256-bit security" but AES is vulnerable to multi-target attacks, so how do you really compare them?
[05:15:29] <bascule> I would still call Goldilocks "spinal tap grade" security
[05:15:35] <bascule> and recommend everyone just use Curve25519
[05:16:15] <bascule> what attack would break Goldilocks and not P-521?
[05:16:18] <bascule> or E-521
[05:17:59] <Ilari> And what's the security comparsion against attacker capable of 2^200 computation (which is freaking lot)?
[05:18:54] <eternaleye> And then there's that "computations" is a quirky metric
[05:19:05] <Ilari> Well, there is certain quantum qbit range that can break Goldilocks but not P-521/E-521. But at that level, ECC is pretty much doomed.
[05:19:29] <bascule> Ilari: yeah like, the thing is if QCs get that big, chances are they'll keep getting bigger?
[05:19:31] <eternaleye> Does it mean 2^200 DH computations, while for AES it means 2^whatever blocks encrypt ops?
[05:19:52] <Ilari> eternaleye: Yeah, there's that too.
[05:19:54] <eternaleye> Because, well, in cycles that could well be 2^12 or 2^18
[05:19:58] <bascule> I don't think quantum computers will get just big enough to break Goldilocks and then all technological progress is halted
[05:20:43] <Ilari> BTW, the amount of qbits needed to break E-521 is less than the amount it takes to break FFDH2k. :->
[05:21:00] <bascule> yeah I saw you mention that
[05:21:04] <eternaleye> I figure that by the time they're even making eyes at cuve25519 we ought to be switching to SIDH or similar wholesale
[05:21:05] <bascule> which is why I'm like
[05:21:09] <bascule> ok you want a backup fine
[05:21:15] <bascule> FFDHE instead of binary curves o_O
[05:22:06] <Ilari> (Also, the way TLS 1.3 does FFDHE is a lot more reasonable than TLS 1.2).
[05:22:08] <eternaleye> (Also, adding ephemeral SIDH should totally be accompanied by blog posts about TLS, now with elves.)
[05:22:33] <bascule> we tried to enable group 20 on some of our network gear today
[05:22:35] <bascule> failed :(
[05:23:05] <Ilari> bascule: How big is group 20?
[05:23:12] <eternaleye> bascule: Didn't you know? the G-20 never works right! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-20_major_economies
[05:23:15] <bascule> it's P-384 AFAIK
[05:23:21] <bascule> lol
[05:23:38] <bascule> I should look into group 19
[05:24:03] <Ilari> eternaleye: Well, one would have to figure out how to generate SIDH "groups".
[05:26:13] <Ilari> Then there's RLWE. Which looks to be a lot faster, with a lot larger keys and bit questionable base problem.
[05:26:46] <bascule> Ilari: I feel like once quantum computers get big enough to start challenging real-world public key cryptography, it's all doomed
[05:27:59] <Ilari> Then there's the problem of post-quantum signatures (but there I think situation is a bit better).
[05:28:38] <bascule> that's easy, just use SPHINCS! :D
[05:29:14] <bascule> at least if you don't mind signatures being 41kB lol
[05:29:31] <Ilari> Well, TLS can use signatures up to 64kB. :->
[05:30:31] <bascule> I feel like Lamport/Merkle signatures are actually a good, non-scary answer for post-quantum cryptography, whereas key exchange is still much more of an open question
[05:32:01] <Ilari> Also, the key exchange message size is limited by 64kB.
[05:32:41] <Ilari> And additionally, the scheme can only have only 1 key exchange message per endpoint, and must admit small fixed enumeration of parameters.
[05:35:13] <Ilari> AFAIK, both RLWE and SIDH would qualify.
[05:36:08] <eternaleye> Yup, and both also manage key erasure
[05:36:30] <eternaleye> Main thing is just seeing if they hold up, and getting SIDH to better speeds
[05:37:17] <eternaleye> (I don't think shrinking RLWE keys is going to happen much, but faster SIDH seems plausible, considering DJB is still publishing new ECC speed record papers :P)

[12:50:34] <Tiffany> I wonder why europe has so many unsecured embedded devices
[12:50:54] <mayski> we have no crime
[12:51:19] <Tiffany> http://internetcensus2012.bitbucket.org/images/clientmap_16to9_1600x900.jpg
[12:51:51] <mayski> actually looking at that finland's doing pretty well
[12:55:52] <Tiffany> http://internetcensus2012.bitbucket.org/images/hilbert_icmp_map_lowquality.jpg
[12:55:55] <Tiffany> this is kind of ridiculous
[12:56:26] <Elaine> the massive reserved blocks?
[12:56:40] <Tiffany> yeah
[12:56:55] <Tiffany> would we even be in the midst of a shortage if the address space was used efficiently?
[12:57:24] <Tiffany> 420 million hosts and most of the address space has already been parcelled out...
[12:57:28] <Elaine> probably not, but anything that advances ipv6 is good in my 
[12:57:30] <Elaine> ind
[13:00:45] <Elaine> besides, not every host responds to ping, although most with a publically routable address probably do.
[13:01:45] <Tiffany> I kind of doubt that ford is using their entire /8 with machines that don't respond to ping
[13:02:53] <Elaine> sure, and DEC has been out of business for like 20 years now
[13:03:13] <Tiffany> howcome that doesn't get reclaimed?
[13:03:27] <Elaine> I'm not familiar with how the internet dysfunctions :P
[13:04:30] <Tiffany> ah
[13:04:36] <Tiffany> the DEC block is now owned by HP, apparently
[13:04:40] <Tiffany> so they have two
[13:06:47] <Tiffany> apparently there's an /8 reserved for IP over amateur radio, which was never really common because of the overhead of IP for the very low baud rates of HF
[13:07:38] <Tiffany> https://portal.ampr.org/
[13:09:32] <Tiffany> the DoD has 13 /8s
[13:13:20] <Tiffany> it looks like the earlier dumb allocations are limited to the first quadrant though
[13:13:33] <Tiffany> I wonder how much this map has fleshed out in the past 3 years
[13:13:53] <Tiffany> I see multiple entirely unallocated ARIN blocks
[13:15:24] <Tiffany> at least AT&T is actually using their /8
[13:16:10] <Tiffany> the PSInet block is fleshed out a little, which appears to be because the block is now owned by cogent, and level3 has some stuff in theirs
[13:17:02] <Tiffany> hm
[13:17:12] <Tiffany> I suppose that some of these corporate /8s might still be in use on their internal networks
[13:25:29] <Tiffany> it looks like there were 36 million IP addresses which were not pingable but had a port open
[13:28:36] <eternaleye> Does USPS really need a /8?
[13:28:49] <Tiffany> I really have no idea what RIR was thinking back in the 80s
[13:28:56] <Tiffany> I mean, even in the 80s there were more than 256 organizations in the world
[13:29:50] <Tiffany> the class based allocation scheme never could have worked and I have no idea how anyone believed it could
[13:30:15] <Tiffany> well, you could make it work with IPv6, but there's no point
[13:31:57] <eternaleye> Well, now that CBA is dead in favor of CIDR, it might actually be possible to carve up the class E addresses...
[13:32:02] <eternaleye> https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1112#section-4
[13:32:14] <eternaleye> 240.0.0.0/4, the far upper-right block
[13:34:50] <Tiffany> future addressing modes huh
[13:36:47] <Tiffany> that is interestingly backwards
[13:37:04] <Tiffany> US has 1.5 billion addresses and .3 billion people, china has 1.3 billion people and .3 billion addresses
[13:37:29] <Tiffany> ouch, it's even worse for india
[13:37:46] <Tiffany> 34 million  addresses spread across 1.2 billion people
[13:53:20] <eternaleye> God dammit Dan Harkins, stop pushing TLS-pwd already.
[13:59:27] <Ilari> Well, IPv4 is mostly lost cause nowadays.

[16:32:11] <mcpherrin> Tiffany: Well, there were a lot of class B / class C networks; CBA wasn't totally daft
[16:32:25] <mcpherrin> just what "A lot" meant changed when everybody had computers :P
[16:33:23] <mcpherrin> People knew at the time it was a problem, but didn't have a good way to fix it
[16:34:33] <eternaleye> mcpherrin: I don't think allocating 16 million addresses to any one organization except _maybe_ a large government ever made sense...
[16:35:20] <eternaleye> mcpherrin: The US postal service is an especially silly one there, IMO
[16:35:51] <mcpherrin> eternaleye: Remember that USPS was, pre-internet, the most important communication system in the country
[16:36:02] <mcpherrin> eternaleye: I think it makes a *ton* of sense to give them an /8, if anybody
[16:36:21] <mcpherrin> Why, they might even come up with a scheme for electronic postal mail! 
[16:36:28] <mcpherrin> ;p
[16:36:51] <eternaleye> mcpherrin: heh, except allocating by "importance" is itself incredibly absurd - you allocate by _usage_
[16:37:12] <mcpherrin> eternaleye: Not in the early days ;p
[16:37:40] <eternaleye> It's actually one of the reasons I think the Xerox /8 is one of the least ridiculous
[16:37:58] <eternaleye> Because at the time, they were doing loads of innovation and experimentation, and would likely be _using_ the addresses
[16:38:10] <mcpherrin> anyways, we have CIDR nowadays
[16:38:17] <mcpherrin> so we can split those blocks up if we have to
[16:38:29] <mcpherrin> and a transfer market ;p
[16:38:53] <eternaleye> Honestly, I thing 240.0.0.0/4 is a good option for that...
[16:39:12] <eternaleye> 16 new /8's is nothing to sneeze at, and it's explicitly reserved for "future addressing"
[16:39:44] <Ilari> Thanks to compatiblity, those are forever "future addressing". :->
[16:40:12] <eternaleye> I dunno, might be worth testing to see if existing hardware accepts routes for it.
[16:40:36] <mcpherrin> It was a ton of pain getting 1.0.0.0/8 usable
[16:40:47] <eternaleye> I'd be surprised if it didn't: special-casing anything is more circuitry.
[16:40:51] <mcpherrin> as soon as routes for it were announced, it got flooded with people's shitty msiconfigured traffic ;p
[16:40:56] <eternaleye> True
[16:41:03] <mcpherrin> eternaleye: WRT route policies, that's software, not hardware
[16:41:18] <mcpherrin> I'm pretty sure the software I work on will reject routes for it as bogus
[16:41:24] <mcpherrin> (it's a small change, though)
[16:41:40] <mcpherrin> just gotta convince the users to upgrade their software :|
[16:42:01] <Ilari> I think fairly recent Linux versions refuse to assign class E addresses.
[16:42:37] <eternaleye> Anyway, cases like that are why I was super aggressive in making the startup I'm at switch from bogarting real IP space to 172.16.0.0/12
[16:43:06] <eternaleye> And moreover, leaving 172.16/16 unused
[16:43:36] <eternaleye> Since we have to deal with VPN from clients' networks, and most use either 192.168.0.0.0 or 10.0.0.0
[16:43:42] <eternaleye> er, minus a zero there
[16:43:57] <eternaleye> And the exceptions are on 172.16.0.0/16
[16:45:08] <Ilari> Well, the version I have accepts class E addresses for interfaces. But I think some supported distros still run kernels that don't. And dunno about Windows (does it still have some unusable addresses due to broadcast handlng)?
