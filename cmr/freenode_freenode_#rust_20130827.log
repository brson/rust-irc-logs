[20:05:20] <_Vi> I updated and the Rust repository and running "./configure && make"... Why does it downloading something from Internet (probably bootstrap things). Can't it use already installed Rust?
[20:06:46] <_Vi> I already see two existing rust-stage0-DATE-linux...tar.bz2. How often new ones are needed?
[20:11:50] <SiegeLord> A new snapshot is needed whenever you want to use some new feature inside the compiler itself
[20:12:36] <_Vi> SiegeLord, Can't it just build a snapshot instead of downloading one (if Rust is already installed)?
[20:12:56] <bstrie> _Vi: snapshots are built from prior snapshots
[20:13:16] <bstrie> all the way back to the original self-hosted rust compiler, years ago
[20:13:35] <_Vi> Am I updating Rust repository correctly? (using just "git pull" and "git submodule update", then configure & make)?
[20:13:40] <bstrie> _Vi: yep
[20:14:09] <bstrie> though you shouldn't need to configure manually after the first time
[20:14:14] <bstrie> make will do that for you
[20:14:18] <_Vi> (I expected "bootstrap" to be downloaded once, then compiler compiling compiler and so on locally...)
[20:14:46] <bstrie> not every new build is a snapshot. we only do snapshots when we need a new feature
[20:14:56] <bstrie> I mean, it's probably possible to make it that smart
[20:16:10] <SiegeLord> Well, considering stage3 exists, I don't think it's a good idea
[20:16:18] <bstrie> _Vi: but in order to get by without snapshots *at all*, you'd literally have to download the original ocaml-based compiler and build three years worth of compilers
[20:16:35] <SiegeLord> You want to start from a known starting point
[20:16:39] <bstrie> so at some point snapshots become necessary
[20:16:45] <bstrie> and at that point you might as well use them
[20:17:23] <_Vi> bstrie, I mean the situation when you update Rust, not initially build it.
[20:18:23] <bstrie> _Vi: that's what I mean. by necessity, we already have the machinery in place to download snapshots. so instead of doing anything more clever, we just reuse the compiled snapshots whenever we need a new one
[20:18:50] <rmmh> can rust cross-compile?
[20:18:54] <bstrie> it's certainly possible to manually create a snapshot yourself, but I've never done it
[20:18:56] <_Vi> "... the original ocaml-based compiler and build three years worth of compilers" -> BTW can it happen that there is some binary-only error that is chaining from snapshot to snapshot (broken compiler producing another broken compiler from correct source code)?
[20:18:57] <bstrie> rmmh: yes
[20:19:27] <bstrie> _Vi: part of our whole "compile this three times" rigamarole is to ensure that this doesn't happen
[20:19:34] <rmmh> _Vi: well, it's always possible to put a backdoor in the binary...
[20:19:39] <_Vi> (still downloading that 20MB...)
[20:19:52] <rmmh> in case anyone hasn't read it: http://cm.bell-labs.com/who/ken/trust.html
[20:21:14] <bstrie> rmmh: fortunately, nobody's writing login programs in rust just yet :)
[20:22:23] <_Vi> Will there be a [simplified] Rust compiler written in C that can bootstrap the full Rust compiler?
[20:23:12] <SiegeLord> Where will you get the simplification from?
[20:23:54] <bstrie> rmmh: one day there may be other rust compilers, and those compilers would necessarily be able to build rustc
[20:24:13] <SiegeLord> In the future what'll really happen is that you'll do sudo apt-get install rust 8)
[20:24:37] <rmmh> how does GCC's bootstrap work? doesn't it just do an unoptimized build first?
[20:25:02] <rmmh> untrusted cc -> basic GCC without optimizations -> full GCC
