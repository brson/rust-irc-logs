[03:40:39] <bascule> o_O https://www.blackhat.com/us-15/briefings.html#the-memory-sinkhole-unleashing-an-x86-design-flaw-allowing-universal-privilege-escalation
[03:42:16] <Ilari> Yeah, up to hypervisor, the memory protection is solid. Above that, not so much.
[03:46:27] <Ilari> And also, system bus can interfere with boot, no matter what one does (since DMA is not locked down on poweron / reset).
[04:14:20] <Ilari> bascule: Heh, reminds me that the way I print (rarely) is to stuff raw .ps to USB parallel port character device file...
[04:15:14] <bascule> heh
[04:17:27] <Ilari> I don't remember why I don't use non-USB parallel port. Maybe it was because I have lost the cable or that something is broken with that.
[04:18:36] <c74d> wow, that works with modern printers?
[04:19:19] <Ilari> Well, the printer is very old.
[04:19:23] <c74d> ah
[04:19:50] <c74d> new enough to use USB, though?
[04:20:20] <Ilari> Yeah. It has USB connector (which apparently just emulates parallel port)
[04:20:57] <Ilari> At least judging from the /dev/usb/lp* node it gets.

[16:34:31] <eddyb> that is beautiful!
[16:34:40] <bascule> :D
[16:34:41] <eddyb> it also looks so much better in a monospace font
[16:34:44] <bascule> yup
[16:34:48] <eddyb> though it's still not perfectly aligned
[16:34:53] <eddyb> have you considered box-drawing characters?
[16:35:02] <bascule> hahaha
[16:35:11] <bascule> there's plenty of fonts available
[16:35:15] <bascule> maybe some of them do that
[16:48:24] <Tiffany> only problem with having switched to source sans pro is that it ruins your ascii art
[16:48:42] <eddyb> bascule: the box drawing is part of unicode
[16:48:49] <eddyb> Tiffany: huh, why?
[16:48:52] <eddyb> (that's what I have)
[16:48:59] <eddyb> oh, "sans" not "code"
[16:49:05] <Tiffany> yeah
[16:49:25] <Tiffany> monospace -> source code pro; sans -> source sans pro
[16:49:48] <Tiffany> also, there needs to be a decent gui for fontconfig
[16:51:58] <eddyb> kde's is not amazing
[16:53:03] <Tiffany> it's absurd to me that users are unable to configure their preferred font
[16:53:23] <Tiffany> can you do it on windows or OS X though? I have no idea
[16:53:34] <Tiffany> I know you can pick between like two built in fonts on android, but I don't know if you can add your own
[16:53:47] <Tiffany> you can pick between like 8 on the kindle, and I'm pretty sure you can't add your own without rooting it
[16:54:16] <Tiffany> I had to edit the fontconfig xml in addition to changing configs for lots of applications which do not use or ignore fontconfig
[16:54:21] <bascule> people do change the system font on OS X, yes
[16:54:28] <bascule> that was actually a big deal recently
[16:54:30] <Tiffany> firefox, for example
[16:54:34] <bascule> because Apple switched it to Helvetica
[16:54:38] <bascule> and people got maaaaaad
[16:54:39] <bascule> lol
[16:54:55] <bascule> http://gizmodo.com/helvetica-is-the-worst-change-your-yosemite-font-to-sa-1668350413
[16:55:10] <Tiffany> I used to like helvetica until I realized my only point of reference was arial
[16:55:25] <Tiffany> which, despite being a TTF, always seems to be pixellated
[16:56:07] <bascule> heh
[16:56:26] <bascule> Arial is a nice little microcosm of Microsoft
[16:56:48] <Tiffany> I actually set arial and helvetica to be forcefully rewritten to source sans pro by fontconfig
[16:56:48] <bascule> crib someone else's work, imitate it poorly
[16:56:59] <bascule> make it arguably more popular than the original o_O
[16:57:08] <Tiffany> and now all of these news websites look decent
[16:57:24] <Tiffany> it's pretty sad
[16:57:48] <Tiffany> shitty default font -> everyone changes the default to something which is bad but supported everywhere -> changing default font does not fix ugly websites

[17:55:30] <Tobba> also installing helvetica means websites like twitter think you're a mac

[18:27:40] <bascule> yeah heh

[18:30:36] <Ilari> A8 4A 6A 63 04 7D DD BA E6 D1 39 B7 A6 45 65 EF F3 A8 EC A1
[18:48:00] <Ilari> Well, in scale of X.509 certs, that was very mild.
[18:54:32] <bascule> hahaha
[19:01:17] <Tobba> what was with the golang cert?
[19:10:10] <Ilari> Tobba: had SAN of "*.google".
[19:11:24] <Ilari> bascule: For genuine X.509 crazycert, you need things like KeyUsage bits set that make no sense for the algorithm, strange undocumented extensions and strings containing characters not in character set.
[19:25:41] <Tobba> Ilari: don't forget a comment field in russian
[19:25:56] <Tobba> or Linear A
[19:27:20] <Tobba> of course containing something that causes the certificate to make even less sense
[19:28:17] <Tiffany> are there crazycerts like this out in the wild?
[19:35:23] <Ilari> Tiffany: If you want to see really crazy certs, look at various "qualified signature" certs. PKIX certs don't tend to be that crazy.
[19:40:39] <Ilari> Tiffany: I think there was some vendor that was a standout even in the generally crazy crowd, but I don't remember what it was (IIRC, it was some german one).

[22:17:25] <bascule> Tobba: do you understand the normal wildcard rules? They're rather complicated
[22:17:40] <bascule> and in fact RFC 6125 which is the canonical source on them is agnostic to gTLD vs ccTLD vs brand/vanity rules
[22:18:10] <bascule> ordinarily wildcards are not allowed on gTLDs or ccTLDs
[22:18:36] <bascule> following that same idea, they shouldn't be allowed on brand/vanity TLDs either
[22:20:01] <Tobba> bascule: interesting
[22:20:29] <bascule> Tobba: yeah, like, *.co.uk shouldn't be treated differently from *.com for example
