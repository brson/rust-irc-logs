[00:28:42] <larsberg> edunham: saw your awesome blog post (http://edunham.net/2015/07/06/mozilla_onboarding.html), and glad the experience was good!
[00:29:28] <edunham> larsberg: thanks! git history would tell an embarrassing story of "1 week at mozilla"... "3 weeks at mozilla"... "oops it's been more than a month, just call it onboarding and publish"
[00:29:40] <larsberg> btw, "meet only 80% of the critiera" is super generous. I'd say at least half the applicants have nearly zero relevant qualifications for the positions.
[00:29:54] <edunham> oO wow
[00:30:14] <edunham> then again, if 200 people apply to a given job and 1 gets it, the other 199 go and apply to the next job
[00:30:26] <larsberg> It's consistent with my experience as a hiring manager at Microsoft, too (though I had dedicated recruiters who helped, so I didn't see as many forklift drivers, etc. as I do now)
[00:31:04] <edunham> ah yes, http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2005/01/27.html is what I was looking for.
[00:31:42] <edunham> oh yeah, I guess I didn't get the "did you read your own resume?" chat until after I'd been approved by a real team member
[00:31:47] <edunham> that seems like a kind of funny workflow
[00:33:27] <larsberg> I usually just try to filter out obviously unqualified and at least phone screen most other people. I will say the hit rate is higher for experienced candidates here than Microsoft - I think I hired or saw zero people hired via resume submission. It was all either solicitation by hiring manager or internal referral.
[00:33:52] <edunham> what department were you in at Microsoft?
[00:34:04] <larsberg> Developer Division (Visual Studio)
[00:34:43] <larsberg> also, if you were just being nice in the blog post, you should definitely tell us what we can improve. Mozilla has a... shall we say poor? reputation for its hiring process :-)
[00:35:02] <edunham> no, I was seriously amazed
[00:35:22] <edunham> firstly, because my process of attempting to get an internship here a couple years ago was hilariously bad
[00:35:58] <edunham> and secondly, because I expect all technical interviews to be as bad as the worst one I ever had (yay logical fallacies)
[00:36:29] <edunham> so my expectations weren't super high, but throughout the whole process Moz really seemed to have its act together
[00:36:54] <huon> edunham: (typo in your post "ge ttheir")
[00:36:59] <edunham> huon: thanks
[00:38:16] <larsberg> awesome :-) If anything comes to mind, though, definitely let me know (or somebody else, if I'm the culprit). We've lost more than one candidate in the past due to poor/slow/awkward process and it's hard to see from the inside, especially when I'm juggling a bunch of candidates at once :-(
[00:38:18] <edunham> larsberg: the only annoying part was how before every technical interview, I politely asked the recruiters whether there were any particular topics I should brush up on or prep for, and every single time they made like they hadn't even recieved the email
[00:39:18] <larsberg> edunham: Ha! I'll talk with them about that. The right answer is that unfortunately every team is different and the only way they would really know is to talk to the hiring manager and possibly also the interviewer. We don't have the same kind of rigorous "this is How We Do Interviews" culture that some places have
[00:39:26] <edunham> it was kind of obnoxious, and there've been times when I was less confident when I would've taken it very personally, second guessed everything, and bombed the interviews due to being stressed out by it
[00:39:39] <edunham> but tbh, I think that's a reasonable weed-out for finding candidates who can handle a bit of uncertainty :)
[00:40:17] <larsberg> yeah, but it's not consistent, because I've seen recruiters get annoyed when candidates don't reply to questions, so we should hold ourselves to the same standard
[00:40:19] <edunham> yeah even a generic "it'll probably relate to the skills listed in the job description" would've been polite, rather than total silence
[00:41:26] <larsberg> I'll also try to keep an eye on it, but jobvite (our interview tracking tool) is only marginally better than the nightmare-inducing workday HR tool
[00:41:40] <Elaine> Ouch, that's a pretty harsh critique.
[00:41:56] <edunham> I found it funny how consistent they were in ignoring those questions, though
[00:42:00] <larsberg> Elaine: "slightly better than workday" or "nightmare-inducing"? :-)
[00:42:06] <Elaine> larsberg: "slightly better than workday"
[00:42:11] <larsberg> lol
[00:42:44] <edunham> larsberg: I'm glad you enjoyed the post :)
[00:44:05] <larsberg> edunham: definitely! Thanks for writing it. Interview processes can be mysterious, and the extra info helps future candidates, too.

[16:24:11] <Manishearth> I'm using an Ubuntu laptop at *Microsoft*. And today two team members saw me playing detective with binaries to locate a bug that we've been unable to pinpoint for weeks and were like "wow, Linux is really good at these things"
[16:24:25] <larsberg> Manishearth: Two points. #1, that question is actually pretty nice because there are a bunch of valid approaches. #2, back in ~2000, "add element to a linked list" was basically fizzbuzz :-)
[16:24:39] <Manishearth> boo fizzbuzz
[16:24:53] <Manishearth> larsberg: yeah, actually that's probably an okay question
[16:25:30] * larsberg suspects Manishearth has never spent 12 hour days interviewing new college grads back to back with only a half an hour for lunch or he would also appreciate the need for a very straightforward problem...
[16:25:58] <Manishearth> larsberg: I have spent 6 hours interviewing college undergrads back to back but that was more relaxed :P

And for the pre-palcement interviews, they had a whole presentation a few weeks ago
[16:30:30] <Manishearth> *placement
[16:31:07] <Manishearth> I think that was pretty nice -- I didn't trip up due to an impedance mismatch of expectations
[16:32:58] <Manishearth> I mean, don't expect the interviees to ask the recruiter for clarification. That might accidentally exclude the more timid. Expect the recruiters to sync with the candidates.

[16:37:11] <larsberg> Manishearth: yeah, Microsoft and the rest are pretty good about that now, due largely to the basically random failure rate associated with "did you search for `microsoft college grad interview tips` before coming?" Much bigger problem for new college grads, at least circa-2005, though I hear this internet search thing has become big since then.

[17:34:00] <Manishearth> Not seen WinDBG
[17:34:32] *** Parts: dholbert (dholbert@moz-pnm275.static.fusionbroadband.com) ("Ex-Chat")
[17:34:43] <pcwalton> ollydbg is useful for debugging on Windows if you're desperate and don't mind asm
[17:34:57] <pcwalton> it's designed to give you as good an experience as possible for source-less debugging
[17:35:08] <pcwalton> (e.g. for reverse engineering)
[17:35:48] <Manishearth> pcwalton: I'm debugging Android NDK stuff via visual studio
[17:36:02] <pcwalton> hmm ,ok
[17:36:21] <Manishearth> (i.e. I *was* debugging until I gave up with the slowness and the brokenness of it all and went back to log-statement-rebuild)
[17:36:41] <Manishearth> pcwalton: I've used ollydbg, but I like readelf/objdump/gdb better for reverse engineering
[17:37:14] <Manishearth> I'm actually doing that right now. We have a very strange bug that only happens to code in the office build system, but not if I take code out of the build system and use the same flags
[17:37:28] <Manishearth> copying fiels to linux and reversing away
[17:37:31] <Manishearth> *files
[17:37:39] <pcwalton> all I can say is that I can't imagine how you prefer gdb :)
[17:37:45] <pcwalton> but whatever works for you of course
[17:37:50] <Manishearth> pcwalton: never used lldb :)
[17:38:09] <pcwalton> lldb has a pretty bad UI
[17:38:19] <pcwalton> they've improved it but they really started in the wrong place sadly
[17:38:21] <Manishearth> ah, you mean olly? Yeah, olly is good, just not used to it
[17:38:26] <pcwalton> (commands are way too long)
[17:38:50] <pcwalton> lldb is really well engineered but they needed a better UX designer :)

[19:45:58] <nrc> I loved debugging with VS, so good
[19:46:52] <nrc> I kind of hated windbg, because whenever I had to fall back to that rather than VS it meant it was going to be a really hard problem to fix (also the UI cf VS)
[19:47:31] <larsberg> nrc: agreed. windbg usually meant I was remote kernel debugging video driver problems, which is never how you want to spend your day :-)

[21:08:21] <khuey> roc: so while recording a mochitest run that crashes, rr is hanging after the browser shuts down

[21:11:44] <khuey> it seems to be addr2line processes that are hung
[21:15:12] <khuey> they seem to be stuck on a SIGHUP
[21:16:24] <roc> ok
