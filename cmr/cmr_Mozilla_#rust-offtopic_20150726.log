[00:28:29] <Tiffany> fkaa: pretty easy
[00:28:40] <Tiffany> you could even have bytecode loading that isn't a gaping security hole!
[00:30:52] <fkaa> cliffhanger!
[00:31:00] <fkaa> what happened to the bytecode
[00:31:37] <Tobba> fkaa: the lua interpreter has basically no checks whatsoever
[00:31:39] <Tiffany> fkaa: lua bytecode is not considered arbitrary input-safe
[00:31:43] <Tiffany> and has multiple outstanding RCEs
[00:32:05] <Tiffany> the easiest of which involves malicious for loop instructions
[00:32:08] <Tiffany> which lack type checking
[00:32:19] <Tiffany> leading to arbitrary memory read/write and eventually RCE
[00:32:35] <Tiffany> lua 5.2 added a thing to let you disable bytecode loading
[00:32:46] <Tiffany> in lua 5.1, you have to ban it manually by checking for the signature

[01:11:05] <Peach> can someone explain C++11's thread system to me please
[01:11:10] <Peach> How do I use it right
[01:11:16] <Peach> I mean, I got a thread going
[01:11:45] <Peach> but dettach appears to crash, I can only do join for things to not crash 
[01:12:22] <Astraea> WindowsBunny: want to work on that project?
[01:12:41] <Elaine> Peach: steps to reproduce?
[01:12:46] <WindowsBunny> Astraea: Right now it is evening, time for me to sleep :D
[01:12:53] <eddyb> Elaine: pretty clear this is stack memory at work :P
[01:13:01] <Astraea> what is sleep?
[01:13:19] <eddyb> Peach: detach makes the thread run independently, join waits for it to finish before returning to the caller (of join)
[01:13:24] <Astraea> anyway, I pulled up a paper on all the conversions
[01:13:43] <Astraea> how complex are you thinking this library should be, WindowsBunny? heh
[01:13:43] <WindowsBunny> Astraea: Just to get you outraged at how everyone fails to handle sRGB correctly, http://www.4p8.com/eric.brasseur/gamma.html
[01:14:05] <Astraea> so... complex then
[01:14:06] <eddyb> Peach: you need to join threads that point to the spawning thread's stack, otherwise they might continue to run after that spawning thread is gone (including its stack)
[01:14:16] <WindowsBunny> Astraea: I'm thinking... having RGB colorspaces with a type parameter with associated consts for their various parameters
[01:14:18] <Elaine> Astraea: see also http://ninedegreesbelow.com/photography/srgb-profile-comparison.html
[01:14:25] <WindowsBunny> like which white point they use and shiz
[01:14:41] <Peach> Ok, so - when I launch a thread, does it have its own heap? If I try to allocate/free when on a thread is that an error?
[01:14:44] <Astraea> a friend of mine is a game developer
[01:14:46] <eddyb> Peach: if you use detached threads, you need to only share resources between them with shared_ptr and mutex (or rw_lock)
[01:14:51] <Elaine> Peach: no and no, it's global and shared.
[01:14:53] <Astraea> he has raged about this topic multiple times
[01:14:54] <eddyb> Peach: it has its own stack
[01:14:57] <Elaine> (using the default allocator)
[01:15:15] <Elaine> same address spaces.
[01:15:16] <Astraea> well, I will have to do some serious reading
[01:15:31] <Elaine> should totally send patches to https://github.com/bjz/color-rs ;P
[01:15:34] <eddyb> Peach: this is all stuff that Rust enforces automatically, and in C++11 you have to keep track of manually :P
[01:15:34] <Peach> Maybe I'm doing it wrong or C++03 tinythread doesn't work well on my system - Sometimes I get a crash when calling free on a tread
[01:15:38] <WindowsBunny> Astraea: If you're not outraged at all the shoddy implementations, then you haven't read enough
[01:15:41] <Astraea> Elaine: or I can do that
[01:15:54] <WindowsBunny> Elaine: I think we might have to completely refactor that library
[01:16:04] <eddyb> Peach: you're likely sharing things you shouldn't, between threads
[01:16:09] <Astraea> WindowsBunny: there's shoddy implementations of practically everything, I can't be mad at everything
[01:16:16] <Peach> eddyb: I'd use Rust but..... I can't use it for compiling apps on iOS :(
[01:16:18] <Astraea> I'll die of a heart attack young if I do =P
[01:16:22] <eddyb> Peach: or sharing without synchronization (locking or atomics)
[01:16:43] <Astraea> young'ish anyway
[01:16:49] <eddyb> Peach: you mean you need ObjC or Swift to access Apple's APIs?
[01:16:59] <Elaine> Peach: you can use it for compiling apps on iOS.
[01:17:09] <Elaine> I have a game in development (pure Rust of course) that builds and runs on iOS.
[01:17:13] <Peach> Yeah I'd need full ObjC access and C++ access to the rest
[01:17:25] <Peach> of frameworks and whatnot
[01:17:31] <Peach> C++ can interop with ObjC nice
[01:17:35] <Peach> but I dunno about Rust
[01:17:38] <Astraea> Peach: you can interface with ObjC from Rust
[01:17:50] <Astraea> C++ is a different matter
[01:17:51] <Elaine> Nicer than C++, if you're not using ObjC++
[01:18:00] <Elaine> (which you likely are)
[01:18:09] <Astraea> although, it's still a bit messy interfacing with ObjC
[01:18:11] <Astraea> ugh
[01:18:13] <Peach> How does Rust compile Elaine ? Can you submit Rust apps to app store?
[01:18:17] <eddyb> Elaine: how hard is it to build a glutin+glium app for iOS?
[01:18:27] <Astraea> maybe I will look back into rust+objc integration
[01:18:33] <Astraea> it's really not too difficult (except ARC)
[01:18:34] <eddyb> Elaine: IIRC on android you used a tool and maybe some startup shim, nothing too big

[01:19:08] <eddyb> you aren't Astrum, are you?
[01:19:08] <Astraea> eddyb: well I changed my name from Astrum|Lap
[01:19:09] <Elaine> eddyb: unfortunately the iOS port is using SDL2 right now, not Glutin.
[01:19:11] <Peach> What where Elaine ?
[01:19:13] <eddyb> goddammit
[01:19:31] <WindowsBunny> Astraea: Fak, now I have to realign all my memories of Astrum with you
[01:19:40] <Astraea> heh
[01:19:51] <eddyb> Astraea: you seem derpier and I'm not sure if it's *just* the username
[01:20:05] <eddyb> I also was oblivious to the name similarities
[01:20:25] <Peach> Also besides technical ability, Rust has 2 major obstacles - a lack of a rich Rust IDE for my system and, and learning the syntax is an investment for a language that isn't back by a tech giant
[01:20:44] <eddyb> lol
[01:20:48] <Elaine> ^
[01:20:55] <Astraea> eddyb: I changed my name after a discussion with niconii and a few others over gender
[01:21:01] <Peach> Well you can ignore the last one :P
[01:21:04] <eddyb> the tech giant thing is quite the shallow argument
[01:21:06] <Astraea> also I like the sound of this name
[01:21:07] <Peach> But the IDE thing though
[01:21:19] <eddyb> I agree on the IDE bit
[01:21:30] <eddyb> but only because I deal with the compiler
[01:21:39] <eddyb> you know, over 150 thousand lines of code
[01:21:42] <Astraea> anyway, I'll look back into objc-rust integration
[01:21:43] <Peach> Yeah, without an IDE with nice errors I can't use Rust :(
[01:21:47] <Astraea> I know D has a branch that can do it
[01:21:50] <scott> What library should I use to play with basic OpenGL in Rust?
[01:22:01] <Astraea> and what clang does for objc actually isn't all that complex
[01:22:02] *** Quits: Havvy (Havvy@moz-epv20b.wa.comcast.net) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[01:22:22] <eddyb> if you are building something that's less than a tenth of the compiler, you have room to breathe without an IDE
[01:22:22] <Elaine> scott: glium is the nicest high-level library.
[01:22:26] <Peach> How well does Rust interact with C++ ?
[01:22:30] <Elaine> scott: but if you want raw opengl, gl-rs is the only option
[01:22:38] <eddyb> Peach: you need to go through C on both sides
[01:22:39] <scott> Elaine: Thanks
[01:22:41] <Astraea> Peach: C++ doesn't have a stable ABI
[01:22:45] <Peach>  ;-;
[01:22:51] <eddyb> Astraea: well, that's almost entirely irrelevant
[01:22:55] <Astraea> err... not stable
[01:22:56] <eddyb> C++ has templates
[01:22:57] <Astraea> standardized
[01:23:12] <eddyb> for Rust to call into C++, it needs to instantiate templates
[01:23:17] <Elaine> Astraea: the Itanium ABI is de-facto standard, and regardless we could target each platform's ABI with libclang.
[01:23:24] <Astraea> eddyb: yeah, templates are an issue, then again macros are an issue with C
[01:23:26] <Elaine> But C++ and Rust have fundamentally incompatible type systems.
[01:23:47] <Peach> Guys so can I at least get a nice Rust IDE?
[01:23:49] <Peach> : (
[01:24:00] <eddyb> Peach: what do you need an IDE for?
[01:24:02] <Astraea> Peach: I've considered making a non-textual rust editor
[01:24:05] <eddyb> I mean, what do you mainly use it for?
[01:24:10] <Elaine> Peach: there's Visual Rust.
[01:24:14] <Astraea> but... it'd take me forever
[01:24:25] <Peach> eddyb: searching across multiple files all at once
[01:24:27] <eddyb> Astraea: with auroraes and stuff?
[01:24:30] <eddyb> Peach: pffft
[01:24:31] <Elaine> Really? THat's it?
[01:24:36] <eddyb> kate does that
[01:24:40] <Elaine> Every text editor worth its name can do that
[01:24:42] <Astraea> eddyb: auroraes?
[01:24:47] <eddyb> it does that even for, I don't know, CSV files
[01:25:05] <Peach> Elaine: not search within one file
[01:25:14] <Peach> I mean search in all source files in project
[01:25:17] <Elaine> I know what you said.
[01:25:18] <eddyb> Elaine: now that I think about it, yeah, you're right
[01:25:30] <Elaine> seriously every text editor I've used has that capability.
[01:25:42] <eddyb> (kate didn't until a year ago or so)
[01:25:47] <Peach> but Elaine , without having to open any files first?
[01:25:49] <eddyb> (or maybe I never knew about it!)
[01:25:49] <WindowsBunny> notepad++ doesn't have the concept of a project, unless you use plugins
[01:25:52] <eddyb> Peach: yupp
[01:25:53] <Peach> Ah
[01:25:56] <eddyb> Peach: I use it all the time
[01:26:09] <Peach> How about inline compiler warnings
[01:26:09] <Elaine> WindowsBunny: who uses notepad++ without plugins though :P
[01:26:10] <Peach> ?
[01:26:14] <Astraea> ah, let me get some caffeine in me then I'll look into objc-rust stuff
[01:26:19] <Elaine> Peach: most of them.
[01:26:24] <Peach> and a visual line highlight with  ^  showing me where the error is
[01:26:37] <Astraea> let's hope libobjc, clang, and ld64 are in sync now
[01:26:40] <eddyb> that stuff is *easy*
[01:26:51] <Peach> and it needs to handle 1000+ errors at once when I break my code base
[01:26:55] <WindowsBunny> Elaine: Because I just want it to be a good text editor, not a text editor with a bunch of plugins bolted on trying to make it act like an IDE
[01:27:00] <WindowsBunny> Elaine: If I want an IDE I just use VS
[01:27:16] <Astraea> although I have no clue how to handle memory management from ObjC in Rust...
[01:27:22] <Peach> And I don't want to use the command line to build anything 
[01:27:26] <Peach> that's why I like IDEs
[01:27:31] <eddyb> Peach: pfffft
[01:27:35] <eddyb> that's not what an IDE does
[01:27:48] <eddyb> that's what a decent multi-file text editor does
[01:27:59] <eddyb> that's entirely language-agnostic
[01:28:06] <Peach> inline compile error messages eddyb ? >:(
[01:28:16] <eddyb> mhmm
[01:28:22] <Peach> semantic highlight? class scope lookup?
[01:28:23] <WindowsBunny> VisualRust provides inline error messages, I think
[01:28:37] <eddyb> Peach: hey now, the last two you haven't mentioned yet
[01:28:37] <WindowsBunny> It doesn't do anything more than trivial syntax highlighting though
[01:28:45] <eddyb> don't cheat :P
[01:28:52] <Peach> well I wasn't done yet eddyb :P
[01:28:57] <WindowsBunny> VS has really awesome C++ highlighting
[01:29:15] <eddyb> WindowsBunny: did it rip off kdevelop :P?
[01:29:18] <Peach> eddyb:  don't pfft your chickens before they hatch
[01:29:26] <eddyb> Peach: ahahahahaha
[01:29:26] <Peach> :P
[01:29:26] <WindowsBunny> eddyb: No, it has its own thing
[01:29:33] <Elaine> WindowsBunny: The VB.NET VS integration is the best of any language.
[01:29:36] <eddyb> WindowsBunny: I mean, last I used it it had barely anything
[01:29:38] <Elaine> And the fastest.
[01:29:47] <Elaine> for whatever reason
[01:29:56] <WindowsBunny> eddyb: When did you last use it?
[01:29:57] <eddyb> WindowsBunny: around the same time, kdevelop had *something*
[01:30:15] <eddyb> 2010-ish, maybe? actually, I touched 2012 at some point
[01:30:30] <WindowsBunny> eddyb: Did you know most of the C++ syntax highlighting is unused
[01:30:37] <WindowsBunny> like it tracks the info, but doesn't color them differently
[01:30:44] <eddyb> and it didn't seem more impressive than CodeBlocks or some other boring stuff
[01:30:48] <eddyb> WindowsBunny: lol
[01:30:49] <WindowsBunny> but you can configure it in the fonts & colors settings
[01:30:59] <WindowsBunny> So I have it rainbow as fuck
[01:31:01] <eddyb> now that's a missed opportunity at being useful
[01:31:05] <eddyb> by default
[01:31:13] <WindowsBunny> its so colorful, but it really helps to distinguish things
[01:31:20] <eddyb> Peach: do you mean something specific by "semantic" highlight, or is it just "syntax highlighting"?
[01:31:44] <eddyb> Peach: and I have no idea what "class scope lookup" is because "class" doesn't actually *mean* anything
[01:31:47] <WindowsBunny> eddyb: I'd show you a screenshot, but I have to reboot to open VS since I just installed the new VS 2015
[01:31:51] <eddyb> (as opposed to "type class")
[01:31:52] <Peach> eddyb: semantic highlight means the editor highlights macros and classes and functions differently
[01:32:00] <Peach> so more than just syntax
[01:32:06] <eddyb> well, the macro thing is solved for Rust :P
[01:32:10] <Tiffany> elaine: maybe it's faster to parse VB?
[01:32:22] <eddyb> Tiffany: compared to C++?
[01:32:27] <Elaine> eddyb: compared to C#
[01:32:30] <eddyb> hmm
[01:32:36] <eddyb> still simpler
[01:32:51] <Elaine> the C++ engine is still primitive compared to the .NET ecosystem.
[01:33:09] <Elaine> can't even live edit code while debugging ;)
[01:33:39] <WindowsBunny> eddyb: VS's intellisense does the equivalent of a compile on all your code, except no codegen, and can cope with typos and stuff. So it knows _exactly_ what everything is
[01:33:40] <eddyb> I am still amazed I can live edit JS in v8
[01:34:00] <WindowsBunny> it knows whether a function is a regular method, a static method, a templated method, and so on
[01:34:25] <eddyb> I have no idea what happens if you fudge a long-running loop *while* it's running
[01:35:24] <eddyb> it's probably more like Erlang's "new calls get the new version"

[01:45:31] <eddyb> you still have those extra spaces :P

[01:46:52] <scott> Like other things with curly braces.
[01:47:20] <scott> Peach: You can add pointless silly whitespace to most languages.
[01:47:39] <Peach> should it be a syntax error?
[01:47:45] <Peach> style enforcing?
[01:48:07] <scott> Probably not. I would say just provide a tool like gofmt.
[01:48:50] <c74d> Peach: it is in my programming language concept
[01:49:00] <Peach> mine too
[01:49:13] <Peach> Though in mine, it's only enforced where it's needed
[01:49:22] <Peach> Like  single line if statements are allowed,
[01:49:25] <Elaine> if the language I'm going to use enforces style, why does it even have text as the primary input mechanism?
[01:49:30] <Peach> but not if the indent is wrong
[01:49:36] <eddyb> Elaine++
[01:49:48] <Peach> Elaine ?
[01:49:55] <Elaine> Syntax-directed editing is an ancient, underused technology.
[01:50:02] <Elaine> just because it went over poorly the first time
[01:50:06] <Peach> ???
[01:50:14] <Peach> Elaborate Elaine maybe we can bring it back
[01:50:17] <scott> Warning on inconsistent indentation could be a nice feature in any language.
[01:50:18] <Elaine> look it up
[01:50:27] <eddyb> hmm
[01:50:34] <c74d> For me: because text is easy... like reference-counting GC.
[01:50:48] <Elaine> Is text easy, though?
[01:50:57] <Elaine> Our tools are text-oriented, but they don't have to be.
[01:51:20] <eddyb> actually, Rust's value flow could be represented interestingly in 2D
[01:51:24] <eddyb> or... 3D
[01:51:43] <eddyb> just like 3D microchips :P
[01:51:51] <c74d> Compared to writing a GUI to manage some non-textual representat... hm... actually that sounds easier, with a GUI toolkit.
[01:52:08] <Peach> I can't imaging source code being GUI oriented, that would complicate things
[01:52:21] <scott> paredit-mode is probably the closest thing to a non-textual interface I've used for code, even though it was still technically text. But the point is that every command (except for a few escape hatches) preserved the syntactical correctness of the code.
[01:52:23] <Elaine> It's not "GUI oriented", it's structure oriented.
[01:52:33] <scott> paredit is very structure-oriented
[01:53:08] <Elaine> I can't find the excellent prototype I saw a few years ago
[01:53:09] * eddyb is already imagining chaining iterator combinators like a very satisfying combo
[01:53:14] *** Joins: mrx_ (mrx@moz-jpl.2ko.181.87.IP)
[01:53:19] <scott> It would be challenging but interesting to design a system like that for a more complicated syntax.
[01:53:22] <eddyb> but it's 5am and I'm seeing things
[01:53:37] <Elaine> most languages aren't amenable to structured editing I think.
[01:53:45] <Elaine> wouldn't want to do it with Rust or C++ I think.
[01:53:58] <c74d> What would the non-textual editor store its structures as? Text? Or some Smalltalk-like thing?
[01:54:11] <Elaine> c74d: serialized AST, perhaps.
[01:54:27] <eddyb> MIR! :P
[01:54:28] *** Quits: ytain (ytain@moz-u0rb5h.dsl.teksavvy.com) (Quit: Textual IRC Client: www.textualapp.com)
[01:54:30] <scott> The other issue for adoption is that text is easy to use at a base level for everyone, while the structured system is less accessible. Unless it saves in a plain text format, too.
[01:54:34] <Peach> Elaine: so it would be somehing that lets you edit a language's AST?
[01:54:41] <Elaine> It's not that there can't be canonical text forms
[01:54:51] <Elaine> see LLVM's textual IR vs bitcode
[01:55:00] <scott> Peach: That's the essential idea. All your actions transforms ASTs instead of raw textual source code.
[01:55:07] <eddyb> Elaine: imagine having a canonical Rust source form for MIR

[01:55:38] <Peach> I'm thinking about C++
[01:55:42] <eddyb> I guess macro expansion would make it nasty
[01:55:50] <c74d> My programming language's syntax is intended to be directly equivalent to AST, so I might as well have the textual editing first and build any non-textual editing atop it.
[01:56:00] <eddyb> Elaine: recombining temporaries into complex expressions, that kind of stuff
[01:56:20] <eddyb> picking minimal type hints

[01:56:45] <Elaine> Undecidable, probably.
[01:56:54] <Elaine> Although maybe not for Rust, right now.
[01:56:57] <Peach> Elaine: how would macros even work with non text editing in a programming language?
[01:57:10] <Elaine> Peach: Why wouldn't they work?
[01:57:16] <eddyb> Peach: just like functions would
[01:57:17] <Elaine> Make your macros structural.
[01:57:23] <Elaine> a la scheme
[01:57:24] <Peach> The AST though
[01:57:34] <eddyb> Elaine: pretty Nim does that
[01:57:39] <eddyb> *pretty sure
[01:57:41] <c74d> There's some sugar, and some things like comments that are "special", but fewer such things than Scheme.
[01:57:50] <Peach> and what about C style #include
[01:58:01] <eddyb> Peach: the C preprocessor is just terrible
[01:58:08] <eddyb> you don't want #include
[01:58:12] <eddyb> you don't want #define
[01:58:17] <eddyb> there are better ways (TM)
[01:58:24] <Elaine> Peach: cpp isn't structural, why put a square peg in a round hole?
[01:58:51] <eddyb> isn't it a triangle?
[01:58:56] <Peach> ^
[01:58:59] <eddyb> I don't think they had invented squares yet
[01:59:05] <Peach> :P
[01:59:08] * eddyb shows himself out
[01:59:27] <Peach> Well!
[01:59:36] <Peach> I think what would be cool is maybe
[01:59:59] <scott> C++11 created a second shared_ptr reference to that triangle and reoriented it with the original to form a square
[02:00:03] <Peach> You can shrink function calls etc to a drop down menu when you browse code
[02:00:08] <scott> But then, oops, the original triangle got flipped, too
[02:00:35] <scott> Drop down menus suck though :P
[02:00:36] <Peach> so you'd see:     >  print
[02:00:45] <Peach> and then V  print would contain
[02:00:51] <Peach> x,y,z,etc.
[02:01:05] <Peach> so code can be viewed more compact
[02:01:06] <eddyb> (random thought: I added an API to rustc to be able to control how source files are loaded from disk and I haven't used it yet...)
[02:01:10] <scott> Code folding is already a thing
[02:01:23] <Peach> code folding for function calls though scott ?
[02:01:26] <Peach> and expressions?
[02:01:43] <eddyb> horizontal folding pls
[02:01:52] <eddyb> it's not a hard thing though
[02:02:02] <Peach> a*b*+c-1    ->  Expression that you can drill down to see each part
[02:02:09] <Peach> like an AST browse feature
[02:02:27] <scott> I write my code so I can read it without folding and unfolding stuff
[02:02:27] <Elaine> Having an "associate" hotkey would be neat.
[02:02:34] <Elaine> it'd sort of blow-up and show how the expression parses.
[02:02:42] <Elaine> I often have trouble with associativity and precedence.
[02:02:54] <scott> A precedence display would be great
[02:02:55] <Elaine> it never matches my intuition so I just paren everywhere
[02:03:01] <eddyb> Elaine: coloring or some 3D effect would be really sweet
[02:03:03] <Elaine> even when I write the damn parser
[02:03:18] <scott> "Show All Implicit Parens"
[02:03:22] <Elaine> J is nice for that.
[02:03:29] <Elaine> just one long train
[02:03:32] <scott> Or even tree-format it in the case of binary operators
[02:04:38] <eddyb> IDE wishlist #569: pattern-matching over value/control-flow
[02:05:27] <eddyb> if _ { .. (_: Foo).Bar(..) }
[02:05:43] <scott> If I had my own IDE backed with a good semantic engine... I would add all kinds of nonsense as it occurred to me.
[02:05:48] <eddyb> if you think that's useless, try writing regex for it
[02:06:00] <Elaine> eddyb: you should look into tree automata
[02:06:08] <eddyb> I probably should :P
[02:06:10] <Elaine> it's a neat little corner of computation theory.
[02:06:16] <Elaine> lots of fun stuff to play with
[02:06:49] * Peach adds "Show Expression breakdown" to IDE features
[02:08:12] <Elaine> it's both rich and almost completely barren at the same time.
[02:08:18] <Elaine> very few agreed upon conventions.
[02:09:29] <scott> What's the deal with gfx (as opposed to glium)? More ambitious, less mature, plans to target more than one backend?
[02:09:35] <Peach> a+b*3-1 ->    a+(b*3)-1
[02:09:55] <Peach> it should show step by step what gets evaluated

[02:18:20] <c74d> who?
[02:18:42] <niconii> Elaine: oh, guess i missed it, but yeah, rust accepts arbitrary whitespace between pretty much every token
[02:19:00] <niconii> and newlines are whitespace, so... http://is.gd/6Lpu4d
[02:19:08] <Elaine> niconii: yeah it's unsurprising once I put an ounce of thought into it.
[02:19:29] <Elaine> I do think at some point the ! got sucked into the identifier
[02:19:40] <Elaine> which is why I got confused

[02:23:44] <Elaine> multiline strings are the only string, yo.
[02:23:54] <niconii> Peach: rust accepts literal newlines in strings, yes
[02:24:11] <Peach> Oh oh
[02:24:18] <Astraea> so how open would the core rust team be to some additions to rustc to support objc interop
[02:24:27] <Elaine> Astraea: depends on how invasive they are.
[02:24:42] <scott> Astraea: What needs to be done that can't be done in a compiler extension?
[02:24:57] <Elaine> Astraea: if you can restrict it to a few attributes and a completely separate codepath, that'd be nice.
[02:25:11] <Astraea> scott: I've been away rust for probably 10 months, what can compiler extensions do?
[02:25:20] <scott> I don't really know :P
[02:25:29] <Elaine> Astraea: programmatic AST transformation
[02:25:39] <Elaine> also, lints.
[02:25:45] <Elaine> but I imagine you need to do ABI stuff
[02:25:47] <Astraea> that's just a syntax extension
[02:25:58] <Astraea> well objc follows the C abi
[02:26:00] <scott> I wasn't sure if they could go deeper than the AST
[02:26:13] <Elaine> yeah but iirc there's some weird linker stuff
[02:26:21] <Astraea> some, yes
[02:26:28] <Elaine> maybe it works magically, I don't know how weird it is :P
[02:26:29] <Astraea> ARC is the only thing I'm not sure how to handle
[02:26:36] <Astraea> and maybe exception handling stuff
[02:27:00] <Astraea> well for the most part clang just sticks stuff in various sections of the binary
[02:27:15] <Astraea> and dyld pulls it in on start-up and does all the libobjc work for you
[02:27:16] <scott> How is ObjC normally FFI'd in other languages? Or do you want to do something to make it easier than normal?
[02:27:34] <Peach> I need programmers who understand what simple and intuitive language design is :'(
[02:27:37] <Astraea> scott: normally people would go through the libobjc interface (which is written in C)
[02:27:43] <Peach> People who don't say "syntax doesn't matter"
[02:27:58] <Astraea> but since rust is compiled, there's no real problem with doing what clang does
[02:29:00] <Peach> Ok, so
[02:29:01] <swgillespie> what does clang do?
[02:29:08] <Astraea> might have to look into how completion blocks are implemented as well...
[02:29:15] <Peach> Is there no "Learn rust from C" tutorial online? :X
[02:29:33] <Astraea> swgillespie: so a method in objc is just a C function
[02:29:44] <Peach> how would I    int x = 0; int *y = &x;  *y = 5;   in Rust?
[02:29:59] <Astraea> clang sticks the details in... I forget which section
[02:30:05] <scott> Peach: On some levels I don't really believe in "intuitive" language design. There's just what you're used to and what you aren't. Googleability and good learning resources are more important.
[02:30:06] <Astraea> dyld pulls it out and registers it with libobjc
[02:30:08] <Elaine> let x = 0; let y = &mut x; *y = 5;
[02:30:10] <swgillespie> Peach: let x = 0; let y = &mut x; *y = 5;
[02:30:32] <Elaine> Peach: there's the Book, there's Rust By Example, there's Rust for C++ Programmers.
[02:30:33] <swgillespie> Astraea: oh wow, that's significant
[02:30:36] <scott> I can pick up most languages in a really short time because I have a lot of exposure to different languages and not much can surprise me anymore.
[02:30:44] <Peach> scott: well Rust isn't googable cause it likes to use symbols everywhere
[02:30:48] <Astraea> swgillespie: the interactions between clang, libobjc, and dyld are really awesome
[02:30:48] <Peach> Rust for C++ where Elaine ?
[02:30:58] <swgillespie> that's really cool
[02:31:10] <Elaine> https://github.com/nrc/r4cppp
[02:31:27] <Astraea> I think ld gets thrown in the mix there as well
[02:31:29] <scott> Peach: I'm not claiming Rust does everything right. But Googleability also isn't the only concern. You have to weigh everything together.
[02:32:30] <Astraea> again, it's been like... 10ish months since I was looking into this
[02:32:34] <Astraea> I'll need a short refresher
[02:32:45] <niconii> there's definitely a couple bits that are very difficult to search for
[02:32:49] <niconii> for<'r> comes to mind
[02:32:58] <scott> Yes, that one is nasty
[02:33:00] <Elaine> niconii: the obscure usecases don't help either

[02:34:14] <swgillespie> Peach: you cannot use x because it's been borrowed mutably by y
[02:34:19] <niconii> Peach: so, that's the borrow checker at work, you can't use x while it's borrowed
[02:34:27] <Peach> Oh rust is super possessive 
[02:34:28] <Peach> :P
[02:34:29] <swgillespie> this is one of the killer features of rust

[02:34:46] <Peach> YOU CAN'T USE X, HE'S MINE
[02:35:06] <niconii> so:

[02:36:39] <Peach> Well Elaine it just makes parsing more complex
[02:36:48] <amstrad> um, why would i used the 'ref' keyword
[02:36:56] <amstrad> what does it do?
[02:37:04] <swgillespie> it can be part of a pattern
[02:37:07] <Elaine> amstrad: in a pattern, it takes a reference to the value at that point in the structure.
[02:37:12] <Elaine> with the given name
[02:37:39] <amstrad> Elaine: not sure i follow, i have 1 example i have been looking at

[02:38:20] *** Joins: Rym (uid91135@moz-l7h36v.ealing.irccloud.com)
[02:38:21] <Elaine> amstrad: yeah so that takes references to the tuple elements.
[02:38:42] <Elaine> the outermost & in the pattern matches against one layer of reference, then you bind the names lock and cvar by-reference.
[02:38:44] <Peach> what would be a user friendlier syntax for   *y = val
[02:38:47] <niconii> Peach: we use &/* like C, it's just that our reference type is also & instead of *, because it makes a hell of a lot more sense for &5 to be the type &i32
[02:38:53] <amstrad> Elaine: pattern?
[02:39:11] <amstrad> you mean, Arc<Mutex<Box<Option<T> <--- pattern?
[02:39:11] <Elaine> amstrad: yeah, pattern. the thing that occurs on the left hand side of each match arm, or the left hand side of a `let`
[02:39:30] <Elaine> https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/patterns.html
[02:39:49] <amstrad> Elaine: i call everything something else, but ok
[02:39:59] <scott> Peach: Who is the "user" in your mind? There is nothing friendlier for C-like language users.
[02:40:12] <amstrad> Elaine: in that example tho, there is a Arc being pass a Tuple
[02:40:23] <amstrad> of Mutex and Condvar
[02:40:42] <Peach> scott: person who is able to use a computer well and understand its concepts but does not know the technical details of how computer work
[02:40:42] <Elaine> amstrad: &*pair2 dereferences the Arc<...> and then takes a reference to its innards.
[02:40:50] <Peach> So like...people who aren't CS majors scott 
[02:41:00] <amstrad> Elaine: as opposed to a copy right?

[02:41:51] <swgillespie> there aren't pointers in math
[02:41:54] <Elaine> There's no standard mathematical notation for indirection.
[02:41:55] <Peach> there is some intuition
[02:42:01] <scott> Peach: The syntax is the easy part. If they don't understand the concepts, they'll be lost anyway.
[02:42:01] <Elaine> since it's not a useful abstraction at that level
[02:42:40] <Peach> "How do I make pointer syntax make sense to a CS newcommer?"
[02:42:49] <Peach> something that reflects the concept
[02:43:00] <amstrad> Peach: tell them to print the memory location of the pointer
[02:43:02] <swgillespie> I learned C as a CS newcomer and it's pointer syntax worked fine
[02:43:18] <Peach> How does rust handle pointer to pointer to pointer?
[02:43:22] <Peach> like C  int*** x;
[02:43:28] <niconii> &&&x
[02:43:33] * Peach hurls

[02:43:49] * Peach hurls hard
[02:43:55] <niconii> what else would it be?
[02:44:03] <scott> Bad syntax for a probably bad use of pointers.
[02:44:23] <niconii> yeah, pointers to pointers are not good anyway, they don't need nice syntax
[02:44:28] <Peach> Maybe have pointers look like generic containers?
[02:44:36] <swgillespie> that's sort of dishonest, though

[02:45:40] <Elaine> so verbose
[02:45:46] <Elaine> not that that situation ever arises in reasonable code
[02:45:53] <Peach> lol
[02:45:56] <Elaine> this is what we have data structures and containers for, by jove.
[02:46:07] <Peach> I want pointers to be verbose if they have to be used directly
[02:46:14] <swgillespie> you can do it like ocaml, lol
[02:46:20] <swgillespie> let p = ref (ref (ref 42))
[02:46:25] <Peach> cause otherwise you can just use Vec and etc. to store data
[02:46:28] <Elaine> in p

[02:51:08] <Peach> swgillespie: C function pointer syntax
[02:51:13] <niconii> as for me, i dunno, i think rust kinda hits the sweet spot in most respects nowadays
[02:51:19] <swgillespie> C function pointer syntax is objectively bad, not terse
[02:51:19] <swgillespie> haha
[02:51:23] <niconii> early rust was gross though
[02:51:38] <Elaine> Peach: http://www.eecg.toronto.edu/~jzhu/csc326/readings/iverson.pdf
[02:51:50] <Elaine> (case study: https://scottlocklin.wordpress.com/2014/11/14/notation-as-a-tool-for-thought-wavelets-in-j/)
[02:51:50] <niconii> though part of that was because types weren't capitalized
[02:52:01] <niconii> everything was lowercase so it all sorta blended together
[02:52:09] <Peach> swgillespie:  int (*)(double) 
[02:52:13] <scott> void (*i_hate_everything[10])() // array of function pointers
[02:52:32] <swgillespie> Peach: that's not terse though
[02:52:37] <swgillespie> Peach: int -> double works fine
[02:52:38] <niconii> oh, yeah, C spiral syntax is insane
[02:52:43] <swgillespie> and is terse
[02:52:45] <scott> C's type syntax was a weird experiment gone horribly wrong
[02:53:21] <scott> niconii: Apparently the spiral idea isn't accurate, but it is generally insane
[02:53:38] <Peach> swgillespie: terse vs simple, I guess what I really mean is "cryptic"
[02:53:40] <niconii> let i_love_everything: [fn(); 10]; // array of function pointers in rust, for comparison
[02:53:56] <Peach> cryptic is usually bad naming
[02:54:03] <Peach> which Rust has everywhere
[02:54:19] <scott> Rust has a few cases, but definitely not everywhere
[02:54:25] <niconii> Peach: examples?
[02:54:43] <Peach> Rust Ord and Eq
[02:55:01] <Peach> and return used to be ret
[02:55:28] <Peach> pub instead of public
[02:55:30] <niconii> okay, let's not use stuff we've *already scrapped* as examples
[02:55:45] <Peach> I wish you could do public: instead of pub pub pub...
[02:55:49] <swgillespie> Peach: if you like confusing you should check out some really old C function declarations

[02:56:15] <scott> pub gets written a *lot*. A public block would require indentation to be clear.

[02:57:06] <swgillespie> When I write C#, and I write public things, I usually end up doing "pub<TAB>"
[02:57:16] <swgillespie> i feel that it's pretty unambiguous
[02:57:18] <niconii> anyway, i think Ord/Eq were inherited from haskell
[02:58:03] <c74d> Eq/Ord were scrapped?
[02:58:23] <niconii> c74d: no, i was referring to `ret`
[02:58:27] <c74d> oh
[02:59:36] <niconii> anyway, i'll agree that Ord/Eq are a bit too terse... or at least Ord (Eq seems pretty unambiguous, not many things that start with Eq)
[02:59:42] <niconii> disagree on `pub` though
[02:59:45] <Peach> scott: with Rust as terse as it is, pub should really be a label that has indentation or something
[03:00:01] <c74d> some say "eq" for "equalizer"
[03:00:14] <Peach> Why does no other language use C++'s syle public block ever?
[03:00:14] <scott> Peach: Rust already has issues with too much indentation, though.
[03:00:31] <Elaine> scott: not in type declarations though.
[03:00:45] <scott> But methods get marked pub, too
[03:01:07] <Elaine> good point, I don't notice the pub pain for methods.
[03:01:48] <Peach> scott: you know C++'s indent style for public, right?
[03:01:56] <Peach> the label goes all the way to the left
[03:01:59] <scott> I know of a variety of styles.
[03:02:10] <scott> It works in C++ because the struct body is already indented.
[03:02:25] <scott> In Rust we use sometimes use pub on things which are not indented at all.
[03:02:33] <Peach> ???! Rust doesn't have that same struct indent?
[03:02:42] <c74d> C++ doesn't specify indentation style.
[03:02:44] <Peach> I mean you can pub:  AND pub
[03:02:44] <scott> pub is used on top level things, not just fields
[03:02:54] <zwarich> the Rust indentation rules are "when in doubt, indent 4 spaces"
[03:02:58] <zwarich> lol
[03:03:00] <Peach> pub: as an option for fields would be nice
[03:03:40] <scott> I suppose, but I prefer to keep the syntax less complicated when possible.
[03:05:57] <scott> Elaine: That is quite the channel
[03:06:57] <Peach> I hate how Haskell is the "standard" all new programming languages get influenced by, Haskell has bad naming practices
[03:07:02] <Peach> Like "filter"
[03:07:27] <scott> filter is a pet-peeve of mine :)
[03:07:32] <XMPPwocky> how so?
[03:07:32] <Peach> it should be keepif / removeif 
[03:07:43] <Peach> XMPPwocky: the name is non self explainatory
[03:07:48] <scott> It's fine once you learn which sense it traditionally means... but at first it's ambiguous
[03:07:53] <Peach> Does it keep elements if true or false
[03:07:58] <scott> Peach: Ruby has select and reject
[03:08:07] * niconii shrug
[03:08:08] <XMPPwocky> rust used to have .retain
[03:08:11] <Peach> Ruby named that better
[03:08:14] <XMPPwocky> which might take the cake
[03:08:17] <scott> retain was different and weird
[03:08:17] <niconii> i dunno, i've never had a problem with filter myself...
[03:08:47] <scott> niconii: It could mean "filter out stuff matching this predicate"
[03:08:53] <niconii> i suppose
[03:09:00] <c74d> I preferred `filter-for`/`filter-out`, but now that I think of it, `filter-out` is ambiguous too (are we discarding or keeping the filtered-out elements?).
[03:09:27] <scott> XMPPwocky: filter is an iterator method and retain was an in-place vec method which took a negated predicate compared to filter
[03:09:32] <scott> That was a nasty situation imo
[03:09:33] <XMPPwocky> right
[03:09:55] <scott> Oh, retain is still around
[03:10:03] <Peach> map is poorly named too
[03:10:16] <scott> map is an extremely standard name for what it does
[03:10:20] <Peach> not intuitive, not self explainatory
[03:10:41] <swgillespie> at least it's not fmap
[03:10:46] <Peach> doesn't even matter how standard, it's not friendly to someone even if they fully know english
[03:10:53] <swgillespie> but hey, if you want to be friendly for mathematicians, map is pretty standard
[03:11:04] <Peach> programming languages should be at least somewhat innutive for all, not just math people
[03:11:07] <scott> At some point I have to assume the programmer is willing to use the handy doc search function...

[03:11:30] <swgillespie> not reading the manual is not sustainable :P
[03:11:31] <scott> F*** them, then. Let them not know what map means.
[03:11:54] <Peach> scott: you must not be familiar with common human practices
[03:12:03] <scott> Good coders look things up.
[03:12:04] <Peach> manual not reading is like the most common thing ever
[03:12:12] <Peach> people like to try and experiment first
[03:12:18] <Peach> and read only when something goes wrong
[03:12:27] <swgillespie> yeah, like "what does map mean"
[03:12:28] <Peach> but usually they just give up if something goes wrong
[03:12:38] <niconii> depends heavily on the person
[03:12:46] <whipsch> some_vec.do_thing_to_everything(the_thing)
[03:13:03] <whipsch> s/to/with/
[03:13:15] <Peach> map should be "apply" but isn't apply already taken for some non intuitive thing?
[03:13:27] <scott> map should be "map" because that's what it's called everywhere.
[03:13:29] <swgillespie> apply f x = f(x)
[03:13:43] <scott> apply sounds like function application as swgillespie points out
[03:14:23] <c74d> Peach: `apply` isn't at all an "intuitive" name for that to me -- I think C++'s `transform` is better.
[03:14:47] <Peach> applyfunction ?
[03:15:11] <Peach> or applytoeach or something
[03:15:35] <c74d> but, don't use "apply [function]" for "apply [function] to each" when "apply [function]" by itself is a valid operation.
[03:16:09] <Peach> Oh what if functions were first class and any function could have an "each" function that accepts an array?
[03:16:23] <Peach> print.eachin(namelist);
[03:16:50] <niconii> Peach: no thanks
[03:16:59] <Peach> it's not for rust
[03:17:08] <Peach> it's just an idea
[03:17:14] <niconii> i'm not saying it is for rust
[03:17:21] <c74d> Peach: I'm open to that
[03:17:34] <Peach> <3
[03:17:45] <niconii> it makes chaining stuff a pain imo

[03:18:28] <Peach> map lets you chain better?
[03:18:57] <scott> foo.map(..).filter(..).map(..).etc(..)
[03:19:53] <niconii> compare baz.eachin((bar.eachin(foo)).filter(..)).etc(..)
[03:20:01] <XMPPwocky> yeah, you want to think about typeability
[03:20:11] <Peach> acos.eachin(numlist).removeif(x > 10)
[03:20:13] <XMPPwocky> you really don't want to be mentally tracking nesting depth
[03:20:27] <Peach> hmm
[03:20:36] <niconii> actually i guess the parens around bar.eachin(foo) are unnecessary but
[03:20:53] <niconii> either way, the prefix/suffix stuff feels like the revenge of C or something
[03:20:57] <Peach> what would be a better name for "map" ?
[03:21:21] <c74d> I agree about making it prefix rather than suffix being ugly
[03:21:37] <niconii> "map" is fine to me; "map these inputs to outputs"
[03:22:09] <Peach> niconii: for people who don't have a math background
[03:22:33] <c74d> `numlist, each acos, drop-each {_ > 10}`
[03:22:43] <scott> map is used in most other programming languages. You would be doing your new programmers a favour to teach the term to them.
[03:23:05] <Peach> "map" is not intuitive outside high level math ideas, and I agree about other languages using it
[03:23:28] <niconii> i guess "transform" is fine
[03:23:45] <whipsch> idunno, i think once you go 'wtf does map mean?' the first time you've probably pretty much got it...
[03:23:46] <niconii> ...i dunno if that's better from a "no math" perspective though
[03:23:59] <scott> transform sounds even more vague to me, but I guess I am biased by my exposure...
[03:24:15] <niconii> "mighty_morphin_power_rangers"
[03:25:23] <Peach> map returns what again?
[03:25:28] <Peach> the new list?
[03:25:53] <scott> In essence, yes. It's slightly more complicated in Rust because of lazy iterators.
[03:26:57] <reem> worth noting that iterators aren’t actually “lazy” they just do as little work as possible to get you the next value when you call .next
[03:27:14] <reem> i.e. it’s laziness by implementation + convention, not enforced by the language or anything
[03:28:33] <Peach> square.each_in(numberlist).dropif(x > 10)
[03:28:40] <Peach> scott: foo.map(..).filter(..).map(..).etc(..)  is that invalid?
[03:28:58] <Peach> "foor" is a list?
[03:29:08] <niconii> Peach: in rust, foo would be an iterator
[03:29:14] <scott> ^
[03:29:31] <niconii> to get from a vector to an iterator, you'd use .iter()/.iter_mut()/.into_iter()
[03:29:41] <niconii> but in essence, that's the basic gist of it, yeah

[03:34:00] <niconii> .into_iter() converts vec -> iterator, .collect::<Vec<_>>() converts iterator -> vec so it can be printed

[03:47:11] <Peach> Anyone heard about Apple's Swift going open source this year?
[03:47:38] <niconii> yes
[03:53:15] *** Quits: bjz (bjz@moz-puppgq.tpgi.com.au) (Quit: My Mac has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[03:53:25] <Astraea> yes
[03:53:35] <Astraea> maybe the community will fix it
[03:53:56] <Astraea> that or 2.0 is the new 1.0
[04:00:42] <Peach> Any *excited* about Swift officially going open source later this year?
[04:01:05] <Astraea> mmm... interested, not excited
[04:01:10] <Quxxy> Nope.  No one.  Anywhere.
[04:01:29] <Astraea> though I do distinctly remember a lot of people claiming apple wouldn't open source it when swift first came out
[04:01:31] <Quxxy> Just Apple's horde of mind-controlled pod people
[04:01:45] <Astraea> so perhaps I'm excited for them to eat their words =P
[04:02:24] <Peach> How about that unicode handling
[04:02:28] <Peach> if NOTHING else
[04:02:35] <Quxxy> Chanting "Swift is the first protocol-oriented language and is thus superior to all others" with their dead eyes staring off into the cosmic abyss
[04:02:41] <Peach> I think Swift has good Unicode handling built in
[04:03:00] <Astraea> I like my source code to be nothing but emoticons
[04:03:09] <Peach> How good is Rust's unicode string support? I don't think it's graphame aware like Swift
[04:03:19] <Peach> And not unicode ident, I mean unicode text processing
[04:03:25] <Astraea> and actually I discovered something rather interesting in swift
[04:03:30] <Quxxy> Astraea: Emoji; emoticons are symbols made of regular characters
[04:03:51] <Astraea> I (absentmindedly) named a variable switch
[04:03:52] <Quxxy> Peach: I believe the current position is "push that into crates"
[04:03:55] <Astraea> turns out you can actually do that
[04:04:05] <Astraea> Quxxy: yeah, emoji, ta
[04:04:12] <Quxxy> On the basis that if you're writing a kernel or embedded driver, you might not *need* that
[04:04:30] <Astraea> ends up being something like let `switch` = blah
[04:04:34] <scott> Peach: There's this crate for graphemes: http://unicode-rs.github.io/unicode-segmentation/unicode_segmentation/index.html
[04:04:43] <Quxxy> Personally, I think that's a silly position and you shouldn't need a crate just to split at grapheme clusters

[04:05:10] <Astraea> now I just want to know their time tables for killing objc
[04:07:47] <Astraea> I'm guessing 5 years
[04:07:51] <Astraea> any other guesses? =P
[04:08:35] <scott> never o'clock
[04:08:59] <Astraea> never?
[04:10:23] <scott> Is it worth it for them to kill it?
[04:10:54] <Astraea> well, apple tends to be pretty singularly minded
[04:10:58] <Astraea> they've killed tons of stuff before
[04:11:13] <scott> I guess I don't pay attention to Apple much
[04:11:34] <Peach> Apple CAN'T kill objc
[04:11:38] <Peach> that would be awful
[04:11:48] <Peach> It's an easy interface with C++
[04:11:55] <Peach> obj C++ is so nice
[04:11:56] <Astraea> I mean there used to be cocoa and carbon, you don't use carbon anymore
[04:12:11] <scott> Obj-C++ is ridiculously terrible.
[04:12:22] <Peach> Killing obc would mean rewritting ALL of apple's own apps
[04:12:23] <scott> I'm sure it's convenient when you need it...
[04:12:25] <Astraea> yeah... objc++ is terribad
[04:12:34] <Astraea> Peach: they've... done it before
[04:12:43] <Astraea> again, I'll bring up carbon
[04:12:50] <Peach> but Apple is in a worse position though
[04:12:54] <Peach> they don't have to care
[04:13:03] <Peach> they're not the underdog anymore
[04:13:12] <Peach> they can just leave stuff the way it is
[04:13:20] <Astraea> they also don't want to support both swift and objc
[04:13:32] <Peach> in fact, they've already written most of their apps, and the current objc version are super buggy
[04:13:33] <Astraea> like I said, they've been very singularly minded in the past 15 years
[04:13:39] <Astraea> I can't imagine them changing
[04:13:42] <Peach> I think the swift versions would be even crashie
[04:13:43] <Peach> r
[04:13:53] <Astraea> crashier?
[04:13:59] <Astraea> oh... I got it
[04:14:27] <Peach> Swift's implementation is really lacking and it's got a lot of errors from the compiler alone
[04:14:32] <Peach> in fact
[04:14:44] <Astraea> yeah, I didn't say they were going to rewrite everything in swift right now
[04:14:48] <Peach> I should go into OS X 10.11 and try Swift 2 out
[04:14:52] <Astraea> swift has interoperability with objc
[04:14:58] <Astraea> so they can slowly move that way
[04:15:00] <Peach> dual boot <3
[04:15:11] <Astraea> which is why I said 5 years
[04:15:20] <Astraea> but heck, they introduced garbage collection into objc
[04:15:25] <Astraea> then it went away
[04:15:35] <Astraea> they moved to arc
[04:16:07] <scott> I'm so isolated from the Apple world.
[04:16:19] <Astraea> iirc java was a first class citizen in the early days of OS X, they dropped that
[04:16:31] <scott> I barely know what they're doing over there.
[04:17:08] <Astraea> no one really knows
[04:17:10] <Astraea> they're tight lipped

[04:31:53] <scott> There are only a few TV series that rank as high as my favourite movies for me. Arrested Development, Breaking Bad, Firefly, maybe a few others. There are lots of probably good TV shows I've never watched, though.
[04:31:56] <amstrad> Astraea: you missed the 90's then

[04:33:04] <Astraea> add to that babylon 5, star trek, battlestar galactica
[04:33:08] <Astraea> venture bros
[04:33:15] <scott> I never watched much sci-fi TV.
[04:33:17] <amstrad> babylon 5 was terrible
[04:33:22] <Astraea> babylon 5 was amazing
[04:33:25] <Astraea> especially s4
[04:33:30] * c74d hasn't watched any of these series.
[04:33:46] <Astraea> s1 was slow, s5 can be skipped
[04:33:57] <Astraea> except the last episode...
[04:34:04] <amstrad> i disagree with any show that promotes the integration of aliens into society, we need to be fighting them dammit, ideally with lazers 
[04:34:31] <Peach> WOw Mac os x 10.11 full screen mode is useless :O
[04:34:32] <amstrad> tho, Star Trek was alright, but deep space 9, couldn't stand that
[04:34:43] <c74d> well, I did watch nine or ten episodes of Star Trek
[04:34:48] <Astraea> considering Earth uses xenophobic propaganda to stage a coup d'etat in babylon 5...
[04:34:49] <Astraea> yeah
[04:34:54] <amstrad> people didn't like Voyager, but i thought Voyager was WAY better than Deep Spave 9
[04:34:56] <c74d> but that's not "90's"
[04:35:02] <Astraea> voyager was terrible
[04:35:09] <amstrad> i liked it
[04:35:10] <Astraea> it could have been like battlestar galactica (the reboot)
[04:35:22] <Astraea> but instead it was TNG in the delta quadrant with the least memorable set of characters ever
[04:35:28] <amstrad> nothing compares to the original Star Trek tho
[04:35:42] <Astraea> ds9 was really good once they got into the dominion war
[04:36:00] <Astraea> the original star trek... I mean I enjoy it, but it hasn't aged well in a lot of cases

[04:52:40] <scott> I have a lot of movies on my to-watch list... I only recently starting watching lots of well-known movies I'd never seen.
[04:52:45] <amstrad> anything Gasper Noe puts out is deeply disturbing
[04:53:01] <Astraea> oh!
[04:53:05] <Astraea> I forgot one of my favorite movies of all time
[04:53:08] <Astraea> Paint Your Wagon

[04:54:01] <amstrad> Astraea: westerns are not really my thing
[04:54:14] <Astraea> it's... not really a western
[04:54:19] <Astraea> it's a musical
[04:54:20] <amstrad> there are not enough good films about AI
[04:54:29] <scott> I wish crates.io hosted generated docs for every crate...
[04:54:38] <Astraea> basically sin city during the gold rush
[04:54:42] <scott> Some don't bother to host them themselves and then I get annoyed
[04:54:46] <amstrad> best AI film - Forbin - The Collosus Project (and that is decades old)

[04:55:30] <c74d> one time, looking through files on an old, shelved Powerbook G4, I found, in a directory with my name on it, a file named `startrekscripts.rtf`... which puzzled me, because the file dated back to my youth, before I'd ever watched even the small amount of Star Trek I have now.
[04:55:32] <Astraea> scott: have you seen Metropolis?
[04:55:39] <scott> Nope
[04:55:49] <amstrad> im sure no directors out there know anything about computer science and AI research to really put together a decent AI film without anthropomorphizing the AI 
[04:55:54] <scott> That's in some more obscure part of my current list
[04:56:05] <Astraea> well... it's one of the most influential silent films
[04:56:23] <amstrad> Metropolis was overrated
[04:56:37] <Astraea> which version did you watch, amstrad?
[04:56:52] <amstrad> it was spectacle, that's for sure, not a great film, even for its time
[04:56:57] <Astraea> the Giorgio one is horrible
[04:57:01] <amstrad> Astraea: no idea
[04:57:32] <Astraea> did it have 80's pop music? if so, you watched the horrible version
[04:57:43] <amstrad> no, no pop music
[04:57:48] <amstrad> not that i recall
[04:57:48] <Astraea> and it's a spectacle now
[04:57:57] <Astraea> it was made in 1927, you always have to place yourself into the time period
[04:58:15] <Astraea> it was a very political film
[04:58:16] <amstrad> Astraea: sure, granted, still not that great
[04:58:36] <amstrad> Fight Club is a political film, with a lot more depth to it
[04:58:57] <Astraea> it kind of saddens me how many early films are lost to us
[04:59:09] <amstrad> anyway, wasn't really into Metropolis
[04:59:23] <Astraea> I'll put fight club at the top of my list
[04:59:27] <scott> The oldest films I've currently seen that I really liked are Casablanca and 12 Angry Men.
[04:59:52] <scott> 1942 and 1957 respectively
[04:59:57] <Astraea> I've seen quite a few old films from the 20s, 30s, and 40s
[05:00:01] <amstrad> Astraea: ill watch Spotless Mind next i think
[05:00:05] <amstrad> i have been meaning to watch it
[05:00:17] <scott> I haven't seen anything pre-40s yet
[05:00:35] <Astraea> amstrad: just a forewarning, it can be a little confusing
[05:00:41] <Astraea> they jump back and forth in time
[05:00:44] <Astraea> well... not exactly time
[05:00:49] <Astraea> memory of time
[05:01:07] <amstrad> Astraea: that's ok, its gotta be better than the Number 23
[05:01:32] <Astraea> scott: it's interesting to see the progression of film
[05:01:42] <Astraea> I tend to view early works with that in mind
[05:01:47] <Astraea> it's also how I like to view video games
[05:04:46] <scott> Early videos games are being lost too quickly. It can be hard to play anything 10+ years old.
[05:05:15] <amstrad> Astraea: they are going to remake the blob
[05:05:33] <amstrad> i think Hollywood are going to mess it up (as usual)
[05:05:39] <Astraea> scott: 10? I still play games from the 90s...
[05:05:49] <scott> I like that archive.org is doing stuff like this: https://archive.org/details/msdos_Oregon_Trail_The_1990
[05:05:50] <amstrad> the 1980's Blob was fantastic
[05:06:00] <Astraea> I mean it starts to get worse and worse when you go back farther than 1995
[05:06:02] <scott> Astraea: Sure, it's doable. But it's harder than it should be.
[05:06:14] <Astraea> amstrad: they always mess stuff up =/
[05:06:22] <Peach> I have a question
[05:06:31] <Astraea> scott: though I do agree, video games are part of our culture at this point
[05:06:32] <Peach> How did you Rust people manage manjor syntax changes
[05:06:38] <amstrad> Astraea: the thing is, im sure those who write the movie scripts just follow some formula
[05:06:40] <Peach> between versions of Rust?
[05:06:44] <Astraea> and it's pretty sad that we're going to lose a lot of it to time
[05:06:52] <Peach> Like before rust had  const int x = 0; syntax
[05:06:58] <Astraea> the same way we lost so so many silent films and early movies
[05:07:11] <scott> Peach: It doesn't have major changes anymore. Back when Rust was changing a lot, you just have to deal with and update your code. That was part of the deal.
[05:07:16] <Astraea> amstrad: they do for summer action flicks, it's incredibly formulaic
[05:07:44] <Peach> there wasn’t any auto convertor scott ?
[05:07:54] <Astraea> tbh video game source code should be preserved and open sourced/public domained at some point in the future
[05:07:59] <amstrad> Astraea: hence why i watch indie films
[05:08:15] <Astraea> a bit too late for that policy though
[05:08:20] <huon> Peach: no converter
[05:08:23] <Peach> Astraea:  id tech does that
[05:08:24] <scott> Peach: Not in general. I think for a few changes some people made scripts to make pull requests to every Rust repo on github.
[05:08:40] <Astraea> Peach: yeah, but they're the exception
[05:08:46] <Astraea> that's the problem
[05:09:14] <Peach> Astraea: what OSX version are you on?
[05:09:55] <Astraea> I can still read From the Earth to the Moon 150 years later
[05:10:14] <Astraea> in 150 years how many people will be able to play Halo
[05:10:21] <Astraea> Peach: 10.10
[05:10:36] <scott> I've read a number of books from the 1800s. (Not to mention Shakespeare and Greek classics.)
[05:11:27] <Peach> Wow OS X is so silly, they have quite a lot of bugs everywhere
[05:11:34] <Peach> Xcode 7 is so bad
[05:11:47] <Peach> Xcode 7 is so buggy
[05:12:00] <Peach> OH my gosh my IRC client is now buggy too
[05:12:05] <Astraea> heck, Tribes 2 which came out in 2001 is now just a binary blob, the source code has been lost (though the source code for Starsiege: Tribes, its predecessor, was apparently found in a closet)
[05:12:33] <Peach> The client is placing my new messages in the MIDDLE of the conversation
[05:12:37] <Astraea> that's depressing to me
[05:17:46] <Peach> guys, thoughts on IDE auto line wrapping?
[05:17:57] <Peach> Xcode 7 does it and I hate it
[05:18:04] <Peach> Xcode 3 doesn’t do it and I love it
[05:18:05] <Peach> <3
[05:18:21] <Astraea> xcode 3?!
[05:18:30] <Astraea> it must have been just a text editor at that point
[05:18:42] <c74d> They'd be using Xcode 3 with Mac OS 10.6, yes.
[05:19:46] <c74d> I don't know how you're defining "IDE" vs. "text editor" (some would have a continuum between them), but I'd say it would be a fairly fancy text editor.
[05:20:06] <Astraea> I was trying to make a joke =(
[05:21:01] <c74d> Peach: define "auto line wrapping"?
[05:21:40] <Peach> c74d: The text editor makes all text fit within a fixed horizontal line space
[05:21:54] <scott> Soft wrapping or hard wrapping?
[05:21:56] <Peach> so newlines are obscured to not always being actual newlines
[05:21:59] <Peach> soft wrapping
[05:22:04] <Peach> It’s just visiual
[05:22:04] <c74d> Peach: by inserting actual line-breaks, or just displa-- 'k.
[05:22:16] <c74d> Is it non-configurable?
[05:22:34] <c74d> I'm pretty sure I had that in Xcode 3.
[05:22:35] <scott> Ah, I dislike soft wrapping but I keep it enabled. I either hard wrap manually or change my editor width to fit 99% of the time.
[05:22:46] <scott> Well, I also have auto hard wrapping.
[05:22:49] <Peach> I can turn it off, I was just wondering if any of you dislike soft wrapping

[05:26:26] <c74d> I prefer it to having the text area scroll horizontally, except in the case of very long lines.
[05:29:15] <Astraea> oh snap
[05:29:34] <Astraea> objc support in D is still pending
[05:29:54] <Astraea> maybe rust could swoop in and pull in would-be D developers to rust on OSX
[05:32:10] <niconii> i like soft wrapping, horizontal scrolling is just a pain
[05:33:12] <niconii> ...plus i use vim, so
[05:34:13] <niconii> i guess it's possible to set things up that way, but it'd feel really unnatural

[05:49:32] <Peach> I guess that’s expected, but ironic because Rust is influenced by Swift and vice versa

[06:11:01] <c74d> one time, iirc, an acquaintance of mine, upon learning that I'd never watched Star Trek, expressed some kind of shock or dismay and gave me a list of 69 "The Next Generation" and "Deep Space Nine" episodes that she insisted I consume.

[06:42:34] <Peach> Hey every y'all
[06:43:12] <Peach> do you think it's bad language design to let integers call functions with member syntax?
[06:43:20] <Peach> 45.acos  ?
[06:43:34] <Peach> 25.sqrt()  ?
[06:43:53] <Peach> Is that bad style?
[06:44:19] <niconii> ...are you saying 45.acos (without parens) would *only* work for integers?
[06:44:40] <Peach> ?
[06:44:54] <Peach> it could be a property niconii 
[06:44:55] <Mutabah> Peach: ... literally that way? yes, becuase it's nasty for the lexer
[06:45:07] <niconii> or... work for everything but integers? either way, that's inconsistent
[06:45:26] <Peach> no niconii anything could do that
[06:45:28] <Mutabah> Peach: But having (45).acos() be valid, not bad
[06:45:47] <Peach> (45).acos() hmm
[06:45:59] <Peach> but not 45.acos() ?
[06:46:09] <Peach> where is it nasty for the lexer?
[06:46:16] <Peach> *how
[06:46:25] <Mutabah> Peach: Collides with parsing floats
[06:46:38] <Peach> It shouldn't?
[06:46:42] <Peach> I mean
[06:46:45] <Peach> It shouldn't.
[06:47:01] <Mutabah> It's another special case in a special-case heavy section
[06:47:27] <Peach> when a dot is found if the next character is not a number then it's a function call
[06:47:37] <Peach> -10.abs
[06:47:46] <Peach> 10.0.abs
[06:47:51] <Peach> I suppose it looks stupid
[06:47:52] <Peach> :P
[06:47:55] <niconii> a lot of languages allow 45. to equal 45.0 though
[06:48:03] <niconii> instead of making you write the 0
[06:48:08] <Peach> ah
[06:48:53] <Peach> (10).abs is better?
[06:48:59] <Peach> (10.0).abs etc
[06:49:01] <Mutabah> It's far more explicit about what you mean
[06:49:11] <Mutabah> And doesn't get interesting when you have hex/other literals
[06:49:19] <Mutabah> 0x1.bc
[06:49:27] <Mutabah> Does that call .bc on 0x1, or define a float 0x1.BC
[06:50:57] <niconii> ...well, i mean, non-decimal floats aren't valid in most languages; by the time you read 0x you can stop worrying about . meaning float
[06:51:13] <Peach> ^
[06:51:43] <Peach> So yeah style wise, I think I'll require numbers to be in an expression before allowing calls like that
[06:52:05] <Peach> It seems more organized that way
[06:52:23] <Peach> so what about strings through?
[06:52:32] <Peach> "Hello World".reverse(); ?
[06:52:35] <Peach> Is that clean?
[06:53:03] <Mutabah> Peach: Why would it not be?
[06:53:09] <niconii> should be fine
[06:53:12] <Mutabah> . has no special menaing after "
[06:53:23] <Peach> I talk about style here people, not just parsing :P
[06:53:25] <Mutabah> It's just with ints/floats that . is a mess
[06:54:27] <niconii> solution: use , as the decimal point and mess *everything* up
[06:54:40] <Peach> no niconii no
[06:55:00] * Peach marks solution as solved
[06:55:42] <Peach> 10..abs would be so ugly (and allowable) with that other syntax idea
[06:55:44] <niconii> does foo(1,0) call a function with one int or two floats? who knows!
[06:56:05] <Mutabah> niconii: trolololol
[06:56:13] * Peach make niconii stand in the corner to reflect on actions
[06:56:33] <scott> niconii: Reminds me of C++ templates + CPP...
[06:56:39] <niconii> it actually wouldn't be ambiguous if you make it dependent on how the function is declared
[06:56:44] <niconii> but it *would* be awful
[06:56:45] <scott> MACRO(lol<life, sucks>)
[06:57:26] <niconii> wow
[06:57:48] <niconii> i just realized my syntax is so confusing, it confused *me*
[06:57:56] <niconii> s/one int or two floats/two ints or one float/
[06:58:27] <Peach> ok so
[06:58:33] <Peach> function expressions
[06:58:36] <scott> Better yet, make it locale dependent. l10n is all the rage.
[06:58:59] <Peach> anonymous function expressions yay or nay?
[06:59:21] <Peach> (function() { dosomething } )();  // an expression that calls itself
[06:59:43] <niconii> anyway, that's how you know foo(1,0) is cutting-edge, right? no one understands monads and those are cutting-edge
[07:00:06] <niconii> so if no one understands foo(1,0), that means it should be cutting edge too
[07:00:41] <niconii> Peach: expressions are more than just that, foo(function() { ... }) would also have an anonymous function as an expression, passed to foo
[07:00:48] <scott> If you use it and get cut, that should settle it.
[07:01:02] <scott> The comma does look sharp.
[07:01:14] <niconii> Peach: anyway, i vote yea
[07:01:25] <Peach> Hmmmmmmm
[07:01:37] <Peach> Now I'm considering how this complicates the language
[07:02:00] <Peach> It means now expressions can introduce their own local scope that the compiler has the check for
[07:02:18] <niconii> well, we've been over this
[07:02:31] <Peach> Oh you remember :O
[07:02:44] <niconii> well yeah >_>
[07:04:50] <niconii> anyway, to reiterate my stance, make as many things expressions as possible
[07:05:08] <niconii> where it makes sense to, anyway (and for a lot of things it makes sense to)
[07:06:34] <niconii> blocks, if statements, pattern matching, closures... but probably not loops, for a counter-example
[07:06:49] <Peach> The only thing I can't think of as being useful is unnamed blocks
[07:07:11] <Peach> wait what's the difference between a block and closure, and why would block expressions be useful?
[07:07:52] <Peach> and if statement expressions I don't understand the usefulness because we have ternary already
[07:08:22] <niconii> Peach: the point with if expressions is that you can *do away with* ternary
[07:08:26] <niconii> which adds simplicity
[07:08:53] <niconii> rust doesn't have ternary, you just use if where you'd use ternary
[07:09:08] <Quxxy> Clearly, the most optimal language is just x86 assembly with a conditional move instruction
[07:09:22] <Quxxy> Maximum simplicity
[07:09:23] <Peach> what would   if (x > 0) { a = b; } else { print("")}  return?
[07:09:36] <niconii> (), i.e. nothing
[07:09:38] <Quxxy> Peach: ()
[07:09:44] <Peach> Oh
[07:09:51] <niconii> both sides resolve to void
[07:10:04] <niconii> anyway, regarding blocks, all they do is add scope and return the last expression, they're not full functions or anything
[07:10:08] <niconii> they're useful for say...
[07:10:19] <Peach> playbot: let x = if (1==1) {1} else {2}

[07:14:03] -playbot- 1
[07:14:19] <Peach> so niconii go on about block expressions
[07:14:36] <Peach> you were at "let x = { do some stuff to initialize something; something };"
[07:14:40] <niconii> so for instance you could do something like
[07:15:02] <niconii> let x = { let s = String::new(); open file; read into string; s };
[07:15:22] <niconii> the file would go out of scope nicely, and with RAII would close it
[07:15:31] <niconii> and then x is the contents of the file
[07:16:22] <Peach> ooooh
[07:16:39] <Peach> where else could block expressions be used?
[07:17:13] <Peach> passing around block expressions is impossible right?
[07:17:52] <Peach> playbot: let x = { let x = 1337; x }; x
[07:17:52] <niconii> passing 'em around, yeah; they just run and resolve to their last expression
[07:17:53] -playbot- 1337
[07:18:14] <niconii> in rust, only thing you can really pass a block to is a macro
[07:18:17] <Peach> playbot: let x = { let x = 1337; }; 
[07:18:18] -playbot- ()
[07:18:44] <niconii> x equals () there; that's the other thing with rust
[07:18:46] <Peach> playbot: let x = { let x = 1337; };  x

[07:18:58] <niconii> in rust, if the last expression has a ; at the end, it's just ()
[07:19:12] <niconii> the block returns that rather
[07:19:16] <Peach> playbot: let x = void;
[07:19:17] -playbot- <anon>:9:17: 9:21 error: unresolved name `void`

[07:19:25] <Peach> playbot: let x = ();
[07:19:26] <niconii> that goes for functions too, they also have implicit return like that
[07:19:26] -playbot- ()
[07:19:49] <niconii> yeah, () is the empty type/value in rust; it's actually just a 0-element tuple
[07:20:59] <Peach> Block expressions have no real use outside of the RAII you listed niconii ?
[07:23:04] <Peach> cause I can't think of more uses
[07:23:20] <Peach> since they only resolve to their last expression's value
[07:23:44] <niconii> well, they're useful anywhere where something takes only a single expression, but you need multiple lines of code to set it up
[07:24:13] <niconii> for instance, in rust there's `match expr { pattern => expr, pattern => expr, ... }`
[07:24:18] <niconii> and blocks are useful there
[07:25:25] <niconii> there's another use that's... far *less* of a good idea, but
[07:26:00] <niconii> rust has `while expr { ... }`, but it doesn't have a do-while
[07:26:29] <niconii> but you can fake it with `while { loop body; condition } {}`
[07:27:25] <niconii> since the condition is evaluated every iteration to see if the loop should end
[07:27:59] <Peach> rust has no do while why? :O
[07:28:47] <reem> we want the do keyword for greater things
[07:28:53] <reem> :P
[07:29:30] <eddyb> Peach: how often do you write do-while :P?
[07:30:16] <Peach> :{
[07:30:17] <eddyb> C's main use of do-while is to allow ; after macros or something like that
[07:30:26] <Peach> Well maybe I should remove do while
[07:57:44] <Peach> Why is Lua even popular :(
[07:57:57] <Peach> And why do people even treat it like a programming language :(
[08:00:21] <niconii> well... probably because you can program stuff in it >_>
[08:01:48] <niconii> but, more to the point, lua is a) fairly simple, b) relatively small, and c) can interface with c
[08:02:02] <niconii> so it works fairly well as a scripting language for games
[08:02:26] <niconii> people who want to mod said games then learn lua
[08:04:12] <Peach> Lua is useful
[08:04:20] <Peach> but it's so ew sometimes

[12:54:53] <Quxxy> eddyb: A thought: does this allow for yielding a borrow of the generator's state?
[12:55:37] <eddyb> no
[12:55:45] <eddyb> there's no real way to implement that
[12:55:56] <Quxxy> Waaaah
[12:55:58] <eddyb> well, wait
[12:56:10] <eddyb> you mean &'a mut self -> &'a T?
[12:56:10] <eddyb> a borrow of some field?
[12:56:46] <eddyb> that requires adding a lifetime parameter to Generator and using it in &mut self
[12:57:02] <eddyb> well, both Generator and GeneratorBase
[12:57:04] <Quxxy> I'm just wondering if you could write a generator that works with (a hypothetical) streaming iterator trait
[12:57:35] <eddyb> you need to perform the same transform I did to get streaming Iterator in the first place :P
[12:57:46] <eddyb> it should be doable, but I didn't think to include it here
[12:58:21] <eddyb> (I initially thought you meant some kind of weird escaping borrow that somehow made sense with CPS but not my generators, sorry)

[13:11:16] <Elaine> eddyb: hm, that's a fun question.
[13:11:25] <Tiffany> .. too slow?
[13:11:28] <Elaine> would need to carefully design the interconnect.

[13:11:49] <Tiffany> no it doesn't
[13:11:59] <Binero> It does, I tried it out just last month again
[13:12:03] <Elaine> it doesn't for me
[13:12:04] <Tiffany> you have to have a really broken firefox config for that

[13:12:17] <Binero> #firefox didn't know what was up either
[13:12:36] <eddyb> for me it was a weird combination that was causing memory leaks
[13:12:41] <Elaine> eddyb: I haven't looked into the details of how the logic cells on this FPGA work, but it'd be constrained by the communication network overhead and how many cells an adder can fit in.
[13:12:55] <Elaine> At least 20, I'd think.
[13:13:02] <eddyb> but if I got rid of the leaks, it was pretty useless. if the leaks even stopped completely
[13:13:38] <Tiffany> I mean, I guess firefox might have some memory leaks?
[13:13:49] <Tiffany> but I never leave it running longer than 18 hours, because I can't leave my computer running longer than 18 hours

[13:19:35] <eddyb> so why the heck was I screwing around with VirtualBox q_q
[13:19:38] <eddyb> or was it VMWare?
[13:19:48] <Elaine> I thought I was going to have to wrangle with all sorts of nastiness, but it just... works.
[13:19:56] <Tiffany> is PCI passthrough just as easy?
[13:20:05] <Elaine> I don't know, I haven't had a chance to use that.
[13:20:15] <Elaine> never had multiple graphics cards or other devices to dedicate to VMs.
[13:20:17] <Tiffany> the XML configuration certainly implies so

[13:21:55] <Tiffany> that's neat
[13:22:05] <Elaine> yeah
[13:24:35] <Tiffany> it's apparently significantly more complicated with xen
[13:24:57] <Elaine> Xen is historically important technology but it's not relevant anymore imo

[14:57:41] <Tiffany> I like the comparisons between daala and jpeg of equal size
[14:57:50] <Tiffany> https://people.xiph.org/~jm/daala/paint_demo/fruits_16k.jpg https://people.xiph.org/~jm/daala/paint_demo/fruits_pf_full.jpg
[15:00:08] <Tiffany> I wonder how it works out for other formats like H.264
[15:00:30] <Quxxy> IIRC, Daala's problem is with ringing
[15:01:03] <Quxxy> Also, the comparison with JPEG is a bit unfair to JPEG; Daala's competing against... H.265?
[15:01:30] <Quxxy> I remember someone from Xiph saying they were trying to "skip" a generation and target ahead
[15:01:47] <Tiffany> the article I was just reading eliminated ringing, although it had issues with performance
[15:02:05] <Tiffany> and is where those images came from

[15:22:39] * Quxxy wonders if it'd be a bad idea to write a Rust parser for Nix expressions and promote their use over TOML and the like
[15:24:53] <Tobba> Quxxy: it'd be lovely if there was an easily embeddable Nix-like language for use in stuff like Cargo
[15:26:36] <Quxxy> Tobba: 'cause I've been staring at the Nix grammar, wondering if it'd make an interesting project to write up
[15:26:51] <Quxxy> i.e. implementing a lexer, parser and interpreter in Rust
[15:27:01] <Tobba> sounds like an interesting project
[15:27:06] <Tobba> I ended up basically rewriting cargo in Nix
[15:27:14] <Tobba> it works a whooole lot better :P
[15:27:55] <Quxxy> Also, I've realised that Nix is kinda like the pure, functional equivalent of Lua
[15:28:35] <Quxxy> Which means it's only a matter of time before it get used by Telltale as a scripting language in their adventure game engine
[15:28:45] <Quxxy> (Telltale being the "functional" equivalent to LucasArts these days)
[15:28:47] <Tobba> :D
[15:28:56] <Quxxy> (oooh, burn!)
[15:31:34] <fkaa> is nix a os or language
[15:31:42] <Quxxy> fkaa: Yes
[15:31:47] <fkaa> neat
[15:31:59] <Quxxy> It is a language, a package manager *and* an OS
[15:32:14] <Tobba> fkaa: Nix is a package manager, which has its own language, and then there's NixOS which is an OS built around the package manager
[15:32:14] <fkaa> so.. it's a systems language? :)
[15:32:16] <Quxxy> ("nix language", "nix" and "nixos")
[15:32:34] <fkaa> strange
[15:32:35] <Quxxy> It's basically what'd happen if old-school Lua and Haskell had a baby
[15:32:52] <Quxxy> A purely-functional, lazily-evaluated configuration language
[15:33:44] <Quxxy> It's of interest because, with NixOS, the *entire* system configuration is defined by a Nix expression
[15:33:57] <Quxxy> All the packages, their configuration, the users, the lot
[15:34:24] <Quxxy> Also, it allows fun things like opening shells that *only* have a specific set of packages available

[15:35:01] *** eddyb_ is now known as eddyb
[15:35:21] <Tobba> I don't think I could explain it better myself, exactly why NixOS is awesome is hard to express
[15:35:29] <eddyb> persistent data structures
[15:35:39] <eddyb> imagine your OS and its packages formed a persistent tree
[15:35:45] <eddyb> instead of messy mutable state
[15:36:20] <eddyb> if you ever wondered what packaged left over some random file that rpm or dpkg aren't tracking
[15:36:43] <eddyb> or if you ever wanted to *instantly* roll back a broken upgrade
[15:37:02] <eddyb> then you know the pain of mutable package management
[15:37:18] <Quxxy> Pfft; you don't need a package manager for that

[19:20:50] <Manishearth> oh right speedrun
[19:24:33] <fkaa> exploding beds..
[19:29:14] <Gankro> You don't need to try to sleep iirc. Beds just explode in the end.
[19:30:01] <Gankro> I think people also race non-seeded? People certainly do it for roguelikes like Isaac
[19:30:51] <fkaa> isaac is very luck based for speed running
[19:31:02] <Gankro> speed running yes, racing no
[19:31:30] <Gankro> Like you *can* get walled or carried, but overwhelmingly skill is the decider
[19:32:45] <Gankro> In particular if the racers watch each other they can push more or less based on how their opponent is doing
[19:34:03] <Gankro> Especially since the best RNG opportunities are affected by skill -- if you take too much damage you don't get the devil deals
[19:35:24] <Tiffany> fkaa: it was a troll added by mojang, back when the nether was added, since compasses spin in circles in the nether, so there's never a "night time", and the beds don't let you sleep when it's night time
[19:35:33] <Tiffany> so instead of letting you sleep or not letting you sleep, they get confused and explode
[19:36:14] <Tiffany> well, I meant to say clocks spin in circles, both clocks and compasses spin
[19:36:21] <Tiffany> clocks are more relevant
[19:36:44] <Tiffany> the only trouble with beds as a method of mining/etc is that they hurt you
[19:37:02] <Tiffany> and spawn fire everywhere, so of the few drops that spawn from an explosion, most get burned

[20:30:34] <Tiffany> iirc it's diku -> merc -> smaug -> SWR -> RitS/FotR
[20:30:55] <Tobba> I'm trying to fix some of this shit up, especially stuff that has been piled on
[20:31:00] <eddyb> fkaa: have you seen my pings?
[20:31:08] <Tobba> when it saves the database or you try to edit a verb, it fucking DECOMPILES the function from the bytecode
[20:31:12] <Tobba> it doesn't store the source anywhere
[20:31:18] <fkaa> eddyb: yes, i yield!
[20:31:20] <Tiffany> hahahaha
[20:31:32] <Tiffany> well that's one way to enforce code style
[20:31:42] <eddyb> fkaa: lol
[20:31:44] <Tiffany> does it strip comments?
[20:31:46] <Tobba> yes
[20:31:51] <Tiffany> amazing
[20:31:59] <niconii> the usual way to do "comments" is to use like
[20:32:01] <Tobba> to comment, you have to do "foo";
[20:32:05] <niconii> string literals on their own line, yeah
[20:32:15] <Tobba> which actually gets compiled in and will slow the code down in inner loops
[20:33:23] <Tobba> also accessing undefined variables is an error at runtime, because reasons
[20:33:55] <Tobba> (it's to support statements like "if (a) b = 4; else b = 0; endif", but still)
[20:34:13] <Tiffany> does it cause a string interning operation?
[20:35:22] <Tobba> commenting like that just causes it to up the refcount of the string and then lower it again
[20:35:26] <Tobba> but I think it wastes "ticks"
[20:35:43] <Tobba> (a verb can only run for so many "ticks" before it has to sleep or it gets killed)

[20:39:41] * eddyb blames Elaine
[20:39:44] <Elaine> Sorry :D
[20:39:57] <Tobba> it also passes around refcounted strings as const char*s, but that might be an ABI thing
[20:43:23] <Tiffany> the fotr codebase has some kind of fucked up refcounted string thing
[20:43:48] <Tiffany> I think it stores the refcount after the \0
[20:44:04] <Tobba> what
[20:44:14] <Tiffany> I don't know where it came from
[20:44:21] <Tobba> that's the dumbest thing I've heard in a while
[20:44:26] <Tiffany> there's such a long lineage and no commit history, so I don't know who to blame for it
[20:44:31] <Tiffany> but basically
[20:44:36] <Tiffany> some of the code will increment string pointers
[20:44:51] <Tiffany> which makes it impossible to free them the normal way
[20:44:58] <Tobba> does it also store the start of the string after the \0
[20:45:22] <niconii> Tiffany: niiice
[20:45:54] <Tiffany> let me google for the file
[20:46:02] <Tobba> oh and the way MOOs handle connections is fucking atrocious and leads to some hilarity

[20:46:18] <Tobba> when you log in it *permanently* associates your connection with an object
[20:46:37] <Tiffany> let me diff these files
[20:46:41] <Tiffany> the header block at the top differs
[20:47:00] <Tobba> and the built-in verb parser will only care about everything around that "player" object
[20:47:15] <niconii> oh, huh
[20:47:15] <Tobba> this means that if you fall asleep and go into a dream the game does the most retarded of shit
[20:47:26] <niconii> i've actually tried this particular mud
[20:47:28] <Tiffany> okay, it's a big diff because of running clang-format
[20:47:41] <Tobba> which involves spawning a fake body, moving all your stuff over and moving the real player
[20:47:50] <niconii> Tobba: (also, don't use "retarded", please)

[20:49:15] <Tiffany> oh
[20:49:59] <XMPPwocky> Tobba: if it works...
[20:50:00] <Tiffany> I'm wrong, tobba
[20:50:04] <Tiffany> it doesn't store anything after the \0
[20:50:05] <XMPPwocky> (remember the fallout train hat)
[20:50:10] <Tiffany> instead, what it does is let you insert \0s to chop off the string
[20:50:10] <Tobba> XMPPwocky: it mostly doesn't
[20:50:13] <Tiffany> it checks *before* the pointer
[20:50:52] <Tiffany> also, note the shitty hash table
[20:51:03] <Tiffany> the hash function is strlen()
[20:51:04] <Tiffany> hahaha
[20:51:11] <Tobba> ...
[20:51:17] <XMPPwocky> ah, the ol' php tactic
[20:51:40] <Tiffany> I might be able to actually fix this one though
[20:51:43] <Tiffany> it's confined to one file
[20:51:45] <niconii> at least they're not using it as a password hash...
[20:51:47] <Tiffany> so I may be able to pull out siphash
[20:51:52] <Gankro> There's 2^64 lens so it seems like a great hash fn!
[20:52:06] <Tobba> oh yeah
[20:52:14] <Tiffany> oh, the code uses the register keyword
[20:52:16] <Tiffany> this must be old
[20:52:22] <Tobba> this one modified MOO core has a fucking stupid SHA-256 function pasted in
[20:52:30] <Tobba> and if you compile it under 64-bit it simply produces incorrect results
[20:52:36] <Tiffany> oh, it's from SMAUG
[20:52:41] <Tiffany> * Advanced string hashing functions (c)1996 D.S.D. Software, written by    *
[20:52:42] <Tiffany> * Derek Snider for use in SMAUG.					   *
[20:52:44] <Tiffany> this is missing from my version
[20:52:50] <Tiffany> lol "advanced"
[20:53:26] <Tobba> I need to replace that with libsodium
[20:53:45] <Tiffany> the login code in this mud uses crypt()
[20:53:48] <niconii> it's very advanced; it used to be `int hash = 4;`
[20:53:53] <Tiffany> yes, all passwords are "hashed" using a fucked up variant of DES
[20:54:56] <Tiffany> I would change it but this code is so gross...
[20:55:02] <Tobba> same here
[20:55:02] <Tiffany> I already changed a few things in it and ended up breaking it
[20:55:20] <Tiffany> have you ever dealt with diku-derived muds?
[20:55:21] <Tobba> it does provide MD5, which it says is "useful in networking applications" and promotes crypt() for passwords in the docs
[20:55:24] <Tobba> nope
[20:57:09] <Tiffany> ahaha, the cowboy bebop one even has a comment from thoric
[20:57:50] <Tiffany> good old thoric
[20:57:54] <Tiffany> "Unknown error #%d - %s (immortal data).  Report to Thoric\n\r"
[20:58:57] <Tiffany> this one is an absolute classic
[20:59:10] <Tiffany> much of the time, when you get a linked list corruption bug:
[20:59:11] <Tiffany> do_say(ch, "Thoric says, 'Prepare for the worst!'");
[21:00:36] <Tiffany> tobba: is there anyone in your codebase who spams their name as often as possible?
[21:00:42] <Tiffany> > ag Thoric | wc -l
[21:00:43] <Tiffany> 274
[21:00:54] <Tobba> Tiffany: nothing except for a few names in help pages
[21:00:59] <niconii> Tiffany: pfft
[21:01:10] <Tiffany> niconii: it gets better
[21:01:12] <Tobba> Tiffany: there is the good 'ol Necancode though, which is the name of any code written by Necanthrope
[21:01:16] <Tiffany> > ag Ewerta | wc -l
[21:01:16] <Tiffany> 695
[21:01:17] <Tobba> it's so fucking bad we have a counter for it breaking
[21:01:32] <niconii> ahaha
[21:01:58] <XMPPwocky> Gankro: hm, /actually/ no. because if you had the 2^64th one, you wouldn't have space for the hashtable overhead
[21:02:08] <Tobba> basically most objects written by him, which is a lot of generic stuff we use when building areas, will just explode randomly or be horrenderous to use
[21:02:18] <Gankro> XMPPwocky: overhead?
[21:02:22] <XMPPwocky> but, luckily, for the 2^63rd, you never have to worry about collisions

[21:30:28] <niconii> it's an anime
[21:30:35] <Tiffany> niconii: that's funny, since it still uses all the star wars classes and languages
[21:30:41] <Tiffany> I don't expect there are any ewoks in this, though
[21:30:51] <niconii> huh
[21:31:31] <niconii> maybe that code's a bit outdated? in any case, cowboy bebop takes place in space so that's probably why they used the codebase of a star wars mud
[21:31:38] <Tiffany> yeah
[21:31:44] <Tiffany> SMAUG is like dungeons and dragons themed or something idk
[21:31:55] <Tiffany> I don't think it has any space ship code

[21:34:05] <Tiffany> the editor
[21:34:10] <Tiffany>  char	line[193][81];

[21:45:54] <niconii> 193 seems like a pretty bizarre line limit...
[21:49:03] <Tiffany> yeah
[21:50:08] <niconii> at least the 81 makes sense, 80 + '\0'
[21:50:14] <niconii> er
[21:50:19] <Tiffany> yeah
[21:50:20] <niconii> makes "sense"
[21:50:27] <Tiffany> I mean
[21:50:32] <Tiffany> the new editor.c ewerta wrote is more flexible
[21:50:43] <niconii> the fact that there's a line limit at *all* doesn't necessarily make sense, but...
[21:50:50] <Tiffany> you can have arbitrarily many lines, and I wrote reflowing code which automatically wraps to 64 characters or something
[21:51:05] <Tiffany> it's not unicode-aware, but it is colour code aware
[21:51:34] <Tiffany> the old editor must have been a damn nightmare
[21:51:53] <Tiffany> only trouble is that the new editor uses linked lists, like pretty much everything else
[21:52:15] <Tiffany> you see, these people never had the sense to write vector macros for C like I did
[21:54:10] <niconii> reminds me of the codebase i was trying to port a while ago that always used a stack completely manually
[21:54:15] <Tiffany> oh you know what's my favourite part
[21:54:19] <Tiffany> they never wrote a LIST_ITER macro either
[21:54:30] <Tiffany> I am literally the first developer on this codebase to understand the idea of deletion-safe linked list iteration
[21:54:43] <niconii> (modifying the stack pointer and putting it in the right location, etc.)
[21:54:50] <Tiffany> in fact, the first bug I fixed was deletion-unsafe linked list iteration leading to random crashes when going pirate hunting
[21:55:03] <Tiffany> and then I proceeded to fix about 30 more
[21:55:30] <Tiffany> that's why I am so familiar with "Thoric says, 'prepare for the worst!'"
[21:55:41] <Tiffany> most of the update loops in the code have some sanity checking
[21:55:46] <Tiffany> like if ch->prev->next != ch
[21:56:02] <Tiffany> they will print that, try to correct it, probably crash, and then instigate CrashGuard™
[21:56:35] <Tiffany> many a times have I had that print out, get some CrashGuard nonsense, and then get disconnected because the MUD segfaulted
[21:56:43] <Tiffany> and boy is that fun to debug
