[04:43:16] <bjz_> cmr: man, lambda calculus is pretty cool
[04:46:42] <cmr> bjz_: had you seen the alligator game?
[04:46:48] <cmr> http://worrydream.com/AlligatorEggs/
[04:46:53] <cmr> I had seen that a while ago
[04:46:55] <cmr> and went "wut"
[04:46:56] <bjz_> no
[04:46:59] <cmr> but now it all makes sense
[04:47:01] <cmr> which is a godo feeling
[04:47:21] <cmr> *good
[04:48:14] <bjz_> some of the definitions make absolutely no sense until you actually evaluate things out by hand
[04:48:41] <cmr> my first self-assigned task is write an interpreter.
[04:49:00] <bjz_> like, I saw: `tru = \t.\f.t; fls = \t.\f.f` and was like, 'wat'
[04:49:24] <cmr> I always thought the periods were confusing when I only gave lambda calculus brief glances
[04:49:36] <cmr> and tbh it is pretty wonky syntax
[04:49:42] <bjz_> until you actually make some logical operations and work with those boolean definitions it doesn't make sense
[04:49:56] <bjz_> yeah, it was made a while ago
[04:50:45] <bjz_> periods were used lots more in the first half of last centurary apparently
[04:51:06] <cmr> did you try reading turing's paper on the lambda calculus?
[04:51:11] <cmr> absolutely impenetrable
[04:51:15] <bjz_> like, the principia mathematica apparently used them for spacing out operators too
[04:51:18] <bjz_> nope
[04:52:00] <bjz_> turing wrote a paper on it?
[04:52:25] <cmr> A. M. Turing, "Computability and λ-Definability", The Journal of Symbolic Logic, Vol. 2, No. 4. (Dec., 1937), pp. 153-163.
[04:52:52] <cmr> I'll get the PDF on the dropbox
[04:52:57] <cmr> if I can find it again..
[04:54:01] <bjz_> neat
[04:54:13] *** Joins: eddyb (eddy@F8B50789.F33C1089.FB866788.IP)
[04:54:28] <bjz_> have you got TaPL yet?
[04:54:52] <cmr> nope
[04:54:55] <cmr> on spring break
[04:55:13] <bjz_> you could probably 'aquire' a copy off libgenesis :P
[04:56:05] <cmr> never seen this site before
[04:56:44] <bjz_> http://lib.freescienceengineering.org/view.php?id=228389
[04:57:02] <bjz_> I feel kinda bad doing it, but I often buy the books I like
[04:57:09] <bjz_> (I prefer hard copies)
[04:59:05] <cmr> turing-symbolic.pdf in papers/
[04:59:12] <cmr> put it where you think it goes :p
[05:01:33] <bjz_> eh, I hate hierarchal files systems for these kinds of things 
[05:01:40] <cmr> I know right?
[05:01:41] <bjz_> I want a sort of web thing
[05:01:54] <bjz_> graph/network thing
[05:01:56] <cmr> tagged filesystem with links would be interesting.
[05:02:03] <cmr> tags for categories, links for relations.
[05:02:06] <bjz_> never been a fan of tagging
[05:02:11] <cmr> possibly with an arbitrary label
[05:02:16] <bjz_> super hard to manage tags :(
[05:02:45] <cmr> I don't think it's too bad? What main problems do you see with it.
[05:03:03] <bjz_> tags are big flat lists
[05:03:24] <bjz_> you often can create tags that sort of mean a similar thing
[05:04:21] <bjz_> it's hard to keep the list of tags in your head
[05:04:59] <bjz_> it's easy to not bother with tagging stuff, and you end up with this backlog of things
[05:05:06] <cmr> yeah that's true
[05:05:11] <bjz_> becomes a chore
[05:05:59] <bjz_> I would like to be able to make connections between documents, and have some sort of smart suggestion thingy
[05:06:14] <bjz_> to make serendipitous discovery easier
[05:06:22] <cmr> if only nepomuk wasn't so disappointing.
[05:06:26] <bjz_> Devon Think had a cool thing
[05:06:37] <bjz_> it would do word associations
[05:07:21] <bjz_> so it would show a list of possibly related things based on the amount of times the same words pop up
[05:07:42] <bjz_> but it would weight it towards longer words 
[05:08:08] <bjz_> I mean, it was a pretty dumb algorithm, but it didn't have to be perfect
[05:08:13] <cmr> right
[05:08:17] <bjz_> it was more of a discovery thing
[05:08:30] <bjz_> like, you might make a connection between really weird things
[05:08:41] <bjz_> that you might not have thought of
[05:08:56] <bjz_> sadly the rest of the software was a horrible mess of ideas
[05:09:04] <cmr> heh
[05:09:50] <bjz_> but the idea of it is: you want to make discovery easier, to help making connections easier
[05:10:13] <bjz_> you can't keep everything all in your head at once
[05:10:24] <cmr> yeah
[05:10:30] <bjz_> you want it so you can just chuck stuff in there
[05:10:39] <bjz_> and for it to sort it out
[05:10:50] <bjz_> but so you can also intervene
[05:11:10] <bjz_> to help shape the connections you want
[05:11:38] <bjz_> also, you want it archivable, exportable
[05:11:58] <bjz_> these are super important things to you, basically an extension of your memory
[05:12:28] <bjz_> especially if you start adding random musings, scraps of ideas and such
[05:13:43] <bjz_> call me old fashioned, but local storage would be important too
[05:13:55] <cmr> yes I agree 100%
[05:14:02] <cmr> cloud crap is the bane of my existence
[05:14:10] <bjz_> I mean, it is cool
[05:14:19] <cmr> non-internet-access is like 90% of my quiet time.
[05:14:23] <bjz_> yeah
[05:14:40] <bjz_> you want to be able to work on your stuff anywhere
[05:15:21] <bjz_> so yeah, that's my half-idea that has been nocking around my head for the past like, five or six years
[05:17:38] <bjz_> I know there are products out there, but none have really satisfied me
[05:18:08] <cmr> I've heard great things about mind mapping software
[05:18:17] <cmr> I've given a few of them a whirl and ... they're all not very good?
[05:18:22] <cmr> I prefer a pad and pencil
[05:18:26] <bjz_> yeah :(
[05:18:31] <bjz_> me too
[05:18:53] <bjz_> but pad and pencil is tricky too
[05:18:59] <cmr> hard to organize and search
[05:19:06] <cmr> old notebooks full of... stuff
[05:19:09] <bjz_> ideas are multidimensional objects
[05:19:11] <cmr> half of it unintelligible
[05:19:26] <bjz_> yeah
[05:19:41] <bjz_> ideally it should be one ginormous mind map
[05:19:56] <cmr> it doesn't help that I don't get enough sleep :\
[05:20:01] <bjz_> heh
[05:20:06] <bjz_> niether
[05:20:11] <cmr> ... speaking of sleep I really should be doing that now
[05:20:24] <bjz_> I should really copy this transcript
[05:20:37] <cmr> g'night
[05:20:41] <bjz_> and plonk it into my nonexistant thought software
[05:20:46] <bjz_> :P
[05:20:46] <cmr> :P
[05:20:47] <bjz_> o/
[05:20:49] <bjz_> night
[05:22:25] <ChrisMorgan> All the software that even vaguely attempts to deal with this problem seems to me to either lack structure altogether or be so excessively structured as to prevent its use for a great many things.
[05:23:01] <ChrisMorgan> UML design is another example of things where there is *no* good software.
