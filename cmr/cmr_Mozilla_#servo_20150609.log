[00:05:37] *** kimundi is now known as zz_kimundi
[00:07:26] <mwu> pcwalton: do you know roughly how many dom objects it takes for 300k?
[00:07:33] <pcwalton> mwu: not sure
[00:08:24] <pcwalton> I guess if you assume every DOM object is 16 words, then you can fit 256 DOM objects *per core*
[00:09:26] <pcwalton> I think the right approach with tiny L1 caches is going to be something like "tiled rendering"
[00:09:29] <pcwalton> like mobile GPUs do
[00:09:37] <pcwalton> where you work in batches of (your cache size) objects
[00:11:09] <mwu> hmm
[00:11:20] <pcwalton> although I admit I don't quite know how to do that :)
[00:12:08] <Savago> yay! Just completed servo build @Raspberry Pi2.
[00:12:36] <Savago> and it crashes.
[00:12:43] <mwu> I have ideas on how to do that, but I don't know how you would decide what dom objects would go in which batches
[00:13:25] <pcwalton> mwu: work-stealing
[00:13:31] <pcwalton> figure it out dynamically!
[00:13:33] <pcwalton> you know what's interesting
[00:13:56] <pcwalton> time is much better correlated with i-cache misses (r^2 = 0.6) than d-cache misses (r^2 = 0.371)
[00:13:58] <mwu> so you'd move the objects as necessary?
[00:14:12] <mwu> hah
[00:14:14] <pcwalton> mwu: oh, I'm not sure that would help
[00:14:33] <pcwalton> if you're on cache line boundaries does it really matter whether your memory is physically adjacent?
[00:14:42] <Tobba> pcwalton: modern ARM CPUs are out of order, so that adds up
[00:14:53] <mwu> true
[00:14:57] <pcwalton> what *does* help is if you can fit multiple DOM nodes into one cache line
[00:15:00] <pcwalton> dunno if that's possible
[00:15:04] <mwu> very very very hard
[00:15:18] <mwu> nodes store pointers to their parents, children, etc.
[00:15:21] *** chmanchester is now known as chmanchester|afk
[00:15:22] <pcwalton> *but* selector matching only needs a few elements of each DOM node
[00:15:29] <pcwalton> there may be some sort of trick we can do there
[00:15:43] <pcwalton> struct-of-arrays (as opposed to array-of-structs) style

[00:50:01] <Savago> douh!

[01:02:57] <pcwalton> ok

[01:09:17] <gw> KiChjang: a pipeline is the grouping of a (optionally shared) script task, layout task and paint task. it's effectively what is needed to load a single page, and there is a new pipeline created for each page load

[05:29:07] <mbrubeck> but our regression testing is not always complete enough to keep them working long-term. :/

[05:30:09] <BenWa> Neat

[05:48:08] <njn> gw: you know much about LayoutWorkers?
[05:48:38] <njn> gw: I've finally determined that the FontContexts they have in their thread-local storage are the big ones (i.e. big FreeType instances)
[05:48:39] <gw> njn: a reasonable amount, yep. what's up?
[05:48:48] <njn> gw: so I want to do memory reporting for them
[05:48:52] <gw> ok
[05:49:02] <njn> gw: trying to work out how to handle the inter-thread communication between the memory profiler and the LayoutWorkers
[05:49:12] <njn> they're using WorkQueue, which complicates things
[05:49:19] <gw> njn: yea. let me just take a look
[05:50:20] <gw> njn: see new_animations_sender in SharedLayoutContext ?
[05:50:35] <gw> njn: perhaps you could do something similar
[05:50:38] *** Quits: dbaron (dbaron@moz-12jr9n.dynamic.fusionbroadband.com) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[05:50:49] <gw> njn: where the layout threads use the sender there to report memory usage per worker?
[05:52:16] <gw> njn: that's used by the layout workers to trigger new animations as they are encountered during css matching
[05:52:23] <njn> gw: where are the messages that go throug new_animiations_sender() received?
[05:53:23] <gw> njn: in process_new_animations, which is called by the layout task at the end of the reflow
[05:53:47] <gw> njn: so it effectively queues up messages from the worker threads, which are then handled by the owner layout task
[05:55:27] <njn> gw: so the LayoutWorker threads need to be able to receive a "CollectReports" message from the memory profiler
[05:55:29] <njn> possibly via the LayoutTask
[05:56:18] <gw> njn: trying to remember how that stuff works - does the layout task currently receive a similar message now?
[05:56:31] <njn> gw: from the memory reporter? yes
[05:57:18] <njn> LayoutChan implements `Reporter`
[05:58:04] <njn> when LayoutChan receives a collect_reports request from the profiler, it injects a `CollectReports` message into LayoutTask's event loop
[05:58:36] <njn> it's hard to do exactly that with the WorkerQueue because they have vanilla channels
[05:58:48] <njn> so I can't make the worker's channels implement `Report`, AFAICT
[05:59:02] <gw> njn: hmmm, looking
[06:00:27] <njn> maybe I can create a wrapper of sorts for the work_chan
[06:01:40] <njn> gw: yeah... I think that'll work
[06:01:46] <njn> I can store it next to the WorkQueue
[06:01:57] <gw> njn: I think, if you create a function in workqueue.rs, similar to run(), you could iterate each of the threads, and call a closure, which reports the stats?
[06:02:31] <gw> njn: I don't quite follow what you said above?
[06:02:35] <njn> gw: I see... generalize it so that we can measure any kind of WorkQueue?

[11:25:42] <Yoric> Hi
[11:25:52] <Yoric> What's the status of putting Rust-based components on mozilla-central? Is that legal yet?
[11:26:49] <Yoric> SimonSapin: ^
[11:27:08] <SimonSapin> Yoric: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=oxidation is the metabug
[11:27:52] <Yoric> Thanks.
[11:28:04] <Yoric> Because the component I'm working on right now looks like a good candidate for oxidation.
[11:28:26] <SimonSapin> Yoric: I think it’s find to land whatever you can make work if it’s off by default, but we need to solve things like OS X 10.6 support before it can be shipped
[11:28:34] <SimonSapin> s/find/fine/
[11:38:38] <Manishearth> Yoric: o/
[11:38:44] <Manishearth> what's the component?
[11:39:06] <Manishearth> SimonSapin: I thought we solved that?
[11:39:39] <SimonSapin> Manishearth: Dunno, I just see gh 1166996 still open
[11:39:52] <Manishearth> h,
[11:40:01] <SimonSapin> eh not gh, https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1166996
[11:40:05] <firebot> Bug 1166996 — NEW, nobody@mozilla.org — rustc doesn't support MacOS X 10.6
[11:41:30] <Yoric> Manishearth: WebRTC has a LoadMonitor that monitors, well, the load of the operating system and the current process.
[11:41:44] <Yoric> I am in the process of extracting it from WebRTC and into toolkit.
[11:41:53] <Yoric> But, well, writing multi-threaded code in C++ is no fun.
[11:41:54] <Manishearth> oh, nice
[11:42:47] <Yoric> I'd be happy to make it my first Rust contribution to m-c.
[11:42:52] <Manishearth> :)
[11:43:15] <Manishearth> Yoric: so is this a fx dev tool, or something that needs to go in production?
[11:43:29] <Yoric> This would eventually go in production.
[11:43:38] <Yoric> But it may remain locked to nightly for some time.
[11:43:42] <Manishearth> okay
[11:43:47] <Manishearth> in that case Rust sounds okay
[11:43:56] <Yoric> Anyway, I'm too wasted to write code right now.
[11:44:00] <Yoric> I'll take a nap.
[11:44:12] <Manishearth> Yoric: the current state of rust components is : There is build system support, but you should put all rust components behind a flag
[11:44:15] <Manishearth> ;)
[11:44:29] <Yoric> Being a daddy is hard :)
[11:44:31] <Manishearth> and nothing past nightly
[11:44:32] <Manishearth> hah

[15:37:41] <zmike_> jack: pretty sure I added some of those
[15:37:48] <SimonSapin> jack: components/servo/target/debug has four components
[15:37:57] <jack> ok
[15:38:01] <SimonSapin> or something like that
[15:38:37] <SimonSapin> I think we should have some convention on where to find the files instead
[15:38:58] <jack> The last group makes no sense.
[15:39:07] <SimonSapin> group?
[15:39:08] <jack> I see going back one (removing the executable name)
[15:39:10] <jack> and then going back two
[15:39:17] <jack> after that, it makes no sense to me.
[15:39:24] <jack> but the code does two more levels of shaving off two dirs.
[15:40:15] <jack> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/wQL1hKgo/
[15:40:58] <SimonSapin> pop() after push("resources") undoes that push, then then next pop goes one more level up
[15:41:19] <SimonSapin> why we do that whole thing twice I don’t know
[15:41:19] <jack> sure, but that has been outdated since target/debug existed.
[15:41:25] <jack> and tehre's even one more after that!
[15:42:18] <zmike_> so...I added the first part
[15:42:30] <zmike_> because it wasn't checking for resources/ in the same directory
[15:42:32] <SimonSapin> jack: how about starting from file!() instead of current_exe() ?
[15:42:54] <zmike_> the rest of them I think are assuming that it's running stuff from inside the source tree
[15:42:57] <jack> ok. because that makes no sense in a binary distribution :)
[15:42:59] <zmike_> which imo is probably wrong
[15:43:17] <jack> But this will have to change when we have those regardless.
[15:43:42] <zmike_> a Pipeline only has one PaintTask, yes?
[15:43:58] <jack> zmike: I think so, although that owns a threadpool.
[15:44:04] <SimonSapin> jack: start with file!(), and if that doesn’t exist looks in /usr/share/servo or something for distributions?
[15:44:18] <zmike_> ehh you can't just pass /usr/share
[15:44:24] <zmike_> that's a configure thing and we don't have configure
[15:45:14] <SimonSapin> use file!() and add a TODO for when we actually distribute binaries?
[15:45:59] <zmike_> I think for "correctness" you just need to ensure that the path is passed into opts during init based on how the binary was compiled
[15:46:25] <zmike_> eg. if you were compiling for a binary package where resources/ would be in /usr/share/servo then you would hardcode that value into that binary
[15:46:46] <zmike_> for things like we're doing now where it's just source builds then it's just whatever
[15:48:15] <jack> hmm. there's also the arch dir in here somewhere.
[15:48:30] <jack> so there is one more level possible.
[15:49:00] <jack> mach already doesn't handle that case.

[17:16:49] <larsberg> edunham: the only exception is when I mess up a dependency and salt thinks that my changes are a no-op (e.g., I change a file on a server, but the preq doesn't fire), so I always pass -v to make sure that it says something changed

[17:19:48] <larsberg> Savago: Awesome!
[17:20:11] <Savago> larsberg: it will only run on headless mode. I’m trying to figure it out what it takes to get it to run for real.
[17:20:34] <Savago> larsberg: it requires few changes on servo and some of its dependencies.
[17:21:16] <Savago> Do you think it would make sense to upstream those changes? They are minor… and would enable people to get servo running in rpi2 (which is a quite cheap and popular arm board).
[17:21:46] <Manishearth> jack: homu can look at multiple repos. See the <ul> for servo. http://build.servo.org/homu/
[17:22:09] <larsberg> Savago: definitely. These are changes required for any arm-linux config, right? If so, I assume pcwalton will need those changes for his work, too, once he updates to jack's changes to the deps
[17:22:18] <jack> Manishearth, larsberg: I may try this today. What's the first repo to add?
[17:22:39] <Manishearth> larsberg: yeah, I'm not killing syntax, mostly jsut imports that could be  taken from the facade
[17:23:09] <Manishearth> jack: stuff that gets lots of contribs. h5e, url for a start. 
[17:23:10] <Savago> larsberg: yeah, I’m using a checkout from yesterday. As a matter of fact, I’m just finishing a build from today’s servo to make sure that everything is fine.
[17:23:14] <Manishearth> We could let hyper use our homu too
[17:23:48] <jack> ok. i'l start with rust-url and move to h5e if I am successful.

[19:08:02] <larsberg> Gankro: we are trying to get as many of our dependencies off of nightly and onto stable as possible to maximize reuse / contributions. I'm a little skeptical about Servo itself (see the rust thread - we use all the new features as they're added and before they're stable, pretty much by definition), but there's no reason most of our eightybajillion
[19:08:03] <larsberg> dependencies can't be on stable.
[19:08:33] <Manishearth> larsberg: I'm *only* looking at servo btw
[19:08:36] <Manishearth> deps, maybe later
[19:09:33] <Manishearth> larsberg: the intention is to reduce unstable deps wherever possible, and to get a list of papercut-unstable features that are  just unstable due to naming or whatever
[19:09:37] <Manishearth> that actually get used a lot
[19:09:42] <Manishearth> eg push_all is used *everywhere*

[19:14:14] <mwu> associated consts and const fn fix a lot of issues
[19:14:32] <Manishearth> mwu: until 1.3 gets a really shiny feature like higher kinded associated const linear higher order functions
[19:14:40] <Manishearth> and then you want that
[19:14:42] <Manishearth> badly
[19:15:00] <larsberg> Manishearth: or, more realistically, virtual structs / DOM inheritance support :-)
[19:15:02] <mwu> I have no idea what those are
[19:15:19] <Manishearth> mwu: I just strung together some jargon :P
[19:15:36] <mwu> also I don't really feel like virtual structs are that important..

[19:16:07] <mwu> uh oh

[19:16:37] <larsberg> mwu: it was the biggest request from the content/DOM team to make implementing DOM features easier; I have no personal opinions on it other than that I've been told to "make it happen" :-)
[19:18:06] <larsberg> (jdm generally handles requests from them, since he also sits in that org)
[19:18:58] <mwu> larsberg: do you know if it involves adding some way to safely upcast?
[19:19:06] <Manishearth> mwu: that is a must
[19:19:17] <Manishearth> and I think most proposals till now have it
[19:19:22] <Manishearth> the current one seems to
[19:19:53] <mwu> like a dynamic_cast, right

[21:21:57] <_Y_> what are r+ then?
[21:22:14] <jack> Manishearth: the travis token has to be the token of the user who set up the repo on travis intiially.
[21:22:27] <jack> So I get to find everyone' suser tokens and include them in the build config!
[21:22:41] <jack> It's not even clear how to find who set it up
[21:23:01] <_Y_> did kmc set it up?
[21:23:18] <Manishearth> jack: that sucks
[21:23:26] <Manishearth> I think in most cases it was me
[21:23:38] <Manishearth> I wonder if Travis has org tokens
[21:24:26] <Savago> larsberg: all the rpi2 patches have landed on servo deps. The only thing missing is landing this on servo https://gist.github.com/Adenilson/233c5f771f331270f52a
[21:24:31] <Savago> and update the hashes of the deps.
[21:24:38] <jack> oh. it looks like i can change it on github perhaps.
[21:24:51] <jack> (for html5ever it turns out to have been kmc)
[21:24:55] <Manishearth> jack: you need to give bors admin access
[21:25:29] <larsberg> Savago: excellent! did you have to add any arm-specific cfgs anywhere, or just the Cargo hackery?
[21:25:38] <jack> Manishearth: that I already did.
[21:25:47] <larsberg> (I ask because I probably won't get to adding a builder before the workweek, as there's a lot to plan and prepare)
[21:25:52] <Savago> larsberg: some of the deps would fail to find freetype2 on raspbian.
[21:26:03] <Savago> (then it was just a matter to edit the makefiles).
[21:26:26] <larsberg> Savago: nice; that sounds like the kind of thing we are (hopefully) unlikely to bitrot if we do another rust upgrade, etc.

[22:26:10] <pcwalton> ok, I implemented chunking for layout on ARM
[22:26:21] <pcwalton> bear in mind there are still segfaults I need to fix so take these numbers with a grain of salt
[22:26:46] <pcwalton> but for me on x86, the speedup for layout is 1x, 1.43x, 2.41x for 1, 2, 4 cores respectively
[22:27:01] <pcwalton> for ARM big.LITTLE, the speedup is 1x, 1.44x, 2.55x for 1, 2, 4 cores respectively
[22:27:10] <pcwalton> so, slightly better scaling than x86 :)
[22:27:21] <pcwalton> roughly equivalent
[22:27:53] <pcwalton> style recalc is worse -- 1x, 1.82x, 2.34x on x86 vs. 1x, 1.58x, 1.98x ARM and I wouldn't be surprised if the problem is properties::cascade

[22:40:14] <larsberg> frewsxcv: once per version of D that cargo picks up
[22:40:48] <larsberg> pcwalton: that's very exciting - nice work!
[22:43:12] <frewsxcv> larsberg: so if that's the case, is there any reason to have components/utils do something like this? https://github.com/servo/servo/blob/master/components/util/lib.rs#L43-L44    it looks like compontents/utils doesn't actually utilize those reexports, but other components do. it seems like each component that utilize those reexports could just depend on
[22:43:12] <frewsxcv> those individually
[22:44:00] <mbrubeck> frewsxcv: Yup, I agree.
[22:44:15] <mbrubeck> frewsxcv: I think it's because smallvec (and fnv? I'm not sure) started out as a module within the util crate.
[22:44:29] <mbrubeck> So that was just to ease the transition.
[22:44:30] <frewsxcv> right, that's what i figured
