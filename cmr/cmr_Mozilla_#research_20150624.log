[06:22:21] <sunfish> Gankro: hi!
[06:24:47] <Gankro> sunfish: hey!
[06:30:54] <Gankro> sunfish: is the issue clear (reading it again I think I mixed something up; the main point is that it would be nice to not have to special handle no-op offsets on fake allocations, at least in some special cases.
[06:35:33] <sunfish> Gankro: some of the rust syntax isn't clear to me, but I think ultimately, LLVM doesn't want you to do "regular" pointer arithmetic on non-allocated memory
[06:36:04] <Gankro> sunfish: Is there a way to mark an address as allocated?
[06:36:38] <sunfish> no, the property of being allocated is implied and and depends on which API abstraction level you're at
[06:39:29] <Gankro> sunfish: This is also a fairly... hypothetical problem for us, in that there's several known locations where we just do this and we've never had LLVM do something bad. Presumably relying on it Just Working is a Super Bad Idea?
[06:40:13] <sunfish> undefined behavior can do what you want 999999 times and then send demons out your nose the next time
[06:40:20] <Gankro> Yeah
[06:40:48] <sunfish> what is heap::EMPTY?
[06:40:57] <Gankro> sunfish: literally just 1
[06:41:08] <sunfish> what is it used for?
[06:41:31] <Gankro> sunfish: When you ask us to heap allocate a zero-sized type we just spit that out, usually
[06:41:48] <Gankro> Since any request to load/store it is a no-op, so it doesn't matter
[06:42:00] <sunfish> because 0 would be considered an indication of failure?
[06:42:26] <Gankro> sunfish: we also do some tricks with nulls and tagged unions
[06:43:03] <sunfish> oh, so you're only adding 0 to it?
[06:43:08] <Gankro> sunfish: Yeah
[06:43:32] <Gankro> Which is why it seems maybe kinda ok
[06:43:35] <sunfish> it's possible you can get away with that
[06:43:51] <sunfish> and a fake allocation can indeed model this
[06:44:18] <sunfish> inbounds permits "one-past-the-end" pointers
[06:44:41] <sunfish> so 1 as mut* is just one-past-the-end of a zero-length allocation starting at 1
[06:45:11] <sunfish> adding zero to that produces a result which is also valid, because it's also a one-past-the-end pointer
[06:45:27] <Gankro> yep
[06:45:29] <Gankro> sunfish: How does one model a fake allocation to llvm?
[06:45:41] <sunfish> you don't have to do anything :-)
[06:45:52] <sunfish> it's magic
[06:46:28] <Gankro> As in llvm considers ever address allocated for a zero-sized type?
[06:47:13] <sunfish> kind of
[06:47:36] <sunfish> i think of it as, you have to have some concept in your own head of where the allocations are, and stick to it
[06:47:50] <sunfish> and llvm has to behave correctly no matter what that concept is
[06:48:13] <sunfish> but llvm is allowed to assume that you're following your own rules
[06:48:34] <Gankro> I can work with that.
[06:49:15] <Gankro> sunfish: What if I offset-by-0 of heap::EMPTY while saying it's e.g. a byte?
[06:50:13] <sunfish> another rule is that you need to make sure that none of your fake allocations ever share any bytes with llvm allocated objects
[06:50:58] <sunfish> hmm, i don't immediately see a problem with pretending that you've allocated 1 byte at address 1
[06:51:18] <Gankro> sunfish: Hmm, so if I say heap::EMPTY is a HugeStruct and offset by 0, that may cause LLVM to think there's a HugeStruct there which could potentially run into actual allocated memory?
[06:52:40] <sunfish> yeah. part of the game is that you need to pick addresses which aren't going to alias the stack or any global variables or anything that malloc will ever return
[06:53:44] <Gankro> I can probably live with special-handling empty array iterators (which is where we might do this)
