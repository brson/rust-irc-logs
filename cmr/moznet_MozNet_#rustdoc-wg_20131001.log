[18:14:44] <Seldaek> ohai
[18:15:04] <Seldaek> so it's great I'm less in the future now, but on the other hand omg shitty internet :(
[18:16:12] <Seldaek> anyway cmr  re links I agree those inside docblocks maybe should just be font-weight:normal + underline or something
[18:24:02] <cmr> Seldaek: less in the future?
[18:31:41] <Seldaek> I'm in buenos aires
[18:31:50] <Seldaek> around same timezone as you I guess
[18:31:54] <cmr> ohhh
[18:32:25] <Seldaek> my irssi-over-the-atlantic-ssh is pretty painful though :)
[18:32:52] <cmr> can't be worse than mine over the pacific :P
[18:34:58] <cmr> What time isit foryou?
[18:36:07] <Seldaek>  15.30
[18:36:20] <cmr> so only an hour in the future :D
[18:36:46] <Seldaek> aye
[18:37:29] <Seldaek> ah great loop>continue (reading TWiR..) 
[18:51:04] <cmr> yep
[19:33:57] <Seldaek> acrichto: oh the 0.8 docs aren't rebuilt when your improvements get merge d:/
[19:34:06] <Seldaek> that's sad
[19:34:08] <acrichto> yeah :(
[19:35:02] <Seldaek> obviously if the language changes at some point it might be impossible to build 0.8 with latest rustdoc
[19:35:13] <Seldaek> but as long as it is, it'd be cool
[19:51:01] <cmr> Yeah, I agree actually.
[19:51:12] <cmr> That'd be really nice to do.
