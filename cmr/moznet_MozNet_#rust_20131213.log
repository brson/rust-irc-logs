[00:43:09] <Leo`> oh
[00:43:14] <aatch> Luqman, oh! that's the cause of the ICE
[00:43:27] <Leo`> I had almost forgotten that

[00:44:00] <Leo`> a better error message would be nice, maybe ? :)
[00:44:08] <aatch> Leo`, it's a bug in rustc to be sure.
[00:44:17] <aatch> Any ICE is a bug
[00:44:25] <Leo`> "can't statically allocate type Foo taht implements the Drop trait" or whatever
[00:44:26] <aatch> Just trying to find the cause of it.
[00:44:31] <Leo`> ok
[00:45:03] <Leo`> ok it's just this :D
[00:45:11] <Leo`> this is not a real problem for my code
[00:45:38] <Leo`> I could use a *mut GCPair instead of the Pair with the Drop trait

[02:13:22] * bjz was being a tad jokey there
[02:13:37] <Jarrett> okay, I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong here.. I have an enum type Value. I have a function which returns Value.  I have a ~[Value] in that function, and I'm trying to return an element of that vector, but I'm getting: "cannot move out of dereference of & pointer"
[02:13:45] <bjz> yay sarcasm on the interwebs
[02:14:03] <bjz> Jarrett: you need to .clone() it
[02:14:16] <Jarrett> |:V
[02:14:19] <bjz> Jarrett: or get a reference to it instead
[02:14:54] <bjz> Jarrett: Rust moves by default. it is trying to move it out of the reference, but that isn't allowed
[02:15:04] <Jarrett> ohhh.
[02:15:38] <Jarrett> and putting #[deriving(Clone)] on the Value enum is the right thing to do here, yes
[02:15:40] <bjz> that's a pretty imprecise explanation

[02:16:25] <bjz> Jarrett: it means we don't have all this rvalue/lvalue complexity of C++11

[02:17:20] <aatch> Move by default also makes more sense because it's the most generic.
[02:17:31] <aatch> Everything (well, almost) can be moved.
[02:17:41] <Jarrett> right
[02:17:47] <aatch> (there are some odd things that rely on their address, but we'll ignore those)
[02:18:05] <bjz> you can think of it better as, 'it moves if it has a destructor'
[02:18:20] <bjz> other things can be implicitly copied
[02:18:47] <Jarrett> or given a default implementation of Copy (like enums)
[02:18:50] <bjz> but in generic code you need to explicitly clone
[02:19:04] <aatch> Jarrett, you mean Clone?
[02:19:15] <bjz> Copy was an old inbuilt kind
[02:19:39] <aatch> We have rules for knowing when a type can be implicitly copied though.
[02:19:50] <bjz> there used to be a copy keyword, but it was libified
[02:19:52] <aatch> And Copy is sorta being resurrected as Pod.

[03:00:12] <wycats_> brave?

[03:01:07] <wycats_> kinzeron: for what I'm saying?
[03:01:12] <wycats_> F# has no GC?
[03:01:15] <aatch> Jarrett, if it's copyable or clonable, you can.
[03:01:27] <wycats_> you can control the storage of a value (stack vs. heap) in F#?
[03:01:45] <aatch> kinzeron, you can't write on-the-metal code in those languages.
[03:01:53] <ChrisMorgan> aatch: but that's by borrowing it and cloning that, right?
[03:02:00] <aatch> ChrisMorgan, well yes.
[03:02:15] <kinzeron> not f#, but I think you can do with ocaml
[03:02:37] <kinzeron> of course rust is a more interesting option if it's stable
[03:02:46] <kinzeron> which is why I m asking this question
[03:02:52] <aatch> kinzeron, I don't think so. Doesn't Ocaml have garbage collection?

[03:05:23] <kinzeron> feature wise I like where rust is going
[03:05:45] <bjz> kinzeron: I don't find it too bad keeping up, but my stuff isn't for production

[03:09:20] <Jarrett> nnngh. I have an Rc<~str> s and I want to print out the string contained inside. s.borrow().clone() doesn't work (can't move out of & blah blah), but even if it did, I wouldn't want to copy the string just to print it...

[03:12:24] <Jarrett> yeah, but now I have the problem that this is a match arm, and the other arms use to_str() on some values to give ~str

[03:14:35] <ChrisMorgan> Jarrett: or come up with a way that the others can be slices as well, or make it so that you don't actually need to have that value as the value of the match expression.
[03:15:14] <bjz> ChrisMorgan: if he's using to_str it might be hard

[03:15:59] <bjz> Jarrett: gistygist?
[03:16:57] <wycats_> the issue isn't really GC
[03:17:04] <wycats_> it's control over stack vs. heap allocation
[03:17:14] <wycats_> you can get away with a ton of stack allocation in rust
[03:17:44] <bjz> wycats_: you mean re. kinzeron's language choices?
[03:18:01] <bjz> yeah, I love the fact that you can do unboxed types in Rust
[03:18:27] <bjz> the indirection from boxing is a big performance sink
[03:19:07] <wycats_> bjz: correct
[03:19:41] <wycats_> Rust is basically the only remotely mainstream language that lets you manage values in the optimally efficient way without giving up on segfault safety
[03:19:50] <wycats_> that probably wasn't the right way to say it, but I'm on pain meds 
[03:19:51] <wycats_> :P
[03:19:53] <wycats_> forgive me
[03:20:05] <doublec> technically it's not mainstream yet
[03:22:07] <ChrisMorgan> Rust has seriously warped my judgement on matters of performance. I write code in both Python and in Rust and in Rust I agonise about the difference between performance of 4 and of 5 while in Python it's not even possible to get past 2. (Arbitrary values, of course, but it's the right idea.)

[03:34:19] <ChrisMorgan> kinzeron: http://michaelwoerister.github.io/2013/09/27/what-you-call-the-present.html covers using Eclipse for debugging Rust code.

[03:34:32] <aatch> kinzeron, we use C++ name mangling.
[03:34:55] <aatch> wycats_, we used to have backtraces, it's just part of unwinding.
[03:35:11] <ChrisMorgan> Old runtime did backtraces, new runtime doesn't yet.
[03:35:16] <aatch> you can create the backtrace before starting the unwind.

[03:42:58] <aatch> so String(ref s) binds to `s` *by-reference*, otherwise you are trying to move it out of the String(ValStr) variant.
[03:43:16] <ChrisMorgan> Jarrett: the Rc can't be implicitly copied (whereas the uint and the bool can be), so you would be consuming the Value by using `String(s)`, which is unsound and not permitted.
[03:43:39] <bjz> Jarrett: we can't reuse `&` here, because that destructures a reference

[04:05:14] <carter> Luqman: should i have a ccache?
[04:05:31] <kinzeron> but how can I include librt as a static linked library ?
[04:05:47] <aatch> kinzeron, do you have librt.a available?

[04:06:57] <kinzeron> the good thing is that rust works out of the box on qt creator
[04:07:15] <kinzeron> the bad thing is that the executable is huge!
[04:07:57] <carter> whats making it so big?
[04:08:06] <acrichto> kinzeron: yeah sadly right now the executables have lots of code pulled in, but if you run with -Z lto it should trim the size down a bit
[04:08:26] <carter> acrichto: wouldn't having function sections in the object files help too?
[04:08:35] <acrichto> kinzeron: also, the librt.so depednency is pulled in by libstd, it has a dependency so your executable is linked with -lrt, and it must be finding the dynamic version first

[04:09:47] <carter> mind you i'm still learning
[04:09:48] <acrichto> if you link without optimizations just as you normally would, I found ffunction-sections to slow things down a fair amount

[04:10:16] <carter> and big ideas
[04:10:25] <acrichto> kinzeron: right now libstd is libstd and it's s small as it's gonna get, but soon you should be able to select particular variants where some may be smaller than others
[04:10:37] <aatch> kinzeron, fairly hard. acrichto is right though, and using -Z lto will likely shrink it down.
[04:10:40] <acrichto> carter: what do you mean "call rust from another lang", you mean like calling rust from C code?
[04:10:47] <carter> nah

[04:17:48] <acrichto> specifically in the "box" department is this idea of "placement new" which means that you construct an object "into a memory location"
[04:18:02] <carter> oh "heres some preexisting mem, use it"
[04:18:03] <carter> ?
[04:18:03] <acrichto> which is more efficient than creating an object in a temporary and then moving it in

[04:21:14] <kinzeron> my opinion has little weight, but coming from different paradigms, i still prefer to have a shortcut
[04:21:29] <kinzeron> making the code verbose kills readability
[04:21:40] <kinzeron> that's the pitfall of C++
[04:22:00] <aatch> jtbandes, because, well, ~str can't be derefences and you are trying to dereference it.
[04:22:14] <aatch> (bah, typing is hard)

[04:23:57] <jtbandes> so the & pointer is self, I think?
[04:23:59] <kinzeron> a problem rust will have to deal with in the future
[04:24:10] <aatch> Only one place can hold onto it, so when you bind it to `n` it tries to to move it out.

[04:24:36] <kinzeron> jeaye: there are many
[04:24:44] <jeaye> kinzeron: My point exactly.
[04:24:50] <aatch> you can bind by reference using Foo(ref n), then turning the '&~str` into a &str by using '.as_slice'
[04:24:56] <kinzeron> but if rust is going to take the verbosity route, it's gona end like that
[04:25:01] <acrichto> o11c: don't worr, there's been plenty of discussion on that :)

[04:25:08] <jtbandes> hm

[05:13:32] <escalant3> Hi, I am new to Rust. I am trying to be able to use the documentation better and would appreciate some help. I am playing with strings. I know I can use my_str.len() to get the length of a string. But if I don't see the .len() method at http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/master/std/str/trait.StrSlice.html
[05:13:49] <rntz> has anyone implemented finger trees for rust yet?
[05:13:53] <escalant3> Where should I have looked? Let's say I want to reverse a string, where could I find it?
[05:14:43] <Yurume> escalant3: it's in std::iter::Container (I think).
[05:14:44] <ChrisMorgan> escalant3: http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/master/std/container/trait.Container.html#tymethod.len
[05:14:53] <Yurume> ah, std::container.
[05:15:10] <ChrisMorgan> escalant3: the search on the API docs is quite good
[05:16:04] <ChrisMorgan> escalant3: implementing StrSlice does not actually require Container to be implemented.
[05:16:26] <ChrisMorgan> (But in practice, &str is the only type that StrSlice is expected to be implemented on, and it does implement Container.)
[05:17:18] <escalant3> I see. But as a newcomer, I don't know that str implements the Container trait. And I don't see any reference to it at http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/0.8/std/str/index.html. I guess I am missing the flow
[05:17:47] <Jarrett> yaaaay it worked!
[05:17:52] <derek_c> what could be the reason that the compiler is complaining that "type `std::rand::TaskRng` does not implement any method in scope named `gen_range`", while it actually does?
[05:17:56] <ChrisMorgan> escalant3: at present, &str is not a documented type; this is a known problem and is on the way to being fixed.
[05:18:11] <Jarrett> it looks really silly to have to do "let a = arr.borrow().borrow(); a.get()[i]" or something but hey :P
[05:18:21] <ChrisMorgan> derek_c: it doesn't, actually.
[05:18:37] <derek_c> ChrisMorgan: I don't understand. it's in the source code

[07:09:24] <diverse> Yeah, the point of abstraction is to hide the complexity. So you don't need to have an understanding of how the system works. What I mean is, without having to learn the complexities, makes it easier for other users to understand the system at a high level and the abstraction makes it look like magic.

[08:10:41] <eddyb> you *don't want* to infer bounds

[11:11:37] <Jarrett> so I'm curious about something
[11:11:56] <Jarrett> is it at all possible to write a library in Rust that exposes a C interface that can be used by... anything else?
[11:12:12] <cmr> as much as it is in C++
[11:12:47] <Jarrett> really? I was under the impression that the threaded stacks made things more difficult
[11:12:51] <Jarrett> or can those be disabled
[11:13:01] <dbaupp> Rust now uses the C stack
[11:13:05] <Jarrett> :o

[12:05:01] <cmr> yep
[12:05:21] <ChrisMorgan> ohcount is a pretty nasty project. It's quite poorly implemented, the tests don't pass (try removing the failing tests and you just come across more that are broken and more fundamentally), …
[12:05:53] <stomper> is it fixed or offline?
[12:06:21] <cmr> stomper: well it still fails, but fails don't bring down the rest of the builders (as it should be, until android is stabilized)
[12:06:35] <ChrisMorgan> ohcount parsers also do ridiculously precise parsing, considering all it *actually* cares about is whether a line is code, comment or blank.
[12:06:47] <stomper> oh okay, thanks for the info
[12:07:02] <ChrisMorgan> It'd be good having it integrate with .*ignore files, too. Time to rewrite it in Rust, adding features and making it more generally useful.

[14:03:49] <nmatsakis> ezyang: I'm not sure what you mean by "in principle" -- I mean, as long sa the property exists, it can in theory be proven
[14:03:56] <cmr> std::unstable::intrinsics::uninit() iirc
[14:04:00] <nmatsakis> ezyang: but maybe you mean "with simple extensions to the existing reasoning"

[14:04:22] <nmatsakis> ezyang: I'm not sure. I guess it'd be helpful to have a more concise example.
[14:04:41] <nmatsakis> ezyang: so I know we are thinking of the same thing :)
[14:04:43] <ezyang> ok 
[14:04:52] <nmatsakis> ezyang: e.g., I have some code that builds a linked list that threads up through stack frames,
[14:05:02] <nmatsakis> ezyang: where the entries are allocated on the stack,
[14:05:18] <nmatsakis> ezyang: and I don't think the borrow checker could check equivalent code that used a loop and a vector
[14:05:23] <mib_lfvevc> cmr: What's the recommended way to pass variables as "out" parameters? Initialize them first with content that's overwritten in the external function?
[14:05:50] <cmr> mib_lfvevc: you don't need to initialize them, as long as the C fn does it.
[14:05:54] <nmatsakis> ezyang: (without a lot more complex reasoning)
[14:06:27] <ezyang> nmatsakis: *nod* That's sort of the intuition I have too 
[14:07:20] <mib_lfvevc> cmr: So the recommended way is to use std::unstable::... ?
[14:07:38] <cmr> mib_lfvevc: *I'd* recommend it :P
[14:07:54] <ezyang> nmatsakis: BTW, not to be a nag, but could you send me a copy of a preprint of whatever paper y'all have about the borrow checker? :) 
[14:08:22] <mib_lfvevc> sounds dangerous :O
[14:08:36] <cmr> mib_lfvevc: what, uninit?
[14:09:06] <nmatsakis> ezyang: oh yes sorry :) I'll do it, but I don't think it'll be very useful
[14:09:10] <nmatsakis> ezyang: I've been meaning to write you about that
[14:09:18] <nmatsakis> ezyang: mainly because it describes a much older model
[14:09:21] <ezyang> nmatsakis: Ah. Well, if it won't be useful, what do you think would be? 
[14:09:24] <nmatsakis> ezyang: but the foundations are the same nonetheless so maybe it will be
[14:09:30] <nmatsakis> ezyang: a paper that we haven't written yet? :)
[14:09:32] <ezyang> Aha! A good reason. 
[14:09:35] <ezyang> Hehe

[14:09:54] <nmatsakis> ezyang: or possibly the docs in src/librustc/middle/borrowck/doc.rs, maybe in combination with the paper
[14:10:07] <nmatsakis> ezyang: but those are rather rough, more like a rough draft

[17:01:23] <sellout> So, _if_ higher-kinded types were added to rust, would the syntax of all traits change? EG, `trait Functor<F> { fn map<A, B>(f: |A| -> B, x: F<A>) -> F<B>  }` – could `&self` be used at all in traits anymore? Has anyone done any work in this direction or made a list of issues they’ve thought of?

[17:01:51] <Ms2ger> 42
[17:02:00] <bstrie> sellout: nmatsakis is the only one who has probably given it any thought at all
[17:02:08] <cmr> Wait why would any changes to the syntax need to happen
[17:03:34] <sellout> cmr: Because you need to be able to do F<A>/F<B> to parameterize the type differently. &Self won’t let you parameterize and Functor<A>/Functor<B> doesn’t express the right thing. But, I haven’t thought too much about it, yet. Just planning to …
[17:05:34] <cmr> sellout: do you mean `self` or `Self`?
[17:05:43] <cmr> they're entirely different
[17:05:48] <cmr> one is magic, one is a type parameter.
[17:05:59] <sellout> cmr: I _think_ I used the ones where I intended to.
[17:06:33] <arrrrrrrrr> Do pointers to struct A; (A has no fields) and *c_void cast? I ask this because I want some type safety for external function calls.
[17:06:56] <cmr> arrrrrrrrr: one can always cast an unsafe pointer to any other type.
[17:07:00] <arrrrrrrrr> I mean: Is this a good idea?
[17:07:09] <cmr> any other unsafe pointer type, that is.
[17:07:19] <benh> There's also std::somethingsomething::Void which is an empty enum
[17:07:23] <sellout> cmr: Using the current syntax, I can’t see how I would express Functor (barring the fact that it wouldn’t work anyway).

[17:08:53] <sellout> `trait Functor<A> { fn map<B>(f: |A| -> B, x: Functor<A>) -> Functor<B>  }` is about as close as I can come, but that doesn’t express that both Functor<A> and Functor<B> should be the same functor (EG, List<A>/List<B>, not List<A>/vec<B>)

[17:31:27] <Blei> while we're all transmuting and forgetting, i have a question in a similar vein: i want to pass an owned pointer to a c function (transferring ownership in the process). deallocation is handled as well (by registering a deallocation function with the c code)
[17:31:31] <arrrrrrrrr> fn reg(cb: extern "C" fn(d: ~A), a: ~A);
[17:31:34] <arrrrrrrrr> does this work?
[17:31:41] <Blei> now, how do i cast a ~foo object to a *c_void?
[17:31:44] <cmr> arrrrrrrrr: no
[17:31:51] <Blei> transmute won't let me (different type sizes)
[17:31:57] <arrrrrrrrr> ohh, why?
[17:32:03] <arrrrrrrrr> isn't ~A just a pointer internally?
[17:32:15] <benh> For trait objects it's also a vptr
[17:32:38] <cmr> arrrrrrrrr: that would move the ptr into C, which isn't really safe. It doesn't have to free it, etc.
[17:32:41] <benh> If it's just a regular type, that should work?
[17:33:09] <cmr> depends on how exactly the C lib works.

[17:35:28] <cmr> that'd probably work yeah
[17:35:37] <arrrrrrrrr> cmr: I don't see why casting ~ to * is safer when your concern is that the C function might call free on it
[17:35:56] <cmr> arrrrrrrrr: ~ has a destructor that isn't necessarily free
[17:35:59] <sellout> Ms2ger: Yeah, I think TaPL is useful reading regardless, and specifically for a language like rust. It does talk about HKT explicitly and gives a good basis for understanding it in a larger context. But maybe a lot of reading if your only goal is to figure out what a HKT is :)
[17:36:10] <Ms2ger> Right :)
[17:36:30] <cmr> arrrrrrrrr: and if it calls that callback multiple times you've now broken ~'s invariants entirely
[17:36:33] <arrrrrrrrr> cmr: So does (a as *c_void) do more than tell the compiler to let it be?
[17:36:42] <arrrrrrrrr> Ahh, I see.
[17:36:53] <arrrrrrrrr> Of course, that will actually happen.

[19:47:46] <SiegeLord> It says it prefers static by default, but ldd tells me my executables reference shared libraries?
[19:48:26] <acrichto> SiegeLord: our prefence is that of choosing between an rlib and a dylib, libstd has a number of dynamic system dependencies which are not always known to have static copies
[19:48:55] <acrichto> static linking sadly isn't a magic bullet for a "standalone executable", that would require much more thought in order to figure out how to drop various native dependencies that we have

[19:49:20] <acrichto> static linking of rust crates to one another
[19:49:23] <Luqman> SiegeLord: that's because the final linking step uses gcc/clang which seem to prefer shared to static libs. Passing --link-args -static  might work for you

[20:05:56] <bstrie> hello
[20:06:06] <tiffany> I suppose so

[20:06:22] <jack> if anyone knows something else I can do to help, let me know. i have no idea how else to deal with these spambots.

[20:06:33] <bstrie> jack: possibly alert whoever runs the server
[20:06:37] <tiffany> I wonder if this ircd has word blacklisting
[20:06:39] <bstrie> see if there are any ips they can blacklist
[20:06:57] <jack> tiffany: we could ban anyone who says "Hello" and "Welcome"! :)
[20:06:57] <pnkfelix> why didn't the earlier fix (put in by jdm earlier today right?), why didn't that stick?
[20:07:13] <jack> pnkfelix: what was the earlier fix?
[20:07:20] <bstrie> pnkfelix: +M
[20:07:39] <jack> I assume we reverted because it's not very friendly to newbies.
[20:07:41] <tiffany> well because I imagine there's a considerable number of legitimate users here who aren't registered with nickserv
[20:08:01] <jack> We should update the topic probably to let people know

[20:09:59] <Ms2ger> jack, I'd set +R too
[20:10:05] <jack> what is +R?
[20:10:14] <Ms2ger> *  R = Only registered (+r) users may join the channel [o]
[20:10:29] <tiffany> I'm pretty sure +M is this ircd's +R

[20:10:45] <jack> I don't think we can do +R without documentation updates.
[20:10:57] <jack> People might not know why they can't join :(
[20:11:02] <tiffany> yeah
[20:11:06] <Ms2ger> Sounds like we need documentation updates, then
[20:11:27] <jack> Ms2ger: I'm not opposed, I'm just not signing up for that right now :)
[20:11:36] <tiffany> the last thing we need to do is require new people to go through a confusing registration process before they can see what they're signing up for
[20:12:03] <Blei> Welcome
[20:12:06] <jack> today is just a bad day on mozirc. normally -M and -R work just fine for us.
[20:12:08] <Blei> fun
[20:12:37] <jack> Ms2ger: is there a channel here to talk to irc netops about these issues?
[20:12:42] <Ms2ger> #it, I guess
[20:12:50] <Ms2ger> And the last thing we need is actually spambots
[20:12:53] <jack> I assume #rust is being targetted, because #servo is not seeing this.
[20:13:18] <tiffany> it's probably some go fanatics
[20:13:23] <tiffany> it's been done in the past
[20:13:31] <Ms2ger> It's the only channel I'm in, at least

[20:36:01] <arrrrrrrrr> does anybody have an idea how to work around https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/10954 for now?
[20:40:09] <pnkfelix> arrrrrrrrr: Have you tried providing an explicit lifetime param when you instantiate A<T> in the `unsafe` block ?
[20:41:05] <arrrrrrrrr> what do you mean?
[20:41:12] <pnkfelix> arrrrrrrrr: we try to infer lifetime parameters
[20:41:30] <pnkfelix> arrrrrrrrr: the 'a thing in `struct A<'a, T>`
[20:42:12] <arrrrrrrrr> How would 'a be defined?
[20:42:23] <pnkfelix> arrrrrrrrr: but you should be able to try to explicitly instantiate it, if you get a lifetime parameter, e.g. if you add a lifetime parameter to the `fn a<T>`
[20:43:04] <pnkfelix> arrrrrrrrr: like: `fn a<'l, T>(a: *c_void, b: Option<&'l ()>)`
[20:43:24] <arrrrrrrrr> struct A { a: T }
[20:43:28] <arrrrrrrrr> doesn't work either

[20:46:58] <SiegeLord> What is the difference between these two lifetimes: impl<'l> Foo{ fn test<'m>(&'m self) {} } ?
[20:47:11] <arrrrrrrrr> extern "Rust" gives me  internal compiler error: unimplemented Foreign functions with Rust ABI
[20:47:19] <SiegeLord> I can sort of understand 'm, it's basically the usual thing... but what is 'l?
[20:47:39] <kmc> SiegeLord: lifetimes, like other type parameters, can be introduced by impl or by an individual fn
[20:47:54] <SiegeLord> Yes, but what is 'l a lifetime of?
[20:47:59] <kmc> nothing, it's unused
[20:48:15] <kmc> impl<T> Foo { fn f(&self) -> int }
[20:48:18] <kmc> T is unused
[20:48:39] <SiegeLord> You don't know it's unused
[20:48:47] <SiegeLord> Oh, err
[20:48:51] <SiegeLord> Foo<'l>
[20:48:54] <SiegeLord> Forgot that
[20:49:48] <kmc> oh, is Foo a struct with a lifetime parameter?

[20:51:01] *** Joins: brendan (brendaneic@moz-BBE3ABD.mv.mozilla.com)
[20:51:58] <SiegeLord> Yeah?
[20:52:23] <SiegeLord> So what is the relationship between 'l and 'm
[20:52:35] <kmc> almost none
[20:53:08] <kmc> test takes a Foo by reference; the lifetime of that reference is 'm; it also happens that Foo contains some borrowed pointers and their lifetime is 'l
[20:54:38] <SiegeLord> If I do fn test<'m>(&'m self) -> Foo<*> {} which lifetime do I stick in there?
[20:54:50] <SiegeLord> Well, { self }
[20:55:05] <kmc> if you're returning self directly then you would use 'm
[20:55:08] <SiegeLord> fn test<'m>(&'m self) -> &'m Foo<*> { self }
[20:55:22] <kmc> but you might have e.g.   fn test<'m>(&'m self) -> &'l int { self.bar }
[20:55:37] <kmc> but in that case the 'm parameter could be inferred
[20:56:00] <kmc> and it would be simpler to write  impl<'l> Foo<'l> { fn test(&self) -> &'l int { self.bar } }
[20:56:20] <kmc> (sorry for using the terms "reference" and "borrowed pointer" interchangeably btw)
[20:58:10] <SiegeLord> I do observe that I can return both Foo<'m> and Foo<'l>... so 'm is a subset of 'l?
[20:58:20] <SiegeLord> I suppose that makes sense

[21:57:46] <jhasse> hi! How can I convert a str to a c_str to pass it to a c function?
[21:58:54] <jack> jhasse: look for with_c_str
[21:58:56] <kmc> jhasse: mystr.with_c_str(|s| c_function(s))
[21:58:57] <jack> or as_c_str
[21:59:01] <kmc> it's a method of the ToCStr trait
[21:59:18] <kmc> make sure not to do   c_function(mystr.with_c_str(|s| s))
[21:59:27] <kmc> because that might free the memory for the C string before the C function is called
[21:59:44] <Jarrett> what does "borrowed value does not long enough" mean and how do I get around it? e.g. foo(bar()) where bar() apparently returns a borrowed value that doesn't live long enough

[21:59:56] <kmc> also note that Rust ~str can contain null characters which will confuse most C string functions
[22:00:00] <tjc> Jarrett: the easy fix is to write: let temp = bar(); foo(temp)

[23:58:54] <Tari> (page doesn't have a ref to decoder)
[23:59:03] <jmgrosen> is compiling for arm-linux (normal linux, i.e. not android) working yet?
[23:59:17] <Tari> so that sounds like a bug?
