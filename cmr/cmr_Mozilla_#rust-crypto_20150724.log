[05:48:06] <eternaleye> If they were supported, arbitrary atomic changes could be done with hardlink-dirs and RENAME_EXCHANGE

[05:55:17] <bascule> it seems that Rust just kind of made up names for all the filesystem operations

[05:57:05] <eternaleye> We should all just go back to 9p

[05:58:06] <bascule> a lot of the stuff was in std and got split out
[05:58:39] <eternaleye> My honest opinion is that I want a 9p-like FS interface for "common use", with IntoOsSpecific for when you need complex stuff

[05:59:50] <bascule> haha
[06:00:17] <eternaleye> Also, 9p's semantics are so much fucking better for isolation
[06:00:22] <eternaleye> It's actually capability-clean
[06:00:35] <bascule> I like the idea of mapping facilities into robot-like agents in a messaging system
[06:00:35] <eternaleye> If you treat FIDs as opaque capabilities, it's completely sound
[06:00:41] <bascule> which is a very objcap way of looking at things
[06:00:52] <bascule> robots talking to robots
[06:00:53] <eternaleye> You can only walk downwards in the FS, etc

[13:46:00] <Tiffany> wow what the hell
[13:46:12] <Tiffany> you have to validate NIST public keys to prevent key extraction?
[13:48:14] <Ilari> Tiffany: Well, that's general property of all non-laddered systems.
[13:48:26] <Tiffany> laddered?
[13:48:58] <Ilari> Tiffany: Well, if you have two coordinates for curve and can feed arbitrary public keys, you can extract the scalars.
[13:51:33] <Ilari> Even point compression won't save you (if you don't check for existence of square root in decompression, which is equivalent to point check).
[13:52:27] <Tiffany> the RFC for curve25519 in TLS says you don't need to validate curve keys though
[13:52:32] <Tiffany> does that mean curve is laddered?
[13:52:50] <Ilari> The reason why Curve25519 is safe without checks is that all the points are on two curves, both of which have small cofactor.
[13:55:35] <Ilari> Specifically, if one specifies x coordinate where y^2 = x^3 + 486662x^2 + x (mod 2^255-19) has no solution, then it acts like the point is on curve 2y^2 = x^3 + 486662x^2 + x (mod 2^255-19)  (which has solutions for all such x). Both curves have cofactor of at most 8.
[14:03:20] <Ilari> But if you allow specifying arbitrary coordinates for say -x^2+y^2=1-121665/121666*x^2*y^2 (mod 2^255-19) (the Ed25519 curve), you could extract the private key. And even if one uses point compression (and doesn't check if square root in decompression exists).
[14:13:58] <Ilari> Tiffany: At least with Weierstrass curves, because the constant parameter appears in neither addition formula nor doubling formula, every point (x,y) is a valid point on some curve. And some of those are very weak (due to PH attack). So one may pick very weak curve.
[14:18:11] <Ilari> Tiffany: Singatures aren't very vulernable because: 1) When signing, one uses fixed point. 2) Changing the point makes the key not match (but some applications may still get vulernabilities if one isn't careful).
[14:21:05] <Ilari> With DH one can use 1-coordinate forms. Then there are various other ECC protocols that might be vulernable to chosen points because those need a group structure and take points as input.
[14:22:59] <Ilari> Also, there are some protocols that assume h=1 and are insecure if h>1 (like Curve25519 has). And for some, even h=1 isn't enough.
[14:28:56] <Elaine> https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-byrne-opsec-udp-advisory-00 whyyyyy
[14:29:00] <Elaine> RIP games
[14:29:35] <Ilari> Elaine: UDP is a shitpool.
[14:29:50] <Elaine> well I know the motivation
[14:30:16] <Elaine> and I imagine certain deployments could just nuke UDP almost entirely, at least on the border.
[14:30:24] <Elaine> but hopefully not on most of the public internet.
[14:30:39] <Elaine> it's bad enough that it's deprioritized over tcp
[14:32:08] <Ilari> And new port number for QUIC? Doesn't it use 443/udp, or am I totally off-base?
[14:33:36] <Elaine> I thought it was 443
[14:34:56] <Tiffany> I use UDP...
[14:35:51] <Ilari> Well, point is, 443/udp probably isn't big source of reflection DOS attacks.
[14:36:34] <Ilari> Ah, protocol number, not port number. Also, good luck getting new protocol number to work (and good luck getting SCTP to work).
[14:36:55] <Elaine> yeah, that recommendation about SCTP is completely ignorable.
[14:37:02] <Tiffany> these protocols which allow amplification attacks should be fixed, not punishing legitimate users
[14:37:03] <Elaine> It makes me wonder if this draft is serious
[14:37:11] <Tiffany> yeah, there's no way
[14:37:24] <Tiffany> this is pie in the sky
[14:37:30] <Ilari> Tiffany: Unfortunately, one of those is DNS...
[14:37:36] <Tiffany> yeah
[14:38:08] <Ilari> None of those recommendations is even remotely reasonable. Especially if dealing with IPv4.
[14:38:33] <Elaine> Is DNS amplification still an issue? I was under the impression those had been tamed the past few years
[14:38:45] <Tiffany> how could you tame them?
[14:39:02] <Tiffany> there's a fundamental asymmetry in the request/response sizes in DNS, and there's no handshake to prevent spoofing
[14:39:03] <Ilari> Elaine: Oh, it still is. Along with NTP amplification and SNMP amplification.
[14:39:27] <Ilari> Well, DNS can run over TCP, but it rarely is done.
[14:40:05] <Elaine> Tiffany: egress filtering, to at least prevent spoofed packets.
[14:40:22] <Ilari> Also, 53/udp is one of the dirtiest ports out there. 53/tcp (which is DNS too) is in contrast very clean (one IETF WG did some testing on it, they expected it to be much dirtier than it was).
[14:40:40] <Tiffany> dirtiest?
[14:42:06] <Tiffany> here's an idea
[14:42:27] <Tiffany> have a DNS extension where you poke the server and it returns a macaroon, and then you have to use that macaroon in the headers in order to make record requests
[14:42:27] <Ilari> "dirty" port means port where one has all sorts of middleboxes that interfere with protocol in all sorts of odd ways, including for packets not destined to them.
[14:42:42] <Tiffany> not that it would ever get implemented..
[14:43:05] <Ilari> Tiffany: Well, you could return a very short truncated response. That triggers TCP fallback.
[14:43:20] <Tiffany> ooh, really?
[14:44:02] <Tiffany> " The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is used when the response data size exceeds 512 bytes, or for tasks such as zone transfers. Some resolver implementations use TCP for all queries."
[14:44:37] <Ilari> Tiffany: Well, it is 4kB now (but that would cause fragmentation).
[14:46:40] <Ilari> Tiffany: One example of bad middlebox behaviour is assuming that responses can be at most 512 bytes. Along with things like chocking on unknown record types that don't even try to do anything special.
[14:47:02] <Tiffany> nice
[14:47:10] <Tiffany> I imagine SMTP is pretty dirty as well, then?
[14:47:27] <Tiffany> seeing how we're still using these screwy formats to avoid setting high bits
[14:48:55] <Ilari> Well, STMP is not that dirty, just widely blocked. AFAIK, the dirtiest TCP ports are 80 and 465.
[14:50:07] <eternaleye> Ilari: Well, 465 is SMTP...
[14:50:58] <Ilari> 80 has all sorts of "transparent" proxies. 465 is actually some kind of multicast(?) control protocol (it was STMPS, but got reassigned), and some routers interpret packets to that port, even if not addressed to them.
[14:52:25] <Ilari> TURN... Reminds me of what HTTP tunnel-protocol authors said in their presentation in one IETF (before it was adopted)...
[14:53:24] <Ilari> Basically, the problem with using TURN for WebRTC is that it quickly eats enormous amount of resources.
[14:54:33] <Elaine> TURN destroys a lot of the benefits of WebRTC.
[14:56:21] <Ilari> IIRC, the comment from authors said that it takes about 2.5 streams until the proxy is in serious trouble or something like that.

[14:59:18] <Ilari> Why the recommednations are not reasonable: 1) Sometimes you need unreliable unordered protocol. 2) OSes don't let one setup IPSec tunnels. 3) TURN is slow, SCTP/IPv4 is unusable due to NAT. 4) OSes don't let you use protocols except very few.

[15:14:22] <Tiffany> it's almost as large as the number of protocols over TCP as a whole
[15:14:41] <Ilari> IIRC, SCTP does unordered unreliable, but the problem is to get SCTP connection up... Also, there was some surprising nasty limitation with using reliable channels over SCTP.
[15:15:12] <Ilari> BTW: Internally WebRTC uses SCTP for data channel (implementing the SCTP decoding in userspace!).
[15:15:25] <Tiffany> not supported by NATs, complex specification, no good implementations

[17:09:37] <bascule> RSA-PSSR specifically
[17:09:52] <Tiffany> why?
[17:09:57] <bascule> why indeed
[17:10:01] <bascule> going to go with "bad reasons"
[17:10:17] <Tiffany> I was going to guess it's because someone isn't familiar with existing bearer token schemes
[17:14:33] <bascule> yeah, more or less that, plus some made up business requirements
[17:25:39] <bascule> lol @ Mike Hamburg's reaction to Dan Brown
[17:25:41] <bascule> "Why would we use this instead of Schnorr?  It’s ultimately equivalent to Schnorr (with h(m,R) = h(m||R)/f(R)), but with an extra f(R) thrown in for no reason."
[17:32:51] <Ilari> IIRC, f is function that maps point into string (and does not need to be inverable).
[17:53:02] <Ilari> Seems like COSE WG is going towards designing a framework that is intended to be profiled down (but can still be implemented in full in high-power devices).

[18:26:07] <Ilari> Oh fun, a while back I was wondering if anyone was assuming certain properties (secrecy) out of tls-unique. Seemingly I got answer today: tokbind/unbearable. :-)

[18:29:23] <bascule> haha
[18:33:23] <Ilari> (Stuff using TLS in weird ways is always fun).
[18:35:30] <Ilari> Hmm... Would one expect for hash deletions for SHA-512 to exist?
[18:36:09] <Ilari> (However, if hash deletion for one output exists, I would expect deletions for almost all outputs to exist.)
[18:39:25] <Ilari> And if deletions for SHA-512 exist, would one expect those to have huge lengths?
[18:40:15] <Tiffany> what is hash deletion?
[18:40:48] <Ilari> Postfix that causes collisions with non-neglibiable amount of prefixes.
[18:47:14] <bascule> lol wtf
[18:47:17] <bascule> "I would point to the fact that we (now) have libraries that have been vetted as a reason to use JWS, not the other way around."
[18:47:40] <bascule> horrible design with sharp edges that lead to vulns in practice, but since the vulns were found and fixed, the libraries must now be secure o_O
[18:54:45] *** Quits: brson (brson@moz-l8ebtf.sfo1.mozilla.com) (Connection closed)
[19:05:01] <Ilari> bascule: Also, can you come up with usecases (that I don't think are worse than useless :-) ) for extensions (essentially signed attributes for key) in tokbind?
[19:05:23] *** Quits: erickt (erickt@moz-4hh.6p3.217.74.IP) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[19:07:53] <Ilari> Those signed attributes can not be allowed to link keys (because linking capability would create completely unacceptable privacy and security issues).

[19:23:17] <Ilari> Also, it seems tokbind would interact in unpleasant way with origin cookies (cookies that follow the same-origin policy).
[19:23:54] <Ilari> And also in unpleasant way with PSL changes.
[19:35:45] <Tiffany> why does JWS exist?
[19:43:33] <Ilari> "unifying" MACs and signatures is not a good idea.
[19:47:14] <Tiffany> that does sound like a bad idea

[20:04:23] <bascule> so bad
[20:04:24] <bascule> makes me sad
[20:04:49] <bascule> Tiffany: I think because JWT is something of a kitchen sink of a standard, and they figured some people want HMAC and other people want pubkey signatures
[20:05:13] <bascule> and so we wind up making everyone sad, woohoo
[20:06:22] <Tiffany> I didn't know about JWT either
[20:06:26] <Tiffany> are there more JW*s?
[20:06:54] <Tiffany> I like how they try to sidestep the fact json has the overhead of being schemaless by using 3-letter keys
[20:07:00] <Tiffany> it's terrible
[20:14:01] <Ilari> Tiffany: There's at least JWA (which is algorithms document), JWE (Encryption), JWS (Mess of signatures and MACs) and JWT (OAUTH shit).
[20:14:15] <Ilari> Tiffany: Oh and JWK (Key format)
[20:25:36] <eternaleye> You know, I'm honestly not seeing why JWS needs much of anything near the complexity it has.
[20:25:55] <eternaleye> I mean, define a canonicalization and sign the damn bytestring.'
[20:26:38] <eternaleye> OH HEY LIKE THIS ONE: https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-staykov-hu-json-canonical-form-00

[21:56:11] <Ilari> The thing that makes me wonder about hash deletion: The postfix must "herd" the hash chaning values. But the fewer chaining values there are, the more difficult herding becomes, and the block limit might come up fairly soon.
[21:58:50] <Ilari> (In traditional herding attack, there are at least two message fragments at each point, which makes block limits not to come up as number of chaining values goes down.
[21:58:54] <Ilari> )

[22:13:12] <Ilari> Okay, some statistical analysis suggests that as number of chaining values go down, the maximum likely delta goes down, which would suggest erasers to have enormous lengths.
[22:18:03] <Ilari> Which could do well with the fact that the longer the input is, the relatively easier preimage attacks become.
