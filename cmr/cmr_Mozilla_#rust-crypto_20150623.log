[00:14:35] <Tiffany> no
[00:17:55] <Tiffany> what makes a cryptosystem breakable by quantum computers or not?
[00:18:33] <cmr> the existence of a quantum algorithm that solves the computationally hard problem with decent time complexity?
[00:19:06] <Tiffany> so there's nothing fundamental like "NP-hard problems cannot be magicked away by quantum computers"
[00:19:10] <cmr> there are complexity classes for quantum algorithms the same as classical algorithms
[00:19:27] <cmr> not the same complexity classes, but in the same manner as there are for classical algorithms
[00:19:30] <Tiffany> I don't really understand complexity classes
[00:20:15] *** Quits: dpc (dpc@moz-52v2l7.nvidia.com) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[00:20:53] <mcpherrin> Tiffany: There are a ton of open questions w.r.t complexity classes and where quantum fits
[00:21:02] <cmr> it's unknown what the relationship between quantum complexity theory and classical complexity theory is.
[00:21:13] <cmr> so, there's no answer to your question yet
[00:21:46] <mcpherrin> not to mention there's lots of open questions in classical complexity theory too (famously, P ?= NP, but there's a bunch of related thins too)
[00:22:10] <cmr> I think Shor's algorithm is pretty bogus. It works but the circuit complexity of actually constructing a quantum computer to do it is immense.
[00:22:30] <Tiffany> bascule's blog post mentioned a million qubits
[00:22:34] * cmr 's crypto course last year was 33% quantum crypto
[00:23:02] <Tiffany> what is limiting the number of qubits in quantum computers?
[00:23:09] <mcpherrin> Tiffany: engineering
[00:23:13] <bascule> Tiffany: today, if it's based on either factoring or the discrete logarithm problem
[00:23:16] <mcpherrin> we can't build 'em big yet
[00:23:19] <bascule> a.k.a. the hidden subgroup problem
[00:23:30] <bascule> the hidden subgroup problem is generally solvable by quantum computers
[00:23:49] <mcpherrin> Unlike transistors that we can slam a trillion onto a silicon wafer, we don't have mass production of qubits
[00:24:14] <bascule> via e.g. shor's algorithm or grover's algorithm
[00:24:46] <bascule> today the best algorithm is pollard's rho (for both problems)
[00:26:13] <Tiffany> isn't NTRU based on the shortest vector problem?
[00:28:14] <eternaleye> Tiffany: It's *similar*, but no reduction has been found
[00:28:23] <Tiffany> oh
[00:29:18] *** Joins: dpc (dpc@moz-7gui97.nvidia.com)
[00:29:19] <cmr> Tiffany: that's generally true. eg it's unknown if RSA is equiv. to factoring
[00:29:32] <eternaleye> cmr: No, not quite
[00:29:50] <eternaleye> cmr: NTRU is *very* similar to SVP (Or was it Nearest, not Shortest?)
[00:30:08] <eternaleye> cmr: One of the two * Vector Problem
[00:30:24] <eternaleye> cmr: In a "This started out as the problem, but they made tweaks we can't prove still reduce" way
[00:30:52] <cmr> eternaleye: I know nothing about NTRU, I'm merely elaborating on cryptosystems "based on" some problem often not known to be equivalent to that problem.
[00:31:19] <eternaleye> Sure, I was more saying it's a poor comparison to the relationship between DLP and factoring
[00:31:47] <eternaleye> Oh, wait
[00:31:49] <eternaleye> NVM
[00:31:50] <eternaleye> misread
[00:31:57] * eternaleye is having a Monday at work
[00:33:23] <Tiffany> so what makes mceliece hard is that nobody's come up with a way to either reuse shor's algorithm for breaking it, or come up with a new quantum algorithm?
[00:33:42] <Ilari> Also, I suppose that engineering challenges increase rapidly as number of coupling qubits increases...
[00:34:35] <mcpherrin> Also, real quantum computers run much slower than simulations of quantum computers on classical ones
[00:34:55] <Tiffany> huh
[00:34:57] <cmr> "real"
[00:35:07] <mcpherrin> I heard we've run shors algorithms on real quantum computers on numbers as big as 15
[00:35:23] <mcpherrin> that was a few years ago though, maybe we've factored 21 now :)
[00:35:26] <Tiffany> it's a pretty big number
[00:35:30] <Tiffany> much bigger than 4
[00:36:11] <mcpherrin> "We" being the institute for quantum computing @ uwaterloo -- I had some quantum roommate types when I was there, so I'm a little out of the loop for a few years now
[00:36:38] <Tiffany> can D-wave two run shor's algorithm?
[00:36:48] <Tiffany> apparently each qubit can only interact with at most 6 other qubits
[00:39:04] <mcpherrin> My understanding is that the Dwave is a dedicated quantum annealing machine
[00:39:11] <mcpherrin> and so can't do other things, like shors algorithm
[00:39:14] <Tiffany> oh
[00:40:09] <Tiffany> is the hidden subgroup problem connected to a lot of things?
[00:40:18] <eternaleye> Yup
[00:40:22] <Tiffany> oh
[00:40:34] *** Quits: dpc (dpc@moz-7gui97.nvidia.com) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[00:40:34] <Tiffany> so that's why there isn't much in the way of workable post-quantum crypto?
[00:41:19] <eternaleye> Well, not quite
[00:41:33] <eternaleye> For one, Shor's solves HSP for finite Abelian groups
[00:41:42] <eternaleye> Full-on HSP is still an open question for QC
[00:41:48] <Tiffany> oh
[00:42:10] <Tiffany> "Supersingular Elliptic Curve Isogeny Cryptography" is a mouth full
[00:42:51] <eternaleye> If someone solves HSP for non-Abelian groups on QC, then it'd be able to efficiently solve graph isomorphism, some shortest-vector problems, etc.
[00:43:56] <eternaleye> Tiffany: Lengthy overview of HSP: http://arxiv.org/pdf/1008.0010.pdf
[00:45:26] <eternaleye> Tiffany: Appendix A, on p. 60 of the PDF (54 of the _paper_) is likely of interest
[00:46:16] <eternaleye> Tiffany: Cyclic HSP covers factoring, and is a special case of Abelian HSP, which covers discrete logarithm
[00:47:47] <eternaleye> Tiffany: Fully general HSP includes such ridiculousness as "generating quantum algorithms that are exponentially faster than their classical counterparts"
[00:48:41] <eternaleye> Tiffany: Personally, I consider that juuuuust short of P=NP in terms of "Oh what the fuck"
[00:48:48] <Tiffany> wait, superoptimization to a quantum computer is an HSP problem?
[00:49:16] <eternaleye> Tiffany: *exponentially* faster
[00:49:29] <eternaleye> Tiffany: As in, "You will beat the big O by this much"
[00:49:57] <eternaleye> Tiffany: That comes in somewhere just below automated theorem creation, IMO
[00:50:05] <eternaleye> Tiffany: (Which is what P=NP would give)
[00:50:12] <Tiffany> oh wow
[00:50:33] <cmr> if P=NP lots of things that should be really hard become ridiculously easy.
[00:50:36] <cmr> it'd be pretty neat.
[00:50:51] <eternaleye> cmr: Sure, if you like being obsolete :P
[00:50:57] <Tiffany> wouldn't it bork all public key crypto
[00:50:59] <cmr> but like, P!=NP, almost certainly.
[00:51:02] <Tiffany> would it bork symmetric crypto too?
[00:51:30] <eternaleye> cmr: Consider that the theorems it can generate would include things like "optimal data structure for a purpose" and "code that fulfils constraints"
[00:51:35] <cmr> eternaleye: yes, I know.
[00:51:38] <eternaleye> cmr: Prolog would be the only language!
[00:51:45] <eternaleye> cmr: WHAT HAS SCIENCE WROUGHT?
[00:51:51] <eternaleye> cmr: :P
[00:52:22] <Tiffany> being able to write prolog without having to worry about O(N^12) would be nice
[00:52:37] <eternaleye> Tiffany: The only downside would be writing prolog :P
[00:53:14] <eternaleye> However, it could still be applied as an optimizer pass in LLVM, which would be nice.
[00:53:22] <eternaleye> "Rust 2.0! Now with P=NP!"
[00:53:35] <Tiffany> it doesn't make very much sense to me that P could equal NP
[00:53:49] <eternaleye> Tiffany: It's more that nobody has proven it *couldn't*
[00:53:54] <Tiffany> yeah
[00:54:10] <eternaleye> But the heuristics are very much not in favor of it being equal.
[00:54:20] <Ilari> It could be that P=?NP is independnet of commonly used assumptions.
[00:56:14] <Tiffany> wait
[00:56:23] <Tiffany> oh
[00:56:31] <Tiffany> albenian HSP is equivalent to cyclic HSP?
[00:56:50] <Tiffany> abelian
[01:02:57] <Tiffany> I probably shouldn't be reading about this stuff when I'm about to go to bed

[12:41:45] <Tiffany> wikipedia suggests kerberos as a possibility for post-quantum crypto
[12:41:56] <Tiffany> but its security appears to be dependent on how good your password is
[12:42:49] <Tiffany> it doesn't even mention any PBKDF, just "hash" the password, and implies that the server stores your password in the clear
[12:45:20] <Tiffany> oh, it looks like it doesn't have to be derived from a password
[12:45:25] <Tiffany> but I'm guessing that's how everyone uses it
[12:45:42] <Tiffany> any kind of secret key that can be stored on the server and client will work

[17:08:59] <Tiffany> bascule: it's not based on public-key crypto

[17:10:24] *** Quits: brson (brson@moz-omn.omd.251.216.IP) (Quit: leaving)
[17:11:23] <bascule> not really?
[17:11:36] <bascule> it relies on preshared keys between the KDC and the other principals
[17:12:02] <bascule> same with Macaroons, although I'd like to use them with pubkey
[17:12:24] <Tiffany> I've read about kerberos, and it requires everyone's keys to be stored in reach of the authentication server, yeah
[17:13:17] <bascule> you make keytabs on the KDC (with kadmin) then have to have some way of giving them to the principals
[17:13:44] <bascule> at Square we use TLS for that (Keywhiz)
[17:13:54] <bascule> but otherwise you'd use something like SSH
[17:29:14] <Ilari> SSH2 seems much more solid than TLS 1.2. Probably from SSH1 being total crap and then getting rewritten. SSLv3 hasn't gotten rewritten yet.
[17:33:41] <Ilari> Also, wonder why Dan Brown proposed something close to ECDSA, given all the improvments to ECC signatures that ECDSA ignored.
[17:39:48] <kmc> I don't know much about SSH2, but I agree 
[17:51:10] <Ilari> SSH2 as protocol seemingly has held quite well. Sure, the CBC ciphers have failed, but CTR ciphers seem to still hold (and then there are some AEAD ones).
[17:51:43] <cmr> I only use curve25519-sha256@libssh.org for kex, chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com for the cipher, and hmac-sha2-512-etm@openssh.com for the mac.
[17:54:14] <Ilari> The SSH2 normal E&M construct has gotten critisism, but doen't look like it is bad as long as encryption is tidy (like CTR is).
[17:55:31] <cmr> yeah. and there are alternatives (like hmac-sha2-512-etm)
