[10:02:31] <Lilly> Very offtopic, I know
[10:03:18] * WindowsBunny nibbles on Lilly
[10:03:25] <Lilly> If I have a class Base with a method GetFoo, that itself calls another method GetBar
[10:03:43] <Lilly> And then I have a class Derived that derives from Base, and overrides GetBar
[10:04:02] <Lilly> Will Derived.GetFoo call the overrided GetBar or the base GetBar?
[10:04:44] <Lilly> WindowsBunny: pls no nibbles
[10:05:10] <niconii> Lilly: i'd say most likely the base GetBar
[10:05:16] <Lilly> Well that sucks
[10:06:03] <Lilly> I'm making an RPG and I'm kinda copying the way RPG Maker VX ace handles parameters and modifiers
[10:06:39] <Lilly> Every character, class, equipment, and state can have "features" tied to them, which modify parameters and stuff
[10:06:54] <niconii> oh, heh, interesting coincidence, i'm messing around with vx ace right now
[10:07:27] <Lilly> And then there's a BattlerBase class which defines methods for getting parameters, by using a "get all features of this object" method
[10:08:11] <Lilly> And then when an Actor or Enemy derives from BattlerBase they just override the get all features method, to include equipment, actor properties, and class properties for actors, and enemy properties for enemies
[10:09:04] <Lilly> that way the get_parameter method just works for an actor after just overriding the method to get all features

[10:30:48] <XMPPwocky> https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-thomson-postel-was-wrong-00

[13:40:35] <eddyb> today on HN
[13:40:43] <eddyb> > d'oh, of course you should byte-align memory access
[13:41:10] <eddyb> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9829765 as in, Haskell accesses non-byte-aligned bits of memory?!
[13:41:56] <XMPPwocky> ... how
[13:42:06] <eddyb> oh, the code is using a bitstream abstraction
[13:42:43] <eddyb> the kind where you can read n bits at a time into an integer (where n is smaller than the number of bits your integer type has)
[13:48:12] <Quxxy> Playing around with a new binary file format, and I'm rather pleased with the magic canary I managed to come up with: b"FLF\x0a\xde\x0d\x0a\x1a"
[13:48:44] <Quxxy> It manages to be invalid UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32, as well as having both a UNIX and Windows newline
[13:49:20] <eddyb> hahahaha
[13:49:22] <eddyb> genius
[13:49:35] <eddyb> I know PNG does something pretty bad
[13:49:51] <eddyb> not sure if it's less effective
[13:49:53] <Tiffany> does it have anything with the high bit set though?
[13:49:54] <eddyb> (bad as in "good")
[13:49:55] <Quxxy> Oh!  And the last byte is ^Z to stop output on Windows if someone tries to display the file
[13:49:59] <Quxxy> Tiffany: Yes
[13:50:03] <eddyb> Quxxy: oh dear
[13:50:04] <Tiffany> oh
[13:50:06] <Quxxy> eddyb: I started from PNG's
[13:50:18] <eddyb> my new favorite word: "antipathetic"
[13:50:29] <eddyb> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9830035
[13:50:51] <Quxxy> I basically added the UTF-8 and UTF-16 invalidity by changing and moving the initial byte in their magic canary
[13:51:25] <Quxxy> It was already invalid UTF-32
[13:59:35] <Quxxy> One last change: exchanged one of the ASCII characters for a NUL, to break anything trying to use NUL-terminated strings for some insane reason
[13:59:58] <eddyb> >_>
[14:03:01] <bluss> Quxxy: what did `file` say about it befor the zero byte?
[14:03:14] <Quxxy> I... didn't think to try that
[14:03:26] <Quxxy> I suppose it should be in MinGW...
[14:03:35] <Quxxy> Actually, I've realised that it's only invalid UTF-16-BE
[14:03:43] <Quxxy> So I'm futzing again to make it invalid in both byte orders
[14:03:48] <eddyb> lol
[14:04:09] <eddyb> will it still be 8 bytes?

[14:45:09] <bombless> Now I begin to wonder why is it `make check`, not `make test`?
[14:45:31] <Quxxy> 'Windows 10 Edition will not replace the existing PC version. Instead, it will be treated as an entirely separate platform to “take advantage of the advanced technology and gaming platform provided by Windows 10.”'
[14:45:34] <Quxxy> HAHAHAHAHAHA
[14:45:41] <Quxxy> ... oh, they're serious.
[14:45:55] <Dr-Emann> Minecraft?
[14:46:06] <delma> xD
[14:46:21] <bombless> hmm advanced gaming platform? so what is xbox
[14:46:23] <Quxxy> It's not even the full game
[14:46:36] <Tiffany> quxxy: it's the console edition codebase, I think
[14:46:36] <Quxxy> "Microsoft says players can expect regular updates to bring all the features from the current PC version to Windows 10 Edition, as well as new features."
[14:46:45] <Tiffany> both the console and pocket editions are written in C++
[14:46:53] <Tiffany> and the two currently carry the majority of minecraft's players
[14:47:16] <Quxxy> I'm sorry, they don't have mods
[14:47:20] <Quxxy> They don't count
[14:47:29] <bombless> Hmm console and pocket editions already shipped?
[14:47:33] <fkaa> they rake in the most money
[14:47:43] <Tiffany> I don't think they will be able to replace the PC edition with this new edition, no
[14:47:52] <Tiffany> at least not for a long time
[14:48:01] <Quxxy> No Agrarian Skies, no Magic Farm, no custom servers, no Crash Landing, no Terrafirmacraft!
[14:48:24] <Tiffany> also, no servers with more than 8 players
[14:48:31] <Quxxy> That "advanced technology" but just shits me
[14:48:36] <Quxxy> *What* advanced technology?
[14:48:48] <delma> directX?
[14:48:56] <Tiffany> oh
[14:49:04] <Tiffany> the windows 10 edition is probably going to be the one supported by holo lens
[14:49:18] <Tiffany> that's sad
[14:49:31] <Quxxy> ...which is a stupid application because it misses a huge part of why Minecraft is fun
[14:51:24] <Quxxy> " Craft, create, and explore online with up to seven friends playing Windows 10 Edition Beta, through local multiplayer or with your Xbox Live friends online."
[14:51:33] <Quxxy> Wow, yeah, 8 players
[14:52:01] <Quxxy> What was the player cap on Quake in '96, again?  32?
[14:52:21] <Quxxy> "Record and share gameplay highlights with built-in GameDVR."
[14:52:33] <delma> Funniest thing is that I learned to program because of Minecraft...
[14:52:42] <delma> Well I did some before...
[14:52:42] <Quxxy> Yes, because it's not like there isn't ShadowPlay, or a half dozen free programs that'll do the exact same thing
[14:53:17] <delma> But mostly from reading deobffusicated Minecraft source
[14:53:21] <Tiffany> quxxy: the 8 player limit is the same as the xbox edition
[14:53:37] <Quxxy> Tiffany: I don't care *where* it comes from; it's console peasantry on my lovely PC game
[14:53:43] <Quxxy> Kill it with fire
[14:53:46] <Quxxy> :P
[14:53:47] <Tiffany> I think they have such a low, hard cap because they want to have strict performance windows for the consoles
[14:54:02] <Tiffany> xbox worlds are limited in size and not generated, they're pre-made maps
[14:54:19] <delma> Yeah consoles are really limited to memory usage
[14:54:21] <Quxxy> Nothing but a pale shadow of the One True Minecraft
[14:54:31] <Tiffany> I suppose it's because it has to run on the xbox 360 and PS3
[14:54:35] <Tiffany> both of which have paltry amounts of memory
[14:54:52] <Tiffany> it's not a pale shadow for the millions of people who play it, quxxy
[14:55:00] <Dr-Emann> And tribes, from 98 had up to 256 users per map..
[14:55:21] <Quxxy> Tiffany: This isn't a subjective thing; I'm not saying they don't have fun or don't enjoy playing it
[14:55:39] <Tiffany> I think the main thing is that minecraft is, without mods or server modifications, a game you play with a small group of friends
[14:55:48] <Tiffany> that and afaik the xbox multiplayer is peer to peer
[14:55:52] <Quxxy> But the console and mobile versions are quantifiably worse
[14:56:22] <delma> well boths hardware is worse too...
[14:56:33] <Quxxy> Which is fine, so long as they *stay* over there where I don't have to deal with the limitations
[14:56:39] <Tiffany> it looks like the world is 864x864 blocks
[14:56:54] <Tiffany> which is reasonably sized
[14:56:54] <Quxxy> But if this is the "Windows 10" version, I'd put better than even odds on the original version getting the axe in the near future
[14:57:04] <Tiffany> ah
[14:57:11] <Tiffany> but the PS4 and xbox one editions are much larger
[14:58:03] <Tiffany> apparently you can only have up to 16 wolves, snow golems, etc
[14:58:21] <Tiffany> the 17th wolf will get killed by other wolves, the 17th snow golem will fail to spawn
[14:59:52] <Tiffany> if the original version gets dropped before they've built a suitable replacement there will be a lot of unhappiness
[15:00:18] <Tiffany> I don't think it will happen
[15:00:50] <delma> wow
[15:00:55] <Quxxy> ... really?  Killing the original would take away a big-name game from Linux and OS X, *and* give a reason to use Windows 10
[15:00:59] <delma> It was worse than I knew
[15:01:06] <Quxxy> I mean, have you *seen* how much money they throw at platform exclusives?
[15:01:23] <Tiffany> that's not microsoft's mode of operation anymore
[15:01:26] <Quxxy> If they reason it'll make them more money, why would they care?
[15:01:29] <Tiffany> they didn't drop the linux version of skype when they bought it
[15:01:32] <Tiffany> they just stopped maintaining it
[15:01:43] <Quxxy> I mean, they released Halo: MCC and that was *completely broken*
[15:02:03] <Quxxy> Because Skype is a platform
[15:02:06] <Quxxy> Minecraft is a product
[15:02:17] <delma> Realms?
[15:02:25] <Tiffany> yeah, realms is a thing too
[15:02:36] <Tiffany> there's no need for realms in the other editions of the game
[15:03:02] <Quxxy> Depends on how much money it's making them, and what proportion of players are on Windows
[15:03:21] <Tiffany> I really think you're attributing too much evil to microsoft
[15:03:27] <Tiffany> they're actually going to port .NET to linux
[15:03:30] <Quxxy> What if they started offering Realms free with an XBox Live Gold sub?
[15:03:35] <Tiffany> ballmer isn't CEO anymore, quxxy
[15:03:50] <Quxxy> Tiffany: Again, you're talking platforms, I'm talking products
[15:04:05] <Quxxy> They don't even port their big-ticket games to Windows, for crying out loud
[15:04:08] <Tiffany> I don't know of any examples for products
[15:04:20] <Tiffany> microsoft doesn't generally buy multi-billion-dollar indie games with linux versions
[15:04:36] <Quxxy> Well, Halo never came out on Mac
[15:04:44] <Quxxy> Halo 2 required Vista for no reason
[15:04:46] <Tiffany> halo was never on mac to begin with
[15:04:51] <Tiffany> minecraft is on linux already
[15:04:52] <Quxxy> Yes it was
[15:04:57] <Quxxy> Halo was developed *for* Mac
[15:05:07] <Tiffany> the original game?
[15:05:07] <Quxxy> It was bought out right after it was shown off at WWDC
[15:05:22] <Quxxy> 3, 4, ODST, MCC, never came to Windows
[15:05:32] <Quxxy> Gears 2 and 3, never came to Windows
[15:05:41] <Quxxy> Though we're going to get a port of the original... which *already* came out for Vista
[15:05:54] <Quxxy> They killed Age of Empires and turned it into F2P microtransaction garbage
[15:06:51] <Quxxy> Microsoft have demonstrated *with perfect clarity* that they will gladly shaft PC gamers if they'll make a buck from it
[15:07:02] <Quxxy> No amount of *repeated* empty promises will change that
[15:07:10] <eddyb> and now they own Minecraft
[15:07:13] <Tiffany> why are they making a windows 10 edition if that's the case?
[15:07:14] <Quxxy> Yay!
[15:07:25] <Tiffany> you keep talking about console exclusives, but this new edition is literally a port of the console edition to windows
[15:07:58] <Quxxy> I'm trying to demonstrate that MS acts to secure its platform
[15:08:07] <Tiffany> even if they do drop the PC edition, I expect people will keep maintaining it
[15:08:09] <Quxxy> Killing off PC Minecraft with no other action would just be silly
[15:08:22] <Quxxy> *Replacing it* with a Windows 10-specific version makes total sense
[15:08:25] <Tiffany> a lot of people would rather stop playing than buy a windows 10 computer or an xbox
[15:08:47] <Quxxy> And lots of people failed to get Vista because MS waved Halo and GoW under their noses
[15:08:49] <Tiffany> there's also the other stuff, like the console edition runs on the PS3/PS4 too
[15:08:53] <Quxxy> Doesn't mean it didn't happen
[15:09:03] <Tiffany> and the pocket edition runs on android and ios as well as windows phone
[15:09:19] <Quxxy> I assume they have and continue to make loads of cash
[15:09:26] <Quxxy> How much do you reckon they're making off Linux and Mac gamers?
[15:09:39] <Tiffany> I don't know, I'll look for stats
[15:11:04] <Quxxy> Tiffany: http://media.dinnerbone.com/uploads/2015-03/screenshots/09_11-06-09_QLAhnzHO25.png
[15:11:06] <Tiffany> there aren't very good numbers out there
[15:11:26] <Tiffany> 1% is pretty significant for something which mojang currently spends almost  zero effort maintaining
[15:11:31] <Quxxy> !Windows is ~6%
[15:11:57] <Tiffany> they have to keep the native libraries like jwjgl up to date, and make sure there's no platform specific bugs
[15:12:10] <Quxxy> It makes no financial sense for Microsoft to maintain the classic version
[15:12:23] <Tiffany> they don't maintain the classic version
[15:12:38] <Quxxy> *Currently* they do
[15:12:39] <fkaa> classic being java?
[15:12:44] <eddyb> oh where's niconii
[15:12:49] <Tiffany> classic is the old version of minecraft
[15:12:56] <Tiffany> the current version is the PC edition
[15:12:59] * eddyb is overhearing his dad talking to someone on the phone about US' moral decadence
[15:13:05] <Quxxy> Fine; the PC edition :)
[15:13:24] <Tiffany> I don't expect that microsoft pays a lot of money maintaining the PC version
[15:13:35] <Tiffany> there's a single digit number of developers
[15:13:41] <eddyb> he apparently found some prophecy-ish stuff online that would suggest something bad will happen this year
[15:14:29] <Quxxy> Tiffany: And?  The better question is: do they have more to gain by using Minecraft as a wedge to drive people to Windows 10?
[15:15:05] <Tiffany> Jens, Aron, Jon, Johan, Måns, Nathan, Erik, Tommaso, Michael
[15:15:15] <Tiffany> I don't think so
[15:15:19] <Quxxy> The existence of a Win10-specific version suggests to me that they believe so
[15:15:25] <eddyb> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncNTKr_4J3c this thing
[15:16:54] <Tiffany> the existence of a windows 10 specific version suggests to me that they're trying to draw in a larger demographic
[15:17:12] <Quxxy> But the PC version already runs on Windows 10
[15:17:12] <Tiffany> they've talked about wanting to link xbox and windows 10 together
[15:17:17] <Tiffany> and this is obviously part of it
[15:17:30] <Quxxy> and there's no technical reason they couldn't make the PC version talk to their servers
[15:17:32] <Tiffany> now you can play with your friends whether they have an xbox or a windows 10 computer
[15:17:44] <Tiffany> no, there is a technical reason
[15:17:51] <Tiffany> they're pretty disparate
[15:18:14] <Quxxy> You're saying the PC edition is *not* a strict superset of the console version?
[15:18:18] <Tiffany> I mean, they probably could, but I bet it would require engine modifications
[15:18:27] <Tiffany> it's not, no
[15:18:54] <Tiffany> http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Console_Edition#Differences_from_the_PC_edition
[15:19:03] <Quxxy> I find the idea of modifying the existing PC version to reach parity being *harder* than porting from console -> PC a bit of a stretch
[15:19:18] <Tiffany> you're sure about that?
[15:19:31] <Tiffany> the console version is a C++ codebase that runs on 5 different consoles
[15:19:39] <Tiffany> it uses the existing xbox APIs, which are similar to those on windows
[15:19:43] <Tiffany> and it might even use DirectX
[15:20:18] <Tiffany> the PC edition is a java codebase which basically only the mojang team knows how to maintain
[15:20:40] <Tiffany> all of the engine features and etc are already there in the console edition
[15:20:51] <Tiffany> porting between xbox and windows is not that big of a jump
[15:21:13] <Tiffany> the xbox runs a sort of subset of the win32 API, even
[15:21:32] <Tiffany> it offers DirectX, although some games use the lower level graphics API to get beter performance
[15:22:24] <Tiffany> "Xbox director of development Boyd Multerer has said porting a game from Windows 8 onto Xbox One is easy for developers: if s studio can write a game in DirectX on PC, the team already knows how to “write a game in Xbox One.”"
[15:22:48] <Tiffany> I wouldn't be surprised if they already had an internal windows 10 version for easy testing
[15:22:55] <Tiffany> so that they didn't have to deploy to a console
[15:23:24] <Tiffany> "Like often in a day, maybe two, because the APIs are that similar."
[15:23:35] <Tiffany> from http://www.vg247.com/2014/03/20/xbox-one-developers-can-port-windows-8-games-easily-onto-the-console-says-microsoft/
[15:25:06] <Tiffany> would microsoft allow mojang to push out 1.9 if they were intending on replacing the PC edition?
[15:25:11] <Tiffany> it's going to be released tomorrow
[15:25:21] <Tiffany> well, "more details" will be released
[15:25:21] <Quxxy> Ok
[15:25:33] <Tiffany> also
[15:25:34] <Quxxy> (As an aside, if it's so easy, explain the mess that is Arkham Knight :P)
[15:25:47] * Quxxy steps back from keyboard again
[15:25:55] <Tiffany> the hosts on the minecon stream have been spending lots of time gushing at how great the PC edition is
[15:26:04] <Tiffany> they have multiple panels dedicated to modding
[15:26:15] <Tiffany> arkham knight is an interesting one
[15:26:24] <Tiffany> I want to know the details about their performance problems
[15:26:40] <Tiffany> I learned yesterday that unreal uses garbage collection and a very OOP architecture and I would really like to blame that
[15:26:48] *** Joins: ELD (textual@moz-tbcsac.co.comcast.net)
[15:26:59] <Tiffany> they use this sort of strange tool which generates their own special RTTI which they use for doing tracing GC
[15:27:34] <Tiffany> I can understand why unreal does this architecture, but it really bothers me
[15:28:06] <Tiffany> every single object has a Tick method and there's some loop in the codebase which iterates through very object in existence and ticks it, except when they opt out

[19:05:03] <AxP> Hey
[19:05:21] <AxP> So the "[]" copies the values you assign?
[19:05:28] <benh> no, the = does
[19:05:48] <benh> if it was just x = *(new ...), where x is another map of the right type, it would still be a copy
[19:06:04] <benh> *(new ...) is almost never right
[19:06:14] <AxP> Ah ok, will remember that
[19:06:33] <benh> you don't need "new" to make a new object, only if you want to dynamically allocate memory for that object itself
[19:06:51] <benh> the map will dynamically allocate memory for its contents even if you don't use "new"
[19:07:39] <AxP> So the entries stay "alive" as long as the map stays, right?  Just starting with c++ and the memory stuff is a bit confusing sometimes.

[19:08:46] <benh> everything that has a destructor that cleans up after it is just fine

[19:11:07] <benh> AxP: it's idiomatic that objects can clean up after themselves in their destructors, so you're usually fine as long as you are not yourself dealing with raw pointers, which you should avoid unless you *want* to manually manage things

[19:16:13] <benh> AxP: very broadly speaking, you should try to avoid using pointers and then work your way up along the lines of references, unique pointers, shared pointers, raw pointers if you have to

[21:04:25] <Layl> Peach, it depends
[21:04:28] <eddyb> Peach: log n < n
[21:04:53] <Peach> More specifically I'm trying to think of C++ hashmap, and which is faster, map or unordered_map
[21:04:55] <Layl> O(log n) can be much slower than O(n) if the first one takes a year to run on n = 1 and the second one takes 5 seconds on n = 1
[21:05:03] <eddyb> Peach: depends on your data and access patterns
[21:05:22] <Layl> as well, cache gives a big influence on speed
[21:05:33] <eddyb> I've seen hashmaps do better than trees
[21:05:36] <Layl> vector is usually faster than linked list, even when inserting right in the middle
[21:05:53] <eddyb> in Rust you'd mostly use tress if you wanted to keep your data sorted
[21:05:56] <Peach> Ok, data is - Abstract Syntax Tree lookup - so it's updated somewhat infrequently (when the user edits source code), and accessed ALOT during compilation time to check the symbol tables
[21:06:30] <Elaine> AST and symbol table should be completely separate.
[21:07:17] <Elaine> But you should use an unordered map if you don't need order.

[22:44:53] <Peach> nice!
[22:45:45] <Peach> Ok, can anyone sell me on "why name spaces are great"?
[22:46:09] <Peach> namespaces vs - just have scopes when you compile in separate files?

[22:48:58] <aatch> Peach could you elaborate?
[22:49:29] <aatch> Peach, many languages *do* only have file-based name-spacing. Python being the best example I can think of.
[22:50:04] <Peach> Ok, essentially I see namespaces as redundant when you just have proper named imports, because often function names (when well designed) shouldn't really conflict
[22:50:11] <Peach> i.e. Java's System.out.printlin
[22:50:40] <Peach> should really be just   print - because if you import something, you shouldn't really have multiple "print" functions in global space
[22:50:50] <Peach> I mean that's just a rough illustration
[22:51:05] <aatch> Peach, ok, but how do you specify a specific import?
[22:51:37] <Peach> specific import?
[22:51:56] <Peach> like import ConsoleIO; or something?

[22:58:35] <niconii> who the fuck decided the galaxy s5's camera didn't need a manual focus feature
[22:59:13] <niconii> i just spent 40 minutes trying to take a photo without the auto-focus fucking up everything because they couldn't put in a fucking slider
[23:00:07] <huon> can you click the screen to chose a focus point?
[23:00:13] <huon> s/click/touch/
[23:00:15] <niconii> yeah but it's garbage
[23:00:22] <niconii> it doesn't work
[23:00:28] <huon> :/
[23:00:45] <huon> are there any decent third party camera apps?
[23:00:51] <niconii> it'll actually try to focus, show the thing focused perfectly, then snap back
[23:00:51] * huon has never looked
[23:00:57] <niconii> i tried
[23:01:18] <niconii> the galaxy s5's camera just flat-out doesn't expose manual focus to other apps
[23:01:33] <niconii> it's not possible period
[23:01:54] <aatch> niconii, yeah, I've noticed that too.
[23:02:17] <FreeFull> niconii: Should have gotten a different phone
[23:02:47] <niconii> this was my first smartphone, i kinda expected the camera app to not be shit
[23:04:07] <ytain> there's open camera app
[23:04:13] <niconii> ytain: tried it
[23:04:43] <ytain> stock rom?
[23:04:48] <niconii> i tried about four different camera apps before one just flat-out told me "yeah no your phone won't allow manual focus"
[23:05:17] <niconii> ytain: and yeah, stock rom
[23:05:31] <ytain> check the xda forums
[23:06:21] <niconii> ytain: to be honest i just really don't want to have to deal with all that
[23:07:14] <ytain> i usually check the xda forums for devices before i buy one
[23:08:12] <niconii> anyway, on another note, since it took so damn long just to take a photo of this thing, i guess i'll ask here too
[23:08:37] <niconii> does anyone actually know what the hell this thing is: http://puu.sh/iNrH1/72370a7a3c.png
[23:08:54] <niconii> it's some flat piece of plastic, from some nintendo thing obviously but i have no idea what
[23:09:31] <whipsch> maybe part of a cartridge cleaning kit, or a tool to open something
[23:10:03] <niconii> hmm, don't really think i'd have either of those
[23:10:59] <WindowsBunny> gooood morning rustaceans
[23:11:02] <WindowsBunny> how y'all doin
[23:11:07] <ytain> it could be a cartridge remover
[23:11:14] <ytain> in case the cartridge gets stuck
[23:12:04] <ytain> or a cartridge shim in case the cartridge is shorter than the slot
[23:12:51] <niconii> doesn't really explain the bit at the right though
[23:13:15] <niconii> that bump thing is on both sides by the way
[23:13:19] <whipsch> yeah ive never seen one of those before

[23:56:49] <Tiffany> casualties in the infestation include a $1 biography about the two dudes who started HP, a ~15 year old book on javascript, and some stuff I forgot
[23:57:26] <Tiffany> the book was from when internet explorer and netscape were the dominant browsers
