[05:22:21] <eternaleye> Nice!
[05:23:04] <eternaleye> They really cranked the cycle count down on ivy bridge...
[05:23:18] <eternaleye> What is that, more than 1/6 reduction?
[05:23:25] <eternaleye> er, sandy bridge
[05:23:37] <eternaleye> Oh, no,  right the first time
[05:23:45] <eternaleye> I am clearly shorter on sleep than I should be
[05:27:24] <eternaleye> Mm, actually, the best constant-time result is just under 120k, and theirs is under 90k by a larger margin.
[05:27:36] <eternaleye> 1/4 speed boost is really impressive.
[05:31:21] <eternaleye> Tiffany: Also, you mentioned a few days ago re: AES "256 bytes is still only 4 cache lines though" "I find it hard to imagine you could build an effective timing attack against this" "the S-box should never leave cache"
[05:32:16] <eternaleye> Tiffany: The above paper mentions one such method on p. 4: An operating-system interrupt can occur at any moment (for example, triggered by a network packet), knocking some or all data out of the cache (presumably at addresses predictable to, or controllable by, an attacker—it is helpful for the attacker that, for cost reasons, cache associativity is limited); see also the “flush+reload” attack from [51] and other local-spy attacks 
[05:32:17] <eternaleye> cited in [51].
[05:33:45] <eternaleye> Tiffany: So as an example, if your code and their code run, and you always load enough things that (associativity-wise) will collide with _one_ of those four cache lines, then you can (with some amount of noise) measure the delay when it accesses that region of the S-box

[16:29:28] <Tiffany> probably because salsa is older
[16:30:14] <Tobba> I'd assume there are better ways to achieve security against ciphers being broken than simply layering them ontop of eachother
[16:30:42] <Tiffany> I don't really know anything about what happens when you layer ciphers
[16:30:47] <Tiffany> I remember being told it's a bad idea
[16:30:58] <Tiffany> keybase asserts that it improves security rather than lowers it, though..
[16:31:03] *** Quits: erickt (erickt@moz-njt.vqi.14.76.IP) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[16:35:09] <Ilari> Well, layering ciphers with independent keys is at least as strong as the weakest one.
[16:36:01] <Tiffany> oh
[16:36:21] <Tiffany> er
[16:36:46] <eternaleye> Tiffany: Basically, hash concatenation and cipher layering are not harmful, but they aren't as beneficial as people often presume
[16:36:47] <Tiffany> oh, they do actually use separate keys
[16:37:20] <Tiffany> alright
[16:37:22] <eternaleye> Tiffany: In that it's much more "hedge against one being horrendously broken all of a sudden" than "by your powers combind"
[16:37:27] <eternaleye> *combined
[16:39:28] <Ilari> "We want to minimize the number of ciphers and cipher-suites, not allow for a mind-boggling combinatorial explosion that will cripple interop."
[16:41:47] <eternaleye> Yeah, I dunno where Rich Salz is coming from (or going) with that.
[16:46:40] <Ilari> Well, you are going to get that explosion one way or another... And the current way is nasty for both admins and TLS WG.
[16:57:40] <Tiffany> wtf...
[16:57:41] <Tiffany> https://github.com/NTRUOpenSourceProject/ntru-crypto/blob/master/FOSS%20Exception.md
[16:57:46] <Tiffany> b. The Derivative Work does not include any work licensed under the GPL other than the GPLed NTRU;
[16:57:56] <Tiffany> you can't have any GPL libraries other than NTRU
[16:57:57] <Tiffany> okay
[17:26:03] <Ilari> As said on NIST ECC Workshop yesterday, patents do very bad things to real-world deployment.
[17:35:18] <Tiffany> yeah
[17:35:27] <Tiffany> and vague wording in the legal text is even worse, I imagine
[17:35:39] <Tiffany> I certainly wouldn't feel comfortable using NTRU with these vague terms
[17:49:14] <Ilari> The way it is nasty for admins: The key exchanges, symmetric ciphers and PRFs are relatively independent, and as such, if component is disabled in one context, it should be disabled in all.
[18:10:25] <Tiffany> oh
[18:10:39] <Tiffany> " TripleSec never uses the output of one block cipher as input into the next, which theoretically might allow a crack of one cipher to be used to crack another."
[18:10:52] <Tiffany> the two block ciphers are in counter mode
[18:11:23] <Tiffany> it xors all of the keystreams together
[18:11:36] <Tiffany> which seems pretty okay, as long as the chance of a collision of keystream blocks is near zero
[18:12:26] <cmr> they should be entirely independent, in theory, and xor is fine for mixing independent random data.
[18:12:36] <Tiffany> yeah
[18:12:38] <cmr> but PRFs don't exist.
[18:12:45] <Tiffany> PRF?
[18:12:58] <cmr> theoretical model of perfect cipher
[18:13:10] <Tiffany> oh
[18:14:03] <Tiffany> pseudorandom function family?
[18:14:12] <cmr> pseudo random function
[18:14:19] <cmr> sorry, should have expanded
[18:14:30] <Tiffany> yeah
[18:16:57] <Tiffany> I suppose that a downside to combining ciphers in this way is that they don't have much cryptanalysis and that cryptanalysis is more difficult due to the complexity?
[18:20:54] <Tiffany> what is a PRF supposed to be?
[18:21:10] <Tiffany> a sort of impossible function that maps a key and a nonce to a completely random stream?
[18:22:03] <Tiffany> the same stream every time, that is
[18:22:49] <Tiffany> and the reason it's impossible is that it would require an infinite amount of time or memory to implement?
[18:25:29] *** Joins: erickt (erickt@moz-njt.vqi.14.76.IP)
[18:34:52] <bascule> Tiffany: actually, if you combine ciphers that way, the construction is formally proven to be at least as strong as the strongest of the two
[18:35:00] <bascule> it's the idea that underlies Feistel networks
[18:35:22] <bascule> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_cipher
[18:37:35] <Tiffany> is there a reason why xoring multiple keystreams isn't more common then?
[18:40:07] <bascule> it is...
[18:40:11] <Tiffany> oh
[18:40:17] <bascule> DES is a Feistel cipher
[18:40:43] <Tiffany> er
[18:40:45] <bascule> so is Blowfish
[18:41:09] <Tiffany> I don't really understand what Feistel ciphers and xor of multiple keystreams have in common
[18:41:32] <Tiffany> .. oh
[18:41:35] <bascule> it's the same thing
[18:41:45] <bascule> Feistel lets you build a PRP out of 3 PRFs
[18:41:46] <Tiffany> yeah, I see now
[18:41:54] <bascule> that said, TripleSec is stupid ;)
[18:42:31] <Tiffany> stupid why?
[18:42:42] <bascule> there's no point?
[18:43:01] <Tiffany> why not?
[18:43:15] <bascule> Shamir's law
[18:43:17] <Tiffany> they say it's to keep files secure in case of catastrophic cryptanalysis on any one of the ciphers they use
[18:43:22] <bascule> uh huh
[18:43:38] <Tiffany> since you basically cannot delete files hosted on something like S3
[18:43:40] <Tiffany> not permanently, anyway
[18:44:01] <Tiffany> shamir's law?
[18:44:11] <bascule> Crypto is bypassed, not broken
[18:44:17] <Tiffany> oh
[18:44:19] <Tiffany> yeah
[18:44:25] <Tiffany> that is absolutely true
[18:45:02] <Tiffany> by far the largest attack vector on keybase.io's private key storage is an attacker highjacking the site and hosting malicious javascript
[18:45:05] <Tiffany> not breaking the crypto
[18:45:17] <bascule> haha yeah, they take the whole construction and put it into a web page
[18:45:23] <bascule> go "here, encrypt and decrypt with this o_O"
[18:45:35] <bascule> it's triple secure because it's behind THREE CIPHERS
[18:45:56] <Tiffany> they don't advertise it too hard though
[18:46:07] <bascule> they did when it came out
[18:46:22] <bascule> but like, here's the thing
[18:46:32] <bascule> let's say you're actually worried about that sort of thing
[18:46:39] <Tiffany> their security model is essentially to have the command line users notice when the site is being highjacked
[18:46:48] <Tiffany> and the browser users are all fucked
[18:46:51] <bascule> and think you can keep your endpoint secure for a hundred years, but somehow the NSA is going to get your ciphertexts and wait for a break in AES
[18:46:57] <Ilari> Also, given the modern web browsers, if you can take over HTTPS connection once, you can troijan the site pretty much permanently for that user.
[18:47:06] <bascule> Ilari: lol yeah
[18:47:11] <bascule> Service Workers o_O
[18:47:32] <bascule> but yeah, anyway, given all of ^^^ is true, I'd argue you need at *most* two ciphers
[18:47:39] <Tiffany> so the crypto is overkill, but it's at least sound?
[18:47:51] <bascule> uhh, the concept of a product cipher is sound
[18:47:59] <bascule> that doesn't make TripleSec a good idea
[18:49:35] <Tiffany> I'm trying to figure out where to put this thing
[18:49:49] <Tiffany> so it's not broken, but it's also not a good idea
[18:49:58] <Tiffany> is it not a good idea because it can be broken?
[18:50:13] <Tiffany> or is it not a good idea because it's overkill
[18:50:50] <bascule> it's snake oil because it's overkill and they're putting it in a web page and using JavaScript
[18:50:56] <Tiffany> okay
[18:50:57] <bascule> and not putting a big warning on it
[18:51:45] <Tiffany> you're right, they don't put a warning on it
[18:51:50] <bascule> they're not even using content security policy :(
[18:51:54] <Tiffany> you have to go into their documentation in order to read what kind of attack vectors they have
[18:52:25] <Tiffany> to be fair though
[18:52:33] <Tiffany> this feature is oriented at average users
[18:52:59] <bascule> is it?
[18:53:06] <bascule> okay, let me pretend to be an "average user"
[18:53:08] <bascule> I go to this page
[18:53:10] <Tiffany> if PGP becomes widespread, you can be sure that there will be malware to steal your keys, if there isn't already
[18:53:15] <bascule> TripleSec: now in Python, JS, Node.js, Go, and C#
[18:53:16] <bascule> TripleSec is a simple, triple-paranoid, symmetric encryption library for Python, Node.js, Go, C#, and the browser. It encrypts data with Salsa 20, AES, and Twofish, so that a compromise of one or two of the ciphers will not expose the secret.
[18:53:23] <bascule> what's a Python
[18:53:23] <Tiffany> so you store it on this website, and put all your trust in their code and HTTPS not being horribly broken
[18:53:25] <bascule> what's a JS
[18:53:27] <bascule> what's a Node.js
[18:53:32] <bascule> what's symmetric encryption
[18:53:34] <Tiffany> uh
[18:53:37] <bascule> no, not targeted at average users
[18:53:40] <Tiffany> I'm not talking about TripleSec
[18:53:45] <bascule> ?
[18:53:58] <Tiffany> let me show a screenshot
[18:54:07] <bascule> what thing are you talking about?
[18:54:13] <Tiffany> http://i.imgur.com/Xso3GAk.png
[18:54:15] <Tiffany> from the keybase website
[18:54:18] <Tiffany> on private key hosting
[18:54:25] <bascule> oh that
[18:54:28] <bascule> well that's kind of ok
[18:54:49] <Tiffany> honestly I think I trust keybase's website and the horriblying glob of tech that it requires to access it more than the average person's PC
[18:54:58] <bascule> lolololololol
[18:55:01] <bascule> like installing Node.js?
[18:55:15] <bascule> the concept of storing an encrypted copy of your private key is not an inherently bad one
[18:55:23] <bascule> pasting it into a web page that doesn't use CSP is though
[18:55:24] <bascule> heh
[18:55:31] <Tiffany> I have an encrypted copy of my private key on google drive
[18:55:39] <Tiffany> well, they also have an offline client
[18:55:52] <Tiffany> but Average Joe isn't going to use that
[18:56:14] <Tiffany> well, not offline, but rather not in the browser
[18:56:19] <bascule> https://keybase.io/_/brew/_/e7e4e59f/sitewide-js.js
[18:56:46] <Tiffany> that's a lot of minified javascript
[18:56:50] <bascule> Tiffany: Keybase is at some kind of uncanny valley between trying to aim their tools at technical people and trying to build "crypto for everyone"
[18:57:07] <Tiffany> I suppose
[18:57:09] <bascule> it's basically crypto for technical people with some nice art
[18:57:21] <Tiffany> I think it's more interesting than the PGP key servers
[18:57:27] <bascule> haha, yes, but
[18:57:27] <Tiffany> since it also validates your various accounts
[18:57:29] <Tiffany> instead of just your email
[18:57:49] <bascule> SKS keyservers are completely unusable
[18:57:53] <bascule> even by technical people
[18:58:19] <Tiffany> I managed to publish my key on keyserver2.pgp.com
[18:58:23] <bascule> I think the systems that actually work and scale to millions of daily active users completely abstract key management away from you
[18:58:30] <bascule> like iMessage or WhatsApp
[18:58:53] <Tiffany> yeah
[18:59:22] <Tiffany> I think mumble-style key management can be made reasonable for normal users
[18:59:54] <Tiffany> mumble doesn't do a particularly good job of explaining how important your key is, and as a result a lot of people forget to copy it to new computers and whatnot
[19:00:16] <Tiffany> centralized management of keys would be very beneficial, since you'd be able to just copy the one key to your new computer
[19:00:28] <Tiffany> or even just sign the new computer's key with your current one's key through some simple mechanism
[19:00:40] <bascule> Whiteout does a pairing code and transfers an encrypted private key
[19:00:48] <Tiffany> is there a lot of UX stuff going on in this space?
[19:00:53] <Tiffany> I'm not familiar with much of it
[19:01:00] <bascule> yes
[19:01:12] <bascule> Whiteout is probably the best attempt I've seen at building a decent OpenPGP UX
[19:01:55] <Tiffany> nice
[19:04:28] <Tiffany> how does whiteout interoperability work?
[19:04:44] <Tiffany> it says you can send mail to yahoo and gmail users, but it doesn't seem to mention that they'll receive a blob of ascii armour
[19:05:02] <bascule> Google and Yahoo are trying to do End-to-End
[19:06:17] <Tiffany> ah
[19:06:21] <Tiffany> "Exchange messages with the worldwide community of PGP users. "
[19:06:33] <Tiffany> and it supports all the protocols and whatnot
[19:06:45] <Tiffany> so it really is just a PGP mail client, although a very easy to use one from the look of it
[19:08:18] <bascule> yeah
[19:08:33] <Tiffany> I just downloaded it from the chrome store and it's telling me I can open it from the "Chrome App Launcher"
[19:08:44] <Tiffany> does it think I'm running ChromeOS?
[19:09:04] <Tiffany> oh
[19:09:07] <Tiffany> I open a new tab and there it is
[19:13:49] <Tiffany> this is pretty neat
[19:17:07] <Tiffany> it doesn't seem to have much in the way of configurability or functionality though
[19:40:12] <Tiffany> some of the negative reviews were actually pretty right
[19:40:14] <Tiffany> this is very slow
[19:40:37] <Tiffany> I'm sure it's not as bad once it has actually settled
[19:56:03] <Tiffany> I seem to have locked the client up
[19:56:22] <Tiffany> apparently deleting 18 000 messages isn't a good idea
[19:59:22] <Tiffany> so I tried restarting chrome a couple times
[19:59:27] <Tiffany> the only thing that fixed it was reinstalling it
[20:00:08] <Tiffany> the application, not chrome entirely
