[00:49:30] <bjz_> cmr: indeed
[00:49:37] <bjz_> I would rather not roll my own
[00:50:00] <bjz_> but all embeddable langs seem to be annoyingly dynamically typed
[00:50:02] <cmr> angelscript, tentatively?
[00:50:17] *** Quits: esummers (esummers@moz-3B015C90.wi.res.rr.com) (Ping timeout)
[00:50:35] <bjz_> "Familiar syntax - The script syntax is similar to that of C or C++, with only a few differences. " :(
[00:50:49] <larsberg> bjz_: I'm not really familiar with any directly, but lots of them (e.g., MLton, GHC) will emit either C code or a static lib that you can link in to your program
[00:51:17] <bjz_> larsberg: ideally you could have an inbuilt repl and interpreter
[00:51:29] <bjz_> for quick iteration
[00:51:30] <larsberg> but a lot of the embeddable languages have nice interactive repl-y things you can use, which most of the statically typed languages don't really do so well (ML and haskell interpreters suffer from horrible memory bloat during repl usage)
[00:51:42] <bjz_> yeah :(
[00:51:57] <bjz_> is it something that is not possible with statically typed langs?
[00:52:09] <bjz_> or is it just it hasn't had much work done?
[00:52:16] <cmr> not 
[00:52:21] <cmr> much work done, I imagine
[00:52:22] <larsberg> oh, it's just a pain because you have to do an unnatural tree-shake
[00:52:30] <cmr> it should be *possible*
[00:52:36] <larsberg> you're incrementally defining new bindings (e.g. a new "fun foo" with a new type)
[00:52:38] * bjz_ looks at Elm and drools, but it's not embeddable
[00:52:40] <cmr> but somewhat less useful I imagine
[00:53:00] <cmr> they are used *because* they are dynamic, not in spite of it
[00:53:03] <larsberg> but what you can throw away is not obvious
[00:53:07] <bjz_> larsberg: mmk
[00:53:27] <larsberg> and like cmr says, it's just a lot of work and since repls are for throway / interactive code and the cost of just restarting it is so low, it's not really something people invest in
[00:53:47] <bjz_> yeah
[00:54:14] <bjz_> I guess in a game a repl would just be for interactive exploration by the game dev
[00:54:41] <bjz_> spawn some objects etc
[00:55:26] <larsberg> it's also basically impossible for whole-program compilers
[00:55:46] <larsberg> e.g., in manticore & mlton, datatype and calling conventions are determined by usage in the whole program
[00:56:02] <bjz_> mmk
[00:56:10] <larsberg> so incrementally adding bindings or function calls can dramatically change in-memory representations, registers used to pass stuff to functions, etc.
[00:56:27] <larsberg> you'd have to basically throw everything away and recompile the whole thing on every new binding :-)
[00:56:47] <bjz_> I guess that might be where a jit would come in? but that is probably super tricky
[00:57:00] <bjz_> and would swallow all the development effort
[00:57:10] <bjz_> (ie. no game for you)
[00:57:13] <cmr> well ideally you'd just define a calling convention and representation.
[00:57:17] <cmr> :p
[00:57:17] <larsberg> a jit doesn't make much sense for whole-program, closed-world, statically typed languages
[00:57:24] <bjz_> mmk
[00:57:52] <larsberg> (though o'boyle's group has done some interesting work in that space, doing recompilation based on statistical analysis of program counters during program execution)
[00:58:12] <bjz_> larsberg: could you see the concatenative lang stuff I've been interested in being more amenable to this kind of thing?
[00:59:07] <bjz_> applicative langs probably would be a great deal more complex than a concatenative lang
[00:59:21] <larsberg> yes, certainly. and TBH, even sml/nj could probably be retrofitted for such use - it has a better REPL, but it also doesn't optimize nearly as well as MLton or manticore. 
[00:59:38] <larsberg> (it does separate compilation)
[01:00:49] <bjz_> I'm guessing more complex langs like SML etc would also have very large implementations
[01:01:00] <bjz_> which would hurt embedabbility
[01:01:29] <bjz_> luajit is insane in that regard
[01:01:38] <bjz_> (it's tiny)
[01:01:39] *** Joins: esummers (esummers@moz-3B015C90.wi.res.rr.com)
[01:02:00] <larsberg> Hard to say - SML is actually pretty small as a language and we teach compiling the full SML-CORE in a year of compiler courses; the rest is (provably) syntactic sugar. The hard part is optimizing it. And the big part is the basis library code.
[01:02:24] <larsberg> But I'm totally biased and don't have any idea what "small" is or what people care about for embeddability  :-)
[01:02:40] <bjz_> http://luajit.org/luajit.html
[01:02:46] <larsberg> e.g., why people use LUA instead of just a JS engine.

[01:04:25] <bjz_> ie. you don't want your game download to be saddled with an enormous runtime
[01:04:44] <bjz_> and have big memory footprint
[01:05:29] <bjz_> lua is good because its designed to be embeddable
[01:06:59] <csherratt> JS engines have so much R&D these days it’s almost silly to use anything else.

[01:18:12] <o11c> I'm almost sold on it for that reason then ...
[01:18:26] <o11c> I'm not terribly fond of lua as a language, but ... it's only syntax
[01:18:37] <cmr> I unashamedly love lua.
[01:18:46] <bjz_> it's also semantics too :/
[01:19:02] * cmr has no qualms with its semantics
[01:19:22] <o11c> I haven't used it so much as looked at other people using it
[01:19:38] <o11c> I *really* need to come up with a language that is simple to bind to
[01:20:08] <o11c> (I *am* working on one, to replace our current embedded language)
[01:20:26] <o11c> by "simple to bind to" I mean it shouldn't be *possible* for type errors to exist
[01:20:49] <cmr> so, doesn't have a useful type system? :p
[01:20:56] <bjz_> hah
[01:21:03] <csherratt> where is this?
[01:21:36] <o11c> cmr: no, I just mean that it should be statically typed, and have a "host" API that reflects that
[01:21:52] <o11c> after I deal with this security bug, that's what I'll be working on
[01:21:56] <cmr> ah ok
[01:21:57] * bjz_ is playing around with a Cat inspired lang
[01:22:00] <cmr> no *runtime* type errors
[01:22:22] <o11c> right, the type errors are in the compile_script() function, not in the bind host variable to a name function
[01:23:00] * bjz_ felt obligated not to neglect glfw-rs though
[01:23:49] <o11c> bjz_: I am having difficulty googling "cat language"

[01:24:06] <bjz_> haha
[01:24:07] <bjz_> :D
[01:25:28] <bjz_> o11c: it's pretty neat. it uses a subset of row polymorphism for modelling the stack in the type system
[01:25:59] <o11c> ah, cat as in turtle!
[01:26:04] <bjz_> o11c: I've had to do a bit of learning about type theory stuff

[01:26:22] <bjz_> :D
[01:26:39] <bjz_> I am going to name my lang after my cat :D
[01:26:54] <bjz_> either that or call it Moggy
[01:27:52] <bjz_> need to follow the tradition of feline-related names for concatenative langs!
[01:28:09] <bjz_> another interesting one is http://kittenlang.org/
[01:28:09] <csherratt> meow
[01:28:18] <bjz_> but it's not embeddable
[01:28:34] <csherratt> it has a cute logo
[01:28:45] <bjz_> yep :D
[01:30:23] <csherratt> has anyone used Io?
[01:30:59] <o11c> I *love* the section on "type signatures" in the cat tutorial
[01:32:51] <bjz_> o11c: the papers are also a good read
[01:33:44] <bjz_> o11c: the type signatures are a formalisation of the stack diagrams that are used in Forth
[01:33:53] <tiffany> I'd asked a bit about embedding kitten
[01:34:06] <tiffany> there's no proper API, but it's theoretically possible if I write a haskell shim
[01:34:56] <bjz_> like, `: square (x -- x^2)` - where comments are in parens
[01:37:09] <bjz_> tiffany: haskell shim?
[01:37:54] <tiffany> bjz_: I don't really know how this works - but presumably I would expose some C-friendly entrypoints using haskell's FFI which wrap the functionality of the kitten interpreter
[01:38:07] <bjz_> ah

[15:36:30] <rsaarelm> Rust-toml hasn't been updated in two weeks. "I wonder if the project is abandoned."
[15:40:54] <rsaarelm> Also it seems to have a Decode component but not an Encode one. So I guess I can automagically decode TOML into values of simple struct types, but I also want to pretty-print values from the same type back into TOML.
[15:41:26] <SiegeLord> I wonder if it's a good idea to write a macro to automate the #[start] function dance
[15:44:36] <SiegeLord> I should re-implement my own configuration language at some point... and change it's syntax to match Rust's XD
[15:46:08] <rsaarelm> My use cases are ini files, human editable save files and human editable map/world files.
[15:46:18] <rsaarelm> TOML seems good enough for all those.
