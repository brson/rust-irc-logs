[00:30:20] <ytain> from the link above The article I found mentioned the ability to render an entire tilemap layer with a single quad. Using a texture look-up along with a tileset image it’s entirely possible to render 1000×1000 tilemap layers in a single draw call.
[00:30:32] <eddyb> ah, yeah, that too

[05:05:37] <Layl> hm, what's a common solution when you want to use array textures but your textures can be whatever size
[05:09:56] <jpernst> texture atlasing is a classic approach, but has some downsides
[05:10:17] <Elaine> Layl: bucketing into an array for each size.
[05:10:27] <Elaine> If you have a *ton* of variation, your asset pipeline is bad ;)
[05:11:38] <Layl> I'm just making a small library that's supposed to do extremely easy 2D drawing, I just receive image files and have to make sense of them
[05:12:09] <Elaine> Sure, what I'm saying is, do the simplest bucketing, it's a best-effort approach to performance and the client will need to do some optimization if the performance is poor.
[05:12:14] <Layl> jpernst, is there an alterative better (and well supported!) solution?
[05:12:30] <jpernst> i think Elaine's approach is best
[05:12:38] <jpernst> texture atlasing sucks and should be avoided if you can
[05:12:53] <Elaine> If you atlas for the client you'll introduce bleeding and they won't like that.
[05:12:58] <jpernst> exactly
[05:13:08] <Elaine> you need to carefully tune the atlas manually to avoid it.
[05:13:13] <jpernst> if you're doing strictly 1:1 drawing, you can get away with it, but as soon as you scale it's a mess
[05:13:59] <Layl> hm, what if I just keep powers of 2 starting at 32x32
[05:14:05] <jpernst> you can also get away with it for fonts, since each glyph is surrounded by full transperency
[05:14:29] <Layl> and if something that's not a neat 32x32 gets put in, I can pad it out
[05:14:34] <Layl> *not a neat power of 2
[05:15:04] <WindowsBunny> Layl: You can use my algorithm for allocating tiles in a texture atlas
[05:15:07] <Layl> anything above 512x512 gets put in, perhaps I can just say "though luck" and make it a special case
[05:15:07] <jpernst> padding it out will reintroduce the problems that atlasing has, unless you pad it around the edge by duplicating the edge pixels
[05:15:30] <jpernst> even then you could still have problems with mip levels
[05:15:43] <Layl> damn it I just wanted to have a small rendering library to make a game with
[05:15:53] <WindowsBunny> oh yeah, mipmapping will suck
[05:16:01] <Layl> this is all taking too much work in engine stuff gaah
[05:16:47] <jpernst> sometimes simplicity can be complicated
[05:16:57] <Elaine> WindowsBunny: what's your algorhtm?
[05:17:25] <WindowsBunny> Elaine: Well, it's based off the black pawn algorithm https://github.com/retep998/Wiki/blob/master/Wiki.cpp#L173-L218
[05:17:47] <Elaine> Does largest-first best-fit not work?
[05:17:51] <Elaine> acceptably well I mean
[05:18:08] <Layl> gaaaaaaaaaaah, fuck it I'm only allowing power of 2 textures
[05:18:15] <Layl> I don't want to deal with all of this, I just want to make a game
[05:18:22] <Layl> this is getting increasingly frustrating
[05:18:38] <WindowsBunny> Elaine: That algorithm is used to keep track of empty space so you can very cheaply insert stuff

[05:21:09] <WindowsBunny> Because then that means I'd have to rotate the texture data before uploading it
[05:21:15] <jpernst> yeah, personally i think it's usually overkill
[05:21:30] <WindowsBunny> For the most part I can pack things in fairly well
[05:21:39] <WindowsBunny> And if I run out of space, I just purge the atlas and start over
[05:23:10] <WindowsBunny> Fortunately since that game used a more pixel art style, I didn't have to worry about mipmapping

[05:24:49] <Layl> I'm noticing that, a lot
[05:25:02] <jpernst> Layl, I recommend you start with your game design first
[05:25:06] <Elaine> jpernst: with current and future GPUs, you just get arbitrary memory access and access to programmable texture filtering :D
[05:25:17] <jpernst> flesh it out a bit and ask yourself exactly what features you need
[05:25:20] <Layl> jpernst, I rather start with a prototype
[05:25:23] <jpernst> then take the shortest path through the complexity to get there
[05:25:35] <Layl> see if the gameplay works before spending time on a formal design
[05:25:47] <aatch> Layl, I think that's what jpernst is suggesting.
[05:25:56] <jpernst> in that case, you may be best served by using something like Love2D to do a quick proto
[05:26:14] <jpernst> then once you get it a bit more solid and want to move to rust, you'll know exactly what you need
[05:26:43] <aatch> I've learned that trying to get something "right" from the beginning results in you getting nothing.
[05:26:52] <Layl> but I like rust, I want to use rust

[05:28:23] <Layl> aatch, that's why I'm trying to write a really small library to just draw textures on the screen
[05:28:40] <tomaka> Layl: at first glutin and glium were an integral part of my game
[05:28:43] <Layl> rather than a full engine
[05:28:52] <tomaka> I extracted them because they were becoming too complex

[05:31:22] <jpernst> true
[05:31:33] <jpernst> but i'd argue that's basically always the case

[05:57:18] <aatch> Layl, the only single-line way I know of is transmute
[05:57:25] <aatch> Or that.
[05:57:43] <aatch> I feel silly for not thinking of that.
[05:57:44] <Layl> darn that's not quite as small as I would like it to be
[05:58:06] <Layl> I'll just make a quick trait so I can do .to_i32
[05:58:11] <Layl> and .to_u32

[13:35:41] <magina> I have a project with a module /src/engine/{mod.rs, otherfiles.rs}, which contains all my base game classes, traits, maths stuff etc. Is it possible to have some types auto-imported for all subfiles in the module? i.e. a "use engine::traits::*;" in each other file without needing to specify it manually?

[13:50:31] <neikos> So it's alright if I create dozens of widgets in each drawing call?

[14:44:04] <Layl> hm, if you've already got an android SDK installed do you still need the NDK?
[14:44:08] <bitwise_uk> will give it a go, as been battling C/C++ on android ndk for last few days, rust seems more fun

[15:07:04] <bitwise_uk> I always get confused between mingw and msys
[15:07:25] <bitwise_uk> I think they have "mget" or something ?
[15:07:39] <bitwise_uk> is this to build rust?  I can prob have a go in a windows vm
[15:07:51] <Layl> there's no executable with "get" in it whatsoever

[15:26:09] <tomaka> Okay so I guess I don't need an RFC after all
[15:26:18] <tomaka> hmmm
[15:26:26] <tomaka> I may still need is_size_suitable though
[15:26:31] <bitwise_uk> (most of that stuff you won't actually need) - I borrowed it from another project and updated to newer ndk
[15:26:33] <Layl> is there some automated script using vagrant that just makes apk-builder work instantly no effort required
[15:26:58] <Layl> since you can just make a throwaway VM that way with everything set up
[15:27:41] <eddyb> tomaka: what would it do?
[15:28:04] <tomaka> eddyb: returns true if the `usize` passed as parameter is possible for the type you give
[15:28:11] <eddyb> what for?
[15:28:15] <tomaka> for example  `is_size_suitable<[u16]>(3)` returns false
[15:28:16] <bitwise_uk> there probably is a docker image around somewhere
[15:28:40] <tomaka> eddyb: if the user wants to allocate an empty block of memory to contain an unsized type
[15:28:41] <bitwise_uk> I gave up on the standalone toolchain a few days ago and just worked on gradle based builds... but prob time to come back to it
[15:28:49] <tomaka> I have no way to know if the requested size is correct
[15:28:56] <eddyb> ah
[15:29:02] <eddyb> tomaka: again, write your own trait
[15:29:06] <eddyb> "granularity"
[15:29:13] <tomaka> hmm
[15:29:21] <tomaka> but that's something unsafe to implement
[15:29:27] <eddyb> unsafe traits exist
[15:29:47] <tomaka> yeah but the compiler could easily implement it for every single existing type
[15:29:54] <eddyb> so can you
[15:30:09] <tomaka> I can only if I know the layout of the type
[15:30:15] <eddyb> except unsized types other than [T], I guess
[15:30:23] <tomaka> yeah that's the problem
[15:30:52] <eddyb> but how do you get a reference of that unsized type?
[15:31:02] <eddyb> if I were you I'd just ignore the extra capacity
[15:31:23] <tomaka> right, I need to know the layout of the fat pointer as well
[15:31:24] <tomaka> >_>
[15:31:31] <eddyb> there's an evil trick
[15:31:51] <eddyb> transmute (0, 0) to a reference of your type
[15:31:55] <eddyb> and call size_of_val on it
[15:32:01] <tomaka> ah nice
[15:32:04] <eddyb> it will segfault for traits
[15:32:10] <tomaka> ah, not nice
[15:32:10] <eddyb> and give you minimum size for everything else
[15:32:26] <eddyb> (0, 1) will give you minimum size + element size

[15:35:51] <eddyb> syntex could be very nice to use, if Cargo gets a few features to help with that
[15:36:07] <tomaka> using regex!("blabla") is nicer than writing a build script that generates rust code that you have to include
[15:36:19] <eddyb> that's the easy part IMO

[19:10:29] <eddyb> fkaa: WoW
[19:10:41] <eddyb> so it has no shader sources, anywhere?
[19:10:51] <fkaa> probably in Cg-speak
[19:10:57] <fkaa> which is compiled into arb programs
[19:11:11] <eddyb> what's the SPIR-V <-> ARB compat?
[19:11:21] <fkaa> arb is old
[19:11:23] <fkaa> and crufty
[19:11:44] <fkaa> and lacking in some major stuff
[19:11:48] <fkaa> so probably none
[19:12:31] <tomaka> I think they abandonned this assembly stuff because it was too hard to write or something
[19:12:36] <Tiffany> there's a game I used to play which used Cg
[19:12:54] <tomaka> it's funny that they come back to a similar system ten years later
[19:13:06] <fkaa> :p
[19:13:08] <tomaka> what used to be a weakness is now considered a strength
[19:13:11] <Tiffany> I think the intention with the old ARB shaders was to write them by hand...
[19:13:17] <Tiffany> the intent now is entirely around tooling
[19:13:27] <Tiffany> but yeah, things do tend to revolve like that
[19:15:19] <Tiffany> fat vs thin clients, unified vs coprocessor architecture, and so on
[19:15:42] <Tiffany> I remember reading some thing about a video terminal which had a coprocessor in its graphics coprocessor
[19:15:48] <Tiffany> when you get to nesting, that's when you go back to basics
[19:16:51] <fkaa> damnit apple
[19:17:11] <fkaa> some parts of core frameworks just don't have any documentation whatsoever

[22:44:12] <jhasse> Hi! Is it possible to use glium and gl-rs at the same time? Especially since get_proc_address becomes unavailable when using build_glium.
[22:44:30] <Elaine> jhasse: Probably, but it seems like a very bad idea.
[22:44:32] <Elaine> Why?
[22:45:04] <jhasse> Elaine, I want to switch to glium with a smooth transition of my existing code ;)
[22:45:25] <Elaine> That seems like a really bad idea.
[22:45:36] <jhasse> Why?
[22:45:56] <jhasse> Does glium do some things which could mess up my existing gl code?
[22:46:06] <Elaine> The state interactions between glium and your raw gl are surely complex.
[22:46:21] <Elaine> And glium will use newer GL features where possible, in ways you might not expect.
[22:46:44] <jhasse> ah makes sense.
[22:46:53] <jhasse> Okay I will have to rewrite then. Thanks :)
