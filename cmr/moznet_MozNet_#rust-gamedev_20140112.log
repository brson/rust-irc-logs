[09:08:27] <bjz> csherratt: sorry!
[09:08:49] <csherratt> no. I was thinking about the change and you made valid points
[09:09:25] <csherratt> I was trying to work around a weekness in the design of rust with the default type. I still need that, but I think I can get around it using Option<T> instead
[09:09:55] <csherratt> the way I applied default only made senses to the areas that already had Zero. 
[09:10:53] <bjz> like, a matrix sort of has two defaults - depending on whether you're looking at it from the point of view of an additive group or a multiplicative monoid
[09:11:13] <bjz> either the zero matrix or the identity
[09:12:25] <csherratt> I think in the case of a matrix, the identity matrix probably makes more sense.
[09:12:36] <bjz> yes
[09:12:46] <csherratt> otherwise they would have just used the zero trait
[09:13:17] * dbaupp has no context but...
[09:13:28] <bjz> wait
[09:13:29] <csherratt> that being said. I'll probably reopen it later, since I added the clone trait that was missing for a few types.
[09:13:33] <bjz> I had that wrong
[09:13:40] <bjz> don't listen to me
[09:13:54] <dbaupp> if you're talking about a default constructor for matrices, the default should be the identity of the operation that they'll be used with the most
[09:13:56] <dbaupp> (IMO)
[09:14:24] <ecl3ctic> Rust doesn't even have constructors...
[09:14:32] <ecl3ctic> what do you mean by default constructor?
[09:14:38] <dbaupp> so for cg, with rotation matrices (etc.) the identity; for a general math lib, zero.
[09:14:42] <csherratt> http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/0.8/std/default/trait.Default.html
[09:15:01] <bjz> csherratt: use http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/master/std/default/trait.Default.html
[09:15:09] <dbaupp> ecl3ctic: "constructor" in rust refers to functions like `fn new() -> MyObject` etc.
[09:15:13] <bjz> csherratt: master docs are the most up to date
[09:15:14] <csherratt> I hate when I grab the first result from google
[09:15:22] <ecl3ctic> oh that Default trait
[09:15:26] <dbaupp> not a language support thing
[09:15:38] <ecl3ctic> does that ever get used implicitly? Don't you still have to invoke default()?
[09:17:23] <csherratt> you have to call default().
[09:17:35] <csherratt> but, it's pretty useful for placeholders.
[09:17:35] <bjz> dbaupp: I agree that the identity would be the most commonly used default, but we already have that constructor
[09:17:45] <ecl3ctic> so why have a default for matrices at all?
[09:18:00] <ecl3ctic> why not Matrix::newIdentity and Matrix::newZero
[09:18:07] <ecl3ctic> (I have no idea where the code is for this)
[09:18:11] <bjz> ecl3ctic: that's what we have
[09:18:17] <ecl3ctic> well then good :)
[09:18:53] <bjz> ecl3ctic dbaupp : sorry, for context: https://github.com/bjz/cgmath-rs/pull/19
[09:19:29] <csherratt> The reason It came up was that I needed a way to store the transform3D in an initiated state in fixed sized arrays in rust.
[09:19:42] <bjz> csherratt: ahh
[09:19:44] <csherratt> default() seems like the best way when it is a throwaway value
[09:19:55] <bjz> then tranform might need a default
[09:20:06] <bjz> but I definitely wouldn't autoderive it
[09:20:22] <bjz> or maybe it could also just have an identity
[09:20:30] <bjz> because that makes sense
[09:21:01] <bjz> the identity transformation should give the same transformation when concatenated with another
[09:21:16] <bjz> but there's still no reason to use Default
[09:21:20] <csherratt> well in my use case it could be initialized to static background radiation of the universe. Since it is just a place holder until I get a useful value.
[09:21:26] <ecl3ctic> yeah I really don't think a Default for a basic, generalized matrix makes sense
[09:21:47] <ecl3ctic> there are two equally valid defaults, so IMO it should have none
[09:22:37] * bjz Does not like Default, if anybody hasn't noticed
[09:22:58] <ecl3ctic> fwiw it hasn't won me over either
[09:23:10] <bjz> I don't even like Zero or One :P
[09:24:38] <ecl3ctic> chserratt: isn't there a trait to randomly fill a struct? :P
[09:24:48] <bjz> that makes sense
[09:24:50] <bjz> ohh
[09:24:55] <bjz> I get it
[09:24:56] <bjz> hah
[09:25:28] <csherratt> That would probably be a terrible idea for floats
[09:25:47] * bjz meant that he though Rng made sense
[09:25:58] <bjz> csherratt: well floats have their own impl
[09:26:13] <bjz> dbaupp did it I think
[09:26:29] *** Quits: jeaye (jeaye@moz-34FEF2BB.hsd1.ca.comcast.net) (Quit: zzz)
[09:26:50] <bjz> i doubt it would set it to a random set of bits
[09:34:59] <csherratt> hey bjz, with your new glfw changes have you had any problems with the callbacks?
[09:35:15] <csherratt> changes moving towards a channel based model.
[09:35:32] <bjz> csherratt: the PR I have open?
[09:35:38] <bjz> it's bitrotted
[09:35:43] <bjz> :(
[09:35:44] <csherratt> ah
[09:37:14] <csherratt> I was working with OpenCL before and it has callbacks too. I wanted to poke rust threads from one of the callbacks but with the runtime at the time if the thread was not created by the rust runtime, it would fail!() when you tried to use channels.
[09:37:51] <csherratt> with the changes to libnative and libgreen I think it could work now... which is kinda neat
[09:38:20] <csherratt> but wanted to see if anyone had tried something similar.
[09:45:32] *** Quits: diverse (diverse@moz-ED94B8D.oc.oc.cox.net) (Quit: WeeChat 0.4.2)
[09:49:08] <bjz> csherratt: yeah, acrichto was using channels with my trait objects in his emulator
[09:49:24] <csherratt> hmm
[09:49:26] <bjz> as in, just storing a channel in the trait object
[09:50:04] <bjz> which makes me wonder - why don't get rid of the trait objects and stor channels instead
[09:50:30] <bjz> then people can select over them
[09:51:01] <csherratt> it would be nice
[09:51:21] <bjz> man, this stuff takes so long to figure out
[09:51:49] <bjz> here am I in ground hog day with https://github.com/bjz/num-rs/blob/master/src/lib.rs
[09:52:41] <bjz> the plan is to make std::num more naive, and extra::num more based on algebraic structures
[09:53:18] <bjz> then cgmath could be based off the extra::num traits. Wouldn't affect it much though - would just mean shifting around a few things
[09:53:19] <dbaupp> bjz: yes, the Rand instance for floats isn't just a random bit pattern: uniformly random on [0, 1)
[09:53:28] <bjz> \o/
[09:55:15] <bjz> dbaupp: does that above explanation sound reasonable?
[09:55:44] <bjz> the current stuff is an ugly compromise
[09:57:12] <dbaupp> sorry, which explanation?
[09:58:41] <dbaupp> bjz: (fwiw, I think having a top level `op` function is peculiar, since `op` is such a generic word.)
[09:58:54] <bjz> ok
[09:59:22] <bjz> as in, about the plan to simplify std::num
[09:59:29] <dbaupp> from a brief glance, what you've got there is pretty nice
[09:59:50] <dbaupp> I think std::num should be the absolute minimum possible
[09:59:54] <bjz> yeah
[10:00:04] <dbaupp> i.e. operator overloading
[10:00:08] <bjz> I was thinking Num, Float Integer
[10:00:14] <dbaupp> and the type specific stuff
[10:00:19] <dbaupp> like floating point decoding
[10:00:23] <bjz> yes
[10:00:27] <bjz> oh ok
[10:00:39] <dbaupp> but I'm not really sure
[10:00:42] <bjz> no abs and friends?
[10:00:44] <dbaupp> ... it's easy to add to much
[10:00:47] <dbaupp> don't know
[10:01:00] <dbaupp> they seem fairly fundamental, so i'd lead toward yet
[10:01:01] <dbaupp> *yes
[10:01:03] <dbaupp> *lean
[10:01:17] <dbaupp> e.g. python has abs in scope by default
[10:01:47] <bjz> yeah, I think it would be painful not to have something like std::num::abs(x)
[10:02:07] <bjz> people would curse us
[10:02:10] <bjz> :P
[10:06:06] <bjz> dbaupp: any other names you can think of for the group operator?
[10:06:21] <csherratt> huh... speaking of fundamental instructions. is there really no way to do a bitwise not?
[10:07:26] <bjz> !x
[10:07:48] <bjz> csherratt^
[10:08:10] <csherratt> rusti: !0
[10:08:16] <dbaupp> bjz: implement support for unicode mathematics as identifiers
[10:08:27] * bjz wants |+|
[10:08:29] <dbaupp> bjz: :P
[10:09:00] <dbaupp> bjz: `op` seems fine when associated with the trait, but less fine when freestanding
[10:09:03] * dbaupp shrugs
[10:09:08] <dbaupp> doesn't matter particularly
[10:09:29] <dbaupp> you've had much more experience writing libraries that people use than I.

[10:19:33] <bjz> but some folks might be using rust-sdl here
[10:20:41] <doug> so you're saying that I should use rust-sdl or glfw-rs?

[10:22:11] <bjz> ohh
[10:22:26] <bjz> sFML, not sDL
[10:22:40] <bjz> yeah I have no idea if that's still being maintained
[10:22:54] <bjz> what is the most recent commit date?
[10:23:05] <doug> all I care about is getting a window up and displaying some 2d graphics
[10:23:22] <lurk_> bjz: 20 hours ago
[10:23:42] <bjz> oh cool
[10:23:56] <bjz> lurk_: have you used it? or did you just look it up?
[10:24:08] <lurk_> I just looked it up. I know nothing
[10:24:49] <bjz> heh
[10:27:27] <lurk_> I've only just begun using rust
[10:31:20] <doug> I'm trying glfw-rs now, and completed the "cmake .." step in the instructions
[10:31:42] <bjz> lurk_: neat!
[10:31:44] <doug> now I have a bunch of visual studio project files... that ok?
[10:31:52] <bjz> lurk_: for gamedev stuff?
[10:32:22] <bjz> doug: eek - is that the default on windows?
[10:32:39] <bjz> doug: eek - I thought it would give you makefiles
[10:33:01] <bjz> (which seems to be the default on osx/linux)
[10:35:08] <lurk_> bjz: Well... possibly eventually.
[10:35:39] <Ycros> cmake can generate various project types, vs project files probably are the default on win, maybe depending on what sort of cmake you're running 
[10:35:43] <bjz> doug: you might need to give cmake a flag to generate the makefiles
[10:36:04] <bjz> lurk_: oh well, that's cool

[11:13:37] <doug> i'm guessing editing the makefile is the easiest solution?
[11:18:04] <bjz> I really don't know the process of using cmake on windows :(
[11:18:07] <bjz> sorry
[11:19:02] <bjz> might you know jack?
[11:30:09] <zokier`> under mingw most stuff should behave very similar to that of linux. but i don't know specifics, this is one of the reasons i'm using linux right now
[11:31:40] * bjz finds *nix far easier

[11:35:57] <bjz> might be good to see if I could get him to write it down and put it in the readme
[11:36:08] <bjz> sorry doug :(
[11:36:20] <doug> i think i'm almost there
[11:36:33] <doug> i just can't figure out how to fix the linker error because i'm not familiar with make
[11:36:39] <bjz> unfortunately google might be your friend in this, at least on the weekend
[11:37:28] <bjz> doug: cmake might give you things you can configure when you generate the glfw-rs makefiles the first time
[11:37:32] <doug> and yes, mingw is the key

[11:39:42] <bjz> ideally you shouldn't have to fiddle with the makefile generated by cmake
[11:40:14] <zokier`> there probably is some flag to set cmake library search path to include the place where your glfw lib ended up

[12:09:08] <lurk_> I downloaded glfw and put the .a files into mingw's lib folder and it stopped erroring about not finding glfw3
[12:16:03] <bjz> lurk_: is this with your own project?
[12:16:29] <bjz> lurk_: you can use pkg-config to get the deps that glfw needs
[12:16:35] <lurk_> bjz: I'm trying to get glfw-rs to build on Windows
[12:16:41] <bjz> oh
[12:17:06] <bjz> ah yeah - saw the `c:/` now - oops
[12:17:11] <bjz> hm
[12:17:29] <lurk_> It seems I have to link to gdi32, but I have no ideas how to go about that
[12:19:18] <bjz> lurk_: yeah, this is my linking code: https://github.com/bjz/glfw-rs/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt#L27-L42
[12:19:44] <bjz> http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/build.html#build_link_win32
[12:22:01] <lurk_> well
[12:22:04] <lurk_> It didn't err
[12:22:16] <lurk_>     set(GLFW_STATIC_LDFLAGS -lglfw3;-lopengl32;-lgdi32)
[12:22:23] <lurk_> I added -lgdi32 to that line
[12:22:39] <bjz> so that works>
[12:22:41] <bjz> ?
[12:22:49] <lurk_> I think so. It produced a dll file
[12:23:12] <bjz> try building an example
[12:24:40] <lurk_> The program can't start because glfw-b34bcc5c-01.dll is missing from your computer.
[12:24:45] <lurk_> But I copied the dll into the directory
[12:24:47] <lurk_> and it ran
[12:24:48] <lurk_> I built cursor
[12:24:57] <lurk_> Whtie window. Stole my cursor
[12:25:12] <lurk_> I also used cmake -G "MSYS Makefiles" 
[12:25:16] <lurk_> I don't know if that's important
[12:25:31] <bjz> yeah, I should add that to the README
[12:25:32] <zokier`> sounds about right
[12:26:01] <bjz> sorry, it's hard to find help for improving the windows experience
[12:26:51] <bjz> I also think I might need to factor out the glfw finding thing into a FindGlfw3.txt thing, like cmake projects normally do
[12:27:03] <bjz> that way other people would be able to use it easier
[12:27:35] <lurk_> Compile on modes example
[12:27:39] <zokier`> a good binary distribution might help windows people, but to get there things need to stabilize a bit i imagine
[12:27:57] <bjz> is that always the answer :(
[12:28:03] <doug> lurk_ putting libglfw3.a into mingw's lib directory fixes the first problem
[12:28:30] <lurk_> doug: It did for me
[12:28:42] <lurk_> Although I don't think the examples are working correctly
[12:29:19] <lurk_> I'm getting "GLFW Error: The GLFW library is not initalized" messages and all the examples are just windows with white backgrounds

[16:05:52] <larsberg> that's a *weird* error... ugh
[16:14:00] <bjz> :(
[16:14:40] <bjz> larsberg: jack: so you are moving servo over to cmake?
[16:15:17] <jack> bjz: that is the current plan.
[16:15:30] <jack> although i don't want rust and servo to have different build systems really
[16:15:36] <bjz> :(
[16:15:50] <jack> so if they choose tup or something then we'd probably follow.
[16:15:55] <bjz> it's a shame CMake is sort of the best option
[16:16:02] <bjz> well, that I can see
[16:16:41] <bjz> the non-declarativeness is painful
[16:18:10] <Skrylar> no, no, no tup
[16:19:06] <jack> Skrylar: what do you have against tup?
[16:19:10] <Skrylar> tup's desire to monitor my system for any and all changes is madness, because there are certain vital flaws; one of which is that rust seems to like using weird hash names for outputs, and tup wants to know the name of every single file any build tool will ever touch (including temp caches, in the case of LaTeX)
[16:19:42] <jack> all build tools need to know the output file name, and we've fixed this in rust so that tup and cmake can know.
[16:20:11] <Skrylar> jack: doesn't address the cache file problem
[16:20:37] <Skrylar> e.g. tried to build pdftex files on windows, tup wouldn't ignore the miktex files, so it errored that some hash-named temp file wasn't in the Tupfile
[16:20:39] <jack> i haven't tried latex builds with tup so i wouldn't know. it didn't have any problem with the rust projects i tried.
[16:21:19] <Skrylar> and IIRC some people have issues because you need a special fuse plugin for tup on linux
[16:22:12] <jack> i believe they are removing FUSE
[16:22:21] <Skrylar> I used tup for some C code and I didn't actually mind it, its the reason i use git clean instead of make clean (he refuses to add a 'tup clean' last i touched it), but it had some aggrivating issues like the miktex cache problem
[16:24:21] <Skrylar> though nowadays i use Rake+Ninjabuild; admittedly I wouldn't mind a version of tup that didn't police the filesystem
[16:27:24] <Skrylar> jack: iirc tup doesn't offer config options though
[16:27:36] <Skrylar> there are a lot of choices for builders, but not very many for configs
[16:27:55] <Skrylar> cmake happens to do both, autoconf can be hijacked to output others
