[03:42:12] <cmr> acrichto: do you think the rt or linking changes are going to land tonight? I would like to hold off on TWiR for them if they are coming Real Soon Now.
[03:42:38] <acrichto> well I keep hoping they're gonna land, as in I keep thinking I fixed that "one last bug"
[03:42:45] <strcat> brson_: btw the nightly builds work again thanks to your fix
[03:42:50] <acrichto> and seeing how I've thought that every time now and alway sbeen wrong...
[03:42:52] <cmr> so no, got it :p
[03:43:00] * strcat should check if rusti magically started working again
[03:43:00] <acrichto> yeah sounds about right :)
[03:43:20] <strcat> acrichto: so I looked into fixing generic dtors more and it's a pretty hopeless cause
[03:43:26] <strcat> I figured out why my fixes weren't working
[03:43:34] <dbaupp> strcat: is https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/10237 rusti's bug?
[03:43:40] <acrichto> strcat: I saw that comment about typeck not doing as much work as it probably should
[03:43:48] <strcat> dbaupp: probably!
[03:43:58] <strcat> acrichto: well, typeck creates the tables based on calls in the AST
[03:44:05] <acrichto> dbaupp: oh I mean tto look indo that bug
[03:44:22] <acrichto> strcat: I wonder if we should just teach typeck to research destructors specifically
[03:44:30] <acrichto> but I'm not sure how difficult that would be
[03:44:32] <strcat> acrichto: it's really a pain, the whole thing is strange
[03:44:40] <strcat> it's structured to rely on resolving vtables in a 'context';
[03:44:49] <strcat> where the context is based on a function context (the caller, it seems)
[03:44:50] <acrichto> strcat: can you re-open that bugfix you found earlier for inlined destructors?
[03:44:57] <acrichto> if this is that large of a change, then we should fix that now
[03:45:03] <strcat> acrichto: yeah
[03:45:05] <acrichto> I'd love to start pushing raii and I think that it's an important step
[03:45:15] <acrichto> but can you add a comment to the function explaining that it should be removed?

[03:45:28] <acrichto> and maybe some info about why it's so difficult right now
[03:45:35] <strcat> well I think it will stay but it will call trans_fn_ref/trans_fn_ref_with_vtables
[03:45:41] <strcat> problem is that atm there's no way to get vtables
[03:45:51] <strcat> and also... if you replace it with trans_fn_ref it causes a segfault
[03:45:51] <acrichto> strcat: also thanks so much for looking into this, I would absolutely *love* to see this get fixed and I'm super happy that research is being done on it
[03:46:12] <acrichto> yeah a comment along the lines of that is perfectly fine I think
[03:46:25] <strcat> yeah I really wanted to implement allocators for rust-core...
[03:46:48] <acrichto> dbaupp: I really want that thing where rustdoc extracts code and runs it

[03:47:52] <dbaupp> and, yeah, testing docs would be very very nice.
[03:47:56] <strcat> cmr: it doesn't help yet
[03:47:58] <strcat> it helps mergefunc
[03:48:09] <strcat> it makes it not have to leave behind stubs when it merges
[03:48:09] <dbaupp> (landing the patch that activates the tests will be horrible...)
[03:48:18] <cmr> do we actually do any merging?
[03:48:26] <strcat> cmr: no not yet, it doesn't fully work yet
[03:48:37] <strcat> it works on the IR from libextra
[03:48:39] <strcat> but not libstd
[03:49:08] <acrichto> dbaupp: I think I've settled on the idea that all imports in examples should be relative to the library's name, so each code example should implicitly have "extern mod mylib"
[03:49:37] <acrichto> oh I thought the mergefunc business was the other way around, but I guess it doesn't matter much until it works on everything

[03:57:32] <strcat> most frustrating bug ever ;p
[03:57:42] <strcat> I finally realized that the table was missing the data...
[03:58:31] <acrichto> I can only imagine how long it took to find that
[03:58:52] <strcat> yeah I thought I was doing something wrong because there are so many incantations you need to get proper vtables in the first place
[03:58:54] <acrichto> perhaps nmatsakis or pcwalton will know an easy way to get that info
[03:59:11] <strcat> you have to get the self type, substitute the type parameters in it, resolve the self/trait vtables, substitute the type parameters in them properly
[03:59:29] <strcat> then trans_fn_ref does that all over again internally for default methods
[03:59:41] <acrichto> that sounds terrifying
[04:00:13] <strcat> acrichto: look in trans/callee.rs at resolve_default_method_vtables
[04:00:19] <strcat> that's the "fixup" function
[04:00:22] <strcat> it does all the work again :|
[04:00:34] <strcat> I don't really think there's a sane way to deal with it
[04:00:39] <strcat> rewriting librustc? ;p
[04:01:01] <acrichto> :(
[04:01:05] * strcat still doesn't really understand any of this, it seems to predate monomorphizing
[04:01:15] <strcat> 'understand' as in *why do we do this* ;p
[04:01:35] <strcat> I think it must be from the era before everything (except trait objects) was done statically
[04:01:58] <acrichto> I have a feeling trans is one of those places where things get written and very rarely updated
[04:02:05] <strcat> well this is more a typeck problem
[04:02:13] <strcat> trans is dealing with the mess typeck makes
[04:02:39] <acrichto> typeck is one giant black box to me
[04:02:43] <acrichto> code goes in, magic comes out
[04:02:46] <strcat> but anyway I now understand why those functions take the node id and why vtable lookups use a node id
[04:02:57] <strcat> because typeck generates "vtables" based on call sites
[04:03:21] <strcat> and "vtables" are static information for monomorphization *or* vtables for trait objects
[04:03:53] <strcat> acrichto: AST goes in, poorly mangled AST comes out ;p
[04:04:13] <strcat> it's very weird to have lookup tables based on call sites in the AST... at least to me
[04:04:33] <strcat> it does make sense, because trans walks over the same AST to generate most code
[04:04:35] <strcat> so it has those ids
[04:04:39] <strcat> except... not for dtors
[04:04:55] <strcat> or if we wanted to say, call some trait method implicitly
[04:05:00] <strcat> proper 'for' loop support
[04:05:06] <strcat> it wouldn't work
[04:05:25] <acrichto> hm perhaps typeck needs to get reorganized
[04:05:59] <Sharp> Is typeck the one with the 5000 line file that does everything?
[04:06:13] <strcat> well, a few files
[04:06:18] <strcat> but yes, it has some massive files/functions
[04:06:27] <strcat> when I removed the old for loops I got to delete some 1000 line functions
[04:06:31] <strcat> took a few commits to find them
[04:07:21] <strcat> acrichto: https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/4951 heh
[04:07:34] <strcat> not completely related
[04:08:00] <acrichto> hm that seems like the answer may be no
[04:08:20] <acrichto> especially if things like autoborrowing start calling methods on smart pointer
[04:09:03] <strcat> also went down a floating point rabbit hole
[04:09:09] <strcat> trying to add floating point env support to rust-core
[04:09:12] <strcat> turns out LLVM doesn't support it yet
[04:09:33] <strcat> https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/10186 :(
[04:09:59] <strcat> it considers a / b to be side effect free, for example
[04:10:06] <strcat> even though it can set a floating point exception
[04:10:08] * strcat sighs
[04:10:17] <Sharp> Isn't that the classic example of something you can't assume is side effect free? :)
[04:10:22] <acrichto> there are apparently many thinsg I don't know about floating point
[04:10:29] <strcat> acrichto: floating point is evil
[04:10:30] <strcat> ;p
[04:10:42] <strcat> acrichto: libc support for it is also a mess nearly everywhere
[04:10:49] <acrichto> that's all I've ever known about it
[04:11:07] <strcat> acrichto: so, in the olden days, some errors were set via errno
[04:11:13] <strcat> but the modern way is the floating point environment
[04:11:27] <strcat> there's an extra register on x86 as part of SSE with the floating point exception stuff
[04:11:31] <strcat> and I guess the rounding mode
[04:11:44] <strcat> so, when something like sqrt fails, it sets that
[04:11:49] <strcat> but glibc will also set errno
[04:12:10] <strcat> and LLVM totally ignores the state of the floating point env
[04:12:33] <strcat> and LLVM's sqrt intrinsic is marked readonly/readnone so it has undef behaviour if libc sets errno
[04:12:41] <acrichto> :(
[04:12:45] <strcat> because it will happily reorder it and clobber some other errno
[04:13:04] <strcat> so yeah. pretty hopeless to fix this in rust
[04:13:06] <Sharp> I feel like that might actually be a relatively easy fix on the LLVM side; can't you just tell it that whatever FP functions clobber that register, do?
[04:13:14] <Sharp> And it will do the rest/
[04:13:15] <Sharp> *?
[04:13:16] <strcat> until it's fixed in clang/LLVM we will have undef behaviour on nearly all floating point ops
[04:13:29] <strcat> Sharp: well, LLVM sort of has an effects system
[04:13:34] <strcat> readnone, readonly, nounwind
[04:13:40] <strcat> but that effects system is incomplete
[04:13:48] <Sharp> Oh.  Bah.
[04:13:49] <strcat> and they are willing to place performance over correctness until it is complete.
[04:14:08] <strcat> for example, there is no 'terminates' effect
[04:14:29] <strcat> LLVM will remove a call to a readonly/readnone/nounwind function if the result is unused
[04:14:36] <strcat> even if it loops forever.
[04:14:43] <strcat> so this is a bug in rust
[04:14:46] <strcat> we have -> !
[04:14:52] <Sharp> Ah, right.
[04:15:06] <strcat> but LLVM will remove calls to functions we say never return due to an infinite loop
[04:15:23] <strcat> (well -> ! is sort of irrelevant, it's just that it has memory safety implications)
[04:15:27] <Sharp> I would thin kthe correct solution would be to mark a result as used if it results in termination
[04:15:29] <Sharp> *think
[04:15:41] <strcat> well the correct solution is for LLVM to have a terminates attribute
[04:15:54] <Sharp> Or that.
[04:15:57] <strcat> and for LLVM to have an attribute for when something may read/write to the floating point env and so on
[04:16:10] <strcat> but until it does, they are fine with being incorrect
[04:16:21] <Sharp> Why doesn't it just have a list of clobber registers?  Or is the floating point environment just not in that list?
[04:16:23] <strcat> performance > correctness to them since C is already totally unsafe/broken ;p
[04:16:32] <strcat> Sharp: the IR just doesn't do that
[04:16:42] <Sharp> Weird.  It's in a lot of lower level IRs
[04:16:48] <strcat> it has readnone/readonly/nounwind/noreturn and that's basically the effects system
[04:17:07] <strcat> Sharp: http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#function-attributes
[04:17:51] <Sharp> Huh
[04:17:53] <Sharp> Weird.
[04:18:06] <Sharp> Seems like an oversight, almost.
[04:18:17] <strcat> caller/callee save registers are dealt with as part of the calling convention
[04:18:40] <Sharp> Conventionally you also have 'output' / clobber registers though
[04:18:43] <Sharp> That's what I'm surprised not to see
[04:18:45] <strcat> Sharp: well, LLVM is just that - a low level VM, much like C
[04:18:57] <strcat> it has an infinite number of virtual registers
[04:19:17] <Sharp> Right.  I was talking about the representation on which register allocation is done
[04:19:27] <strcat> codegen does register allocation
[04:19:27] <Sharp> Or around that time, probably
[04:19:30] <Sharp> Yeah
[04:19:37] <Sharp> The codegen layer usually knows about clobbers
[04:19:40] <strcat> codegen takes the IR and generates code
[04:19:42] <Sharp> I would think you should be able to pass that in from higher up
[04:19:49] <Sharp> Or it should be able to infer that
[04:19:50] <strcat> but 90% of optimizations are done on the pure IR
[04:19:53] <Sharp> From the instructions
[04:20:12] <Sharp> Yeah but this sort of thing should be specified in codegen IMO
[04:21:03] <Sharp> It's up to the IR to let you do something useful with it but codegen should at least know about it.
[04:24:48] <acrichto> strcat: you made me so happy, my email had "linkage" and "closed" in an email so I thought that the static linkage finally landed
[04:24:54] <acrichto> then I realized it was a different bug
[04:24:55] <strcat> lol
[04:24:56] <acrichto> and I was sad
[04:25:29] <acrichto> ok so #10237 passes if you don't print
[04:25:33] <acrichto> this is weird
[04:25:59] <acrichto> or if you just don't print in the loop...
[04:26:58] <acrichto> urgh rustdoc tests
[04:28:35] <acrichto> one of these days I'll land something

[04:29:38] <strcat> what is even the point?
[04:29:50] <acrichto> there was this fantasic vulnerability in all jits awhile ago
[04:29:54] <acrichto> b/c they use nan boxing
[04:30:06] <acrichto> where you could specify your own nan, creating an aribtrary js object
[04:30:31] <acrichto> basically it's scary that functions like that even exist

[04:31:31] * acrichto crosses fingers yet again
[04:31:48] <strcat> at least rust is more stable than shumway
[04:32:55] <acrichto> oh argh 10237 may be a uv bug
[04:35:26] <strcat> acrichto: well I was stracing it and it was doing invalid ioctl calls ;s
[04:36:05] <acrichto> strcat: https://gist.github.com/alexcrichton/7286802 hangs forever
[04:36:14] <acrichto> it's the uv_read_stop that's causing the problem I think
[04:36:24] <acrichto> we could also just totally not be using uv correctly
[04:37:53] <acrichto> oh wow they changed their api
[04:37:58] <acrichto> from our branch
[04:38:39] <cmr> heh
[04:38:51] <cmr> Are we not using libuv 1.0?
[04:39:05] <acrichto> I think they're on like 0.11.xxx
[04:39:07] <acrichto> or something like that
[04:40:05] <notmatt> 0.11 is libuv's dev branch, 0.10 is stable.
[04:40:33] <cmr> hm, I thought they released a stable abi.
[04:40:35] * notmatt 's glad to have a question to answer in here.
[04:40:43] <cmr> notmatt: are you a libuv dev?
[04:40:57] <notmatt> no, but at joyent, so I hear about progress a bit.
[04:41:11] <cmr> ahh
[04:41:14] <cmr> cool!
[04:41:18] <acrichto> sadface this may be a bug in libuv
[04:41:46] <cmr> Does Joyent want Rust ported to SmartOS or is that a personal project?
[04:42:14] <notmatt> cmr: mixed?
[04:42:25] <notmatt> I mean, they'll be happy about, but it's a personal project.
[04:42:32] <cmr> mm
[04:42:47] <brson> notmatt: <3 joyent. I'm glad to have you around and helping out :)
[04:43:13] <notmatt> brson: glad to hear it! I'll probably be asking more help than giving for a while, though. :)

[06:22:03] <acrichto> \o/ something finally landed!
[06:22:25] <cmr> \o/
[06:22:43] <cmr> I bet it's because bors got confused by DST, didn't notice ti was one of *your* PRs
[06:23:17] <acrichto> haha
[06:23:27] <dbaupp> acrichto: it only took 6 goes... are you sure it actually landed and bors isn't just tricking you?
[06:23:29] <acrichto> oh man I just gained an hour!
[06:23:53] <acrichto> dbaupp: I am apparently terrible at landing things
[06:24:23] <acrichto> jeez 9901 took like 30 tries on bors
[06:24:27] <acrichto> I need to get better at this
[06:24:32] <dbaupp> acrichto: well, most of them are "change all the files", so it's acceptable. :P
[06:24:39] <acrichto> haha
[06:24:57] <acrichto> the last failure of rt-improvements I had already fixed, but I accidentally obliterated somehow
[06:25:16] <acrichto> I've got like 5 different workspaces across 3 vms/computers and I think I occasionally get things out of sync
[06:25:17] <cmr> acrichto: you know, we have `try`
[06:25:24] <acrichto> cmr: I really should use that more often
[06:25:34] <dbaupp> cmr: who needs try when you have bors and 'r=...'
[06:25:36] <acrichto> I'm actually really glad we have bors

[06:26:16] <dbaupp> (at least, they did for me.)
[06:26:27] <acrichto> haha that conflicted with rt-improvemens
[06:29:26] <strcat> acrichto: https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/10244 r?
[06:30:04] <strcat> fixes this lint
[06:30:05] <acrichto> llvm accepts that?
[06:30:06] <strcat> Unusual: Return statement in function with noreturn attribute
[06:30:08] <strcat>   ret void
[06:30:09] <acrichto> ah
[06:30:11] <strcat> acrichto: well it's fine either way
[06:30:13] <strcat> but it whines
[06:30:18] <acrichto> strcat: could you throw a comment in there?
[06:30:25] <strcat> yeah
[06:30:25] <acrichto> just // no return b/c llvm lint doesn't like it
[06:30:33] <strcat> well, because it's not needed :)
[06:31:33] <acrichto> can you use externfn to declare more than one function?
[06:31:56] <strcat> acrichto: added comment
[06:32:12] <strcat> I am 99% sure that it doesn't need to insert unreachable, we'll see (still in stage0 land)
[06:33:04] <strcat> you know, it'd be nice to just return the LLVM function as the intrinsic...
[06:33:05] <strcat> heh
[06:33:25] <acrichto> that works for a lot of them
[06:33:27] <acrichto> just not all of them
[06:33:37] <acrichto> #[link_name = "llvm.trap"] fn trap() -> !;
[06:34:06] <dbaupp> acrichto: no, externfn only works for one
[06:34:21] <acrichto> well hopefully we won't need externfn soon anyway
[06:35:11] <strcat> acrichto: does that actually work?
[06:35:16] <strcat> right now
[06:35:29] <strcat> seems bad to expose that we use LLVM as a rust feature
[06:36:12] <acrichto> strcat: I tried awhile back to use that for rust intrinsics b/c it involved less compiler voodoo
[06:36:17] <acrichto> didn't end up landing it though
[06:39:03] <strcat> acrichto: meh, yeah
[06:39:06] <strcat> need to insert unreachable
[06:40:00] <acrichto> feel free to r=e
[06:40:02] <acrichto> r=me*
[06:54:59] <Luqman> man, llvm is very well suited to parallel building.

[07:13:45] <Luqman> sweet, optimized builds on arm work now
[07:14:41] <acrichto> nice!
[07:16:46] <dbaupp> strcat: how does moving some functions around improve compile/run-time performance ( https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/10008 )? or is there more to that issue than just moving, say, std::unstable::intrinsics::sinf32 to std::f32?
[07:17:00] <strcat> dbaupp: because atm we wrap them all 
[07:17:28] <strcat> consider 'extern "rust-intrinsic" { pub fn foo() }' vs. the same thing wrapped in #[inline] fn foo() { intrinsics::foo() }
[07:17:43] <strcat> and now remember that we end up with 20000 of these for each generic instantiation of lots of low-level bits
[07:18:07] <strcat> it was one of the low hanging fruit in acrichto 26k lines of IR for task::try thing ;p
[07:18:21] <dbaupp> oh, so it does involve exposing them directly as well? (we'd need an #[safe], presumably)
[07:18:36] <strcat> dbaupp: yeah, for safe ones
[07:18:54] <strcat> dbaupp: https://github.com/thestinger/rust-core/blob/master/core/mem.rs
[07:18:54] <dbaupp> obviously :P
[07:19:14] <strcat> I think I have a bug open requesting #[safe]
[07:19:23] <strcat> https://github.com/thestinger/rust-core/blob/master/core/f64.rs really need it here...
[07:20:19] <acrichto> strcat: would 10008 be fixed pretty much by #[safe] ?
[07:20:26] <acrichto> b/c that's what it sounds like at least to me
[07:20:35] <strcat> well it means removing std::unstable::intrinsics too
[07:20:48] <acrichto> how come?
[07:20:56] <strcat> because atm we have lots of wrappers
[07:20:58] <strcat> cast::transmute
[07:21:01] <strcat> mem::size_of
[07:21:04] <strcat> they call through to the intrinsic
[07:21:09] <strcat> and they're generic
[07:21:15] <acrichto> in theory all the wrappers could just be "pub use transmute = unstable::intrinsics::transmute"
[07:21:26] <strcat> right, but that looks bad in the docs ;p
[07:21:29] <acrichto> it is really nice to have all the wrappers in one place
[07:21:33] <strcat> acrichto: why?
[07:21:36] <acrichto> that's a different problem though
[07:21:48] <strcat> it's nice to not re-declare them everywhere like we used to
[07:21:53] <acrichto> I suppose that's from a compiler implementor's point of view rather than a library's
[07:22:04] <strcat> yeah it might be nice for people working on librustc
[07:22:12] <strcat> but it's not that hard to grep for 'rust-intrinsic'
[07:22:19] <strcat> and it makes the low-level bits of the stdlib a pain
[07:22:42] *** Quits: notmatt (notmatt@moz-9FB2565E.vc.shawcable.net) (Client exited)
[07:23:00] <acrichto> hm I like the idea of less codegen, but I think we'd want to talk about splitting up the intrinsics module again
[07:23:15] <strcat> it wasn't ever split u[p
[07:23:17] <acrichto> and I think that the codegen problem may be a fairly compelling argument
[07:23:17] <strcat> up*
[07:23:26] <strcat> they were just re-declared at every use site
[07:23:42] <acrichto> hm, I guess that's what code review is for
[07:23:48] <acrichto> also I think I'd rather not have #[safe]
[07:23:59] <acrichto> b/c then all declarators of the intrinsic would need #[safe]
[07:24:06] <acrichto> it'd be better if we recognized certain intrinsics as being safe
[07:24:08] <acrichto> automatically
[07:24:31] <acrichto> but that may be difficult in the short-term
[07:27:49] <acrichto> round #8 for rt-improvements, and now is when I sleep
[07:30:09] <strcat> acrichto: I think that might be easy
[07:30:17] <strcat> and it's a better idea
[07:30:24] <strcat> we can type-check safety as part of intrinsics
[07:30:35] <strcat> just force people to declare them with the right safety
[07:30:48] <dbaupp> fwiw, resolve hardcodes things in extern to unsafe_fn.

[23:01:52] <acrichto> I haven't heard from them in a bit, I was gonna ping them soon about it again
[23:02:28] <pcmattman> cool, no worries.
[23:04:04] <pcmattman> all the stuff that already exists to handle forking errors rather than exec errors should (theoretically) pick up new errors returned from spawn already
[23:04:10] <pcmattman> so that's a plus

[23:04:34] <acrichto> yeah it's a pretty small patch to libuv, I think it's mostly the semantics that are under debate
[23:05:09] <pcmattman> yup, and I suppose there's general concerns over code that already uses the callback to handle errors
[23:10:26] <acrichto> pcmattman: they just say they need to talk it over a bit more
[23:11:34] <pcmattman> fair enough :) just thought I'd check in and see how things were in the land of libuv
[23:14:25] <pcmattman> fwiw in the next couple of weeks I'm hoping to set up a basic Windows environment on which I can build Rust, not sure how much love that side gets
