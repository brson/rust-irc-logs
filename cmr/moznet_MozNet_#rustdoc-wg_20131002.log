[03:34:14] <SiegeLord> The code listings for structs and enums used to have links in them... but now they are gone
[03:34:17] <SiegeLord> Are they coming back?
[03:38:27] <SiegeLord> Like the variants here: http://siegelord.github.io/RustGnuplot/doc/gnuplot/options/enum.PlotOption.html
[03:38:51] <SiegeLord> It'd be nice if they were links to the variant descriptions below (which I figured was the intention back when they were non-functioning links)

[17:39:11] <acrichto> Seldaek: do you have an example of the highlighting changes?
[17:39:37] <Seldaek> not really I just dev'd it in chrome dev tools :p
[17:39:40] <Seldaek> but I can screenshot
[17:39:50] <acrichto> hmm I'd rather play around with it for a second
[17:40:49] <Seldaek> http://d.pr/i/kiEP
[17:41:06] <Seldaek> it's very simple
[17:41:25] <Seldaek> highlights line or ranges of line with X-Y
[17:41:30] <cmr> Oh, fancy
[17:42:04] <Seldaek> I didn't test the rustdoc change though because it won't build with my 0.8 but I assume it'll work
[17:42:59] <acrichto> Seldaek: at the bottom of the page it no longer has a black bar all the way across the pre elements
[17:43:05] <acrichto> just the code, not the line numbers, was that intentional?
[17:44:23] <acrichto> that also may have been there before
[17:44:32] <acrichto> oh nvmd it changed
[17:45:27] <Seldaek> acrichto: yeah it's not perfect ideally the whole rendering would have to be tweaked I think
[17:45:42] <acrichto> how?
[17:45:45] <Seldaek> but I fixed the immediate issue hwich is if you have a narrow window (or the code is wide), it wraps and then the line numbers don't match anymore
[17:46:24] <Seldaek> I guess there should be a container around the whole thing with the border and the overflow:auto
[17:46:34] <Seldaek> but it's not a huge deal 
[17:46:43] <acrichto> I like htat it doesn't throw off the line numbers though
[17:46:45] <acrichto> that's cool
[17:46:47] <Seldaek> I mean it's just to make that black bar thing a bit nicer when it scrolls
[17:46:56] <Seldaek> but I can work on that another time
[17:47:02] <Seldaek> just wanted to fix the bad bug 
[17:47:34] <Seldaek> anyway  Ihave to leave for lunch now
[17:47:45] <Seldaek> might be back online later
[17:48:01] <Seldaek> feel free to merge it in your upcoming fixes if you got some
[17:49:02] <cmr> Seldaek: Are you working on merging the new search?
