[16:35:37] <edunham> Manishearth: taking the question of an rm -rf on doc.r-l.o over here: doc.r-l.o is the misleading name of the nginx proxy. Due to some nginx hax in https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edunham/toy-ansible/master/roles/proxy/files/sites-enabled/doc.rust-lang.org , files that appear on the web at http://doc.rust-lang.org/ are actually served from the doc/master folder of the static-rust-lang-org s3 bucket. 
[16:35:56] <Manishearth> edunham: sure, but we should clean it :)
[16:36:09] <edunham> I am reluctant to blindly nuke the master folder, beacuse as I understand it, this would mean we had no docs publicly available for however long it took to build next
[16:36:22] <Elaine> we've been purposefully keeping old docs too I thought.
[16:36:26] <Elaine> for old releases, I mean.
[16:36:40] <Manishearth> Elaine: this is different
[16:36:47] <Elaine> Why?
[16:36:48] <edunham> Elaine: we have folders with a snapshot of the docs at each release
[16:36:50] <Manishearth> Elaine: old doc pages which no longer exist still hang around with new docs
[16:36:59] <Elaine> Oh, that particular issue
[16:37:01] <Manishearth> Elaine: e.g. rustc/middle/ty.rs
[16:37:06] <Manishearth> and friends
[16:37:18] <Elaine> I was pretty sure in your links earlier that they were the same path but I guess not
[16:37:21] <Manishearth> the ones online are month-old copies
[16:37:40] <Manishearth> Elaine: one was a link to my internals docs
[16:37:46] <Manishearth> which showed the newer version
[16:37:51] <edunham> Manishearth: could you give me the full url to that file which should be gone but isn't?
[16:38:54] <Manishearth> edunham: doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/middle/ty/enum.sty.html
[16:39:04] <Manishearth> though the whole rustc/ folder probably shouldn't exist?
[16:39:10] <Manishearth> ditto for all other internals crates
[16:39:14] <Manishearth> *internal
[16:39:15] <edunham> yeah, no kidding
[16:39:45] <Manishearth> edunham: how do we copy from the build dir to the proxied dir now?
[16:39:48] <edunham> there is no rustc folder in the S3 bucket, only rustc_unicode
[16:39:53] <Manishearth> wha
[16:39:59] * edunham digs in the proxy rules to see if it's getting served from elsewhere
[16:40:04] <Manishearth> so ... how
[16:40:05] <Manishearth> magic
[16:40:10] <edunham> other possibility is that a Cloudfront invalidation didn't go out correctly
[16:40:59] <Manishearth> edunham: oh, side note, would it be possible to serve internals docs too? I do it with rust-internals-docs (it's a single configure flag when building), but it would be nice to have an official /internals page
[16:41:11] <Manishearth> build them with the nightlies or something
[16:41:26] <Manishearth> lint-writers and those contributing to the compiler would find it useful :)
[16:41:54] <edunham> hmm I see no compelling reason against it
[16:42:10] <steveklabnik> we've wanted to do it, just needs infra work
[16:42:14] <Manishearth> steveklabnik was also for it, just that  I didn't get around to poking anyone or PRing to buildbot
[16:42:18] <Manishearth> oh he's here too
[16:42:20] <Manishearth> o/
[16:42:21] <steveklabnik> :)
[16:42:22] <steveklabnik> heyyy
[16:42:26] <steveklabnik> i wasn't till like yesterday
[16:42:54] *** ChanServ sets mode: +o edunham
[16:44:12] <edunham> oh ok, sounds like a good way for me to learn the intricacies of how we build docs :D
[16:44:15] <Manishearth> heh
[16:44:26] <Manishearth> edunham: hold on, the conf flag is
[16:44:38] * edunham has stolen today back out of the whirlwind of OSCON to actually get useful things done, and this sounds like a very useful thing
[16:45:58] <Manishearth> edunham: --compiler-docs
[16:46:28] <Manishearth> CFG_ENABLE_COMPILER_DOCS
[16:46:34] <Manishearth> --enable-compiler-docs I guess
[16:47:09] <Manishearth> edunham: oh, also, gave you op in this room since you hang around here way more than any of us do, hope you don't mind :)
[16:47:45] <edunham> Manishearth: thanks! tbh I've coopeted it as my own quiet channel where I can quiz people on infra things and have it not scroll off my screen immediately
[16:47:51] <edunham> *coopted
[16:48:03] <Manishearth> haha
[16:48:11] <Manishearth> yeah, #rust-internals can be noisy sometimes
[16:48:26] <edunham> yeah, it just scrolls fast, because there are important compiler arguments to be had
[16:48:42] <Manishearth> I accidentally summoned compiler arguments into #servo today :P

[16:56:52] <Elaine> brson: so how should I setup buildbot? any particular version etc?
[16:57:36] <edunham> Elaine: context? are you setting up a Buildbot for your own use, or a buildslave for Rust stuff?
[16:57:44] <brson> Elaine: clone this repo and follow these instrs https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-buildbot#slave-configuration
[16:57:48] <Elaine> A powerpc snapshot builder.
[16:57:58] <Elaine> brson: cool, thanks.
[16:58:03] <edunham> ah, awesome.
[16:58:15] <brson> edunham: I kinda promised Elaine they could add a buildslave
[16:58:19] <Elaine> heh
[16:58:33] <Elaine> I'm still a bit away from having reproducible snapshot creation.
[16:59:10] <edunham> brson: that's probably excellent -- I like it when things are other peoples' problem!
[17:04:21] <brson> edunham: what's the state of your puppet scripts? I've been daydreaming about putting together a collection of vagrant environments and want to ues your stuff if possible
[17:05:48] <edunham> brson: Ansible, and the state is looks about right but not well tested
[17:06:26] <edunham> If scripts+instructions for setting up a local, virtualized copy of our infrastructure using Vagrant would be useful to you, I can make those happen probably this week
[17:16:19] <brson> edunham: Awesome. I want that. No rush though.
