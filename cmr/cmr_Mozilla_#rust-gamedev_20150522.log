[01:12:02] <kvark> all the new people coming to rust gamedev - your fresh look is invaluable, since we've been swimming here for a while and may be less objective w.r.t the clarity of the interfaces
[01:12:21] <kvark> if you feel that something could/should be done better/simpler - shoot out, we'll hear you with pleasure
[01:13:09] <aatch> kvark, as a new-ish comer to Rust gamedev, but not Rust itself, I'd say that higher-level documentation would be invaluable.
[01:13:43] <kvark> aatch: like what? general overview of the crates/projects and their dependencies?
[01:13:48] <aatch> kvark, there's often multiple ways to perform some task and it's not always obvious what the best was is.
[01:14:13] <kvark> aatch: where, for example?
[01:14:25] <aatch> kvark, personally, I found the stuff in gfx around `Factory`s and `Canvas`s somewhat confusing.
[01:15:13] <kvark> well, Canvas is gone, for one
[01:15:18] <kvark> is Factory alone confusing? :)
[01:15:45] <aatch> kvark, not sure, I haven't played around with it for a while.
[01:16:27] <kvark> extending your suggestion, I think we need a blog post about what a command buffer is, why it is a first-class citizen, and how you are expected to use it
[01:16:47] <aatch> I guess the best way of explaining it is that a "Rust Game Development Cookbook" would be useful. How to perform various non-trivial but common operations.
[01:16:47] <kvark> but before writing this, I've got to make a demo where multi-threaded command buffer construction is shown, at least
[01:19:10] <aatch> The examples help, but they only show how to do what the example is doing, it's not always obvious how you extend it to what you want to achieve.
[01:21:14] <aatch> Once I started to get my head around how everything worked, it was pretty easy to work with. It's just the initial introduction is pretty punishing.
[01:21:36] <kvark> so basically, a "getting started" tutorial is missing?
[01:21:51] <cmr> maybe no "getting started" but a conceptual overview with motivation?
[01:22:17] <cmr> *not
[01:22:27] *** Joins: fkaa (tundmatu@moz-501od2.business.telia.com)
[01:22:41] <aatch> Yeah, that sounds better. With so much functionality spread across multiple crates, it's hard to get a grip on what's going on.
[01:22:55] <kvark> cmr: still a problem to have docs updated with the code at all times
[01:23:15] <kvark> cmr: I mean, not auto-generated docs, but the hand-written ones
[01:23:20] <cmr> Right
[01:23:44] <cmr> It is a problem, but at the same time, "What is a command buffer? How do I talk to the GPU? Why do I do it this way?" doesn't always need code
[01:24:11] <aatch> I just think that if *I* struggled at first, it's going to be very difficult for others. I mean, I dealt with the lack of documentation in early Rust by reading the compiler code.

[04:29:05] <tomaka_> two, for some reason this happens even without any apparent modification
[04:29:46] <tomaka_> my opinion is that there's probably a hidden .git file or something that is touched when cargo does its stuff
[04:29:57] <tomaka_> which triggers the build script being rerun
[04:30:48] <tomaka_> this does not happen when you don't have a build script, because cargo tracks the modifications only on the .rs files used by rustc
[04:31:26] <tomaka_> but since cargo doesn't know which files a build script uses, it has to rerun it at every change

[04:57:38] <cmr> mostly only because of XInput on Windows - it doesn't expose events at all
[04:57:39] <tomaka_> What's a "Checkout"?
[04:57:57] <cmr> It's from the `pool` crate, it's basically an arena.
[04:58:07] <cmr> a Checkout<T> will return the allocation to the pool when it's dropped.
[04:58:30] <cmr> the idea being that you're probably polling the joystick every frame, but not holding onto the polled data for longer than the frame.
[04:58:36] <cmr> so it can avoid all allocations except one.
[04:58:48] <cmr> it's an optimization, it could be removed, but... it seems pretty easy.
[04:59:05] <tomaka_> ok
[04:59:15] <tomaka_> so yeah I'd prefer if joysticks were outside of "Window"
[04:59:19] <tomaka_> just like monitors are
[04:59:24] <tomaka_> if that makes sense
[04:59:38] <cmr> It does, I'll move it.
[05:01:03] <cmr> One possibility too is exposing both a "poll" and event-based interface, and emulating one in terms of the other on platforms where only one is supported.

[05:02:20] <cmr> I think event support it might also be per-device on platforms where USB HID is exposed directly (Windows Raw Input, OS X, the BSDs)
[05:02:31] <tomaka_> I'm wondering if it would be a good idea to have an entirely freestanding "get_joystick_events()" function that would handle NewJoystick events and all individual events
[05:02:41] <cmr> I think so.
[05:02:52] <cmr> It's an entirely different event source than the Window in most cases.
[05:03:24] <tomaka_> yeah
[05:05:01] <tomaka_> is the "hat" really distinguished from an axis?
[05:05:04] <tomaka_> is the APIs?
[05:05:28] <tomaka_> in the APIs*
[05:05:40] <cmr> Yes, unfortunately.
[05:06:28] <cmr> Oh, there are also "balls"
[05:06:31] <cmr> that I forgot about.
[05:06:35] <cmr> will have to add those.

[17:52:00] <csherratt> kvark: have you thought much about how input polling / window owning should be done with gfx-rs? most of the gfx_window_glfw for example will own the window object which means you have to do the polling on the same thread that does the GL calls.
[17:52:36] <aepsil0n> yes, i know, but when i do that, the code is specific to glutin (not a big issue, but i think it could be done generically)

[18:01:00] <bvssvni2> perhaps PistonWindow can implement gfx::Window?
[18:01:02] <csherratt> in SM I solved it by using glfw's RenderContext. But that does not allow you to read the size of the frame buffer since that not portable.
[18:01:26] <kvark> bvssvni2: sure ;) but that would require it to be aware of gfx

[18:07:09] <csherratt> So we basically solve this issue by letting the window do the window things, and keyboard / mouse input do its own thing?
[18:07:36] <kvark> what about window move/resize events though?..
[18:08:06] <bvssvni2> https://github.com/PistonDevelopers/piston/issues/884
[18:08:44] <bvssvni2> I think window move/resize can be polled through window as usual, since it won't affect gameplay
[18:08:59] <csherratt> Well, unless UI widgets are placed by the resolution.
[18:09:02] <bvssvni2> it's also nice to have keyboard/mouse on the window
[18:09:28] <bvssvni2> ui widgets can use events polled from the window, gameplay can use independent library
[18:10:07] <csherratt> I think this will work.

[18:14:38] <csherratt> 120 sounds right. I was thinking 100, just because 10ms is a nice round number.
[18:15:05] <bvssvni2> the frame rate is 60 fps, so the idea is to double it
[18:15:49] <csherratt> Well, 120 and 144hz screens are not uncommon. and The rift runs at 90hz.

[20:18:43] <kvark> jpernst: wow thanks! glad you liked it ;) if you are doing anything more complex that a couple of sprites, consider looking at gfx_scene as well (https://github.com/kvark/slides/raw/master/GFX_HighLevel_RustTorontoMeetup.pdf)
[20:20:45] <kvark> w.r.t. gfx_device_gl, we'd like to support anything GL-2+. There are problems reported on virtual machines (that have FBO by extension only), which are partially addressed. Any further fixing will not affect the API though, so no need to worry about
[20:21:15] <jpernst> yeah, i remember doing some gl dev in vmware and had problems
[20:22:09] <jpernst> that reminds me, is ES also supported, or just standard gl?
[20:22:11] <fkaa> kvark: reading about shadowmapping, looks like there're new techniques coming out left and right
[20:22:45] <jpernst> i'm not too concerned about mobile at this point, but it's always nice to have the option
[20:23:54] <fkaa> also lots of matrix math :(
[20:26:33] <kvark> jpernst: ES is not fully supported yet.  Some stuff remains to be done (https://github.com/gfx-rs/gfx-rs/issues/641), but aaron was able to hack it to run so that's a good sign ;)

[20:30:33] <kvark> one thing I realized while building the example is how easier it would be to use gfx_scene for it...
[20:31:15] <kvark> like, there are scenes, entities, lights, and even techniques, I just have to do them without the convenient abstractions (not to mention the absence of ordering and culling)

[20:32:45] <kvark> the WIP is here (https://github.com/kvark/gfx_examples/tree/shadow/src/shadow) but nothing to show off quite yet.  Just a bunch of cubes, a plane, and simple lighting
[20:32:53] <fkaa> or is the forking more than submitting commands

[20:33:41] <tomaka> kvark: is there a situation where you'd put multiple data types in the same buffer object?
[20:33:54] <tomaka> like the first half of the buffer contains vertices, and the second half indices
[20:33:58] <kvark> fkaa: I'd like to see a per improvement, but I can't guarantee there is going to be a huge one. fork-join model is (obviously) sub-optimal, and I may need to adjust the parameters (like, the number of shadow casters) to see the benefit
[20:34:38] <kvark> tomaka: I didn't have the need for heterogeneous buffers ever, no
[20:35:00] <tomaka> thanks
[20:35:28] <fkaa> the only reason for that would be to avoid gl's binding model, and most AAA engines do dx which doesn't have that i think
[20:35:37] <fkaa> (correct me if i'm wrong, making a lot of assumptions there :p)
[20:35:38] <kvark> fkaa: never know until you try and measure. At least, we can validate the statement that gfx-rs supports multi-threading

[21:47:51] <RCIX> ah ha
[21:47:59] <RCIX> as much as a gl wrapper inrigues me
[21:48:10] <RCIX> im going to be a bit more product focused and try piston first

[21:55:16] <kvark> RCIX: the good thing about piston + gfx (maybe glium too, but I don't know) is that you can draw gfx stuff on the side while using piston's graphics at the same time.
[21:55:53] <kvark> so you are not enclosing yourself in a cage, basically, there is always a way around

[22:05:11] <RCIX> im used to sprite based drawing for the most part (xna background) but I'm sure it isn't /that/ hard to branch out given the tools 
[22:05:20] <kvark> RCIX: now that I think about it, maybe all the backends support direct operations outside of Piston, I dunno. In any way, if you are just starting, you don't need to select a graphics backend and settle on it, you can switch at any point
[22:08:45] <RCIX> cool, yeah i want to do more stuff with non sprites
[22:08:52] <RCIX> figured id start on familiar ground though
[22:14:24] <kvark> this game uses piston heavily, it seems: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/17256312/reforge_screenies/reforge_screeny6.png
[22:14:39] <kvark> so I guess the sprite support is in place

[23:48:06] <RCIX> okay, i have a question
[23:48:42] <RCIX> in my piston-engine game, why would I not want to do /all/ my draw work in the self.gl.draw call in render
