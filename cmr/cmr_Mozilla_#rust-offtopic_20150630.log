[00:00:13] <zofrex> Tiffany: really? that seems wrong
[00:00:17] <Tobba> MS would never be stupid enough to try it though, considering it'd be instantly re-burning every bridge to the opensource community
[00:00:20] <aatch> The thing is, disabling flash and removing the biggest source of unique data didn't actually change how unique my finger print is.
[00:00:31] <Tiffany> I imagine it's usually strictly en-US or strictly en-GB, zofrex
[00:00:54] <aatch> There's a lot of stuff worrying about the Oracle vs. Google decision.
[00:01:29] <zofrex> oh I get what you mean
[00:01:59] <zofrex> aatch: I guess that's because as well as certain pieces being very identifying on their own, there are several things that are common but not common in that exact combination
[00:02:17] <Tiffany> is google going to have to pay royalties to oracle?
[00:02:37] <Tiffany> for building an open source OS, which is probably the largest source of java jobs in existence...
[00:02:44] <brandonson> Tiffany: google still is going to attempt a fair use defense, according to EFF.

[00:05:14] <Elaine> it was for a bit this morning, at least.
[00:06:32] <niconii> gah, i'm identifiable solely by my system fonts alone
[00:06:48] <WindowsBunny> bstrie: [insert conspiracy theory]
[00:06:59] <bstrie> if APIs are copyrightable that seems bad for open source. if you don't have a CLA that grants copyright to the repo, then anyone can contribute a new API but then later sue people for using that API, it seems
[00:07:22] <niconii> "Your browser fingerprint appears to be unique among the 5,520,644 tested so far."
[00:07:23] <Elaine> niconii: disable flash and java! click-to-enable!
[00:07:33] <niconii> and my system fonts are listed as 1 in 5520644
[00:08:03] <bstrie> we'll need new licenses that grant the freedom to use APIs, just as apache2 added language for granting the freedom to use patents
[00:08:04] <Tiffany> yeah this seems completely untenable, bstrie
[00:08:25] <niconii> Elaine: probably a good idea, i used to have it set like that but didn't do that with this computer for some reason
[00:08:41] <bstrie> Tiffany: CLAs make it possible today, but it's a blow
[00:09:03] <bstrie> anyway, google might still win this on fair use
[00:09:29] <bstrie> in court it could be argued that if you contribute a new API to an open source project, then their use of it falls under fair use
[00:09:33] <bstrie> but I have no idea how defensible that argument is

[00:15:33] <zofrex> in the name of intellectual honesty I withdraw my accusation of brigading, after checking my logs it turns out the goobergabbers were there the whole time :(
[00:15:43] <zofrex> the call is coming from inside the house!
[00:16:41] <bstrie> so, I think the hilarious thing is that for a long time now various internet randos have been calling on google to replace android on java with go
[00:17:00] <bstrie> but if push came to shove and google had to ditch java on android, they'd really use dart instead of go
[00:17:28] <zofrex> I'd be ok with anything that involved burning the entirety of Activity.java and starting over, honestly
[00:17:52] <bstrie> or, interestingly, maybe even javascript
[00:18:10] <zofrex> 6000 lines of code! in one class!
[00:18:38] <FreeFull> The entire program, in one class
[00:18:42] <WindowsBunny> zofrex: lolwut
[00:19:02] <bstrie> you know what, actually, I don't think it is entirely implausible that google would make javascript a first-class language on android
[00:19:12] <bstrie> it sounds kooky, and it is kooky, but it's entirely plausible
[00:19:15] <zofrex> admittedly a lot of that is comments
[00:19:18] <WindowsBunny> bstrie: They should support Rust :D
[00:19:23] <zofrex> the class declaration is on line 660
[00:20:17] <bstrie> WindowsBunny: rust as the primary language for android development is even less likely than go as the primary language for android development :P
[00:20:31] <WindowsBunny> aji: lol, that article
[00:20:52] <WindowsBunny> that said, what does bsdgirl have to do with #freebsd? o_0
[00:21:28] <zofrex> clue's in the name
[00:21:28] <bstrie> I think you're looking too closely into the motives of teenagers
[00:21:58] <zofrex> I'd like to thank google auto-correct for turning "bsdgirl" into "badgirl"
[00:22:05] <zofrex> so that's now in the history on my work laptop
[00:22:50] <c74d> what history?
[00:23:15] <zofrex> Elaine: thanks for the password hashing link btw, interesting project and I hadn't heard of it
[00:23:31] <c74d> Google histories are mutable
[00:23:39] <bstrie> Tiffany: so it looks like the FSF argues that the GPL means that copyrights can't be enforced on APIs, so there's at least one license already set
[00:23:58] <Elaine> zofrex: np.
[00:24:06] <bstrie> Tiffany: of course, the FSF is trying parley this into making it so that google is forced to GPL android
[00:24:30] <WindowsBunny> bstrie: So is it specifically copyrighted so that you cannot implement an API itself?
[00:24:34] <bstrie> Tiffany: (the backstory being that Sun released OpenJDK under GPL, and hence all APIs)
[00:24:38] <WindowsBunny> or are other uses of the API copyrighted as well?
[00:25:04] <Tiffany> heh
[00:25:13] <brandonson> bstrie: GPL'd android would be weird.  wouldn't that force OEMs to opensource their stuff too?
[00:25:23] <WindowsBunny> lol, would be funny if it turned out oracle couldn't copyright the APIs due to OpenJDK
[00:25:23] <bstrie> I dunno how linking works on android
[00:26:05] <bstrie> or how GPL applies to java jars, even
[00:26:06] <zofrex> you compile the android apps against android.jar which is 100% stubs of the real android classes, which are then provided by the phone when the user runs the app
[00:26:24] <zofrex> so the app itself does not contain any android sdk code
[00:31:31] <Tiffany> but zofrex I thought LGPL was the one which allowed linking

[00:55:11] <Elaine> I only listen to it on long car rides
[00:57:29] <XMPPwocky> jesus. i'm trying to use jekyll to generate something. first, debian's "jekyll" package didn't work with some weird ruby error. so then i  uninstalled that and tried installing the gem package thing, which didn't work with another weird ruby error
[00:57:51] <zofrex> XMPPwocky: how familiar are you with the ruby ecosystem
[00:57:53] <XMPPwocky> apparently it only installed for root, so if I run it as root... it wants a javascript engine.
[00:58:08] <Elaine> as someone who never really used ruby or its package managers, I found jekyll abhorrent to use.
[00:58:17] <XMPPwocky> zofrex: not at all, i don't want to participate in the ruby ecosystem at the moment, i want to run a command
[00:58:19] <Elaine> I didn't understand the tooling around it so I always broke stuff...
[00:58:40] <zofrex> *anything* ruby is abhorrent to use if you don't do it "the right way" which is actually not entirely the official way but it's the way everyone does it
[00:59:15] <zofrex> XMPPwocky: I can tell you what I wish someone had told me 3 years ago
[00:59:18] <XMPPwocky> i give up, i'm just gonna use github pages
[00:59:24] <zofrex> that also works.
[00:59:31] <Elaine> (sorry that I couldn't help :P)
[00:59:46] <zofrex> but if you're interested, there is a decent and moderately easy solution, which heavily inspired Cargo ;)
[01:00:32] <XMPPwocky> i'm sure if i install node.js and run it as root along with ruby it'll probably work, but that's pretty much https://twitter.com/codinghorror/status/347070841059692545 
[01:01:02] <zofrex> lol
[01:01:14] <zofrex> basically, the first thing I wish someone had told me was: Never install Ruby gems via the OS package manager
[01:01:35] <whipsch> yes, i can confirm that that's a bad idea
[01:01:54] <zofrex> secondly: you should probably only be installing gems via Bundler not gem, although in your specific use case maybe that's not quite true
[01:01:57] <XMPPwocky> the thing is, i don't actually want a ruby gem, i want /a program/
[01:02:09] <whipsch> gems can include bins
[01:02:19] <whipsch> which is what jekyll does, i assume
[01:02:22] <zofrex> thirdly: seriously question installing Ruby itself from the OS package manager, versus using RVM / rbenv / whatever the hell is popular with kids these days
[01:03:12] <XMPPwocky> like, if i write something in Rust, i put it into a cargo package and get a statically linked (somewhat bloated) executable out, i run it, and assuming the platform's somewhat reasonable it'll pretty much work
[01:03:34] <zofrex> yeah, that is the advantage of compiling to native binaries in a nutshell :P
[01:04:01] <XMPPwocky> i bet Nix could help here
[01:04:08] <zofrex> if you wanted to compile that package from source, you would need to install rustc and cargo and all the libraries it depends on... which is kind of the boat you're in with Jekyll
[01:04:39] <zofrex> FWIW: The steps to make this work, and stay working, and not hose itself or your system are pretty easy
[01:05:20] <zofrex> I totally understand that it's a lot more than you want to do just to run a program, but I can totes help out if you wanna do it

[01:11:14] <zofrex> in case anyone's interested the shortest path from 0 to sensible ruby environment on Linux BSD or OSX is http://rvm.io/
[01:11:31] <XMPPwocky> so i install jekyll with the "bundler" package manager, which i instal with the "gem" package manager, which itself came from apt/dpkg
[01:11:34] <XMPPwocky> this is ridiculous
[01:11:37] <zofrex> it's... I guess the Ruby equivalent of multirust?
[01:11:45] <zofrex> XMPPwocky: bundler is the ruby equivalent of the package management part of cargo
[01:12:32] <zofrex> it lets you manage dependencies on a per-project basis and lock them down and stuff like that, whereas gem installs globally

[01:14:38] <zofrex> ah in that case you probably do need to
[01:14:50] <XMPPwocky> so apparently i can't even install rvm for some reason
[01:15:08] <zofrex> that is weird and I feel incredibly guilty for talking about how easy this is

[01:16:13] <Tiffany> I tried installing discourse once
[01:16:37] <XMPPwocky> at least python's crappy package manager makes /sense/ in the way it's crappy
[01:16:44] <Tiffany> I gave up after 8 solid hours, getting it working in dev but not prod
[01:17:05] <zofrex> once you're used to it, and it does take a while to get over the learning curve with gems and gemsets and bundler, Ruby's package management works better than any other languages that I've tried
[01:17:22] <Tiffany> At the time, they used airbrake.io for logging
[01:17:24] <XMPPwocky> maybe this is why so many SaaS companies use ruby, because nobody is ever going to host it themselves

[05:53:55] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: So every time your thingy gets a definition, it should fill in all references to that in the exports
[05:54:29] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: Any definitions which do not have a corresponding export, even for just a specific architecture, should be shoved into an extra file
[05:54:54] <Quxxy> I was just going to turn those into a big table and use that to decide which file to write the decl to
[05:55:11] <WindowsBunny> that works too
[05:55:21] <WindowsBunny> as long as you account for some functions being in multiple libraries

[06:00:55] <Quxxy> Currently, I do a single pass with the desktop app family

[06:08:29] <WindowsBunny> That's weird

[06:08:35] <WindowsBunny> It errors
[06:08:49] <WindowsBunny> Even though it's right there next to headers that I can include
[06:11:21] <WindowsBunny> oh wait
[06:11:28] <WindowsBunny> That's because my VS is using the win10 SDK
[06:11:30] <WindowsBunny> silly me
[06:11:47] <Quxxy> _EXCEPTION_POINTERS and _EXCEPTION_RECORD are the only two unexposed types
[06:12:10] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: ah yes, for those you are supposed to remove the _ prefix
[06:12:18] <WindowsBunny> and use the actual type which is defined later somewhere else
[06:13:43] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: oh by the way, in win10 sdk there are now separate arm and arm64 libraries...
[06:13:59] <Quxxy> WindowsBunny: *sigh*
[06:14:18] <Quxxy> Well, if there's a clang triple for it and I can get a list of the predefined symbols for it, it shouldn't be hard to add at this point
[06:19:01] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: in other news, the universal CRT is included in the SDK
[06:19:32] <Quxxy> WindowsBunny: I remember reading about that... don't remember what the stink was about
[06:19:59] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: So basically the universal CRT means most of the CRT will be an ABI stable library distributed with the OS
[06:20:28] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: While there will also be a VC Runtime that is unstable and has ABI changes with each version of VS, which covers lower level details
[06:20:30] <Quxxy> Right, but there was another problem people had with the announcement; something to do with versioning *shrug*
[06:20:46] <WindowsBunny> the universal CRT will be stable, the VC runtime won't
[06:22:00] <WindowsBunny> Hmmm
[06:22:04] <Quxxy> Ok, the functions with unexposed types are fixed
[06:22:05] <WindowsBunny> it seems BemCreateReference vanished in win10?

[19:36:07] <WindowsBunny> morning rustybutts
[19:36:26] <zofrex> bluss: should that bug be closed? I found the same thing when I first joined this network and didn't set up SASL because of it
[19:36:29] <RC9> ah just the herbivore i was looking for
[19:36:46] <RC9> WindowsBunny i dont suppose youd have anyk nowledge as to why my right alt key is behaving like a windows key
[19:38:10] <WindowsBunny> RC9: keyboard config?
[19:38:27] <FreeFull> zofrex: I think it should be closed
[19:38:28] <WindowsBunny> RC9: I know some keyboards have hidden switches on the back that can adjust some of those keys behaviors
[19:38:32] <RC9> i thought about that
[19:38:40] <WindowsBunny> RC9: Has it always behaved this way?
[19:38:42] <RC9> seeing as it is a custom keyboard that has thrown fits on me before
[19:38:44] <WindowsBunny> or did it change recently?
[19:39:01] <RC9> i reflashed the firmware to check that A: both keys were actually behaving and B: one wasnt being treated as the other
[19:39:08] <RC9> and then back to right alt
[19:39:14] <bluss> zofrex: yeah it would have helped me too if it were closed
[19:39:19] <RC9> it hasnt, it changed just earlier with no apparent prompting on my end
[19:39:38] <RC9> editing a document in atom, went to fix my input language from KR to english, it acted like a win key
[19:40:01] <WindowsBunny> lol
[19:40:04] <bluss> zofrex: someone with an account on mozilla's bugzilla could comment on it
[19:40:07] <WindowsBunny> RC9: At least its not a lose key :D
[19:40:10] <RC9> ^
[19:40:14] <RC9> i was afraid it was toast again
[19:40:46] <RC9> but now im left with the far more confusing puzzle of "i neither installed nor downloaded anything in the last 2 days and now my right alt key has gone multiple personality on me"
[19:41:29] <zofrex> I have an account for SOMETHING.mozilla.org according to LastPass, but apparently not bugzilla

[20:07:21] <brandonson> RC9: did you manage to convince windows you're using a different keyboard layout or something?
[20:07:53] <RC9> owhere would i check that
[20:08:01] <RC9> i only know where to look at imes
[20:09:27] <brandonson> RC9: 'Change keyboards or other input methods' or something like that
[20:09:44] <brandonson> I also recall there being something in the taskbar sometimes
[20:10:33] <brandonson> mostly seems to affect canadian keyboard layouts in my experience, cause they have a french mode
[20:12:51] <RC9> lemme check

[20:17:38] <RC9> ok yeah nothing relevant on my taskbar
[20:28:20] <ytain> which operating system?
[20:29:34] <RC9> win8.1
[20:30:40] <ytain> go to Control Panel, Region and Language
[20:30:48] <ytain> go to Keyboards and Languages
[20:31:10] <ytain> and click on 'Change keyboards ...'
[20:31:23] <ytain> there should be only one, if you are not multilingual
[20:31:54] <RC9> http://prntscr.com/7n9jey
[20:32:00] <RC9> thats been KR input for forever
[20:32:07] <RC9> and was working till today :<
[20:32:09] <ytain> and the keyboard mapping should be called 'English (United States) -> US keyboard
[20:32:13] <RC9> does it if i add english (US)
[20:32:18] <RC9> and remove the KR input too
[20:32:43] <ytain> you can keep the KR
[20:32:55] <ytain> you can switch between two with Shift+Alt
[20:33:34] <RC9> lemme try that again
[20:34:52] <ytain> when you have two keyboard mapping inputs in that list, it should let you have an icon on the taskbar (keyboard icon) that allows you to switch the keyboard mappings on the fly
[20:35:02] <ytain> by mouse or by Alt+Shift or similar
[20:35:10] <RC9> ytain problem is the KR keyboard has an english mode already
[20:35:17] <RC9> which is usually controlled by right alt
[20:35:24] <RC9> sadly
[20:35:26] <ytain> oh ok, no idea
[20:35:44] <ytain> perhaps a reboot is required?
[20:36:17] <RC9> il try another one 
[20:37:28] <RC9> well thats cool
[20:37:31] <RC9> unrelated but cool
[20:37:50] <RC9> found the date and time display settings
[20:41:16] <RC9> i think i should go dig around in autohotkey and see what it records
[20:41:20] <RC9> when i hit right alt

[20:47:26] <ytain> autohotkey could be the culprit

[21:08:57] <RC9> huh?
[21:09:08] <RC9> i moved right alt to a different key and it does the same thing...

[21:48:55] <Tiffany> dfockler: there's lots of TLS vulnerabilities these days, and some people seem to be actively harmful in configuring their servers
[21:49:01] <Tiffany> ah
[21:49:13] <Tiffany> it looks like the problem with homu.io is that it's using a cert for barosl.com
[21:49:49] <Tiffany> the cert is also valid for homura.barosl.com, so that might work justaperson
