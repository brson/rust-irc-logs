[07:02:15] <Seldaek> acrichto: mornin', cool stuff 
[07:03:03] <acrichto> Seldaek: morning!
[07:03:10] <acrichto> although alas I should be sleeping lol
[07:03:42] <Seldaek> if you wait just a bit more you can skip the night :P
[07:03:52] <acrichto> haha
[07:05:51] <Seldaek> acrichto: just to be the annoying person here, I still think cross-crate linking should be to prio in terms of usability :)
[07:06:00] <Seldaek> I know it's not the funniest problem to tackle
[07:06:18] <acrichto> yeah I was gonna try to tackle that tomorrow actually
[07:06:24] <acrichto> I really wanna land all these changes first though
[07:06:27] <Seldaek> alright awesome
[07:06:28] <acrichto> I don't want it to pile up too high
[07:07:13] <Seldaek> then regarding the cross-crate search we'll see.. I can maybe help adjusting the frontend code to search multiple indices if that's the only way 
[07:07:23] <Seldaek> just let me know 
[07:07:24] <acrichto> Seldaek: what are your thoughts on https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/9489
[07:08:11] <Seldaek> I think long jumpable pages are stupid, but I realize there is no consensus there 
[07:08:14] <Seldaek> probably can not be.. 
[07:08:29] <Seldaek> I think with the sidebar you can click click click vs back click back click as described tehre
[07:08:52] <Seldaek> and the sidebar is at least mostly in scope since the pages are short
[07:09:07] <Seldaek> with the long pages, you also have to click back or get to the top somehow
[07:09:19] <acrichto> I don't really have a strong preference one way or another
[07:09:25] <acrichto> I'd probably use the search predominately
[07:09:29] <dbaupp> I prefer long pages
[07:09:37] <dbaupp> since I like using ctrl-f to jump around
[07:10:13] <Seldaek> I think it's a bit of a non issue since most things have been moved to impls/structs vs dangling functions
[07:10:28] <Seldaek> and all fns of a struct are on the same page
[07:11:33] <acrichto> ctrl-f is really hard b/c there's no prefix to match on
[07:11:39] <acrichto> try searching for 'prelude' on the front page
[07:11:45] <acrichto> you hit like 5 things before you get to the module
[07:12:25] <Seldaek> yeah, you can hit 's' then prelude
[07:12:29] <Seldaek> and you're there :P
[07:12:44] <dbaupp> right; I'm semi-often ctrl-f-ing for something like `%S`, since it's a snippet of an example/documentation *text* that I remember
[07:12:50] <dbaupp> (not the function/struct names)
[07:12:59] <dbaupp> I could just be weird though :P
[07:13:32] <Seldaek> well, it's not really weird, although a bit weird that you remember the stuff around what you should be remembering so you can lookup what you forgot;) 
[07:13:48] <Seldaek> but mostly it's also a characteristic of someone that knows the docs well already
[07:14:04] <Seldaek> I think for newcomers those long pages are very intimidating/confusing
[07:14:21] <Seldaek> but it's also maybe just me being an idiot
[07:14:48] <Seldaek> usability is hardly a science, unless you have the time to make studies and manage not to mess them up :/
[07:15:53] <Seldaek> acrichto: bottom line is, I think the haters will come around, and if not we can always try and change it later, see if more people complain after the change than before :p
[07:16:05] <acrichto> hehe
[07:16:21] <dbaupp> how about a "long/short" option :P
[07:16:32] <Seldaek> how about no :p
[07:16:35] <acrichto> #[doc(please_i_dont_like_long_pages)]
[07:16:35] <dbaupp> and js collects the function/struct pages into one :P
[07:17:03] <Seldaek> dbaupp: you can write a greasemonkey script or browser extension:P
[07:17:21] * dbaupp prefers it when others do the work for him :P
[07:17:50] <Seldaek> yeah that's another way to fix that problem acrichto, let the haters hate and ignore them, most likely nobody will hate it enough to actually send a PR ;)
[07:18:01] <Seldaek> I use this often, it's very efficient
[07:20:43] <Seldaek> dbaupp: seriously though, try to use the search & sidebar more, then write down your mood every day let's see how it evolves from using ctrl-f :)
[07:21:59] <dbaupp> haha (all this said, I only visit the docs to link them to someone; git-grepping the repo is faster for me)
[07:22:27] <acrichto> yeah it's tough to design docs when you don't use them any more :(
[07:24:05] <Seldaek> I still use the docs to find things, then go look in the source to know wtf is going on because there are no docblocks :p
