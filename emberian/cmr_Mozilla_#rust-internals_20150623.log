[05:26:49] <bstrie> rust code highlighting coming to wikipedia: https://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikitech-l/2015-June/082161.html
[05:27:34] <bstrie> hyperassociative: if you'd like to work on that bug, I'd ask nmatsakis directly to clarify
[05:28:09] <hyperassociative> bstrie: I just want to know what it is... :-/
[05:28:19] <sfackler> hyperassociative: <foo as Trait>::method() I believe
[05:28:43] <Tobba> as far as I'm concerned everything nmatsakis says about the type system is generated by a very good markov bot
[05:29:04] <hyperassociative> Tobba: bwaaaa
[05:30:48] <hyperassociative> sfackler: Then what's the 'canonical form' vs. a 'projection'? I'd have thought that fully specifying what traits you're using sounds more 'canonical' than not.
[05:31:57] <sfackler> ah, sorry
[05:32:41] <sfackler> in that example, I::P is a projection and <I as Bar<J, K>>::P would be the canonical form I believe
[05:34:34] <bstrie> does anyone have any idea what would be needed to allow this: https://play.rust-lang.org/?gist=368dc809a95ed95f8a21&version=stable
[05:37:23] <hyperassociative> bstrie: Dumping a #[derive(Copy)] gave me a curious error message that left me thinking in circles. :-/
[05:37:35] <Dabo> hyperassociative, Box wouldn't be Copy in any case though, right?
[05:37:42] <Dabo> I mean even if X is copy, I doubt Box<X> is
[05:38:01] <hyperassociative> Dabo: Is it not?
[05:38:03] <bstrie> right, the question isn't about fixing the code, it's about changing the language to accept None in that position somehow :)
[05:38:09] <bstrie> you can't Copy a Box
[05:38:19] <hyperassociative> I get that, but then why should that work...?
[05:38:27] <Dabo> hyperassociative, I would just think to actually create a new version of a Box, you need to assign new memory
[05:38:43] <Dabo> Copy by definition is literally just copying the bytes of data stored in the type, which in Box's case is a memory address
[05:39:02] <Dabo> if Box implemented Copy, it would still point to the same memory in two Boxes, which really wouldn't be the best
[05:39:49] <hyperassociative> Dabo: Not if it was a blanket impl over the types X that - waaait. I mixed up copy and clone. Woops./

[05:51:15] <eddyb> actually, I wanted to make an RFC
[05:52:04] <eddyb> bstrie: so in [expr; N] we can make it so either expr is a constant rvalue (easy check, we already have the logic for it) which would make it equivalent to N repeats of the expression, so even [None::<Box<T>>; N] would be allowed
[05:52:05] <bstrie> it's also possible that you opened an RFC and I just didn't see it :P

[06:11:40] <jroesch> hyperassociative: by inferred do you mean implied bounds (i.e Eq => PartialEq)?

[06:18:51] <jroesch> so super traits have traditionally been privileged in the compiler and when you do a superclass constraint like `trait A : B` you end up essentially expanding to a set of where clauses with a constraint for each supertrait, there was talk of expanding this implied bounds to other bounds on self or generalizing but it hasn't been done afaik and when we
[06:18:51] <jroesch> refactored that code the existing behavior was preserved

[06:21:33] <hyperassociative> jroesch: is such expansion (elaboration?) eventually desirable? Were there any strong opinions for/against?
[06:25:35] <jroesch> I had tried to change it so that all bounds on self were treated identically but I'm not sure why we didn't go in that direction
[06:26:26] <jroesch> There may of been a good reason but its been a couple of months
[06:26:48] <jroesch> There has been talk at various points about increasing the scope of implied bounds but you would have to ask aturon or nmatsakis since they were the two most heavily talking about it
[06:27:15] <aturon> jroesch: missing context, but http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2014/07/06/implied-bounds/ is likely relevant
[06:28:09] <jroesch> aturon: we were talking about implied supertrait bounds and I believe hyperassociative was generally inquiring about implied bounds if I interpreted his question correclty 
[06:28:14] <jroesch> correctly*
[06:29:09] <hyperassociative> More or less yeah - I'm still trying to understand the jargon and such (been scouring the compiler source, issues, and such) to understand the right questions to ask.
[06:29:37] <aturon> hyperassociative: the blog post link seems likely relevant, probably the best place to start

[06:35:57] <hyperassociative> What sort of implications for API evolution?
[06:36:23] <aturon> basically, that removing a bound becomes a breaking change

[06:37:45] <hyperassociative> I don't follow. Removing a bound on what from what?
[06:38:09] <hyperassociative> Or, rather, I don't see what *breaks* by having more implications.
[06:38:51] <aturon> hyperassociative: sorry, bit distracted on my end. what I mean is: if you have `struct Foo<T: SomeTrait>`, implied bounds mean that whenever you have `Foo<T>,` you know that `T: SomeTrait`
[06:39:10] <aturon> but that means that changing the definition to `struct Foo<T>` is now a breaking change
[06:39:34] <aturon> (which is not the case today)
[06:39:57] <aturon> i don't think that's a deal-breaker, but we'd need to be thoughtful about the design and conventions around it
[06:43:16] <hyperassociative> Yeah, I don't see that as a deal-breaker; it's basically a pick-your-poison sort of thing. I don't see the same sorts of issues cropping up for associated types, though (at least not without some more strings attached like equality bounds).
[06:45:12] <aturon> FWIW, the whole mozilla team + some others are together in person this week, and we'll be doing some planning. i'll bring up implied bounds, which we haven't talked about in a while, and get a sense for where things stand -- feel free to ping me later this week :)

[16:19:09] <steveklabnik> wooo
[16:19:19] <huseby> so what's the agenda for the rust session today?
[16:19:24] <steveklabnik> i have no idea
[16:19:28] <steveklabnik> it took me 36 hours to get here
[16:19:40] <steveklabnik> and i have to step out around noon to preset at a conference remotely
[16:19:40] <steveklabnik> heh
[16:19:56] <huseby> hrm....I'm hoping to get some build-bot script patches queued up for landing next week
[16:20:01] <bluss> steveklabnik: wow that's quite some travel
[16:20:12] <steveklabnik> bluss: yeah mexico -> vancouver via New York
[16:20:18] <steveklabnik> anyway
[16:20:23] <steveklabnik> this is offtopic for internals
[16:20:23] <huseby> wow, that's tough
[16:20:51] <huseby> maybe build-bot scripts isn't internal either?
[16:20:57] <huseby> i came here because #rust is dead
[16:21:41] <bluss> all the internal people being missing is kind a on topic hehe
[16:21:52] <bluss> well holed up in a mountain and having a good time I hope

[19:11:32] <Manishearth>  - Did you accidentally use it as a struct when it's an enum?
