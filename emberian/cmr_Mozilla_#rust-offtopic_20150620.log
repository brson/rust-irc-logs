[02:14:25] <FreeFull> Shouldn't Rust provide some way to override panic! so that an error message box could be displayed for GUI programs?

[02:16:10] <cmr> but no, I don't think so. Rust programs that want to be robust to panics should run things under a std::thread::try supervisor that reports errors.
[02:16:38] <FreeFull> Ok, so have to be multithreaded
[02:16:47] <c74d> Oh, Rust panics can be caught?
[02:16:59] <c74d> …I think I knew that at some point. >_>
[02:17:40] <cmr> FreeFull: try doesn't spawn a thread.
[02:17:47] <cmr> I guess it's called catch_panic now: http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/master/std/thread/fn.catch_panic.html
[02:18:13] <cmr> At least, I don't think it spawns a thread, I recall some work being done to make it not spawn a thread.
[02:18:45] <Quxxy> cmr: I don't think it's re-entrant, though
[02:18:58] <Quxxy> I tried using it to catch panics in an Iron program, and it did nothing
[02:19:02] <cmr> it isn't, no.
[02:19:21] <FreeFull> cmr: Huh, and it's not unsafe
[02:21:06] <c74d> It looks like it's effectively just an `unsafe` block around a `try!` invocation.
[02:21:47] <cmr> FreeFull: yeah so I think the way it works is if you use catch_panic inside a catch_panic, the inner catch_panic just won't ever trigger and it will bubble up to the outer catch_anic

[02:26:10] <cmr> The comments on unwind::try don't indicate that.
[02:26:12] <Quxxy> That's not fair; it didn't work for me :'(
[02:26:25] <cmr> Oh now that we allow dtor leaking maybe it's considered safe.
[02:28:02] <eddyb_> we should make abort safe too :P
[02:28:15] <cmr> eddyb_: I agree.
[02:28:31] <eddyb_> I use it in high perf code trying to reduce the unwinding footprint
[02:28:33] <cmr> I honestly don't know why it ever wasn't.
[02:28:40] <Dabo> isn't std::process::exit the safe version of abort?
[02:28:51] <eddyb_> was never wrapped in a safe function
[02:28:58] <Dabo> or is abort something different
[02:28:59] <cmr> Dabo: no, abort raises SIGABRT which causes a core dump and such.
[02:29:03] <eddyb_> so you had to call the intrinsic which is unsafe
[02:29:04] <Dabo> ah

[02:30:04] <cmr> lol why
[02:30:09] <FreeFull> cmr: abort might be raising SIGABRT, and LLVM installs a signal handler for it?
[02:30:19] <eddyb_> FreeFull: no
[02:30:19] <cmr> FreeFull: no, abort is hardcoded to ud2 on x86
[02:30:26] <FreeFull> Ok
[02:30:31] <cmr> LLVM doesn't install signal handlers, god that'd be awful
[02:31:08] <eddyb_> cmr: I don't like to waste icache with cold calls
[02:31:15] <cmr> eddyb_: it's 2 bytes.

[02:32:15] <cmr> So TIS-100 is really fun.
[02:32:16] <eddyb_> if LLVM jumps to an abort block...
[02:32:45] <eddyb_> can't it just emit only one per module?
[02:33:14] <cmr> one abort block?

[02:38:21] <eddyb_> arenas + sjlj might be a very good mix
[02:38:43] <cmr> I was thinking that children would receive resources from the supervisor and when the supervisor sees child death it cleans the resources and hands them out to the next child

[05:48:15] <niconii> WindowsBunny: there's a *lot* of costs involved
[05:48:36] <Havvy> If I had a lot of money and nothing to spend it on, transplanting wings on could be interesting.
[05:48:42] <Havvy> Though I'd more likely just donate to charity.

[05:51:05] <eddyb_> I wonder what that would take

[05:53:49] <niconii> tbh it kinda bothers me when "being inclusive" is immediately equated with "politics"
[05:54:26] <niconii> eddyb_: it's not something i've gone through yet myself, but it sounds pretty rough, yeah
[05:54:36] <Havvy> Is it actually inclusive to ask for the exclusion of the primary maintainer?
[05:54:55] <eddyb_> I've never understood the whole thing with inclusiveness
[05:55:25] <niconii> Havvy: i'm not really commenting on that in particular; it's just that the argument of "politics" comes up a lot even in other situations
[05:55:30] <eddyb_> can we stop caring about what we include and what we don't?
[05:56:00] <XMPPwocky> i feel like it's easy to say that if you're already included
[05:56:04] <niconii> eddyb_: erm, you'll have to elaborate on that
[05:56:04] <Havvy> eddyb_:  We /could/, but doing so would lead to a very insular community.
[05:56:21] <eddyb_> my solution to "being gay is illegal" is "remove any mention of sexual orientation from laws"
[05:56:36] <eddyb_> instead of "add more sexual orientations to the laws"
[05:56:51] <Havvy> eddyb_:  That's sort of what legalizing gay marriage does.
[05:57:17] <eddyb_> but maybe that's naive DRY thinking
[05:57:48] <niconii> eddyb_: well, the thing is, then you end up with people firing others simply for being gay or trans or whatever because they have no explicit protection
[05:58:14] <eddyb_> the need for explicit anything is annoying
[05:58:23] <eddyb_> we'll keep accumulating special cases
[05:58:35] <eddyb_> it doesn't fucking scale

[06:15:41] <c74d> Filling all public spaces with tons of raw sewage? I think that might go over even worse than putting control chips in everyone's brains.
[06:16:01] <niconii> ...the worst part is that, given humanity, some people would be turned *on* by that
[06:16:08] <eddyb_> but really, you shouldn't get (easily) aroused in the workplace
[06:16:19] <eddyb_> niconii: hah
[06:16:26] <XMPPwocky> c74d: very carefully?
[06:16:43] <WindowsBunny> niconii: I'm turned on by discussions like these ;)
[06:16:53] <niconii> D:
[06:16:59] <c74d> XMPPwocky: mm, my solution is Google Web Cache.
[06:17:25] <eddyb_> c74d: isn't there something for IPv4-over-v6?
[06:17:50] <Havvy> Anyways, the main question I had was...how do /we/, as the Rust community, deal with an incident like this in the future?
[06:17:59] <eddyb_> that an IPv4-enabled router can deal woth automatically?
[06:18:04] <c74d> eddyb: I expect so, but Google Web Cache is quicker.
[06:18:15] <eddyb_> riiight :P
[06:18:33] <eddyb_> s/Cache//
[06:18:50] <eddyb_> better than AOL Web
[06:19:00] <niconii> Havvy: not sure, honestly
[06:19:19] <WindowsBunny> Havvy: Holding any sort of public opinion on matters like race and gender is going to scare some people away

[06:19:52] <eddyb_> everyone is human*
[06:19:56] <niconii> i mean, if they're saying bigoted stuff where the CoC applies, that's one thing
[06:20:04] <WindowsBunny> Havvy: So the most we can do is try to abide by the opinions that the loudest bigots want us to hold
[06:20:15] <niconii> but if it's somewhere else, i'm not sure
[06:20:18] <Havvy> Well, the incident started on Twitter.
[06:20:24] <eddyb_> *except those who take issue with the above fact
[06:20:32] <eddyb_> great, that got broken up
[06:20:48] <WindowsBunny> eddyb_: I am offended by the statement "everyone is human"
[06:20:51] <XMPPwocky> saying "we're going to allow transphobic people to work on our project", or "we're not going to allow transphobic people to work on our project"; both are expressing an opinion
[06:21:17] <eddyb_> XMPPwocky: they are both suboptimal
[06:21:28] <Havvy> And if the project leader is transphobic?
[06:21:46] <c74d> WindowsBunny: then apparently you are excepted from it ;)
[06:21:52] <eddyb_> wait I read something else
[06:22:08] <Havvy> Do we just fork whatever project it was?
[06:22:30] <niconii> i guess it'd be best to try and distance ourselves from that project, or maybe fork it i suppose
[06:22:36] <niconii> depends on how substantial it is, i guess
[06:22:37] <eddyb_> WindowsBunny: proving me right. I mean, me beforr I tried to solve the community issue
[06:22:57] <WindowsBunny> XMPPwocky: I will allow anyone to contribute to my project, but only those whose public opinions do not cause significant backlash from the loudest bigots will be allowed in leadership positions
[06:23:08] <eddyb_> lol
[06:23:15] <eddyb_> being practical
[06:23:39] <WindowsBunny> My policy is thus adaptive to the current social situation

[06:25:05] <niconii> could be a bit awkward
[06:27:10] <WindowsBunny> niconii: If the contribution itself contains content that causes significant backlash from the loudest bigots, then I will consider denying that contribution until it can be rewritten in such a way that it is no longer offensive

[06:29:03] <eddyb_> btw, "xe" was brought up some time ago in #rust-internals
[06:29:17] <lahwran> is it going to be an operator
[06:29:41] <WindowsBunny> I am offended by the use of gender neutral pronouns when referring to me
[06:29:44] <WindowsBunny> I refuse to be neutral
[06:29:57] <lahwran> if it were about offense the problems would look very different
[06:30:14] <aatch> Chaotic Lawful
[06:30:15] <lahwran> we're not here to not offend people, we're here to be inclusive
[06:30:21] <lahwran> well, not here
[06:30:22] <aatch> Chaotic Good I mean...
[06:30:27] <lahwran> we're *here* to talk about random shit
[06:30:33] <eddyb_> and certain forms aren't as neutral as they could be
[06:30:46] <lahwran> why are we here? because eddyb_ has a plan for our existence
[06:31:01] <WindowsBunny> eddyb_: What shall I do next in your great plan?
[06:31:13] <c74d> ó_o
[06:31:15] <eddyb_> I think "xer" vs "xim"
[06:31:16] <niconii> i've never really liked the term "to be offended" either, it makes it sound like it's something the recipient of the abuse is doing
[06:31:22] <lahwran> invader xer
[06:31:37] <eddyb_> my brother came up with the obvious "xeir"
[06:31:55] <niconii> personally i prefer "doing this hurts people" over "doing this offends people"
[06:31:59] <lahwran> it's offensive to a bystander when you hurt someone, but it's the fact that you hurt someone that is the problem, not the fact that you offended someone
[06:32:01] <lahwran> exactly
[06:32:12] <eddyb_> s/th/x/ is an interesting one
[06:32:34] <eddyb_> ofc it doesn't work with "the" :P
[06:32:44] <lahwran> it might be offensive even if you happened to hurt noone - the being offended is a stand-in for being hurt, so as to create a policy of avoiding hurt. but offense was never the point
[06:33:11] <lahwran> anyway, I'm offended that irc exists, because it distracted me
[06:33:11] <lahwran> again
[06:33:14] <lahwran> o/
[06:33:20] <Havvy> eddyb_:  "The" isn't a pronoun.
[06:33:34] <aatch> Havvy, not with that attitude!
[06:33:55] <Havvy> It's a definite article.
[06:34:15] <lahwran> it is a pronoun
[06:34:21] <eddyb_> I was considering writing "th" as "x"
[06:34:27] <eddyb_> everywhere
[06:34:32] <WindowsBunny> (2:32:00 AM) lahwran: it's offensive to a bystander when you hurt someone, but it's the fact that you hurt someone that is the problem, not the fact that you offended someone
[06:34:36] <Havvy> "It" is a pronoun.
[06:34:36] <WindowsBunny> lahwran: This, very much this
[06:34:56] <aatch> Havvy, I contend that English does not yet have enough ambiguity.
[06:35:10] <lahwran> Havvy: you caught me
[06:35:10] <eddyb_> especially since they might be pronounced similarily
[06:35:15] <lahwran> aatch: what?
[06:35:32] <eddyb_> though it's usually spelled "ze"
[06:35:48] <lahwran> oh dear
[06:35:51] <eddyb_> "zeir waffle"
[06:35:52] <Havvy> aatch:  Alright. Instead of saying pronouns are "gender neutral", we shall now say they are isomorphic.
[06:36:02] <lahwran> does crates.io have tags for "works with x version of rust"?
[06:36:10] <WindowsBunny> lahwran: not yet :D
[06:36:13] <lahwran> that's not good
[06:36:13] <eddyb_> lahwran: don't think so
[06:36:19] <eddyb_> crater could help
[06:36:23] <lahwran> that's a very important part of pypi
[06:36:41] <lahwran> (which has been getting actual development lately, it's kind of crazy how that works)
[06:36:45] <Mutabah> Probably make a convention of using 'rust1.n' for menting it requires at least that
[06:36:53] <lahwran> formenting
[06:36:59] * lahwran ferments rand
[06:37:09] <niconii> it's pretty hard to create a gender-neutral set of pronouns that really fits in with english, i've seen
[06:37:13] <Havvy> aatch:  Does that help your ambiguity problem?
[06:37:22] <WindowsBunny> dafuq does WIN32_CHICAGO mean
[06:38:21] <eddyb_> 😂😂😂
[06:38:31] <niconii> personally i've always been fine with singular "they", though i can see why it may be unappealing for non-binary people, especially since "they" has connotations of distance
[06:38:35] <XMPPwocky> WindowsBunny: http://toastytech.com/guis/chicago.html
[06:38:45] <niconii> and "they" can be a bit ambiguous too
[06:38:52] <XMPPwocky> niconii: yeah i use "they" whenever i'm not totally sure of somebody's pronouns
[06:39:01] <niconii> same
[06:39:12] <lahwran> I'm a big fan of "it" for myself
[06:39:25] <lahwran> because of the implications of it, it isn't something I'd ask other people to use
[06:39:27] <XMPPwocky> you can argue about spivak or whatever, but the issue is that people tend to derail conversations when they see them
[06:39:42] <lahwran> but I find it very amusing and actually very apt to ask people to acknowledge that actually, I am in fact a robot
[06:39:48] <niconii> XMPPwocky: yeah
[06:40:03] <niconii> XMPPwocky: i guess that
[06:40:15] <lahwran> plus, it weirds people out in an entirely different way than "they" or "xer"
[06:40:20] <niconii> that's kind of a hurdle to entry
[06:40:31] <niconii> english has solidified a lot
[06:40:37] <aatch> I'll use *a* set of gender-neutral pronouns. One set. I'm not remembering a set of pronouns for each individual, that's what names are for.
[06:40:46] <niconii> what with the internet and wide-spread literacy and all that
[06:40:50] <lahwran> ^
[06:40:59] <lahwran> english has much stronger constraints now that EVERYONE is using it
[06:41:41] <XMPPwocky> at least english hasn't hit 1.0 yet
[06:41:47] <niconii> with time things may improve, as awareness of these sorts of issues grows
[06:41:48] <WindowsBunny> XMPPwocky: wat
[06:41:58] <eddyb_> lahwran++ for experimenting with the next step in being uncanny
[06:42:11] <Havvy> XMPPwocky:  Yes it has. We're at version 2015.06.20
[06:42:28] <lahwran> english is rolling release
[06:42:38] <lahwran> there have been attempts to make it otherwise
[06:42:42] <lahwran> they failed rather miserably
[06:43:02] <WindowsBunny> XMPPwocky: There's this weird WIN32_CHICAGO constant, but its only in a few of the winapi security related headers
[06:43:06] <lahwran> if you ask an english teacher you can get a rant about that english teacher's favorite attempt to do so
[06:43:08] <eddyb_> tumbleweed?
[06:43:37] <lahwran> WindowsBunny: people like naming theory things after cities
[06:43:50] <WindowsBunny> lahwran: And I can't find _any_ documentation on it
[06:43:54] <niconii> unfortunately the maintainers died about 1,400 years ago, and now everyone has commit access to the repository
[06:44:15] <lahwran> it's a damn big repository, too
[06:44:23] <eddyb_> niconii: but append-only
[06:44:30] <lahwran> not at all
[06:44:36] <lahwran> *edits a blog post*
[06:44:50] <lahwran> ...but, close to it. I see your point.
[06:45:26] <WindowsBunny> And people keep using outdated versions of the repo
[06:45:54] <lahwran> btw eddyb_ machine learning is cooler and cooler the more I learn about it
[06:46:47] <eddyb_> I have seen the RNN thing
[06:46:53] <eddyb_> ofc it is :P
[06:48:26] <aatch> machine learning has always seemed like magic to me.
[06:51:11] <eddyb_> by some definitions, it is magic
[06:51:34] <lahwran> it's not magic
[06:51:38] <lahwran> that's what's so exciting about it
[06:51:52] <lahwran> it's understandable and makes a lot of sense
[06:52:01] <lahwran> by understandable, I mean can be understood
[06:52:12] <lahwran> it is possible to wrap your mind around what it's actually doing
[06:52:56] <eddyb_> your mind is what it's doing
[06:53:04] <lahwran> I wish
[06:53:10] <eddyb_> so the wrapping makes sense
[06:53:18] * WindowsBunny farts adorably
[06:53:31] *** Joins: eerie (eerie@moz-2u3428.red.bezeqint.net)
[06:53:36] <aatch> lahwran, my concept of "magic" is more "too complex for me to use my intuition". Processors used to be very magic to me, now they're just quite magic.
[06:53:39] <eddyb_> fuck that shit about being inclusive
[06:53:41] * lahwran asserts impossibilities spherically
[06:53:49] <eddyb_> I am sick of WindowsBunny's farts
[06:54:03] <niconii> WindowsBunny: 6/10
[06:54:12] <Havvy> eddyb_:  Are you saying we should ban all bunnies because you dislike WindowsBunny?
[06:54:20] * eddyb_ fails at pretend hate because of IRC race condition
[06:54:22] <lahwran> eddyb_: maximizing inclusivity sometimes requires removing people who are detractors to inclusivity
[06:54:59] <lahwran> figuring out who that actually means is not a simple problem
[06:55:09] <c74d> Havvy: I think the more reasonable supposition would be that eddyb would like to ban people who use CTCP ACTION for flatulence.
[06:55:19] <lahwran> overfitting! overfitting, I say!
[06:55:33] <WindowsBunny> lahwran: utilitarianism except with regards to least offended rather than most happiness?
[06:56:01] <lahwran> the objective function did not include offense as a parameter
[06:56:28] <niconii> eddyb_: nice
[06:56:38] <Mutabah> eddyb_: That shows up as green on my client... how fitting
[06:56:40] <lahwran> also I'm not really clear on what the different things are or what their problems are
[06:57:29] <eddyb_> now I need a client which can ignore that
[06:59:00] <c74d> eddyb_: Ignore what, `CTCP fart`? Or unsupported CTCP functions in general?
[06:59:07] <eddyb_> the former
[06:59:30] <c74d> seems to me like an odd thing to ignore specifically
[06:59:46] <WindowsBunny> My IRC client doesn't show CTCP stuff in channels other than ACTION
[06:59:50] <c74d> though now that you've started it… v_v
[06:59:52] <eddyb_> no shit sherlock :P
[07:00:01] <lahwran> is someone CTCPing the channel with something besides action
[07:00:04] <lahwran> that's a silly thing to do
[07:00:14] <lahwran> oh it's midnight
[07:00:19] <WindowsBunny> It's 3 AM
[07:00:28] <eddyb_> it's 10am
[07:00:29] <c74d> lahwran: yes, eddyb_ sent `CTCP fart` and WindowsBunny sent `CTCP FART`.
[07:00:40] <lahwran> and I have some serious refactoring to do because I have a dependency loop in my initialization that doesn't need to be there
[07:00:45] <c74d> (My client displays them in-channel.)
[07:00:49] <lahwran> it's just there because I made a mistake in conceptual structure
[07:00:55] <lahwran> time to sleep
[07:00:56] <lahwran> o/
[07:01:00] <niconii> \o
[07:01:06] * WindowsBunny gives lahwran a goodnight nibble
[07:01:30] <eddyb_> lahwran: does your S3 mode do background code refactoring?
[07:02:44] <c74d> eddyb: your client seems to already ignore unknown CTCP commands.
[07:03:09] <c74d> at least, it didn't respond to my `CTCP CLIENTINFO`.
[07:07:01] <Mutabah> Anyone have a good name for a crate that parses command-line type strings as an iterator?
[07:07:19] <Mutabah> i.e. it'd break 'echo "Hello World
[07:07:33] <Mutabah> i.e. it'd break 'echo "Hello World"' into 'echo' and 'Hello World'
[07:08:16] <WindowsBunny> Mutabah: Which rules would it follow
[07:08:19] <eddyb_> c74d: pretty sure that is not it
[07:08:23] <WindowsBunny> Mutabah: bash style rules? windows style rules?
[07:08:27] <Mutabah> WindowsBunny: bash probably
[07:08:33] <Mutabah> as those are the ones I'm most familiar with
[07:08:37] <Mutabah> eddyb_: It's VERSION iirc
[07:08:38] <c74d> bash-words-iterator.rs
[07:08:41] <WindowsBunny> Mutabah: would it follow bash style rules even on windows? D:
[07:08:51] <eddyb_> Mutabah: beh
[07:08:55] <eddyb_> *meh
[07:09:06] <c74d> Mutabah: I had sent eddyb `CTCP CLIENTINFO`
[07:09:07] <Mutabah> WindowsBunny: Dunno, might have different iterators depending on the ruleset
[07:09:16] <Mutabah> WindowsBunny: Oh, and I'm planning on making it take &mut str
[07:09:19] <eddyb_> I have never seen clientinfo
[07:09:23] <c74d> space-separated-string-iterator.rs
[07:09:31] <WindowsBunny> Mutabah: o_0
[07:09:47] <WindowsBunny> Mutabah: Don't be a hero D:
[07:09:50] <Mutabah> :( String doesn't have DerefMut
[07:10:00] <eddyb_> Mutabah: hack it in
[07:10:12] <Mutabah> WindowsBunny: Well, in all of the rules I know for those, the encoded length is longer than the decoded length
[07:10:26] <Mutabah> eddyb_: Yeah
[07:10:35] <Mutabah> WindowsBunny: Which would allow you to reuse the source allocation quite easily
[07:10:40] <WindowsBunny> Mutabah: Anyway, the windows rules are very simple https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/17w5ykft%28v=vs.85%29.aspx
[07:10:50] <eddyb_> that is a cool trick btw
[07:10:59] <eddyb_> instead of CoW
[07:11:17] <Mutabah> eddyb_: Yeah - I'm writing it for my top-level userland loader in my OS. Don't have String in that yet
[07:11:22] <c74d> eddyb: `CTCP CLIENTINFO` might be only a WeeChat thing, I don't know.
[07:11:41] <Mutabah> (It's intended to ONLY live in the top 128K of memory, so can't touch the heap)
[07:12:35] <WindowsBunny> Oh, I forgot I have PMs whitelisted

[11:35:41] <Quxxy> As a result, when you have a popup or context menu that is near the edge, or wider than the menu itself, it gets cut off

[13:26:11] <Quxxy> I have a vague recollection of Bad Things happening if you read from uninitialised storage
[13:26:24] <Quxxy> And in order for replace to do its job, it *has* to read from the argument you give it
[13:26:57] <Quxxy> Could you not just use an empty slice?
[13:27:01] <Quxxy> *thinks*
[13:27:07] <Quxxy> I suppose you can't have generic variables
[13:27:56] <Quxxy> I guess you could construct a &[] slice, transmute to the correct lifetime, and use that
[13:28:06] <Quxxy> But again, I don't know whether or not that use of uninitialised is correct or not
[13:28:12] <Quxxy> *Aside* from that, it looks OK

[13:28:21] <Quxxy> Wait
[13:28:23] <Quxxy> *bangs head*
[13:28:35] <Quxxy> What if you did .split_at_mut(0)
[13:28:41] <Quxxy> Would that give you an empty slice at the front?
[13:28:53] <Mutabah> yes?
[13:29:13] <Quxxy> Could you do replace(slice, slice.split_at_mut(0).0)?
[13:29:27] <Quxxy> Doesn't seem like you should

[18:09:50] <XMPPwocky> ANYSIZE_ARRAY?

[22:10:42] <fmtq> I got the scalpel and just was like
[22:10:46] <fmtq> 30% of you has to go.
[22:10:49] <fmtq> I have only one question.
[22:10:54] <fmtq> How does one stem bleeding?
[22:11:34] <eddyb> Tobba: something is very fast now. I think my HDD is doing better since I stopped cramming things in one part of it only

[22:21:16] <eddyb> hah, steam might actually be installing now
[22:21:32] <Layl> fkaa, MS now actually accepts pull requests
[22:21:43] <Layl> and they've changed to more permissive licenses than "Microsoft Public License"
[22:21:47] <Layl> they now mainly use Apache 2.0 iirc
[22:22:03] <fmtq> eddyb: tell me
[22:22:12] <fmtq> Layl: yep 
[22:22:19] <fmtq> MPL was a "gateway drug"
[22:22:37] <eddyb> I thought MPL meant "Mozilla Public License" or something
[22:22:44] <fmtq> MsPL
[22:22:48] <fmtq> sorry
[22:22:55] <fmtq> I am drunk and just cut a hole in my toe
[22:23:09] <fmtq> eddyb: I Ceausescu kangaroo court'd my toe
[22:23:12] <fmtq> there was limited blood
[22:23:14] <fmtq> I am surprised
[22:23:22] <eddyb> LOL
[22:23:30] <Layl> fmtq, that sounds like something you shouldn't do
[22:23:34] <fmtq> but
[22:23:36] <fmtq> you are right
[22:23:37] <fmtq> but i id dit 
[22:23:38] <fmtq> waoirhaeioja
[22:23:41] <fmtq> I did it* 
[22:23:46] <fmtq> and there is limited blood
[22:23:48] <Layl> uuh see a doctor?
[22:23:50] <fmtq> NO
[22:23:53] <fmtq> I AM IN BELGIUM
[22:23:57] <fmtq> instead I saw €4 of 10% beer
[22:24:00] <fmtq> time 10 
[22:24:01] <fmtq> then
[22:24:04] <fmtq> took an axe to my toe
[22:24:09] <fmtq> I did a romanian judicial system to my toe
[22:24:17] <Layl> you probably should see some kind of medical attention perhaps
[22:24:30] <fmtq> Layl: in which country do you suggest/
[22:24:39] <Layl> any
[22:24:51] <fmtq> oh
[22:24:53] <fmtq> you care
[22:24:53] <fmtq> <3
[22:24:54] <Layl> holes are not conducive to the function of toes
[22:25:14] <fmtq> yeah but
[22:25:17] <fmtq> it's not a real hole
[22:25:26] <fmtq> I cut a straight line into the center of my toenail
[22:25:31] <fmtq> then I pulled the fucked toenail off
[22:25:35] <fmtq> it didn't even blled.
[22:25:40] <fmtq> it just looked at me like a belgian.
[22:25:44] <fmtq> it judged me but took no action
[22:25:51] <fmtq> threw alcohol at it and then bandaided it
[22:26:02] <Layl> you might regret that action when sober again
[22:26:17] <fmtq> tbh no
[22:26:26] <fmtq> I copied the operation that happened on my other toe
[22:26:39] <fmtq> I am not new to toes unfortunatley.
[22:26:40] <fmtq> :(
[22:26:45] <fmtq> I have derp toe
[22:26:54] <fmtq> every 4 years my toenails are like "let us dig!"

[22:32:29] <eddyb> yeah, but I'm happy I got something so close to eddyb

[23:14:21] <fmtq> in hell>?
[23:14:40] <aatch> fmtq, no, New Zealand, not Australia.
[23:15:11] <fkaa> just got racer working
[23:15:19] <fmtq> it's upsetting aatch that that is a true fact now
[23:15:23] <fmtq> like deadset, it upsetsme.
[23:15:24] <fkaa> i'm blazing fast now! :D
[23:15:36] <fmtq> NZ and AU used to be mostly equal.
[23:15:46] <fmtq> and then AU was like "hahah Italian fascism is erotic"
[23:15:51] <fmtq> later that very same lifetim
[23:15:53] <fmtq> nightmar.
[23:15:59] <fmtq> why is my e key not working for shit 
[23:16:27] <aatch> fmtq, yeah, I ocassionally look at the other english-speaking countries and go: "You know, I'm pretty happy here".
[23:16:51] <fmtq> NZ is the best of the anglo westminster traditions
[23:16:54] <fmtq> you accidentally a win
[23:17:26] <aatch> fmtq, yeah, John Key seems to be making an effort to bring us in line, but fortunately it's not working very well.
[23:17:40] <fmtq> fun thing about NZ
[23:17:46] <fmtq> Maoris won't tolerate anglo shit
[23:17:53] <fmtq> if it gets shit enough they will just fuck the system
[23:18:15] <fmtq> like, I am proud as a human that the maori are as strong as they are 
[23:18:27] <fmtq> they are on the up and up
[23:18:41] <eddyb> niconii: what should show up when you start it?
[23:18:59] <eddyb> niconii: I get a black screen and I'm not sure what I'm missing
[23:19:00] <aatch> A lot of early NZ history is pretty cool. The Maori have always been pretty chill.
[23:19:14] <fmtq> no
[23:19:15] <fmtq> well 
[23:19:18] <fmtq> yes except
[23:19:19] <fmtq> whitey was like
[23:19:21] <fmtq> HAHA THIS IS MINE
[23:19:25] <fmtq> and Maori were like
[23:19:25] <eddyb> just played my first TF2 match :P. that game works, anyways
[23:19:27] <fmtq> "eat spear motherfucker"
[23:19:29] <aatch> fmtq, well yeah, but before that.
[23:19:33] <fmtq> and whitey screamed "TREATY"
[23:19:40] <fmtq> maori laughed and said "haha maybe"
[23:19:44] <fmtq> then met, and said okay
[23:19:52] <fmtq> whitey then wrote it in English and Maori
[23:20:12] <fmtq> but they bullshitted so much of it that a recent court case by the Whites found the maori never gave up sovereignty 
[23:20:19] <fmtq> and the court basically declared itself invalida
[23:20:26] <fmtq> that was like, the highlight of my life 
[23:20:38] <fmtq> a westminster court declared _itself_ invalid

[23:21:43] <niconii> eddyb: so you're not missing much if you don't see that bit
[23:21:44] <eddyb> so that that use a font or something?
[23:21:55] <eddyb> niconii: the problem is I'm not seeing *anything*
[23:22:02] <eddyb> actually, it's not fonts
[23:22:12] <aatch> fmtq, my favorite is that they treated Christian Missionaries as status symbols. They happily let them teach people how to read and similar, but it wasn't until a massive 'flu outbreak that they took any of the god stuff seriously.
[23:22:15] <eddyb> I managed to leave something in the window, it's not redrawing :(
[23:22:30] <fmtq> aatch: NZ has a gang problem now 
[23:22:38] <fmtq> the english ruined everything
[23:22:40] <eddyb> (the steam overlay can leave shadows because nothing is drawing to the window)
[23:22:46] <fmtq> they ruined london the most
[23:22:51] <fmtq> and they ruined the english language the rest

[23:23:06] <fmtq> I've been in almost everyone country in western europe
