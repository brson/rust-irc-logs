[14:47:05] <bjz> TheHydroImpulse: http://tympanus.net/Development/ProgressButtonStyles/
[14:47:15] <bjz> I love the whimsy in some of these
[14:47:28] <bjz> "flip-open perspective" especially
[15:39:04] <cmr> bjz: css transforms 
[15:39:10] <cmr> make text look like crap, though
[15:39:15] <bjz> heh
[15:39:20] <bjz> really?
[15:39:46] <bjz> perhaps you just don't notice it much there
[15:40:10] <bjz> also I'm on a retina display
[15:40:41] <cmr> http://imgur.com/d3Lwur9,vLJ5C0s
[15:40:48] <bjz> I'm guessing you don't get the hinting with transforms
[15:41:10] <cmr> looks like firefox just plain isn't doing antialiasing
[15:41:11] <bjz> ack!
[15:41:45] <cmr> I wonder if something is fubar with my profile
[15:41:50] <cmr> I haven't cleaned it out in a while...
[15:42:04] <bjz> it looks like it is doing antialiasing. but ff's font rendering has always been ugly compared to chrome and safari... on osx at least
[15:42:23] <cmr> well look at the box, too.
[15:42:37] <bjz> I don't really notice it any more though - again high dpi gets rid of a ton of that
[15:42:38] <cmr> you can't tell me that's antialiased :P
[15:42:50] <bjz> it looks blurry to me
[15:42:55] <cmr> I see steps.
[15:42:58] <bjz> http://i.imgur.com/d3Lwur9.png
[15:42:59] <cmr> "jaggies"
[15:43:05] <cmr> that's chromium
[15:43:09] <cmr> look at the second image
[15:43:11] <bjz> hmm
[15:43:13] <cmr> sorry, should have clarified
[15:43:17] <bjz> let me look in PS
[15:44:52] <bjz> http://i.imgur.com/JrApXX4.png
[15:44:57] <bjz> anti-aliasing
[15:45:15] <cmr> again, that's chromium
[15:45:20] <bjz> the text shows no sub-pixel hinting though
[15:46:00] <bjz> if you are on a normal dpi display sub-pixel rendering is super important for clear text
[15:46:29] <bjz> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subpixel_rendering
[15:47:00] <bjz> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Subpixel_demonstration_%28Quartz%29.png
[15:49:13] <cmr> I know how font rasterization works :(
[15:50:57] <bjz> sorry
[15:51:00] <bjz> :P
[15:51:30] <cmr> http://i.imgur.com/vLJ5C0s.png
[15:51:32] <cmr> specifically.
[15:52:48] <bjz> ACKYGU
[15:52:52] <bjz> yuck yuck
[15:52:56] <cmr> yes.
[15:53:00] <cmr> this is what I was referring to :P
[15:53:08] <cmr> you were looking at  the chromium image, which isn't bad
[15:53:12] <cmr> the second one was firefox
[16:05:15] <bjz> yeah
[16:05:34] <bjz> firefox aurora on osx looks beautiful to me
[16:05:44] <bjz> (with that example)
[16:05:52] * cmr updates aurora
