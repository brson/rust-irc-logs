[01:09:43] <XMPPwocky> hm
[01:10:50] <XMPPwocky> xoring a float with 0x80000000 is equivalent to negation
[01:11:01] <XMPPwocky> you learn neat tricks from looking at decompiled code
[01:11:55] <geofft> oh, 'cause that's the sign bit 
[01:11:57] <geofft> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format 
[01:12:40] <XMPPwocky> yeah it showed up as v54.x = (unsigned __int128)_mm_xor_ps((__m128)(unsigned int)v56.x, (__m128)(unsigned int)xmmword_B06DF0);
[01:12:58] <tiffany> interesting
[01:13:00] <XMPPwocky> where xmmword_B06DF0 is 0x80000000800000008000000080000000
[01:13:04] <tiffany> ~n + 1 is negation for integers

[01:40:23] <tiffany> it seems like it would be a waste to spend more than one cycle doing measely negation
[01:40:41] <tiffany> whereas a dedicated instruction for FP would probably be a waste since it's so simple

[01:49:27] <FreeFull> But x86 has a dedicated instruction anyway, which I think has a shorter encoding
[01:49:48] <tiffany> hmm
[01:50:04] <tiffany> isn't there some kind of serious thing against number literals in x86 assembly, because they bloat instruction sizes?

[04:16:48] <cmr> Does anyone have a salient argument that mathematics is invented, not discovered?
[04:18:45] <Mutabah> cmr: It's a concept, therefore it was invented
[04:19:10] <Mutabah> It's a concept that is VERY useful for modeling and predicting discovered systems, but it's still an invention
[04:20:36] <XMPPwocky> hm
[04:21:23] <XMPPwocky> so map vs territory sort of thing?
[04:21:33] <cmr> My current stance is that the consequences of our systems are discovered but the ways of reasoning we use are invented. Though I think that doesn't adequately explain that you can both derive theorems from axioms and axioms from desired theorems.
[04:22:19] <geofft> so, I don't really believe that words have meaning in isolation (at least not enough of a meaning to be worth arguing over) 
[04:22:45] <geofft> is there something that uses the concepts of "invented" and "discovered" separately that you wish to apply "math" to? 
[04:23:18] <geofft> like an argument of the form "All invented things are P. Math is invented. Therefore math is P."? 
[04:23:27] <cmr> As one application, consider intellectual property law.
[04:24:23] <geofft> aha! law's a field where words definitely have meanings, and they definitely don't match the meanings in the rest of life :) 
[04:25:20] <Astrum|Lap> I'd say the difference between invented and discovered is merely a product of our limited language
[04:25:37] <XMPPwocky> any idea how to turn off gmail's like... tab thing
[04:25:51] <XMPPwocky> it used to be great, now it has decided to send github emails to the bitbucket or something
[04:26:03] <cmr> XMPPwocky: there's a setting somewhere that turns it off but I can never remember what it was and now I don't use gmail anymore to tell you :)
[04:26:15] <geofft> I'm trying to think if I believe that the formulation of physical laws (which are definitely models, not reality) should get you IP rights 
[04:26:18] <cmr> I recall it being only vaguely connected to the vfeature itself.
[04:26:40] <XMPPwocky> i keep wanting to switch off gmail and then it's like "oh i'll just set up sendmail" and then i'm crying and rocking back and forth on the floor
[04:26:44] <geofft> like the rocket equation or the ideal gas law 
[04:27:01] <cmr> XMPPwocky: I just gave up and forked over money to fastmail.
[04:27:03] <geofft> I _think_ no 
[04:27:22] <geofft> yeah, I'm using pobox.com. I also hear good things about fastmail 
[04:27:36] <cmr> pobox was the other one I considered
[04:27:57] <XMPPwocky> i'm sure there's a market for a piece of software that just receives mail and sticks it in your mbox or whatever
[04:28:19] <XMPPwocky> i'm pretty sure it'd be easier to set up an actual postal service than most mailer daemons
[04:29:13] <niconii> cmr: why would you pay money for fastmail when you could pay money for... http://keymail.com/
[04:29:42] <geofft> I don't trust myself to be able to run a server with the reliability guarantees I want out of my email server 
[04:29:50] <geofft> like not acceptting mail and then crashing without a backup 
[04:29:52] <cmr> I used to have an exim4/ssmtp/notmuch setup that I was content with until my email server was down for a week and I didn't notice.
[04:29:57] <XMPPwocky> http://www.linuxhomenetworking.com/wiki/index.php/Quick_HOWTO_:_Ch21_:_Configuring_Linux_Mail_Servers

[04:30:07] <XMPPwocky> 13000 words
[04:31:11] <XMPPwocky> i feel like  a large reason all this mail stuff is targeted at complex sites is that it's a vicious cycle; the small users just give up and use webmail
[04:31:46] <XMPPwocky> i almost just want to learn Go and write a mailer 
[04:31:50] <XMPPwocky> or even do it in Rust, idk
[04:32:11] <cmr> unfortunately the various protocols are quite not-simple.
[04:32:11] <geofft> yeah, I suspect there's an underserved market here 
[04:32:11] <XMPPwocky> but i figure if there's one project that Go's a good fit for, it's probably that
[04:32:30] <cmr> to implement in a manner compatible with existing mail software
[04:32:32] <geofft> specifically an email server that's really good at making sure it reliably writes out mail if it claims to have acceptted it 
[04:32:51] <niconii> cmr: can fastmail provide you with the best in electronic mail service that 1999 has to offer? what if your on-line dial-up provider goes defunct?

[04:39:33] <niconii> like, if it still exists, like
[04:39:39] <niconii> that has to mean people like
[04:39:46] <niconii> actually still pay for keymail, right?
[04:39:55] <niconii> like, that's the only explanation i can think of
[04:40:33] <cmr> I dunno, it could easily be the case that it's just running on a forgotten web host somewhere, sucking a few dollars a month from someone's ignored bank account.
[04:40:48] <niconii> i guess when they say keymail gives you a permanent email address
[04:40:50] <niconii> they really fucking mean it
[04:40:52] <XMPPwocky> none of the web forms have csrf tokens
[04:40:57] <XMPPwocky> i'm not sure what i was expecting
[04:41:16] <cmr> was csrf even invented yet? ;)
[04:41:39] <cmr> lol according to wikipedia, "no"
[04:41:43] <XMPPwocky> i have a habit of just idly checking for csrf tokens on interesting pages
[04:41:43] <cmr> (2001)
[04:41:51] <XMPPwocky> easily 20% of them don't
[04:42:01] <cmr> csrf is one of those things you either know about or don't
[04:42:40] <XMPPwocky> yeah, nasty gotcha
[04:43:00] <cmr> I guess you can say that about most security issues.
[04:43:32] <XMPPwocky> especially on the web, for some reason
[04:43:46] <XMPPwocky> clickjacking, xss, etc
[04:45:18] <niconii> anyway, i found this when i was idly thinking about what a successor to email might be called, something with encryption more thoroughly built in, and "keymail" was something that came to mind
[04:45:26] <cmr> heh
[04:45:28] <niconii> so i googled it out of curiosity and uh
[04:45:48] <niconii> yeah this is just about as far from "successor to email" as you could possibly get

[04:49:40] <XMPPwocky> and then stuff like having access to it over my phone; i suppose smtp/imap will do
[04:50:01] <XMPPwocky> yeah i guess just a "hey sit over here, receive and send emails, and listen for smtp/imap too"
[04:50:04] <cmr> I think email is one of those things where once you know enough about it you either stop caring and deal with sendmail/postfix/whatever, or stop caring and just use webmail.
[04:50:38] <XMPPwocky> i wonder if there's like, a survey of mx records
[04:50:40] <geofft> the other thing you could do is let (e.g.) Gmail accept your email, but immediately copy it to a different IMAP server 
[04:50:40] <cmr> (I certainly fall in the later bucket, but would appreciate a self-hosted turn-key thing...)

[04:50:59] <XMPPwocky> and who's just using google apps or whatever

[07:47:12] <cmr> it'd certainly be silly to exclude it :)
[07:48:43] <mrmonday> hmm
[07:49:08] <cmr> eg one idea that comes to mind is local uni CS mailing lists
[07:50:10] <mrmonday> aye, if I actually organise this I'll get in touch with the 500 uni's we have in Glasgow/get the various working folk I know to spread it through the office etc
[07:52:50] <mrmonday> I'll contact some venues next week once I'm no longer swamped and see what I can do
[07:53:16] <mrmonday> hmm, uni-wise might be a problem actually, it'll be the middle of exam season

[15:04:46] <tiffany> nice
[15:04:50] <tiffany> falling back to vesa, I imagine
[15:04:57] <scott> this alloy language that showed up on /r/programming looks like it cherry-picked syntax from Rust, Go, and Jon Blow's language: https://github.com/alloy-lang/alloy/blob/master/tests/misc/virtualmachine.aly
[15:05:09] <tiffany> libfud: what OS/distro?
[15:05:09] <libfud_> I think so, I forget
[15:05:10] <scott> mostly Rust, but []int types from Go and ^pointers from Jon Blow's lang
[15:05:16] <libfud_> tiffany: OpenSuse
[15:05:18] <huon> scott: https://github.com/alloy-lang/alloy/blob/master/docs/REFERENCE.md#usize
[15:05:20] <tiffany> oh
[15:05:42] <tiffany> my best guess was going to be that you're running a nonstandard kernel and so everything's gone fucko
[15:05:45] <tiffany> I have that happen on arch
[15:05:59] <libfud_> tiffany: oh, I'm using propriatary nvidia drivers
[15:06:00] <tiffany> I have to recompile bbswitch every time linux-ck updates
[15:06:05] <libfud_> but since I haven't played games in a while
[15:06:23] <libfud_> I may revert back to the Xorg ones
[15:06:38] <libfud_> I guess the last time I updated
[15:06:52] <libfud_> there wasn't a new version for what I got
[15:07:01] <libfud_> I see a new one in this update though
[15:07:09] *** libfud_ is now known as libfud
[15:07:27] <tiffany> it's an unhappy surprise to find that my computer is running at 70-80C because the nvidia gpu is on
[15:07:42] <tiffany> it would be much worse if I was running actual drivers that I had to update every time the kernel updates
[15:08:39] <scott> watching Rust develop has made me very aware of certain parsing issues
[15:08:54] <scott> like requiring `let` so the parser knows a pattern is coming as opposed to an expression
[15:09:04] <scott> I notice alloy lacks that
[15:09:43] <tiffany> what
[15:09:49] <tiffany> name: type; is a valid statement in this language?
[15:09:54] <scott> I think so
[15:09:55] <tiffany> what is the point of an uninitialized immutable value
[15:10:08] <scott> well, I've mostly seen name: type = value;
[15:10:13] <libfud> I thought that rust could do that
[15:10:17] <libfud> provided that by the time you use it
[15:10:20] <libfud> it has been initialized
[15:10:27] <scott> Rust allows that
[15:10:33] <tiffany> I think rust has let mut foo : type; but I don't know if it has that for immutable variables
[15:10:39] <libfud> yeah it does
[15:10:53] <scott> playbot: let foo; if true { foo = 2; } else { foo = 3; }; foo
[15:10:54] -playbot- 2

[15:16:22] <scott> fn sqrt(mut x: double): mut double;

[15:16:44] <huon> can anyone explain why one would annotate return values as mutable??
[15:16:46] <scott> I can usually guess language semantics. can't see why you would need mut here
[15:16:57] <huon> yeah
[15:17:12] <huon> maybe the return value is implicitly a pointer or something (?!)
[15:17:20] <libfud> why would you do that
[15:17:21] <libfud> like
[15:17:29] <scott> huon: that seems likely
[15:17:35] <scott> but that doesn't explain the argument
[15:17:50] <tiffany> maybe it's like that horrible const return value in C
[15:17:52] <tiffany> but by default
[15:18:39] <scott> const on returns and arguments in C are pure evil

[15:23:58] <libfud> for what purpose
[15:24:14] <scott> it just looks like Rust-but-closer-to-C to me
[15:24:18] <libfud> right
[15:24:26] <libfud> semicolons on return statements
[15:24:30] <scott> at the very least it's cute to me for being the first Rust-derived language I've seen
[15:24:32] <libfud> and explicitly saying return
[15:24:42] <libfud> I thought there have already been plenty?
[15:24:46] <tiffany> you could probably call my language rust-derived
[15:24:48] <libfud> such as swift ;)
[15:24:50] <tiffany> but it is not as far along

[15:25:25] <Zoxc> That's what you don't copy

[15:28:12] <libfud> I wonder if Alloy even has ADT
[15:28:47] <tiffany> I am going to have type parameters use the same syntax as calling functions, which is just space separated tokens, because concatenative

[15:30:46] <tiffany> scott: one side effect of the syntax I use is that all currying has to be explicit, so
[15:30:51] <scott> has anyone made the mistake of header files since C, ignoring C-derived languages/
[15:31:01] <libfud> oh
[15:31:04] <libfud> I was about to say C++
[15:31:05] <libfud> lol
[15:31:16] <libfud> I don't think in C's time you could have called them a mistake
[15:31:19] <tiffany> Int [Array]i, [Int] [Array] cat -> [Int Array]
[15:31:20] <libfud> I think then they were a necessity
[15:31:21] <scott> C++ and Obj-C have them (I don't really know Obj-C - it has something weird)
[15:31:29] <libfud> but I wish that something better for C would have emerged as tech progressed
[15:31:42] <scott> C is anti-change

[15:36:21] <niconii> that might be why then, rust was still a moving target
[15:36:36] <niconii> hard to build another language on top of that
[15:36:38] <scott> Rust was amazingly unstable then
[15:36:42] <libfud> no kidding
[15:36:57] <libfud> my rcalc project is essentially scrubbed right now til I buckle down and fix it
[15:36:58] <scott> I think that's pre int -> isize

[15:37:11] <niconii> scott: it is, yeah

[15:37:57] <libfud> >The languages design is influenced heavily by languages like Rust, and C. We even considered implementing ownership, but we thought that might be a bit useless, considering we'd just be making a shitty Rust compiler.

[15:38:04] <libfud> man
[15:38:06] <scott> you just gotta market it right
[15:38:09] <libfud> why not implement ownership
[15:38:10] <libfud> that's like
[15:38:15] <libfud> one of the best things about rust

[15:38:26] <lahwran> haunt?
[15:38:27] <scott> libfud: but their reasoning is right
[15:38:28] <lahwran> lol
[15:38:34] <scott> why just write a shittier Rust?
[15:38:40] <scott> I had the same thought about my language
[15:38:54] <scott> I don't want to have the same goals as Rust
[15:39:00] <lahwran> I want ownership for higher-level languages
[15:39:10] <lahwran> ones that maybe don't need the memory management
[15:39:10] <libfud> my feeling is why write a language at all unless you have something you want that can not be easily expressed in a current language
[15:39:13] <libfud> like

[15:40:26] <libfud> I see
[15:40:28] <libfud> my last name is Allen
[15:40:38] <libfud> so I thought that was some kind of weird shot at me
[15:40:48] <lahwran> no no
[15:40:52] <lahwran> allen short is a person
[15:40:53] <scott> lahwran: Idris has experimental support for owned types and borrows like in Rust
[15:40:59] <libfud> yeah, google revealed that to me
[15:41:03] <lahwran> wait what
[15:41:07] <scott> but then, everything is experimental in Idris, and it's more high level than you probably meant
[15:41:07] <lahwran> isn't idris purely functional
[15:41:10] <scott> yes
[15:41:11] <tiffany> it is, lahwran
[15:41:25] <lahwran> how does ownership/borrowing work in a purely functional language
[15:41:27] <tiffany> you know what's even better?
[15:41:28] <scott> the cool thing about unique/owned types in a purely functional language is that they allow safe mutation-in-place
[15:41:35] <tiffany> owned types and borrows are implemented as part of the standard library, afaik
[15:41:36] <scott> you can forget about immutability just like in Rust
[15:41:38] <tiffany> they're not built into the language
[15:41:43] <tiffany> they're built using the type system
[15:41:46] <scott> tiffany: there is some built in support iirc
[15:41:49] <tiffany> oh
[15:41:58] <scott> I'm not sure how much
[15:42:08] <tiffany> I imagine at least optimisations
[15:42:15] <scott> and some of it is generalized, like auto-borrowing using implicit definitions
[15:42:16] <tiffany> idk if there's anything actually required to implement them
[15:42:32] <libfud> sometimes I wonder how one could reconcile the differences between something like Scheme and Rust
[15:42:50] <tiffany> well
[15:43:02] <scott> it's interesting to look at attempts to type languages like Scheme/Racket and Clojure
[15:43:02] <tiffany> my language is, currently, basically scheme written backwards without the parens

[15:47:13] <tiffany> niconii: how close is rust to FORTRAN?
[15:47:17] <libfud> I've said this before
[15:47:24] <tiffany> they're both the same paradigm, I guess?
[15:47:32] <lahwran> rust and fortran are about five feet apart
[15:47:34] <libfud> but I'll never stop being blown away that garbage collection was invented in *1959
[15:47:48] <libfud> s/*1959/*1959*
[15:47:50] <scott> if you're unfamiliar with concatenative languages, they all seem pretty much like Forth
[15:47:55] <Astrum|Lap> presentism, libfud =P
[15:48:01] <scott> but forth is really really low level in comparison to most
[15:48:37] <scott> in some sense forth is lower-level than C, but can be built up to a higher level due to its extreme extensibility

[15:50:14] <scott> :thumbsup:
[15:50:18] <lahwran> what is a concatenative lang
[15:50:30] <scott> you might have heard them called stack-based languages
[15:50:37] <scott> RPN is a related idea
[15:50:48] <libfud> I dislike RPN
[15:50:49] <tiffany> lahwran: a concatenative language is a language in which the default method of writing programs is concatenating expressions : imagine haskell, except the only operator is (.)
[15:50:50] <libfud> I get the idea
[15:50:52] <libfud> but it's not how I think
[15:51:07] <tiffany> 1 2 + -> 3
[15:51:18] <tiffany> "foo" print -> show "foo" on the terminal
[15:51:36] <tiffany> I made a simplification, also
[15:51:45] <scott> the really cool property is that you can (ignoring macros/builtins) cut and paste any bit of code into a new function and replace the cut section with the function name
[15:51:52] <tiffany> (.) is only a subset of the possible arrangement of combinators in concatenative languages
[15:51:53] <scott> no mucking with variable names or flow control
[15:52:10] <tiffany> you can also compile in parallel for the same reason
[15:52:16] <lahwran> okay and what's interesting about this
[15:52:20] <scott> but that property isn't worthwhile enough to use concatenative style throughout the language imo
[15:52:28] <tiffany> lahwran: you know all the reasons people love lisp so much?
[15:52:32] <libfud> (+ 1 (* 2 3) (/ 4 5) (- (+ 6 7) (- 8 9)))
[15:52:35] <lahwran> not really no
[15:52:40] <lahwran> I hear that people are nuts overi t
[15:52:41] <lahwran> it*
[15:52:46] <lahwran> but I don't see why they like it over haskell
[15:52:48] <tiffany> that you can abuse macros, that it has no bothersome syntax to worry about, that library functions look the same as builtin control flow
[15:52:55] <lahwran> oh
[15:52:55] <scott> concatenative languages are purer than lisp in some sense
[15:53:02] <tiffany> yeah
[15:53:03] <libfud> how would you represent that as a stack
[15:53:12] <scott> forth is, like I said, incredibly simple and low level, but it can build up to anything you want
[15:53:26] <lahwran> what do you mean by pure
[15:53:27] <tiffany> libfud: 2 3 * 4 5 / 6 7 + 8 9 - - +
[15:53:28] <scott> libfud: arithmetic is the bane of both lisp and concatenative langs :p
[15:53:38] <scott> lahwran: very conceptually simple / small base language
[15:53:39] <lahwran> in the sense it sounds like, I think one could reasonably argue that NAND is the most pure possible
[15:53:53] <libfud> scott: I know, but I think it makes more sense when you look at in lisp
[15:54:08] <tiffany> I prefer RPN
[15:54:11] <scott> lahwran: sure, but this is pure without tipping over the scale so far into not-human-readable
[15:54:19] <libfud> since you also have the nicety of (+ i1 i2 i3 ... in)
[15:54:37] <niconii> libfud: 1 2 3 * + 4 5 / + 6 7 + 8 9 - - +
[15:54:45] <scott> libfud: the real answer is in factor you can use a macro like [ARITH 1 + 2 * 3 / 5 + 7 ] or whatever
[15:54:51] <niconii> tiffany: think you missed the (+ 1 ... ) wrapping it

[15:55:39] <tiffany> which makes me sad
[15:55:49] <libfud> infix is crap
[15:56:07] <libfud> even for natural language it leads to those stupid ambiguities that everyone uses as a troll
[15:56:19] <scott> I have a note in an old ideas.txt about a semi-concatenative language where individual expressions were concatenative but were put together in a more traditional language
[15:56:26] <scott> I should explore that idea more
[15:56:31] <scott> not sure if it's worthwhile
[15:56:31] <tiffany> precedence in infix makes user-provided operators painful
[15:56:41] <lahwran> seems like it's more of a precedence problem, libfud
[15:56:51] <lahwran> there's nothing inherently ambiguous about infix
[15:56:52] <tiffany> in lisp and concatenative languages you just expose the symbols as identifier characters and call it a day
[15:57:03] <tiffany> lahwran: you don't need complex precedence tables in PN or RPN
[15:57:06] <scott> ^ that's one reason I use the word pure
[15:57:08] <tiffany> which you do in infix
[15:57:28] <scott> no special operator syntax, etc
[15:57:28] <scott> of course, pure isn't necessarily an upside
[15:57:32] <tiffany> like, you can't add new operators without specifying where in the infix precidence table they lie
[15:57:47] <tiffany> operators have no specialness compared to functions in lisp and concatenative languages
[15:58:06] <tiffany> which they do in infix languages like haskell
[15:58:26] <scott> to be fair, haskell makes them less special than in languages like C or Rust
[15:58:45] <libfud> the overloading of * must be a particular pain
[15:58:47] <scott> they're just a string of a certain set of symbols, like identifiers
[15:58:48] <libfud> in parsing
[15:59:04] <scott> libfud: not particularly
[15:59:15] <tiffany> lahwran: but yeah, think about how easy it is to parse lisp and concatenative languages
[15:59:26] <tiffany> the parser for my programming language is currently 250 lines of haskell
[15:59:31] <scott> libfud: when you're at the start of an expression, * can only mean deref
[15:59:34] <tiffany> and that includes syntax sugar and parsing numbers
[15:59:40] <libfud> tiffany: sounds like you could trim it a bit ;)
[15:59:49] <scott> at the tail end of an expression, * can only mean binary operator
[15:59:53] <tiffany> libfud: I didn't use any of the parsing libraries
[15:59:57] <tiffany> it's all hand-written
[16:00:09] <libfud> I know, I was joking
[16:00:21] <libfud> I think the original base of rcalc was somewhere around that
[16:00:28] <niconii> in forth it's literally just left to right, top to bottom for the most part
[16:00:29] <libfud> before I screwed up and made it way too complex
[16:00:45] <libfud> that sounds nice
[16:00:49] <tiffany> niconii: I think defining words is special, is anything else?
[16:00:54] <libfud> niconii: what are the beg exceptions
[16:00:57] <niconii> well, some words will take the next word and have the interpreter skip it
[16:00:59] <scott> niconii: until you hit parsing words that run arbitrary code to modify the parse
[16:01:12] <niconii> words like : or ' for instance
[16:01:12] <scott> or words that drop into compiler mode from interpreter mode or vice versa
[16:01:15] <niconii> scott: yeah

[16:12:57] <libfud> that will solve everything
[16:13:00] <libfud> :P
[16:13:15] <tiffany> I would actually prefer to use a radix tree
[16:13:52] <tiffany> they have an O(bits) worst case complexity, so anything with constant key lengths is O(1)
[16:14:01] <tiffany> whereas hash tables are prone to collisions in the best of cases
[16:14:57] <tiffany> that combined with compile-time string interning would be very fast, I think
[16:15:42] <tiffany> well
[16:15:52] <tiffany> sometimes you can make collisions rare with hash tables
[16:16:08] <tiffany> but that is usually a tradeoff between time spent in your hashing function and space used for empty slots in the buckets
[16:16:48] <niconii> hmm, colorforth is a pretty strange language, come to think of it, and i'm not just talking about the "source code colors have actual consequential meaning" bit
[16:16:55] <libfud> I really need to read the dragon book
[16:17:03] <niconii> it makes some definite improvements on forth, but at the same time... it's far lower-level than forth is
[16:17:32] <libfud> niconii: wait, the source code is actually colored?
[16:17:45] <niconii> libfud: yes, hence the name
[16:18:05] <libfud> can you write with some other way of specifying the color?
[16:18:14] <libfud> what if you're colorblind?
[16:18:15] <tiffany> reminds me of stropping in algol
[16:18:20] <niconii> libfud: red is a word definition, yellow is interpreted, green is compiled
[16:18:37] <niconii> libfud: chuck moore suggested different font styles in that case, bold, italic, etc.
[16:18:44] <libfud> ah
[16:19:19] <tiffany> it depends on how colour blind you are and the colour scheme pretty massively
[16:19:26] <libfud> I am actually red green deficient, but not to the point where I can't distinguish them if they're bright
[16:19:47] <tiffany> like if you're just red-green colourblind, then make sure to use differing shades of red and green, so you can go off of luminance instead of colour
[16:19:48] <libfud> but, dim traffic lights, for example, are annoying for me
[16:20:09] <niconii> libfud: then lucky you, because colorforth just uses flatout #ff0000 and #00ff00
[16:20:09] <tiffany> traffic lights are pretty awful
[16:20:13] <tiffany> they're always washed out colours
[16:20:16] <tiffany> which makes it really difficult

[16:21:26] <tiffany> which is going to screw me over when entering territories where they arbitrarily mix up the ordering
[16:21:29] <libfud> luckly that's very straighforward
[16:21:35] <libfud> since there're only three
[16:21:38] <libfud> oh
[16:21:39] <niconii> anyway, colorforth is simple enough that once you understand it you can just go write a colorforth
[16:21:45] <libfud> hm, I didn't consider other countries
[16:21:56] <niconii> so if the colors don't suit you, just choose your own

[16:24:29] <niconii> ahaha
[16:25:34] <niconii> colorforth is pretty silly to run on a pc, honestly, but
[16:25:46] <niconii> where it really shines is on the ga144
[16:26:04] <libfud> is that the custom architecture built for it?
[16:26:11] <libfud> where it's like 5bit registers or something crazy?
[16:26:20] <niconii> yeah
[16:26:23] <niconii> 18-bit
[16:26:28] <libfud> ah
[16:26:46] <niconii> anyway, it's a chip with 144 tiny cores, and they communicate not via protocols, but by streaming code to each other
[16:26:53] <libfud> so a 'forth' byte is 18 bits?
[16:26:57] <tiffany> oh dear
[16:27:30] <libfud> what, should I have said word instead?
[16:27:35] <niconii> well, on the ga144, yes, but usually with forth a "cell" is a machine-sized integer
[16:28:02] <niconii> though typically 16-bits minimum
[16:28:20] <libfud> so
[16:28:29] <libfud> what kind of floating point numbers does it use
[16:28:30] <libfud> uh
[16:28:34] <libfud> IEEE 774?

[16:31:52] <niconii> oh, and it's pretty fast too
[16:31:55] <niconii> the problem is just
[16:32:01] <niconii> figuring out how to program the damn thing
[16:32:30] <tiffany> it seems like the best thing is running large actor systems
[16:33:09] <niconii> it's pretty interesting, honestly
[16:33:30] <niconii> you can fit multiple instructions within a single word, so like
[16:33:38] <niconii> you can actually do small loops inside a register
[16:33:45] <niconii> no ram, no rom, just inside the register
[16:35:21] <niconii> (that's actually part of how you load code from one core to another, you just do a loop to read one word and write it to ram)
[16:36:18] <tiffany> huh
[16:36:44] <niconii> also, the chip has no clock, everything is async
[16:37:01] *** Quits: Astrum|Lap (Astrum|Lap@moz-7enfbr.co.comcast.net) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[16:37:02] <tiffany> this is pretty neat sounding
[16:37:11] <tiffany> what are the specs for individual cores?
[16:38:25] <niconii> well, that is the thing, i did say these cores were tiny, so we're talking, like
[16:38:49] <niconii> 64 words of rom and 64 words of ram, so that's like
[16:39:00] <niconii> 144 bytes each
[16:39:18] <tiffany> oh
[16:39:19] <lahwran> wait, async chip?
[16:39:31] <tiffany> those would have to be some pretty tiny actors
[16:40:18] <niconii> lahwran: yup
[16:43:37] <niconii> lahwran: there's actually a few instructions where you need to put nops before them to let the alu settle
[16:47:01] <niconii> ahh, also, one thing about the ga144
[16:47:16] <niconii> because these cores are so tiny, their instruction set is pretty limited
[16:48:23] <niconii> so the only arithmetic/bitwise operators are and, xor, +, and *+ (multiply step, which you'd use in a loop to multiply two numbers)
[16:48:52] <niconii> oh, and not
[16:48:58] <tiffany> oh my
[16:49:08] <niconii> anyway, so like, earlier tiffany mentioned that ~a + 1 was the same as negation?
[16:49:11] <tiffany> O(N) multiplication?
[16:49:22] <niconii> but you actually have to do that to subtract with this
[16:49:42] <tiffany> do they do that in order to bump the cycle count of the ALU higher than it'd be otherwise?
[16:50:32] <niconii> tiffany: not entirely sure, but i think it's more a matter of wanting to make the chip as simple as possible
[16:50:47] <tiffany> oh
[16:50:51] <tiffany> optimising for die size?
[16:50:55] <niconii> also, multiplication is O(N), but on the bright side, you can multiply to arbitrary bit lengths
[16:50:58] *** Joins: Astrum|Lap (Astrum|Lap@moz-7enfbr.co.comcast.net)
[16:51:20] <niconii> tiffany: or something like that, anyway
[16:51:36] <tiffany> I suppose that's important when you're trying to shove as many cores as possible onto the chip
[16:51:39] <Yurume> that is like saying x86 has a built-in bignum thanks to AAA, AAD, AAM and AAD instructions
[16:51:42] <tiffany> how small are these things anyway?
[16:51:42] <Yurume> ;)
[16:52:03] <tiffany> seeing how you could fit over a million 6502-sized CPUs into the die space of a modern x86 CPU
[16:52:16] <tiffany> and a 6502 definitely has more opcodes than that
[16:52:25] <tiffany> although it's also 8-bit and doesn't include memory
[16:52:51] <niconii> the ga144 is 1cm x 1cm, a core is 241um x 523um
[16:53:15] <tiffany> yurume: decimal encoding? that has to be implemented in microcode
[16:53:17] <tiffany> there's no way it's not
[16:53:28] <tiffany> niconii: what feature size?
[16:53:50] <niconii> 180nm

[17:52:41] <Astrum|Lap> see what they've been up to
[17:52:42] <tiffany> I wouldn't think so, seeing how many rust-related domains there are
[17:52:52] <tiffany> and none of them seem to have Serbian-language versions, so it's not like .cat

[17:52:59] <scott> it's funny that there's no .js
[17:53:03] <Astrum|Lap> I'm sick of the 'latest and greatest' stuff

[17:53:25] <scott> in my view
[17:53:43] <Astrum|Lap> yes, but it has the potential to become the latest and greatest, or it'll shrivel and die if something else does
[17:53:49] <Astrum|Lap> the internet is so faddish
[17:53:49] <scott> it's not really any different from HN apart from the community size

[17:56:56] <Havvy> Astrum|Lap:  A good chunk of IRC is also very elitist.
[17:57:55] <Astrum|Lap> perhaps
[17:58:25] <scott> wherever I find myself on the internet I look for the good subset
[17:58:28] <Havvy> e.g. Freenode's decision to block the Mibbit client entirely.
[17:58:38] <scott>  /r/rust and /r/haskell are pretty good. reddit as a whole is pretty awful
[17:58:49] <scott> rust IRC is good, lots of other IRC channels are awful

[17:59:22] <Havvy> Astrum|Lap:  Would your rather we still be getting our information from newspapers?
[17:59:30] <scott> I'm not satisfied with lobste.rs and I've mostly given up on /r/programming and HN
[17:59:43] <Astrum|Lap> Havvy: no, but things move a lot quicker on the web
[17:59:58] <tiffany> there really are so many fads astrum
[17:59:59] <Havvy> I only go to /r/programming for the abject horror of it.
[18:00:06] <Astrum|Lap> /. -> digg (kinda) -> reddit -> HN -> lobste.rs -> ???
[18:00:15] <tiffany> what is lobste.rs?
[18:00:21] <Astrum|Lap> no idea
[18:00:25] <Astrum|Lap> I'm just using it as an example
[18:00:25] <scott> small HN clone, basically
[18:00:28] <Havvy> tiffany:  lobste.rs is an invite only HN.
[18:00:30] <tiffany> oh
[18:00:31] <scott> decent community for now
[18:00:31] <Astrum|Lap> all of this in the span of ~10 years
[18:00:48] <tiffany> havvy: mibbit is really more trouble than it's worth
[18:00:55] <scott>  /r/programming has some decent links sometimes, but I always read the comments... why do I always read the comments?
[18:00:58] <tiffany> for every 1 person I find using mibbit, there's about 10 trolls
[18:01:05] <tiffany> and you can't ban the trolls without banning the whole of mibbit
[18:01:15] <tiffany> because they get a new hostmask every time they come back
[18:01:15] <Astrum|Lap> don't get me wrong, /. is horrible, digg is dead, and reddit is... well a very diverse grouping of disparate groups
[18:01:43] <scott>  /r/programming has way more subscribers than I would ever have expected
[18:01:46] <tiffany> it's not even a very good irc client
[18:01:54] <scott> and it shows in the quality of the subreddit
[18:01:55] <Havvy> tiffany:  If the network has it set up, Mibbit sends the IP of the user to the network as a transparent proxy.
[18:02:11] <scott> quality is inversely correlated with user count, unfortunately...
[18:02:24] <tiffany> havvy: doesn't that require adding cgi irc blocks to your ircd configs?
[18:02:28] <tiffany> because I do not trust mibbit with that power
[18:02:50] <Astrum|Lap> scott: ehhhhh
[18:03:02] <Astrum|Lap> there are several things at play here
[18:03:21] <scott> user count has served me well as a rule of thumb so far
[18:03:24] <tiffany> I haven't really ever seen any decent links on /r/programming
[18:03:38] *** bvssvni_ is now known as bvssvni

[18:03:41] <Havvy> tiffany:  I'm one of the people who maintains the Mibbit CGI:IRC database. I guarantee you, if it was ever abused, I'd be the first person to say something.
[18:03:41] <Astrum|Lap> first we've moved from curated content (newspapers, /., etc...) to crowsourced content
[18:04:07] <Astrum|Lap> but there are far less checks and balances in the latter
[18:04:09] <scott> hrm, true. curated content is harder to find these days
[18:04:11] <tiffany> well okay
[18:04:19] <scott> some online curated content is pretty good
[18:04:21] <Astrum|Lap> what does reddit offer? upvote and downvote
[18:04:22] <Astrum|Lap> that's it
[18:04:27] <scott> TWIR sort of counts for that
[18:05:08] <tiffany> there is a major shortage in good news sites for software developers
[18:05:21] <tiffany> dr dobbs shut down, and there's phoronix
[18:05:27] <tiffany> that's all I know about
[18:05:40] <scott> phoronix comments sections are worse than /r/programming and HN :/
[18:05:49] *** Joins: Hannibal_Smith (nico@moz-ucg29b.retail.telecomitalia.it)
[18:05:51] <scott> I followed phoronix for a while
[18:05:52] <tiffany> I usually avoid reading phoronix comments
[18:06:01] <tiffany> they're not on the same page so there isn't much temptation
[18:06:08] <Havvy> tiffany:  And I've seen clients that are a couple weeks old get entries on Freenode. Mibbit has been around for years and has not shown any abuse of trust with their cgi:irc permissions.
[18:06:27] <tiffany> oh
[18:06:33] <scott> I don't know why I'm drawn to comments. I guess I want to see some insightful commentary, and the article itself usually lacks it. but then, the comments sections have the opposite of insight
[18:06:34] <tiffany> I don't really know about how freenode operates their network
[18:06:45] <Astrum|Lap> also as time goes by it's becoming more and more necessary to stay on top of things
[18:06:49] <Astrum|Lap> everything is instant
[18:06:57] <tiffany> astrum: what is instant?
[18:07:07] <Astrum|Lap> the travel of information
[18:07:11] <tiffany> major revisions of protocols and specifications still move glacially
[18:07:26] <Astrum|Lap> I mean like news and developments in your specific industry
[18:07:35] <Hannibal_Smith> scott, I do the same, but with sited like LWN and some subreddit
[18:07:38] <tiffany> it is difficult to stay on top of the flood of javascript frameworks, yes
[18:07:42] <Astrum|Lap> my dad talked about trade journals for keeping up to date in his field
[18:07:58] <tiffany> the fields I'm interested don't move particularly fast
[18:08:08] <GaryOak_> If you are in academics then CS trade journals exist
[18:08:23] <Astrum|Lap> don't get me wrong, I look at a few journals
[18:08:33] <tiffany> interesting new papers on bsp trees come out every few years
[18:08:39] <scott> I have a large number of blogs that rarely update in RSS. I really like having that
[18:08:47] <tiffany> I have lots of blogs in rss too
[18:09:02] <tiffany> 40 of them, in fact
[18:09:09] <scott> I still get interesting posts about Factor every month, and I haven't cared about Factor in years. but the posts are still interesting
[18:09:13] <Astrum|Lap> I check molecular musings every few weeks, lol
[18:09:27] <Havvy> The general rule of JS frameworks is that there's a lot of them, and only keep up with ones you're interested in.
[18:09:46] <scott> lucky for me I'm not interested in JS at all, unless it's ES6, I suppose
[18:09:46] *** Joins: swgillespie (swgillespie@moz-upj.3un.220.167.IP)
[18:10:01] <Havvy> And ES6 moves as a glacial pace too.
[18:10:11] <Astrum|Lap> in either case, a lot of the stuff you see on proggit and HN would have been more traditionally curated and put into a journal monthly
[18:10:18] <scott> I heard it's supposed to standardize this summer
[18:10:21] <Astrum|Lap> (heavily curated)
[18:10:22] <tiffany> I have a theory that JS code accumulates technical debt so fast and scales so poorly to programming in the large that frameworks have  a half life of about a month before their developers go on to make a new framework
[18:10:28] <GaryOak_> JS frameworks pluck out the good stuff of what came before them, then add in poorly implemented good ideas
[18:10:46] <Havvy> tiffany:  Nah, it's just got so many developers who want to create their own framework.
[18:10:51] <Astrum|Lap> it just seems like we've offloaded that curation work from a group of people onto ourselves
[18:10:54] <scott> there are some things like the Monad Reader for Haskell... that's monthly, I think?
[18:10:58] <Astrum|Lap> for no real gain
[18:10:59] <scott> I should find more stuff of that kind
[18:11:08] <Havvy> And also so many developers that marketing alone can make a framework popular.
[18:11:41] <Havvy> Astrum|Lap:  There's no real "New York Times" for programming.
[18:12:06] <Astrum|Lap> that's my point though
[18:12:56] <scott> Rust should have a The &mut Journal with curated posts about different people's Rust projects in-depth by the authors themselves
[18:13:33] <scott> get the mio guy to explain mio in a post, someone to explain servo, piston, iron, whatever else is big
[18:13:41] <tiffany> with program listings
[18:13:55] <scott> put it in a monthly (or maybe slightly less often for now?) thing
[18:14:01] <Astrum|Lap> places like proggit and HN grow and there's a massive deluge in content that we ourselves have to sort through, as user count grows interests become more general and people flock to 'the next best thing'
[18:14:18] *** Quits: libfud (libfud@moz-p2rb38.eph2.ptd.net) (Quit: leaving)
[18:14:38] <Havvy> Hacker News also seems to have been taken over by Go enthusiasts.
[18:14:52] <scott> fads are really strong in crowdsourced news sites
[18:15:12] <Astrum|Lap> I rarely read HN anyway because most of the time it's just so bay area centric
[18:15:15] <scott> and the tech industry is strongly influenced by crowdsourced news, so the tech industry is strongly influenced by fads
[18:15:37] *** Joins: ogham (rally@moz-eqs.cqb.6.31.IP)
[18:15:46] <Astrum|Lap> and I do like that idea, scott 
[18:16:04] <scott> there's a lot of widespread misconceptions I see in HN and /r/programming comments
[18:16:11] <Havvy> Too many "Worse is Better" people. :(
[18:16:15] <Astrum|Lap> I'd love a rust journal
[18:16:33] <scott> the average user doesn't have a good understanding of C++ or why it's still king and why Rust matters - they think Rust is comparable to Go, Nim, D, etc
[18:16:51] <scott> the average user is, understandably, more concerned with web development, usually
[18:17:03] <Havvy> I don't even know how they thought Rust was comparable with Go in the first place.
[18:17:11] <geofft> it used to be, a long time ago 
[18:17:22] <geofft> alternatively, because they're both "replace C++" languages 
[18:17:24] <Hannibal_Smith> scott, a friend of mine was interested into Rust, simply because Mozilla behind and Servo
[18:17:26] <Hannibal_Smith> So...
[18:17:27] <scott> but these comparisons get repeated so often everyone thinks they actually make sense
[18:17:28] <geofft> just for very different definitions of "replace C++" 
[18:17:34] <Hannibal_Smith> It's really hard to judge :-P
[18:17:35] <Havvy> geofft:  I first learned about Rust during the Rust v.0.2 days.
[18:17:37] <geofft> I made a comment about this on HN, Iwonder if I can find it... 
[18:17:39] <scott> geofft: that's a good point
[18:17:53] <geofft> but one thing I learned separately is that Google internally uses C++ for web API backends, etc. 
[18:18:00] <scott> D, Nim, and Go do all bite off a subset of C++'s usecases
[18:18:08] <geofft> what us normal people would use Django / Rails / Flask / etc. for 
[18:18:08] <Astrum|Lap> anyway, go start a rust journal, scott 
[18:18:11] <Astrum|Lap> I'll read it =)
[18:18:13] <Hannibal_Smith> scott, IMHO more Java than C++
[18:18:17] <geofft> and they statically link things, and deploy them to containers 
[18:18:27] <geofft> and they want a better language for that 
[18:18:27] <scott> right, but Java bit off some of C++ originally
[18:18:35] <Hannibal_Smith> Good point
[18:18:38] <geofft> from that perspective, Go absolutely _is_ their "better C++", for their use case 
[18:18:44] <scott> but no one has gone for the no-GC world for a long time
[18:18:54] <scott> minimal runtime, whatever you want to call it
[18:19:00] <Astrum|Lap> let's be fair, C++ is a kitchen sink of a language
[18:19:06] <geofft> and doing things like being able to run as a dynamic library while linking the stdlib is totally not in their use case 
[18:19:13] <Astrum|Lap> everyone can improve a corner of it =P
[18:19:14] <Havvy> That's because a better no-GC language is a multi-million affair.
[18:19:19] <Hannibal_Smith> Astrum|Lap, that is one aspect that why C++ dev like it
[18:19:22] <scott> I see Go at Google replacing some C++ and some Python but not all of either
[18:19:24] <geofft> (also, C++'s stdlib is vaguely hard to use in a dynamic library anyway) 
[18:19:30] <zwarich> Havvy: Rust doesn't do as well on HN because Rust runs a vote ring
[18:19:43] <Havvy> "vote ring"?
[18:19:55] <Havvy> As in, the same people always upvote it?
[18:19:57] <zwarich> a bunch of people who all vote on similar things shortly after they get posted
[18:19:58] <zwarich> yeah
[18:20:02] <zwarich> HN penalizes that
[18:20:11] <lahwran> that's kind of a stupid way to solve that problem
[18:21:32] <geofft> remember that HN's goal is to draw regular readers, not to promote good discussion for its own sake 
[18:21:32] <Hannibal_Smith> <scott> but no one has gone for the no-GC world for a long time <-Thinking about it, I have read some PL researcher saying that GC is a solved problem and there is no more need of a on GC lang
[18:21:51] <lahwran> is there some way to undo the vote ring behavior, then?
[18:22:01] <GaryOak_> Rust has a higher learning curve than Go, and requires more mental effort on the programmers part
[18:22:03] <zwarich> Hannibal_Smith: I think that is true on some level, most of the SW being written in Rust would probably be fine with a GC
[18:22:04] <geofft> ('cause the profit motive is posting job ads for their companies) 
[18:22:14] <scott> Hannibal_Smith: that's a common belief among GC proponents. it totally ignores the low-level systems part of programming they never touch
[18:22:15] <Havvy> lahwran:  Quit posting HN links on IRC. ;)
[18:22:16] <lahwran> geofft: ugh that makes me so mad!
[18:22:19] <lahwran> Havvy: I don't
[18:22:27] <lahwran> geofft: hacker news has huge amounts of influence
[18:22:27] <Havvy> lahwran:  I meant in general.
[18:22:36] <lahwran> you're missing my point
[18:22:41] <lahwran> I don't mean how do I not encourage that
[18:22:47] <lahwran> I mean how do we convince the community to not do it
[18:23:01] <scott> kernels, high-performances games, embedded software, etc can't use GC
[18:23:12] <scott> you also presumably need a language to implement the GC in
[18:23:39] <scott> Ruby isn't going to go write their GC in Ruby
[18:23:54] <zwarich> scott: write your GC in assembler
[18:23:56] <zwarich> bam done
[18:24:03] <zwarich> usually some of it has to be in assembly anyways
[18:24:07] <lahwran> scott: what makes you think that you wouldn't? http://pypy.org/
[18:24:09] <scott> assembler and Ruby, that's alllll ya need
[18:24:09] <lahwran> :p
[18:24:16] <Hannibal_Smith> Personally I'm a CS student, so I don't have much experience, but I did an intern for one of the most popular italian website, for some improvement to a C# backend
[18:24:28] <Hannibal_Smith> It had really bad latency because the GC
[18:24:30] <Hannibal_Smith> Really bad
[18:24:31] <tiffany> hannibal_smith: but what language do you write the GC in?
[18:24:36] <Astrum|Lap> so... who thinks rust is just a fad? how many years before it's replaced by 'the next best language'? =)
[18:24:42] <zwarich> Rust would suck for writing GCs anyways
[18:24:43] <scott> I haven't looked into pypy, but it doesn't write the GC in python, does it?
[18:24:44] <Hannibal_Smith> As the heap go with things like 4gb
[18:24:45] <zwarich> everything would be unsafe
[18:24:48] <lahwran> scott: ...yes
[18:24:49] <Hannibal_Smith> Latecy go out of control
[18:24:50] <scott> is pypy similar to rubinius?
[18:24:58] <lahwran> so... who thinks C is just a fad? how many years before it's replaced by 'the next best language'? =)
[18:25:05] <geofft> everything in pypy is in RPython 
[18:25:07] <lahwran> ^
[18:25:08] <Hannibal_Smith> SO in the end, the backend was rewritten in C++
[18:25:09] <tiffany> oh scott already mentioned that
[18:25:15] <Astrum|Lap> lahwran: everything depends on C
[18:25:16] <geofft> which is compiled 
[18:25:22] <Astrum|Lap> nothing depends on rust
[18:25:24] <scott> C and C++ are well beyond fads. they'll live forever like COBOL at least
[18:25:33] <lahwran> COBOL is dead
[18:25:39] <tiffany> astrum: objective rust
[18:25:41] <Astrum|Lap> COBOL is a zombie
[18:25:44] <lahwran> that there are companies that practice necromancy is irrelevant
[18:25:46] <geofft> I would _love_ to see Visual R# 
[18:25:47] <lahwran> it's still dead
[18:25:53] <scott> I'm interning at IBM. can confirm you use COBOL whenever you use your bank card ;)
[18:26:02] <lahwran> necromancy!
[18:26:22] <scott> luckily I haven't had to be anywhere near COBOL code
[18:26:27] <Hannibal_Smith> scott, I read some interesting article on how COBOL dev today are an high revenue job
[18:26:29] <Astrum|Lap> but I'm curious if rust will ultimately be looked on as a fad
[18:26:38] <scott> wouldn't it be great if using C++ was declared necromancy in 30 years?
[18:26:48] <lahwran> Astrum|Lap: I don't think so
[18:26:49] <scott> Hannibal_Smith: yes, COBOL devs are in high demand
[18:27:03] <lahwran> rust provides some things that are really seriously valuable
[18:27:06] <Hannibal_Smith> Interesting, is not the same for FORTRAN
[18:27:17] <Hannibal_Smith> Seems like that FORTRAN codebase is migrated to C++
[18:27:21] <lahwran> if rust is a fad, then that's because something comes along and takes rust's ideas and makes them better
[18:27:23] <Astrum|Lap> what do you think adoption will look like?
[18:27:23] <Hannibal_Smith> I question why...
[18:27:25] <lahwran> not because rust's ideas are bad
[18:27:28] <lahwran> but other than that, no idea
[18:27:34] <lahwran> you're asking for market predictions
[18:27:40] <Astrum|Lap> in a way
[18:27:44] <Astrum|Lap> who will use rust
[18:27:57] <lahwran> you're still asking for market predictions
[18:27:58] <lahwran> I have no idea
[18:28:06] <lahwran> and I'd be surprised if anyone else here does either
[18:28:11] <sillesta> scott: by then we'll have c++50 or something
[18:28:16] <tiffany> I'm waiting for a proof solving system to show up that has shed its GC
[18:28:24] <tiffany> idris may be the one to do that
[18:28:43] <Hannibal_Smith> scott, personally I'm happy that today C++ is a live language
[18:28:51] <Astrum|Lap> I mean D has had a hell of a time gaining acceptance
[18:28:54] <scott> I'm excited for the language that can solidly replace Rust
[18:29:23] <scott> D is kind of in a weird domain
[18:29:37] <scott> a bit like C++, but not offering the same control as C++
[18:29:46] <scott> plus it had weird tooling issues early on
[18:30:04] <Astrum|Lap> two competing standard libs as well
[18:30:07] <Astrum|Lap> phobos and tango
[18:30:08] <scott> yeah
[18:30:17] <scott> which couldn't be linked together
[18:30:18] <sillesta> phobos is the official
[18:30:19] <scott> now they can be
[18:30:29] <Hannibal_Smith> D has really strange choice, like having destructor with a GC, don't make sense
[18:30:49] <scott> lots of dynamic languages try to do that
[18:30:56] <scott> python's with blocks
[18:31:03] <Hannibal_Smith> No, different thing
[18:31:07] <scott> same goal
[18:31:12] <Astrum|Lap> it definitely seems that the number of viable languages has increased in the last decade
[18:31:16] <Hannibal_Smith> Maybe more like C# IDisposable
[18:31:18] <Astrum|Lap> by a lot
[18:31:33] <Hannibal_Smith> Python with cover a different use, like Go defer
[18:31:47] <GaryOak_> it's because the knowledge to build languages is getting easier to understand
[18:31:54] <scott> D has something like defer, too. it's essentially an ad-hoc destructor
[18:31:58] <GaryOak_> the same thing is happening with databases too
[18:32:13] <GaryOak_> and machine learning
[18:32:19] <tiffany> oh
[18:32:24] <Astrum|Lap> perhaps our field is ultimately one of fads built upon ancient technology from the dawn of computers =P
[18:32:27] <tiffany> eh
[18:32:32] <tiffany> I'm not so sure about that garyoak
[18:32:37] <tiffany> maybe just the barrier to entry is dropping
[18:32:38] <Hannibal_Smith> GaryOak_, recent db don't really live up their predecessors
[18:32:45] <tiffany> but the majority of nosql databases aren't ACID at all
[18:32:54] <GaryOak_> they aren't really trying to be
[18:32:58] <scott> what are the recent advances in dbs?
[18:33:13] <GaryOak_> but they haven't had the years of work that MySQL or others have had
[18:33:16] <scott> all I hear from the people I trust is that postgresql is pretty good and most other stuff is meh
[18:33:21] <tiffany> scott: better optimisation, new features, and so on
[18:33:30] <Hannibal_Smith> tiffany, yes is easy to replace a db with something that don't work
[18:33:51] <Hannibal_Smith> I continue to think that even today is really hard to build a db that can compete with a commercial solution
[18:33:56] <scott> nosql was a pretty ridiculous fad
[18:34:12] <tiffany> garyoak: what's the point of having a non-ACID db? you might as well just pipe your data to /dev/null if you're fine with it being subject to random corruption every time the application crashes
[18:34:21] <Hannibal_Smith> scott, unfortunately still a thing in communities like js one
[18:34:28] <tiffany> some of them make at least some sort of effort, I suppose
[18:34:28] <zwarich> database vendors are finding it harder to market a new db engine
[18:34:36] <tiffany> mongodb writes a new file and then swaps it with the old one
[18:34:36] <zwarich> even if it is technically superior in some ways
[18:34:50] <scott> JS is all about fad-driven development
[18:34:52] <tiffany> mongodb doesn't have the D in ACID
[18:35:04] <scott> yesterday I found out Netscape released server-side javascript software in 1994
[18:35:19] <Astrum|Lap> how futuristic
[18:35:31] <scott> we've been living in the future since 1994
[18:35:33] <tiffany> most programming languages surfacing are pretty mediocre as well
[18:35:34] <Astrum|Lap> speaking of JS and crap
[18:35:38] <Astrum|Lap> time to get back to programming
[18:35:46] <tiffany> maybe there are more gems than there used to be
[18:35:52] <tiffany> but they're drowning in an ocean of mediocrity
[18:36:02] <GaryOak_> ACID isn't a requirement for every database situation
[18:36:24] <tiffany> maybe not
[18:36:39] <GaryOak_> it's a tradeoff between certain features
[18:36:43] <tiffany> I don't like how most nosql databases throw out relational algebra too
[18:36:49] <tiffany> they're stupid key-value stores
[18:36:58] <Astrum|Lap> tiffany: which kind of ties back to my discussion on how we consume news from places like proggit and HN, heh
[18:37:12] <scott> nosql might be the right answer to some problems
[18:37:19] <scott> but not as many as the nosql fad thought
[18:37:26] <tiffany> exactly
[18:37:36] * Havvy is still not sure why people default to Mongo instead of PostgreSQL.
[18:37:40] <Hannibal_Smith> Having an implicit schema is only a burden...
[18:37:42] * Astrum|Lap is part of this awesome fad
[18:37:46] <tiffany> nosql just really wanted to get the convenience of javascript objects, no matter the cost
[18:37:48] <GaryOak_> Rust uses academic tech from the 90's, it takes a while for those things to come into the mainstream
[18:37:53] <Astrum|Lap> though I actually loathe web development... I want a new job =(
[18:37:53] <tiffany> everything else was secondary
[18:38:18] <GaryOak_> ^ this
[18:38:22] <GaryOak_> it's a tradeoff
[18:38:29] <scott> mainstream programming languages move rather slowly, but that's the natural way of things
[18:38:47] <scott> it's awesome that a language as different as rust could end up mainstream
[18:38:54] * Havvy just wants a mainstream programming language with pattern matching.
[18:38:58] <scott> even though most of the things in Rust aren't new
[18:39:15] <Astrum|Lap> one bad thing about software engineering, huge demand for web dev
[18:39:32] <Hannibal_Smith> Astrum|Lap, is not really a bad thing...
[18:39:35] <scott> that wouldn't be so bad if web tech wasn't so terrible
[18:39:40] <Havvy> Astrum|Lap:  Also, you have to know some web dev no matter what if you're doing open source.
[18:39:41] <Astrum|Lap> sorry, bad thing for me, Hannibal_Smith 
[18:39:46] <Astrum|Lap> I dislike it
[18:39:48] <Hannibal_Smith> Ah yes, I can understand it
[18:39:51] <GaryOak_> most business demands are 'best' solved by web solutions
[18:39:52] <scott> actually, demand would be lower if the tech wasn't so detrimental
[18:40:06] <GaryOak_> and if it didn't change so much
[18:40:08] <Astrum|Lap> and that might partly be why, the tech behind the web
[18:40:10] <Astrum|Lap> I dislike it all
[18:40:24] <scott> it's actually really bad, but most people accept it as normal
[18:40:26] <Hannibal_Smith> Astrum|Lap, personally I don't like web dev because "the cost of entry" is too low, and is not usually a place where one can do interesting things
[18:40:34] <Hannibal_Smith> *cannot do
[18:40:46] <Havvy> The cost of entry is low, but the cost of innovation is high.
[18:40:47] <tiffany> web dev is so much reinventing square wheels
[18:40:50] <Astrum|Lap> I think my preferred area would be gamedev
[18:41:03] <Astrum|Lap> but I don't have the heart to dedicate every waking hour to it
[18:41:14] <GaryOak_> gamedev is just as behind as everything else
[18:41:16] <scott> gamedevs are pretty annoyed with C++ and opengl and stuff
[18:41:19] <tiffany> it's a big industry because there's lots of busywork to be had
[18:41:24] <scott> there are glimmers of hope
[18:41:35] <tiffany> scott: I'm pretty okay with C++, but I am really looking forward to vulkan
[18:41:37] <Astrum|Lap> GaryOak_: gamedev is fascinating to me though
[18:41:43] <Astrum|Lap> sorry, not gamedev but engine development
[18:41:49] <Hannibal_Smith> I don't like videogames! :-P
[18:41:51] <Astrum|Lap> I find them to be the most fascinating code bases out there
[18:42:06] <GaryOak_> engines are a different beast altogether than gamedev
[18:42:16] <Astrum|Lap> sorry, I shouldn't have lumped it all together
[18:42:27] <Astrum|Lap> game programming is actually incredibly boring to me
[18:42:53] <Havvy> I would love to making banking easier and tighter personally. But I doubt any bank would listen to me.
[18:43:15] <GaryOak_> Havvy: Did you see Stellar on HN ;)
[18:43:17] <scott> game programming does look like a lot of hard/painful work at times
[18:43:38] <Havvy> GaryOak_:  Nope.
[18:44:33] <Astrum|Lap> that and embedded stuff are where my interests mostly are
[18:44:55] <GaryOak_> Stellar is a tranaction system built on a new consensus algorithm
[18:45:01] <scott> I'm drawn to systems programming for some odd reason even though I've never had a real reason to do it
[18:45:12] <Hannibal_Smith> Astrum|Lap, thinking about it, there are also some good founds related to things like drones and like
[18:45:28] <Astrum|Lap> founds?
[18:45:33] <scott> my main interest is programming language design / implementation. I guess I find systems languages more compelling
[18:45:49] <Astrum|Lap> scott: type theory interests me
[18:45:58] <Hannibal_Smith> Uhm maybe investments is a bette term?
[18:46:00] <Astrum|Lap> language implementations are meh though
[18:46:04] <Hannibal_Smith> Sorry, my english is really terrible
[18:46:33] <Astrum|Lap> don't apologize
[18:46:36] <scott> I've mainly learned programming language theory and type theory from haskell and dependently typed languages. what's really fun is taking that knowledge and applying it to rust
[18:46:55] <Astrum|Lap> I don't even know a second language, you're doing more than me =P
[18:47:08] <scott> seeing &Trait types as existential types suddenly makes sense to you once you go through all that
[18:47:20] <scott> or &[T]
[18:47:41] <Astrum|Lap> I'm still trying to make it through Homotopy Type Theory
[18:47:43] <scott> and the whole trait system is very similar to haskell
[18:47:56] <Hannibal_Smith> scott, do you know about http://www.ats-lang.org ?
[18:48:02] <scott> I've barely touched the hott book
[18:48:10] <scott> I'm aware of ATS. haven't played with it
[18:48:18] <tiffany> I really like stellar
[18:48:22] <scott> its syntax is rather frightening
[18:48:50] <Hannibal_Smith> scott, yes it really show that is a research project
[18:48:53] <Astrum|Lap>  hott is hard to get into if you've never taken a topology course
[18:49:13] <scott> Astrum|Lap: that is my problem. I have almost no formal math training
[18:49:24] <scott> and in my spare time I'm programming, not learning pure math stuff
[18:49:26] <Astrum|Lap> and impossible to finish if you aren't actively pursuing a phd in algebraic topology =P
[18:49:45] <Astrum|Lap> in the grand scheme of things, math is my first love
[18:49:46] <scott> I did linear algebra 2. that was the highest math I've done so far
[18:49:52] <scott> that was my hardest class ever
[18:49:57] <Astrum|Lap> programming in general is a very distant second
[18:50:05] <scott> I figured I can't make sense of math until I relate it to programming
[18:50:24] <scott> abstract algebra, type theory, and category theory are really easy for me to relate to programming
[18:50:30] <scott> so I pick up those quickly
[18:50:40] <scott> well, basic category theory
[18:51:04] <Astrum|Lap> there definitely needs to be some intuitive sense behind your understand of math
[18:51:36] <scott> I did gain some cool insights from my linear algebra 2 class, but a lot of it went over my head, I think
[18:51:45] <Astrum|Lap> topology can be hard to intuit
[18:52:03] <Astrum|Lap> (I may be using intuit wrong...)
[18:52:24] <scott> quotient spaces at first were really weird, but once I figured out how to visualize them I was really pumped
[18:52:32] <scott> stuff like that was nice to learn
[18:52:49] <Astrum|Lap> funny story, I started uni as an EE major
[18:53:16] <Astrum|Lap> I failed calculus 2 and decided going any further in math would be a bad idea, so I switched to CS
[18:53:31] <Astrum|Lap> (EE required several more math courses, CS ended at Calc 2)
[18:53:43] <Astrum|Lap> for some reason I kept taking more math courses
[18:53:59] <Astrum|Lap> abstract algebra was what made me pick up a second major in math
[18:54:11] <scott> I decided on CS in high school and stuck with it, but now I wish I decided to double major from my first year
[18:54:15] <Astrum|Lap> took it over the summer in 8 weeks and I fell in love
[18:54:34] <scott> I would have to stay longer than I'd like to get a math degree now
[18:54:58] <Astrum|Lap> I went to uni for 6 years
[18:55:31] <scott> a lot of math didn't seem to interest me, but now I realize I wish I'd done the uninteresting-seeming stuff so I would have the common vocabulary to understand stuff
[18:55:32] <Astrum|Lap> I was never in any rush, I enjoyed taking random classes like astrophysics
[18:56:01] <scott> mathematicians really like to bring up to bring up stuff like topology and geometry like it's the basic stuff everybody knows
[18:56:06] <scott> but I don't know :p
[18:56:36] <scott> and number theory. I don't really like number theory
[18:56:43] <Astrum|Lap> topology was my favorite class, so it's something I want everyone to know
[18:56:52] <scott> people start discussing primes, divisibility, and stuff.... I just can't get interested
[18:57:09] <scott> I'll consider topology more strongly for my last year
[18:57:15] <scott> I'm alread planning on abstract algebra
[18:57:23] <Astrum|Lap> I'm the same way, number theory is boring
[18:57:50] <Astrum|Lap> abstract algebra, for me, was a big departure from previous math courses
[18:57:53] <tiffany> I saw a thing that was saying how hott was the future but like I have no idea how it's supposed to work
[18:57:58] <tiffany> although I suppose that's how everything starts out
[18:58:02] <scott> tiffany: that's hott in a nutshell
[18:58:09] <Astrum|Lap> it started to focus on proofs and generalizing concepts rather than ... solving for x
[18:58:12] <scott> it's just the hott new thing *wink wink*
[18:58:17] <Astrum|Lap> though it sounds like your linear algebra course already taught you that
[18:58:46] <scott> I started learning abstract algebra from wikipedia and somehow even that was enough to get me interested
[18:58:53] <scott> wikipedia is usually the worst for learning math
[18:59:07] <scott> linear algebra did get me into the right mindset for that stuff
[18:59:08] <Astrum|Lap> tiffany: I wish I understood hott well enough to give you an answer, heh
[18:59:31] <Astrum|Lap> I can make it through the first chapter of hott
[18:59:39] <Astrum|Lap> and reasonably understand it
[19:00:01] <scott> with abstract algebra, though, you can start directly playing with structures like semigroups, monoids, groups, and so on in a programming language like Haskell or Idris
[19:00:13] <scott> I like the directness of that
[19:00:33] <scott> same thing with type theory
[19:01:18] <Astrum|Lap> topology is kind of a visual branch

[19:25:56] <tiffany> I feel like there's a lot of people who think that C++ is actually named "C/C++"
[19:26:16] <tiffany> there are so many damn places I see where someone says "C/C++" and then shows a snippet of java written in C++
[19:27:34] <tiffany> it actually makes it infuriating to try to write anything of significance in C
[19:27:45] <tiffany> every library says they have a "C/C++ API" actually means they have a C++ API
[19:28:06] <tiffany> whenever you look for snippets of code for something, they say "C/C++" and have C++
[19:28:26] <tiffany> sometimes, there
[19:28:36] <tiffany> 's stuff which even says it's "C" and is actually C++

[19:30:00] *** kimundi is now known as zz_kimundi
[19:30:23] <Hannibal_Smith> In general I tend to see a bad mix of C and C++
[19:30:43] <tiffany> using C++ like it's java is actually extremely common
[19:30:47] <tiffany> particularly in any code using pre-C++11
[19:31:20] <Hannibal_Smith> Yes I completely missed that
[19:31:51] <tiffany> if you need a well-known example I will refer you to bullet physics
[19:32:08] <tiffany> an entire physics engine written using virtual classes, with long inheritance chains
[19:33:35] <Astrum|Lap> physics (in game engines) is one area I've never really looked into
[19:34:27] <tiffany> it's hard
[19:35:00] <Astrum|Lap> I think all parts of an engine are hard to be fair
[19:35:20] <Astrum|Lap> even proper input handling is tricky
[19:36:01] <tiffany> nobody does input handling properly
[19:37:28] <Astrum|Lap> what's the proper way?
[19:37:43] <tiffany> libraries like SDL only allow you to poll input
[19:38:01] *** zz_kimundi is now known as kimundi
[19:38:01] <tiffany> in order to handle input in a way that doesn't discretize between frames, you have to do OS-specific things
[19:38:12] <tiffany> on linux, you can just put the X11 or wayland file descriptor into epoll
[19:38:33] <tiffany> on windows, you can use MsgWaitForMultipleObjectsEx on both your network IOCPs and your WINDOW
[19:38:47] <tiffany> on OS X you can do nothing, afaik
[19:39:06] <tiffany> and this isn't even mentioning joysticks
[19:40:03] <Astrum|Lap> I'm sure you can do something on osx
[19:40:11] <tiffany> I'm not so sure
[19:40:20] <tiffany> OS X revolves around spamming threads in GCD
[19:40:33] <tiffany> it has kqueue, but almost none of its features are via file descriptors
[19:40:46] <tiffany> and it doesn't have anything like MsgWaitForMultipleObjectsEx
[19:41:04] <tiffany> in a lot of ways, OS X is actually more painful to support than windows imo
[19:42:43] <tiffany> also, joysticks are even worse
[19:42:53] <tiffany> DirectInput is actually deprecated on windows
[19:43:02] <tiffany> and its replacement only supports xbox controllers
[19:43:09] <tiffany> so you have to use a deprecated and apparently hard to use API
[19:43:17] <tiffany> in order to support anything not shaped like an xbox controller
[19:43:35] <Astrum|Lap> molecularmusings has a post on that very subject
[19:43:54] <tiffany> on linux, some distros require you to have root access to access the joystick devices
[19:43:58] <tiffany> which is really, really stupid
[19:44:08] <tiffany> arch makes it so you need to be in the 'input' group in order to access them
[19:44:45] <tiffany> and again, I have no idea what OS X does
[19:45:00] <tiffany> their documentation is hidden away in a corner that you can't reach from google
[19:45:18] <Astrum|Lap> for joysticks and stuff you need to use a lower level API iirc
[19:45:30] <Astrum|Lap> which is not well documented

[20:33:42] <cyndis> Binero: are you planning to bind to libwayland or write the protocol code in rust?
[20:34:11] <cyndis> because I tried to do the latter and found out you can't do it.
[20:34:18] <Binero> cyndis: I just realised bindings isn't the right word
[20:34:21] <Binero> cyndis: Why is that? 
[20:34:28] <Binero> cyndis: I am writing the protocol code
[20:34:49] <cyndis> at least the EGL Wayland API requires that you pass it struct wayland_displays or whatever libwayland uses
[20:35:06] <cyndis> struct wl_display
[20:35:15] <Binero> ah, that's just for EGL though? 
[20:35:20] <Binero> Also what stops us from porting that struct? 
[20:35:40] <cyndis> it's the root struct so i would imagine you'd have to replicate the whole data type hierarchy. also it's opaque.
[20:36:08] <cyndis> maybe just for EGL, but they've taken the decision, so anything could do that
[20:36:43] <brson> that's a drag. wayland seems to have put a lot of thought into making the api portable
[20:37:01] <brson> on the surface it looks pretty clean
[20:37:11] <cyndis> yeah, i was pretty surprised when i found out
[20:37:13] <brson> i guess the egl wayland api is by other people?
[20:37:30] <cyndis> well, i would imagine it's pretty much the same people

[20:37:55] <brson> surprising they would take an opaque struct by val
[20:38:00] <Binero> But I'm starting to wonder why there even is an XML spec, as their attitude seems to be if the feature isn't in C it shouldn't be in the XML 
[20:38:34] <cyndis> probably by pointer, but that doesn't help if you want to use a rust protocol library
[20:39:24] <Binero> cyndis: Why is that a problem? 
[20:39:42] <cyndis> well, libEGL will take your pointer and call libwayland methods on it
[20:39:51] <Binero> yeah? 
[20:40:02] <cyndis> so the pointer's gotta point to something created by libwayland
