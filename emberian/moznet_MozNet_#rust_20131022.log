[02:39:06] <sfackler> you could generate a C parser with flex or whatever and then use rust-bindgen to make a rust interface. It'll probably be a bit awkward to work with though

[05:35:14] <bjz_> you know how you say 'Rust has safe manual memory management'
[05:36:13] <bjz_> I was talking to somebody the other day and they got very annoyed, and said 'Rust doesn't have safe memory management - you still have to use an unsafe block to explicitly malloc and free'
[05:36:14] <pcwalton> it's a fuzzy term but I mean "not managed by a runtime" -- (a) you don't have to use a garbage collector to do many things; (b) it's explicit when the GC is being used; (c) you have exact control over when objects are freed if you want
[05:36:23] <bjz_> yeah
[05:36:30] <cmr> bjz_: but ~ is an explicit malloc
[05:36:37] <pcwalton> ~ is a malloc and the destructor is free

[05:36:42] <pcwalton> so that isn't really true

[05:37:05] <bjz_> I defined the term for him, but he said 'that's not what most people think when they hear "manual"'
[05:37:12] <cmr> Only way to control when the free happens is adding scopes.
[05:37:19] <pcwalton> fn destroy<T>(_: T) {}
[05:37:26] <cmr> fair enough
[05:37:39] <pcwalton> I think it can't be fully manual and yet still safe in the presence of exceptions
[05:37:44] <bjz_> I sometimes add a fn destroy(self) method
[05:37:47] <pcwalton> it's as manual as it can be

[05:37:52] <cmr> that's adding a scope, but in a very pretty way.
[05:37:54] <bjz_> pcwalton: yep
[05:38:07] <pcwalton> there *are* languages that required you to use an explicit free with unique types
[05:38:09] <pcwalton> Sing# was one
[05:38:17] <pcwalton> I don't know how exceptions worked in Sing#
[05:38:22] <bjz_> pcwalton: I just wonder if 'deterministic memory management' might be a better term?

[05:38:46] <pcwalton> I use terms like "low level programming without segfaults" or "safe manual memory management" in a very fuzzy marketing-speak sort of way
[05:38:47] <bjz_> I know it's arguing over a word
[05:38:47] <FreeFull> Rust does encourage you not to use exceptions
[05:38:56] <pcwalton> by exceptions I mean failure too
[05:39:26] <cmr> I think manual still applies. It's just not the painful manual that C would train you to accept.
[05:39:53] <eddyb> I don't listen to C :P
[05:39:56] <pcwalton> if I were being precise I'd say something like "Rust uses stack allocation, unique heap ownership, and borrowing to allow for deterministic memory management without the use of garbage collection in many cases"
[05:40:07] <pcwalton> but that isn't very pithy ;)
[05:40:55] <pongad> Sorry for a noob question: if I'm just starting to learn Rust, should I use 0.8 or master? :D

[05:42:26] <cmr> (the arch packages should work anywhere with a recentish glibc)
[05:42:47] <bjz_> pcwalton: I do think 'determinist memory mangement' might be a little closer, but I don't know if that would catch systems programmers attention as muvh
[05:42:50] <bjz_> *much
[05:42:57] <pongad> cmr: There is? Where do I find the ubuntu nightly?

[05:44:47] <bjz_> pcwalton: or 'safe, deterministic memory managment'. but yeah, if somebody gets overly annoyed at the way you use a term, even once you define how you're using it, you might be fighting a difficult argument
[05:44:55] <cmr> eddyb: as in split rustc from libstd/libextra/librustrt/etc?

[05:45:12] <bjz_> pcwalton: indeed
[05:45:25] <eddyb> cmr: librustc and libsyntax are quite big IIRC
[05:45:27] <pcwalton> I mean, people have gotten annoyed at rust calling itself a systems language because it has array bounds checks
[05:45:52] <eddyb> systems == fast and stupid?
[05:46:15] <eddyb> you end up having a million checks everywhere if the language doesn't do it for you
[05:46:17] <pcwalton> well, some people would prefer dependent types to eliminate array bounds checks from the language

[05:47:46] <eddyb> I ripped a lot of magic checks from SlamAllocator when I ported it from C++ to Rust. they shouldn't be required if Rust doesn't go outside of allocated boundaries after receiving the that pointer
[05:48:09] <bjz_> pcwalton: been playing around with dependant types in idris
[05:48:31] <pcwalton> I think that all Rust can realistically do is to move the industry forward a few steps with regions rather than miles ahead with dependent types
[05:48:43] <cmr> I'd agree with that
[05:48:47] <bjz_> pcwalton: super cool - really reminds my of template metaprogramming, but far more well defined
[05:48:53] <bjz_> pcwalton: yeah, agreed
[05:49:03] <FreeFull> People still haven't figured out the best way to do dependent types though
[05:49:04] <pcwalton> I mean, even some academics like Jonathan Shapiro think we've gone too far
[05:49:11] <pcwalton> we're already pretty far out
[05:49:11] <pongad> cmr: Thanks a lot, downloading now. As you might be able to tell, I am very new at this :)
[05:49:13] <FreeFull> As they are now, they won't work in a mainstream language
[05:49:16] <cmr> pongad: np :)
[05:49:50] <eddyb> bjz_: btw, you can do some tricks in Rust, with [u8, ..N] as a generic type param :P
[05:50:00] <cmr> eddyb: the N can't be generic
[05:50:06] <bjz_> eddyb: no

[05:51:52] <bjz_> pcwalton: I really do like the type signatures you get though. like: vdrop : (n : Nat) -> Vect (n + m) a -> Vect m a
[05:52:05] <pcwalton> yes, there's a lot of really cool stuff there
[05:52:13] <eddyb> bjz_: anyways, you can use this trick to specialize functions
[05:52:16] <pcwalton> and I really like Hongwei's work with ATS
[05:52:41] <bjz_> pcwalton: yeah?
[05:52:51] <eddyb> there's no generic containers with statics/types inside, like C++ templates, though :(

[05:53:25] <pcwalton> I mean, it makes sense to be experimenting with how they work in a systems language
[05:53:32] <pcwalton> eddyb: that size_of trick is cute
[05:53:55] <pcwalton> a horrible workaround for not having real associated constants
[05:54:02] <pcwalton> but cute
[05:54:06] <Eridius> sadly it won't work for anything that needs a compile-time value
[05:54:09] <pcwalton> right
[05:54:22] <pcwalton> well, if we had sizeof at compile time as graydon proposed... (which we might need)
[05:54:31] <eddyb> pcwalton: thanks, allocations with known size are now a one-instruction call (no arguments) to a function that doesn't call anything else, and is specialized for that allocation size :P
[05:54:45] * pcwalton laughs at how hilarious of a hack this is
[05:54:52] <eddyb> pcwalton: CTFE and we're done. it should be easier for intrinsics
[05:54:54] <pcwalton> can I name this hack after you?
[05:55:02] <cmr> yeah, it's quite ingenious

[05:55:31] <eddyb> Eridius: sounds like reily
[05:55:40] <kimundi> I must say, everytime I hear "associated statics will solve the [T, ..N] problem" I wonder how they would do that. Seems kinda annoying if specifying a size require writing as new trait implementation :)

[12:25:03] <dbaupp> because that's how it's implemented.
[12:25:30] <dbaupp> iterators are basically haskell's [], and Iterator.map(f) is basically `map f list`

[12:26:41] <Seldaek> is there a way to test some function whose only outcome is a bunch of print() calls?
[12:27:00] <dbaupp> you're just saving the "map object", i.e. an object that represents mapping that function over that vector
[12:27:10] <Heather_> and println! -> print! )
[12:27:24] <dbaupp> you can then use `for x in mapped { ... }` or mapped.len() or mapped.fold() to consume it
[12:27:46] <dbaupp> but you should just use `for x in bug3911 { ... }` rather than the map
[12:27:48] <bjz> Heather_: map returns an iterator that is not evaluated until you do something like .collect() on it
[12:28:02] <dbaupp> as ksf said, mapM_ in Haskell is basically `for` in Rust
[12:28:31] <dbaupp> also, I was 400 off https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/3511

[12:28:37] <bjz> dbaupp: what does mapM_ do? eager wvaluation?
[12:29:16] <dbaupp> bjz: monadic evaluation returning `m ()`, so not exactly equivalent, but represents running a series actions without return values
[12:29:28] <bjz> ok
[12:29:38] <dbaupp> (i.e.. it's still lazy in that doesn't get evaluated at the point of writing)

[13:04:59] <ksf> the most sane approach in that regard would actually be having switchable parsers that all parse to a homoiconic representation. that is, the {:?} syntax of the compiler's AST
[13:05:13] <bjz> ksf: but the average Rust function basically is a haskell function with one tuple as an argument
[13:05:28] <ksf> oh, currying. another can of worms.
[13:05:33] <bjz> yep
[13:06:14] <ksf> necessary to get rid of argument tuples, I think.

[13:06:47] <dbaupp> it easy to write Haskerust: just put everything as @T, and have all functions returning @fn() (or whatever the replacement is supposed to be)
[13:06:55] <eddyb> in ES6 (and C#, too, I think), you can do a => b => c => [a, b, c] if you wanted to
[13:06:56] <dbaupp> "easy"
[13:06:58] <bjz> dbaupp: yup

[13:10:21] <dbaupp> the replacement is trait objects, but apparently I'm too lazy to type that originally
[13:10:23] <bstrie> eddyb: ugh I hate haskell's optional parens :P
[13:10:44] <ksf> parens aren't optional in haskell, they're just seldomly necessary.

[13:11:00] <eddyb> bstrie: wait, I just realized o_O
[13:11:07] <eddyb> haskell is LISP in disguise
[13:11:10] <bstrie> ksf: haskell without the parens is just unreadable word soup :)

[15:19:11] <nmatsakis> eholk: :) ok ....
[15:19:20] <eholk> nmatsakis: well, it seems to me it is
[15:19:46] <eholk> it might not be. The last time I had compile troubles it was because I was doing something illegal
[15:20:44] <nmatsakis> eholk: ok do you have a gist  or something?
[15:20:53] <eholk> nmatsakis: here's the code: https://github.com/eholk/SciRust/blob/wip/src/matrix/matrix.rs#L265
[15:21:33] <eholk> nmatsakis: and here's the compiler output
[15:22:11] <eholk> Submatrix_t is supposed to have a references to TransposeMatrix, which has a reference to another Matrix
[15:22:26] <eholk> I want them all to be bound by the innermost Matrix's lifetime
[15:23:00] <nmatsakis> eholk: I suspect your problem is #3598 (which I am actually close to fixing...)
[15:23:14] <nmatsakis> eholk: that is, the fact that we treat all type parameters as invariant
[15:23:32] <nmatsakis> eholk: that said, you never gave me the compiler output
[15:23:44] <eholk> oh.. right
[15:23:51] <eholk> https://gist.github.com/eholk/7102595
[15:26:07] <eholk> i'm not really sure where this anonymous lifetime is coming from. It seems I've annotated everything I can think of
[15:26:09] <nmatsakis> eholk: actually, yo might just need to write: fn submatrix(&'self self)
[15:26:24] <eddyb> woo, you can actually spot NOTE/HACK/FIXME/TODO/etc. in the kate syntax highlighting for rust, after my last change :D
[15:26:54] <nmatsakis> eholk: if you've haven't done much rustc hacking since last summer, the meaning of `&self` changed -- it is now treated like any other parameter, and hence `&self` by itself gets an anonymous fresh lifetime
[15:27:17] <eholk> nmatsakis: ah, that makes sense.
[15:27:46] <eholk> nmatsakis: I changed to to 'self self, and now I get... task '<unnamed>' failed at 'assertion failed: self.variance.is_some()', /home/eric/projects/mozilla/rust/src/librustc/middle/typeck/rscope.rs:186
[15:29:52] <nmatsakis> eholk: did you update this line too? https://github.com/eholk/SciRust/blob/wip/src/matrix/matrix.rs#L219

[16:50:12] <Eridius> Path couldn't possibly do that because there's no standard mechanism for escaping
[16:50:18] <ksf> well, or creation should fail.
[16:50:35] <Eridius> well you can create a Path with the filename, then check if the original path is an ancestor
[16:50:45] <Eridius> oh wait no you said you don't want / at all
[16:50:45] <ksf> thing is: I don't want random data on the net to tell my program to write to /foobar
[16:50:53] <Eridius> ok so add it as a filename, then check if the dir_path is equal to the original path
[16:51:18] <ksf> I'd like to do Path::new().set_filename(foo)

[16:54:00] <Eridius> btw .set_filename() pops off the last path component before pushing anything on. I think you just want .push() repeatedly

[16:55:42] <ksf> and there should probably be a different set that *does* escape characters or combinations that are illegal. url-encode it or something, I don't care, but the user will rather want to have a file with a strange path than failure.

[16:58:29] <ksf> Url is way more generic than posix paths.
[16:58:38] <ksf> you can e.g. represent magnet links as Url
[16:58:40] <benh> can urls have embedded zero bytes?

[21:19:22] <acrichto> ?
[21:19:25] <strcat1> so there *is* a broken pipe
[21:19:29] <strcat1> it's stopping early
[21:19:38] <acrichto> so printing to stdout causes the broken pipe?
[21:19:41] <strcat1> no

[21:19:57] <strcat1> head -1 breaks the pipe after it's done

[21:35:24] <acrichto> tjc: so if I were interested in a rustpkg repo right now with some C dependencies that it builds during installation (just assuming gcc is available), is that currently possible?
[21:35:29] <bytbox> Is there a way to specify that a type should not be copyable, without some hack like putting a closure in it?
[21:35:41] <tjc> acrichto: That pull request isn't landed yet, I'm working on it :-\
[21:36:00] <tjc> acrichto: You can do the same thing right now with Rust HEAD, but rustpkg will always recompile the C dependencies
[21:36:16] <acrichto> tjc: oh ok, so would I just need a pkg.rs and lib.rs in the same directory?
[21:36:18] <cmr>   strcat thanks :)
[21:36:37] <acrichto> bytbox: you can either define a destructor for it or give it a value which is non-copyable
[21:36:50] <tjc> acrichto: yeah. https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9654 is the pull request -- I don't actually know what caused this last failure; the same tests passed on try (which of course is a different bot)
[21:37:26] <bytbox> acrichto: ok. I think I see a "right" way to do this. Thanks.
[21:37:39] <acrichto> tjc: sweet, I'm curious how one would go about doing this, I can worry about dependencies later
[21:37:59] <tjc> acrichto: Sure, then in that case you should be able to go ahead. You can use the pkg.rs file in #9654 as a model
[21:38:11] <acrichto> tjc: hm rustpkg::api should probably have online docs, right?
[21:38:14] <tjc> acrichto: yes
[21:38:33] <acrichto> and that's the interface I should be using for talking to rustpkg?
[21:38:37] <erickt> hey there tjc! I also had a question about rustpkg. Are the `extern mod foo = "..."` rust dependencies working? If so, I'm running into an odd error trying to get it to work

[21:44:57] <tjc> acrichto: yeah, #9654 fixes that

[21:46:25] <bblum> acrichto: no drop by value? nooooo
[21:46:28] <bblum> what was the problem with drop by value
[21:46:48] <SiegeLord> I don't recall a conclusion in those notes
[21:46:49] <acrichto> bblum: it's tough to prevent the destructor from running in the destructor
[21:46:54] <tjc> bblum: https://etherpad.mozilla.org/Rust-meeting-weekly has the blow-by-blow
[21:47:06] <acrichto> bblum: the solutions we've come up with so far are either too limiting or are just too weird to justify the change
[21:47:09] <bblum> oh i understand
[21:47:14] <bblum> you can't pass it off to another function
[21:47:26] <bblum> i see
[21:47:36] <bblum> well, the option dance is not all that bad for this case
[21:47:50] <acrichto> yeah that's what we were assuming that destructors which need to move fields would do
[21:48:00] <acrichto> which isn't amazing, but neither is wonky rules about destructors
[21:48:16] <bblum> sure
[21:48:22] <bblum> wonky rules would allow you to save memory
[21:48:25] <bblum> which is important in many cases
[21:48:38] <bblum> but it is probably fine for rust to stop short of that line
[21:48:39] <strcat> destructors are usually going to be dealing with integers (file descriptors) and raw pointers anyway
[21:48:49] <strcat> so the can zero them
[21:49:02] <strcat> if they need to disable another destructor
[21:49:18] <SiegeLord> So it's going to be github.com/user/repository/{pkg1, pkg2}...?

[23:06:57] <jdsanders> I'm getting an error: "non-scalar cast: `~str` as `~str`" trying to cast a ~str to a type that has been defined as `type Alias = ~str` - am I doomed to failure, or is there a way to work around that error?
[23:07:31] <bstrie> jdsanders: I have absolutely no idea what could be triggering that :P
[23:07:38] <bstrie> you can't really cast to ~str... can you?
[23:07:56] <bstrie> pretty sure casting is limited to the numeric types
[23:08:11] <bstrie> what are you trying to do?
[23:09:19] <jdsanders> bstrie, yeah I was thinking maybe you can't cast because there's no way to know the lengths or something
[23:09:21] <benh> you shouldn't need to cast ~str to Alias
[23:09:34] <jdsanders> probably what I'm tyring to do is silly
[23:09:49] <benh> just... don't cast
[23:09:57] <jdsanders> I want to sort of "tag" strings as being of a certain type, so that I can define functions on them that are specific to that type
[23:10:06] <jdsanders> so like `type Name = ~str`
[23:10:16] <benh> rusti: type Alias = ~str; let s: Alias = ~"welp";
[23:10:17] -rusti- <anon>:9:32: 9:33 warning: unused variable: `s`, #[warn(unused_variable)] on by default
[23:10:18] -rusti- <anon>:9          type Alias = ~str; let s: Alias = ~"welp";
[23:10:18] -rusti-                                          ^
[23:10:18] -rusti- ()
[23:10:21] <jdsanders> then implement a FirstName trait or something that just returns the first name
[23:10:29] <jdsanders> gotcha
[23:10:30] <benh> You'd want to use a newtype struct for that
[23:10:33] <jdsanders> makes sense
[23:10:34] <benh> aliases are completely transparent
[23:11:00] <jdsanders> benh: ah, that's definitely what i was missing
[23:11:01] <jdsanders> thanks!
[23:11:17] <benh> np
[23:11:34] <benh> methods on newtype structs are a bit fiddly but you'll sort it out <:)
[23:11:43] <benh> (of course you could just as well use a regular struct with one field)

[23:19:26] <jdsanders> yeah, very neat
[23:19:42] <jdsanders> is there any way for me to define == for my newtype struct?
[23:19:47] <jdsanders> i don't see it in std::ops
[23:21:08] <benh> std::cmp i think
[23:21:14] <Luqman> jdsanders: hmm, the trait you want is Eq, it's in std::cmp
[23:21:23] <benh> but I think you just put #[deriving(Eq)] over your struct and magic happens
