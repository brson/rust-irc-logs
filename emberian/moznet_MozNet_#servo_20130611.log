[01:34:16] <jack> why is the memory leak only on mac?
[01:34:36] <pcwalton> realloc() works differently there
[01:34:39] <pcwalton> I checked the man pages
[01:34:51] <pcwalton> realloc actually returns a new allocation if you realloc(whatever, 0) on the Mac
[01:36:23] <jack> If size is zero
[01:36:23] <jack>      and ptr is not NULL, a new, minimum sized object is allocated and the
[01:36:23] <jack>      original object is freed. 
[01:36:38] <pcwalton> minimum sized object is allocated
[01:36:40] <pcwalton> that's the problem
[01:36:57] <jack> oh, you DON'T want to allocate.
[01:37:09] <pcwalton> right, realloc is used by netsurfcss to free (!)
[01:37:18] <jack> oh, beautiful :)

[01:39:51] <caitp> jack it's all good, i don't have a strong opinion on it :p
[01:39:56] <jdm> steven_is_false: don't seem to have worked in what sense?
[01:40:03] <caitp> but i have been spending time with the netsurf people because of servo's use of it
[01:40:05] <jdm> I mean, they only were merged like 30 minutes ago
[01:40:22] <jack> caitp: the primary issue is that it's potentially hard to make the callback api fast.
[01:40:30] <steven_is_false> jdm: I'm still getting a fail on fonts.len() > 0.
[01:40:31] <caitp> mm
[01:40:47] <caitp> steven_is_false I haven't tested the linux fallback very much, i'm assuming you're testing on linux
[01:40:54] <steven_is_false> caitp: Yes.
[01:40:58] <caitp> however it does WFM with msttcorefonts installed
[01:41:28] <jack> also, bz mentioned that querySelector* is not necessarily the same code as browser selector matching for rendering, although it seems to be the case in most browsers for simplicity
[01:41:56] <jack> is Open Sans something we can ship with servo?
[01:42:01] <jack> to solve this problem
[01:42:11] <pcwalton> mm, I'd rather do it the right way
[01:42:20] <caitp> there's got to be something we can do
[01:42:23] <pcwalton> we have the font collection code in servo, might as well go the extra mile and do it right
[01:42:28] <jack> you mean pikcing some system font ?
[01:42:32] <pcwalton> right
[01:43:57] <jack> ugh. so NSPR_INCLUDE_DIR apparently needs to point to some directory where headers are aggregated
[01:44:16] <caitp> oh good
[01:44:17] <jack> why in the world does moz do this?
[01:44:25] <jack> why wouldn't you just point to the oriignal headers?
[01:44:31] <steven_is_false> How do other projects select the fallback fonts?
[01:44:43] <pcwalton> FIPS certification requires a minimum level of obfuscation of the build system
[01:44:53] <pcwalton> steven_is_false: might be good to look at webkit/platform and Gecko/whatever
[01:45:01] <steven_is_false> pcwalton: Okay.
[01:45:02] <caitp> ted seems to be very knowledgeable about the moz build system stuff, so I still say he'd probably be a good person to ask abou the right way to integrate nspr into the servo build system -- but it's up to you
[01:45:03] <caitp> and i'
[01:45:05] <caitp> i'm sure he's busy

[01:45:22] <jack> thank god.

[01:47:47] <caitp> steven_is_false: in Gecko, it looks like the last-resort font selection isn't totally consistent between platforms (not to mention can be overridden in some ways by preferences, etc) ... i haven't looked at what chromium does, they might be a good place to check

[02:06:19] <jdm> rad
[02:07:46] <steven_is_false> From Wikipedia "misc-fixed is a collection of monospace bitmap fonts that is distributed with the X Window System." This sounds like a good choose for a fallback but I have no idea if it's sensible.
[02:08:23] <caitp> supposedly the apple last-resort font (which has glyphs for each unicode script so it can at least identify what script the codepoints are in) is redistributable
[02:08:58] <steven_is_false> caitp: That would be nice but only if it wasn't big.
[02:09:38] <caitp> well, assuming glyphs can be shared by different codepoints (I certainly hope so), it shouldn't be much bigger than a typical latin font
[02:09:42] <caitp> or BMP font
[02:10:05] <steven_is_false> caitp: I have no experience working with fonts, and have no idea what size it'd be.

[04:12:57] <jdm> among other places, that is
[04:13:01] <jdm> such as dist/lib
[04:14:14] <jdm> jack: that may be the problem in fact. presumably the -L$(DIST)/lib works for mozilla-central, since NSPR_LIB_DIR probably doesn't encompass nsprpub/lib/ds

[21:22:38] <eatkinson> removing the dereference on first_child and last_child should work

[21:27:42] <eatkinson> i can't remember why the explicit dereference of parent_flow is required though
[21:27:58] <tikue> jack: eatkinson is correct, and I'm not sure either
[21:28:08] <Luqman> seems odd, it should autodereference. a bug perhaps?
