[01:43:30] <steven_is_false> I'm considering making some of my functions which return an owned pointer use CPS style instead. For example, fn create_program () -> ~Program would become fn create_program <T> (ret : fn (&Program) -> T) -> T .
[01:45:09] <steven_is_false> I know Rust does not support tail call optimization but are there any other downsides to CPS in Rust?
[01:47:08] <pcwalton> steven_is_false: it's probably slower due to indirect branching
[01:48:36] <steven_is_false> pcwalton: Dang It! The cost of branching in computers really bugs me. Writing an interpreter should be really simple but due to the branching cost it's not.

[02:19:25] <bjz> Erik: why !(*x <= *mx)
[02:19:41] <Erik> Nan <= anything  is false

[05:33:27] <brson> TyDesc and TypeDesc are the same thing, just redundant
[05:34:53] <ssbr> Oh. Then I don't really know what I'm doing wrong.
[05:35:33] <brson> are you implementing TyVisitor?

[06:21:29] <Sodel_the_V> Is 'rustc -Z debug-info' supposed to make !debug() print stuff to the console?
[06:21:54] <brson> pseudoku: the compiler refers to various things by handles instead of their values. interning is converting the type to the handle
[06:21:58] <Sodel_the_V> Because I can't seem to turn any debug info on that isn't shown by default.
[06:22:23] <brson> pseudoku: because treating something as int integer means it's really easy to compare and hash

[07:15:24] <brson> pseudoku: it depends on how less runtime you want. right now you always have to link to core, if only to access the exchange heap. you can define your own executable entry point that does not start the runtime before main, at which point you can use the exchange heap
[07:15:50] <brson> pseudoku: this excludes the local heap, the gc, task-local storage and logging
[07:16:34] <brson> i have branch that defines the minimal set of services for the full language to work
[07:17:21] <brson> eventually this should lead to a mode that just starts you on the main thread, with access to the local heap, and without any task scheduling
[07:17:36] <brson> but there's still a runtime there, it's just much lighter

[10:42:02] <Riton> Hi everybody
[10:42:23] <aatch> hi
[10:42:25] <Riton> I'm trying to follow the rust FFI tutorial (v0.6)
[10:42:56] <Riton> and I'm getting the following compiler error : 
[10:42:58] <Riton> error: unresolved name: vec::from_buf
[10:43:20] <aatch> Riton, try vec::raw::from_buf
[10:43:46] <Riton> thanks it works !
[10:44:06] <Riton> but now, to undersand why :)
[10:44:47] <aatch> The tutorial is wrong
[10:44:59] <Riton> the core crate doc too then ?
[10:45:14] <aatch> Hmm...
[10:45:21] <aatch> I'll give it a check

[10:46:04] <friggle> Riton: you might be best off trying the tutorial from the incoming tree

[10:46:16] <friggle> branch rather
[10:46:24] <aatch> wait, vec::raw::from_buf worked?
[10:47:13] <Riton> friggle: aatch yes
[10:47:39] <Riton> friggle: the ffi tutorial of the trunk seems to be completely different
[10:48:12] <aatch> Gah.
[10:48:44] <aatch> So vec::from_buf is actually what is in the current incoming code.
[10:48:59] <aatch> Riton, did you build from source?
[10:49:13] *** Quits: tgt (tgt@moz-D59EE478.aztw.cable.virginmedia.com) (Quit: Computer has gone to sleep.)
[10:49:35] <Riton> yes
[10:50:19] <Riton> from the tarball
[10:50:26] <aatch> Ah.
[10:50:57] <Riton> should I checkout the github repo and build from the last commit ?
[10:51:10] <aatch> Riton, building from master should be fine
[10:51:27] <Riton> ok
[10:51:45] <aatch> I'm not sure what the tarball is at
[10:52:53] <Riton> well, it's writtent 0.6 ...
[10:54:35] <Riton> I suppose that the best way to read the doc, is to read the md files directly on github ?
[10:55:05] <Riton> the html generated pages on static.rust-lang.org are thoses of the previous version ?
[10:55:38] <aatch> Riton, I have no idea sorry
[10:57:52] <kimundi> Riton: The docs on the website are build from 0.6 and master, master is over a month old though, so better use the docs from the incominmg branch, and use tzhe incoming branch if you want to compile yoursef :)
[10:58:58] <Riton> kimundi: thanks, switching to incoming
[11:00:23] <Riton> kimundi: and how can i access/generate the auto-generated doc of the core and std crate for the incoming branch ?
[11:01:21] <kimundi> Riton: Either build the incoming branch and use the docs it generates along the way, or read the md files on github.
[11:02:14] <Riton> ok
[11:03:30] <kimundi> kimundi: And of course for the docs of std and core you need to generate them yourself or just read the actual source

[15:59:11] <pseudoku> kimundi: so for the next version of the snapshot compiler we can remove the conditional compilation as it would be based on a version that accepts **c_char ,right? or do all snapshot compilers expect only *c_char?

[20:32:16] <ssbr> What exactly does the --cfg option to rustc do? I don't see where it's documented.
[20:33:48] <cmr> ssbr: afaik it's just for #[cfg] attributes.
[20:34:12] <cmr> example, code which can't be updated because it's waiting on the snapshot compiler to be updated is guaded with #[cfg(stage0)]
[20:34:18] <mcpherrin> ssbr: think -Dfoo defines in c used for #ifdef foo
[20:35:20] <ssbr> Blargh, okay.
[20:35:48] <ssbr> I'm trying to figure out how to get rust working together with python. It isn't very pretty, since AFAICT the rust compiler won't let me specify what to link with on the command line

[20:36:03] <Ralith> can't you get it to produce object files?
[20:36:06] <ssbr> I think what I'll have to do is generate (modify?) a crate file dynamically and use that to pass in stuff like that
[20:36:39] <ssbr> Ralith: oh, does it produce C object files?
