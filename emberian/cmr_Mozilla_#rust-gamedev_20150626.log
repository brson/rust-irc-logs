[00:36:06] <Elaine> gsingh93: you never clear.
[00:36:36] <gsingh93> Elaine: can you elaborate? clear where?
[00:36:44] <Elaine> also you shouldn't make a new Program on every frame, or a new VBO too. etc
[00:37:01] <niconii> gsingh93: you don't clear the screen after each frame
[00:37:07] <Elaine> oh you do clear, but it's in https://github.com/gsingh93/opengl-test/blob/master/src/main.rs
[00:37:40] <gsingh93> it's not creating a new vbo/program every frame either

[03:14:59] <XMPPwocky> actually the most annoying bug i ever had was just that if you ever, ever stopped moving, you'd veeeery slowly sink through the floor
[03:15:21] <XMPPwocky> i did a lot of testing with that bug, since you don't notice it if you don't stop
[03:16:25] <aatch> XMPPwocky, oh, I had that issue when I was experimenting with a physics engine.
[03:17:03] <aatch> XMPPwocky, I was like "why are sinking into the impossibly-solid floor!"
[03:17:26] <XMPPwocky> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y688upqmRXo actual footage of this bug
[03:17:54] <aatch> I can't remember the exact cause but I think it was a copy-paste error.
[03:18:22] <aatch> Where I forgot to rename a single variable and it didn't just break everything.
[03:18:47] <XMPPwocky> mine wound up being tied to rounding errors
[03:19:04] <XMPPwocky> in movement, the position fixup would prevent the sink
[03:19:24] <XMPPwocky> now i use a huge epsilon throughout most movement
[03:19:35] <XMPPwocky> although that caused a hilarious bug where you bounced off everything
[03:19:37] <XMPPwocky> *everything*
[03:19:59] <XMPPwocky> hit floor -> bounce up, hit ceiling, bounce down again...
[03:20:10] <XMPPwocky> hard to debug through tears of laughter
[03:20:53] <aatch> XMPPwocky, ahh, I was using a sequential impulse solver, so position fixup was just a change in velocity.
[03:21:30] <XMPPwocky> that ended up being that instead of clipping 1.01 of the velocity out, i missed the . and clipped 101x it out
[03:22:01] <XMPPwocky> iirc your position would, in only a few minutes, become +inf or -inf, depending on the phase of the moon
[03:22:28] <XMPPwocky> physics ran at 200hz back then which was... silly, it's 120 now. can't take it to 60 because there's no interpolation yet so it'd get really jerky
[03:22:58] <aatch> XMPPwocky, reminds me of an issue in Ramp where I was diving by two by bitshifting right 1 bit. Except the two ideas collided in my head and I was bitshifting right by two.
[03:23:22] <aatch> XMPPwocky, suddenly I was getting things that should have been mathematically impossible.

[10:31:28] <tomaka> is glium strange, is it the fact that you couldn't find other libraries that is strange?
