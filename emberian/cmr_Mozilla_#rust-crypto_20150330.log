[12:21:47] <Dcoder> are people seriously considering that algebraic eraser thing?
[12:22:04] <Ilari> Looks to have many downsides...
[12:22:20] <Ilari> (Besides the amount of research on security)
[12:22:41] <Dcoder> braid crypto has a horrible track record, it would require very convincing evidence to trust it one bit
[12:23:33] <Ilari> Yeah, most "new" kinds of crypto have terrible track record.
[12:25:09] <Ilari> Also, ECC doesn't fare too well either if you get to fields with higher amounts of internal structure (which is why medium-prime ECC is not used)..
[12:26:53] <Ilari> There's a whole bunch of asymmetric cryptographic constructs based on "NP complete" problems. Almost invariably terrible (or if not downright terrible, at least bad).
[12:28:00] <Dcoder> the notable exception being mcliece
[12:28:45] <Ilari> It takes heck a lot of research to build confidence in asymmetric crypto algorithm.
[12:29:55] <Dcoder> yes, but some problems start with the right foot, others with the left
[12:30:15] <Dcoder> ecc was essentially unbroken from the start
[12:30:30] <Dcoder> you can find weak instances, yes, but those are 'sparse'
[12:30:56] <Dcoder> braid schemes were introduced in 1999, 16 years ago, and not a single good one showed up yet
[12:31:13] <Ilari> If you use fields with less structure yes. Try to use more structured fields and watch insecurity become natural.
[12:31:40] <Ilari> If you think binary ECC is bad, there is a lot worse fields out there.
[12:31:45] <Dcoder> even the worst fields are kind of 'ok'
[12:31:47] <Ilari> *are
[12:32:17] <Dcoder> they reduce the cost below the pollard bound, but they generally don't make the break polynomial
[12:32:51] <Dcoder> not sure if it's even subexponential, unless you assume the exponent grows to infinity
[12:33:12] <Ilari> I think I saw a paper that constructed family of fields that had natural for curves to have polynomial-time(!) ECDLP.
[12:34:08] <Dcoder> anomalous curves?
[12:34:19] <Dcoder> those are actually hard to construct over anything other than prime fields
[12:34:42] <Ilari> Anomalous curves are not natural. And the bad fields were medium-char extension fields.
[12:34:57] *** Joins: Tobba|Craptop (Tobba@moz-1hh.7ki.21.217.IP)
[12:35:01] <Dcoder> ok that must be the joux thing then
[12:35:17] <Ilari> Nautral => most of the curves over field are weak.
[12:35:20] *** Quits: Tobba|Craptop (Tobba@moz-1hh.7ki.21.217.IP) (Connection closed)
[12:35:59] <Dcoder> as in https://www-fourier.ujf-grenoble.fr/~viva/research/articles/CoverDecomp.pdf , not the quasi-polynomial FF discrete log
[12:37:05] <Ilari> Basically, with ECC over GF(p^q), if q>2 and p>2, watch out.
[12:38:18] <Dcoder> table 1 in pg 10; still strictly exponential
[12:40:20] <Dcoder> and if you take the time*memory cost, it's not so hot anymore --- best complexity is #E^~2^7 vs #E^3 from pollard
[12:40:38] <Dcoder> #E^2.7, rather
[12:42:37] <Ilari> And with g=3, I think hyperelliptics are still estimated to be strong, but it is difficult to ensure those don't transform to non-hyperelliptics, which are broken. In g=2, that isn't a problem.
[12:43:11] <Ilari> Of course, I think "broken" there is fully exponential.
[12:43:15] <Dcoder> genus 3 is broken, iirc
[12:43:23] <Dcoder> due to isogenies to nonhyperelliptics
[12:43:56] <Dcoder> https://eprint.iacr.org/2007/428
[12:46:57] <Ilari> I guess the reason why GF(2^q) isn't so broken is that having trace 2 really limits the operations one can apply (heck, one needs trace 5 before one can even use short weierstrass form).
[12:48:26] <Ilari> But even then, GF(2^q) is noticeably more broken for ECC than GF(p).
[12:49:08] <Dcoder> i don't know about broken, but certainly more risky
[12:49:53] <Ilari> Well, noticeably more broken curves (even if not anywhere even near majority).
[12:51:45] <Dcoder> ah yes
[12:52:48] <Ilari> I think there is better PQ key exchange than that AE (is AE even PQ?).
[12:58:02] <Dcoder> don't think it's settled; might be PQ

[17:58:21] <Dcoder> swapping endianness is literally 2 instructions, even without programmer help
[17:59:59] <Ilari> There's a x86 instruction that swaps endianess of register value.
[18:00:24] <Dcoder> that too, MOVBE

[19:36:38] <Ilari> Seems like PQ crypto is pretty hard.

[19:55:36] <Ilari> Is there some purported PQ system that isn't NPC as general version?
[19:56:11] <Ilari> Or actually, thought not to be.
[19:59:45] <Ilari> Ah, hash-based signatures: NP is inapplicable as concept.
[20:01:32] <eternaleye> The Merkle subthread of the AE discussion is quite worrisome.
[20:01:58] <eternaleye> Public parameters derived from 'random' data, where disclosure of the random data results in a complete break.
[20:02:18] <eternaleye> Holy shades of DUAL-EC-DRBG, Batman!
[20:02:24] <Ilari> eternaleye: It is worse than that.
[20:03:48] <Ilari> eternaleye: With DUAL-EC (there are actually useful algorithms with that type of backdoor), you can just do verifiably pseudorandom (not "verifiably pseudorandom") parameter generation. Won't work here.
[20:07:12] <Ilari> eternaleye: It seems that to get ECC PAKE algorithm, you either need two generators and get DUAL-EC type backdoor, or you need hash-into-curve, which is nontrivial to do in constant-time.

[22:31:19] <Ilari> bascule: I saw some RFC6125 validation code in one project. Looked pretty nuts, don't even know if it is even near correct.
[22:35:24] <bascule> I'm guessing mine had some problems
[22:35:27] <bascule> we found some this morning
[22:38:02] <Ilari> I mean, how hard matching DNS names could be (apart from all kinds of fun DNS allows)? Pretty fun apparently.
[22:38:31] <bascule> lololol :(
[22:38:46] <bascule> it's all complicated by the fact that wildcards allow more than just "*.x.y"
[22:38:51] <bascule> like "a*c.x.y"
[22:39:04] <bascule> if you just disallow anything but "*.x.y" a lot of the complexity melts away
[22:39:41] <Ilari> Label of '*' is apparently special in DNS.
[22:40:12] <bascule> only allowing "*." as a wildcard is what Chrome and Firefox do
[22:40:22] <bascule> even though RFC 6125 is technically more permissive than that
[22:41:05] <Ilari> AFAIK, in DNS, '*' can only be covered by a wildcard.
[22:41:37] <Ilari> But e.g. 'a*' is just ordinary label in QNAME.
[22:44:20] <Ilari> For DNS 'a*c.x.y' is completely ordinary sequence of labels.
[22:47:44] <bascule> now add IDNA names!
[22:47:45] <bascule> lol
[22:51:00] <Ilari> If you want crazy, try gatewayed DNS-SD zones.
[22:52:05] <Ilari> Mix of IDNA and UTF-8 native with, everything except controls (_including_ '.') allowed.
[22:53:30] <Ilari> And that '.' is quite a bit worse than spaces (which are allowed too).
