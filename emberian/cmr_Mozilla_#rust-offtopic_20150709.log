[06:22:02] <benh> i was talking to a smart enough c++ programmer a while back who had been toying around with implementing lisps for high school assignments and building GUI description DSLs using c++ operator overloading before pursuing a career in theoretical physics and he did think that rust made things too complicated, while generally being a fan of its approach :P
[06:22:19] <huon> Elaine: fully functoinal with Rust?
[06:22:37] <Elaine> huon: no, but it boots and we can "flash" a program to it and execute it.
[06:22:48] <huon> nice
[06:22:59] <Elaine> And the disk controller in theory can control a disk -- but we don't know how to actually use it yet.
[06:23:28] <Elaine> We don't have a 50-pin SCSI card for anything but the PDP-11 so we'll need to use a shim to write to the disk over serial to bootstrap.

[06:49:54] <lahwran> is this because a proposal was accepted?
[06:49:57] <eddyb> no
[06:50:02] <lahwran> just goofing off?
[06:50:04] <eddyb> it's because we're getting a MIR
[06:50:12] <lahwran> MIRror?
[06:50:20] <lahwran> MIRi?
[06:50:22] <lahwran> MIRth?
[06:50:24] <eddyb> the only difficulty to implementing generators in Rust is transforming control flow
[06:50:27] <eddyb> lahwran: mid-level IR
[06:51:06] <eddyb> nmatsakis has the start of a prototype
[06:51:06] <lahwran> oh
[06:51:20] <lahwran> btw has any progress been made on bootstrapping from asm
[06:51:22] <lahwran> 'cause like
[06:51:25] <lahwran> that'd be wicked
[06:51:29] <Mutabah> Ooh, I wonder if I could use that to write a plugin that converts rust code into UDI drivers
[06:51:32] <eddyb> it becomes almost trivial, except for the fact that one body becomes arbitrarily many Generator impls
[06:51:50] <lahwran> "arbitrarily many"?
[06:51:51] <eddyb> (see the Generator trait in the "infrastructure" bit in my gist)
[06:51:58] <eddyb> lahwran: yes!
[06:52:00] <eddyb> that's the trick
[06:52:17] <eddyb> each yield point can have a different type
[06:52:27] <lahwran> ...
[06:52:44] <eddyb> let x: Vec<u8> = yield "give me bytes"; let y: String = yield "give me string";
[06:52:51] <lahwran> so the number of Generator impls is a linear function of something in the code
[06:53:15] <eddyb> lahwran: it's in the return type
[06:53:39] <eddyb> -> impl Generator<()> + Generator<Vec<u8>> + Generator<String>
[06:53:39] <lahwran> sounds cool
[06:53:40] <lahwran> gimme
[06:53:50] <eddyb> well, I'm not sure about passing () to initialize it

[06:53:54] <eddyb> I need to think about that
[06:53:59] <eddyb> lahwran: how else?
[06:54:07] <eddyb> lahwran: but look at that Async trait

[06:54:35] <lahwran> I mean in python you can't return anything from generators
[06:54:42] <eddyb> lahwran: sure you can
[06:54:45] <benh> due to ecosystem effects if nothing eles
[06:54:45] <Elaine> er, what?
[06:54:48] <eddyb> they're just not named "generators" or something
[06:54:48] <Elaine> of course you can.
[06:54:55] <lahwran> well I mean
[06:55:05] <lahwran> the only thing you can return from a generator is the generator iterator itself
[06:55:11] <eddyb> lahwran: oh
[06:55:16] <lahwran> after that you're doing yields
[06:55:16] <Elaine> oh, literal "return"
[06:55:18] <Mutabah> eddyb: Why arbitary?
[06:55:21] <lahwran> yes, literal return
[06:55:34] <eddyb> yeah, I also support a final return value
[06:55:36] <Mutabah> eddyb: The way I see generators is as a way of writing iterators
[06:55:41] <lahwran> eddyb: from my perspective it feels like yield should be in-function type inference
[06:55:41] <eddyb> lahwran: also see the Iterator impl
[06:55:55] <eddyb> lahwran: yeah but you need to expose a public interface
[06:56:10] <eddyb> Mutabah: that's a good way to not get async functions at the same time :P
[06:56:30] <eddyb> fkaa: I can only read "angst" on that page
[06:56:33] <lahwran> you can build iterators out of async things, easy-peasy

[06:57:04] <fkaa> i get the results this afternoon
[06:57:07] <fkaa> whenever that is
[06:57:15] <fkaa> then i have to hunt for apartment
[06:57:31] <eddyb> to make try! work, I basically had to allow generators to have a return value, different from the yielded values
[06:58:09] <eddyb> instead of Some(a), Some(b), ..., None of Iterators you get Value(a), Value(b), ..., Return(x)
[06:58:16] <lahwran> wat
[06:58:38] <eddyb> for async I/O functions that's Result<(), io::Error>
[06:58:48] <eddyb> Return(Ok(())) would indicate success
[06:58:56] <eddyb> while Return(Err(e)) would indicate failure
[06:59:05] <eddyb> fkaa: good luck :D
[06:59:55] <eddyb> lahwran: a function with -> impl Generator<(), Value=T, Return=()> would return a type that also implements Iterator
[07:00:08] <eddyb> -> impl Iterator<Item=T> could be special cased to do that

[07:07:56] <Elaine> I'd just call it "radically different"
[07:07:58] <lahwran> eddyb: so what, is intel going to steal half of this, screw it up, shrink it to 0.5 nm, and then sell it as the next best thing?
[07:08:04] <eddyb> heh, that works
[07:08:09] <eddyb> lahwran: well, no

[07:08:22] <eddyb> Mill took ages to come out, bit by bit

[07:18:52] <lahwran> this is great news
[07:19:06] <eddyb> so out of order CPUs try to optimize your code at runtime
[07:19:12] <eddyb> the Mill makes you use an optimizing compiler
[07:19:13] <lahwran> yes
[07:19:21] <eddyb> which everyone uses nowadays!
[07:19:32] <lahwran> er
[07:19:44] <eddyb> intel is still living in the 80's
[07:19:46] <lahwran> you can still beat an optimizing compiler by a bit
[07:19:46] <Mutabah> eddyb: That said, OoO CPUs have more information than the optimiser

[07:20:29] <lahwran> in which case I can just say it

[07:25:06] <eddyb> no matter what ordering it does
[07:25:21] <eddyb> lahwran: as for branch prediction, Mill's is more powerful
[07:25:25] <eddyb> it can also be saved to disk
[07:25:25] <benh> it can execute all of F and G in one instruction? :P
[07:25:39] <eddyb> benh: the instruction resumes after the execution of F and G
[07:25:49] <eddyb> it's a bit odd
[07:25:59] <eddyb> maybe they should've stuck with arithmetic :P
[07:26:19] <benh> i guess it has to be like that so their static optimization works in the face of unknown call graphs
[07:26:45] <eddyb> the only non-local state in OoO CPUs that I can think of is branch prediction
[07:26:58] <eddyb> do intel CPUs let you inspect branch prediction tables for PGO?
[07:27:38] <eddyb> on the Mill the intent is to persist branch prediction tables by default, IIRC

[07:39:07] <Mutabah> *Coarse
[07:39:15] <eddyb> so they're going to hit more rarely than on intel CPUs
[07:39:25] <eddyb> Mutabah: let me find the wiki page
[07:39:52] <Mutabah> I think I ahve it
[07:40:08] <eddyb> lahwran: another random thing: it can do speculative vector operations, like strcpy: 32-byte copies per iteration, without reading or writing past the end and without having a byte-grained loop
[07:40:35] <eddyb> lahwran: there's special values that do nothing when you write them to memory, and others that trigger an exception
[07:40:41] <Elaine> that particular example has nothing "vector" about it -- what else can it do vectored?
[07:40:55] <eddyb> Elaine: vector copies of 32 bytes?
[07:41:16] <eddyb> (I'm not sure what you mean)
[07:41:19] <Elaine> what makes that a "vector copy" compared to any other data transfer?
[07:41:43] <eddyb> the fact that it has elements :P?
[07:42:04] <Elaine> Ok. Can it do a mad speculatively?
[07:42:07] <Elaine> etc?
[07:42:22] <eddyb> in one cycle you can find the first 0 byte in those 32 bytes and replace everything after it with those None values that do nothing when written to memory
[07:43:05] <eddyb> if the 0 happens to be at the end of a page, and the next page is unallocated, values after the 0 in that vector will be NaRs
[07:43:18] <eddyb> so replacing them with None's is essential to avoiding the page fault
[07:43:24] <eddyb> Elaine: "mad"?
[07:44:17] <Elaine> multiply-add, a+b*c
[07:44:31] <aatch> Elaine, oh, FMA
[07:44:40] <Elaine> it doesn't have to be fused..
[07:44:50] <eddyb> lahwran: and this delayed exception thing is also available for, e.g. arithmetic overflow. I tried implementing it in Rust using SSE saturation on x86 and it's crazy good, but still not as fast as unchecked
[07:44:55] <eddyb> Elaine: what's speculative about it?
[07:45:03] <eddyb> Elaine: oh, I meant, speculative vectorized loops
[07:45:09] <eddyb> guess that's where the confusion came from
[07:45:23] <eddyb> "loop" not "operation". sorry
[07:45:28] <Elaine> ah
[07:45:59] <eddyb> so strcpy is just 3 instructions or something like that
[07:46:15] <eddyb> same for strncpy, memcpy, memset, etc.
[07:46:56] <eddyb> you'll probably want to inline them most of the time
[07:47:21] <Elaine> the circuitry I have in mind for implementing that is annoying and has a fair amount of propagation delay, I wonder what cycle speeds they're talking about.
[07:47:33] <Mutabah> eddyb: As a hobby osdev, chunks of this architecture seem odd
[07:47:42] <eddyb> Mutabah: yeah, they do
[07:47:45] <eddyb> you should watch the talks
[07:47:54] <Mutabah> Like the fact that the return stack is in hardware?
[07:48:05] <eddyb> Mutabah: and it comes with IOMMU that you can't turn off
[07:48:21] <eddyb> physical memory is allocated in hardware
[07:48:26] <Mutabah> IOMMU is more of a motherboard thing
[07:48:45] <Mutabah> (well, the interface between RAM and devices)
[07:48:52] <eddyb> hmpf
[07:49:03] <eddyb> nevermind that bit, I still don't have details
[07:49:11] <aatch> Hey, the #10 talk might be the first where I can see where he's oversimplifying.
[07:49:16] <eddyb> :P
[07:49:25] <aatch> I know about compilers!
[07:49:30] <eddyb> Mutabah: so the OS is started with mapped device memory, mapped ROM and nothing else
[07:49:35] <Mutabah> eddyb: Know if they have an ISA yet? Or even an emulator?
[07:49:44] <eddyb> Mutabah: both
[07:50:04] <eddyb> they're working on a FPGA implementation and polishing their LLVM-based toolchain
[07:50:06] <Mutabah> eddyb: IOMMU = MMU that applies to the device's DMA engines
[07:50:09] <aatch> Mutabah, yep, not sure if they're public, but one of the talks is a demonstration of the emulator.
[07:50:26] <Mutabah> s/'s/s'
[07:50:33] <eddyb> you input instructions into the emulator by writing C++ code
[07:50:55] <eddyb> they don't have a textual assembler, at least I hope they don't
[07:51:14] <Mutabah> eddyb: Well.. if they have a LLVM backend... <_< >_>
[07:51:18] <eddyb> they have only a macro assembler which is generated from the same instruction specifications that will generate the LLVM backend, presumably
[07:51:34] <eddyb> also get turned into a PDF spec etc. :P
[07:53:15] <eddyb> Mutabah: here's the hierarchy http://millcomputing.com/wiki/Memory
[07:53:30] <Mutabah> Yeah, read that
[07:53:38] <eddyb> the MMU there looks like an IOMMU to me
[07:53:44] <Mutabah> Not quite
[07:53:44] <eddyb> where it's placed
[07:54:37] <eddyb> Mutabah: and things like transient memory allocations can live solely in cache
[07:54:40] <Mutabah> Iirc, the IOMMU is a memory-management unit used to allow exposing access of PCI devices to VMs
[07:54:48] <eddyb> without ever reaching DRAM
[07:55:00] <Mutabah> So it sits between the device and the RAM
[07:55:23] <eddyb> Mutabah: what I know is that without an IOMMU any device with DMA access is thoroughly unsafe
[07:55:25] <Mutabah> eddyb: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOMMU
[07:55:35] <Mutabah> Yep.
[07:55:38] <eddyb> it can do whatever it wants with the whole of RAM
[07:56:02] <Mutabah> Point is, there's no IOMMU on that diagram. There's a MMU is a non-standard place, but no IOMMU
[07:56:16] <eddyb> Mutabah: what I gather from the Mill hirerarchy is that you can't cross from a device to DRAM without going through the MMU
[07:56:21] <eddyb> but it's placed to the side so idk
[07:57:11] <Elaine> that has some nasty sync issues with the CPU and DMA engine access to RAM
[07:57:24] <Elaine> (just designed this subsystem today for the architecture we're working on...)
[07:57:42] <eddyb> heh
[07:59:17] <eddyb> > All memory accesses happen in the order they occur in the program. This is sequential consistency. No access reordering happens, and consequently there is no need for memory fences and the like.
[07:59:22] <eddyb> I wonder what this means
[07:59:25] <eddyb> for atomics
[07:59:43] <eddyb> > This order is not only maintained on a single core, but a defined order for all cores on a chip is maintained with the cache coherency protocol.
[07:59:50] <Elaine> Everything is atomic, thus you don't need any.
[08:00:06] <Mutabah> eddyb: I'd assume there's no plans for HVM, so no need for a real IOMMU
[08:00:12] <eddyb> that's like removing the possibility of reodering expressions from C
[08:00:18] <Elaine> no it's not
[08:00:24] <eddyb> I mena
[08:00:27] <eddyb> *I mean
[08:00:34] <Elaine> and cache coherency is well understand and implemented, with incredibly high performance.
[08:00:42] <eddyb> it's a sane decision
[08:00:46] <Elaine> (nvidia's everything is cache coherent, if not now, than moving forward)
[08:01:10] <eddyb> and the loss might only be visible on old architectures
[08:01:24] <eddyb> Elaine: would this mean Arc and Rc behave identically on the Mill?
[08:01:45] <Elaine> yes.
[08:01:51] <Elaine> well, no.
[08:01:55] <eddyb> or is there some difference in optimizations and maybe the lock-like looping we're adding?
[08:02:04] <Elaine> just because memory access is atomic doesn't mean addition is.
[08:02:13] <eddyb> Mutabah: you still need IOMMU to ensure devices can't do shit they're not supposed to
[08:02:16] <eddyb> Elaine: ah, right
[08:02:17] <Elaine> you still need atomic arithmetic
[08:02:31] <Mutabah> eddyb: ... you generally trust devices to do what you tell them to
[08:02:35] <eddyb> Mutabah: no
[08:02:43] <eddyb> that's another thing that has to be thrown out
[08:02:47] <Mutabah> _generally_
[08:02:49] <Elaine> Mutabah: what about thunderstruck etc?
[08:02:54] <Mutabah> Barring devices that expose the PCI bus
[08:03:01] <eddyb> PCI-e is very powerful
[08:03:03] <Mutabah> Which should have a MMU-like device built in
[08:03:15] <aatch> Also, we still need the "volatile" aspect to prevent LLVM from making invalid optimisations.
[08:03:16] <eddyb> USB 3.1 is the future
[08:03:28] <Mutabah> Oh god, does it expose DMA again?

[08:03:52] <eddyb> I'm not sure
[08:04:22] <eddyb> universal composable serial buses with protocol negotiation
[08:04:45] <Mutabah> The Firewire and Thunderbolt attacks were due to bad hardware design mostly
[08:05:51] <eddyb> on the Mill you can model each device as a turf
[08:05:58] <Mutabah> well... interface design
[08:05:58] <Mutabah> Hopefully, this USB will use pre-allocated buffers instead of arbitary addresses
[08:05:58] <Mutabah> Because otherwise, it's just one more attack surface systems designers have to account for
[08:06:00] <eddyb> and give it precise permissions
[08:06:32] <eddyb> (I'm not sure that's the plan, but it seems like a good plan :P)
[08:07:06] <eddyb> allocating 10 bytes on the heap somwhere, allowing access to *only* those 10 bytes and revoking it after the device has finished writing them
[08:07:29] <eddyb> devices are just microkernel services :P
[08:08:12] <eddyb> Mutabah: oh and this means zero-copy transfers
[08:08:29] <eddyb> userspace lends buffer to driver, driver lends it to device
[08:08:37] <eddyb> device writes userspace memory
[08:08:52] <Mutabah> eddyb: Pretty common thing in modern OSes
[08:08:58] <Mutabah> Scatter-gather lists are awesome
[08:09:15] <eddyb> yeah, but you have hardware protection for all of it on the Mill
[08:09:44] <Mutabah> I'd presume it's to make the memory model closer to being unified, nice idea really
[08:10:21] <eddyb> and hey, maybe JVM will be efficient enough to run on Mill phones
[08:10:24] <Mutabah> I'd be interested to see an implementation, and to write drivers for it
[08:10:36] <eddyb> Mutabah: you're not alone :D
[08:10:59] <eddyb> a smart GC on the Mill can have a somewhat ridiculous throughput
[08:11:13] <eddyb> it just has to be careful to keep almost everything in cache
[08:11:33] <eddyb> you can allocate and release physical memory without ever touching DRAM
[08:13:51] <eddyb> Mutabah: oh they have something textual http://millcomputing.com/wiki/GenAsm_(language)
[08:14:17] <eddyb> I expect it to be mostly used for spec pseudocode though
[08:15:00] <eddyb> Mutabah: http://millcomputing.com/wiki/Instruction_Set

[08:22:20] <eddyb> Elaine: ah, storing to special registers
[08:23:04] <eddyb> "Streams provide cacheless bulk memory access for reading and writing."
[08:23:19] <eddyb> MMIO?
[08:23:43] <Elaine> not usually
[08:23:48] <Mutabah> That, and for bulk memcpy I presume
[08:23:56] <Elaine> it's really useful for avoiding cache pollution.
[08:24:13] <eddyb> L1 or L2?
[08:24:20] <Elaine> x86 has this too
[08:24:45] <eddyb> direct DRAM access sound like asking for trouble unless it's large enough chunk

[12:00:21] <eddyb> WindowsBunny: you mean `impl !Sized for Struct {}`?
[12:00:52] <eddyb> we can't get that without Sizeable though

[12:04:20] <eddyb> trait Sizeable { fn size_of(&self) -> usize; fn align_of(&self) -> usize; } trait Sized: Sizeable {}
[12:04:39] <eddyb> bounds can have ?Sized or ?Sizeable
[12:05:06] <eddyb> if opt out of Sizeable for T you can only use T behind non-owning pointers
[12:05:45] <eddyb> Box<T> and Rc<T> wouldn't work because they need to know how big T is, even if the size is not known at compile-time
[12:06:17] <eddyb> you can impl !Sized for a type, and optionally impl Sizeable
[12:06:26] <eddyb> this way you can thin pointers to trait objects
[12:06:33] <eddyb> (if you also impl Drop)
[12:06:54] <eddyb> something similar to C++ struct layout with the vtable pointer inside the struct

[13:08:52] <Quxxy> The 10% that *do* care enough *can* be helped
[13:09:19] <eddyb> those that care enough only need to be pointer to the nearest library
[13:09:33] <eddyb> these days the internet has enough information to digest
[13:09:42] <benh> :|
[13:09:47] <eddyb> *pointed
[13:09:48] <Quxxy> Sometimes, it's not as simple as not having gone over the material
[13:09:54] <eddyb> I keep making these typos
[13:09:58] <benh> What about those that care but can't afford to devote their entire cognitive ability to a problem
[13:10:08] <Quxxy> Often, the problem is that they've misinterpreted or misunderstood something that got incorporated into their mental model
[13:10:50] <Quxxy> Static explanations are unhelpful, because they're often not aware of the bit of the explanation they don't understand; they *think* they understand it
[13:11:08] <Quxxy> So you have to poke around their heads, playing Spot The Inconsistency
[13:11:28] <Quxxy> benh: It's not about bending your whole being to a problem
[13:11:40] <Quxxy> It's about putting it any reasonable amount of effort at all
[13:11:51] <Quxxy> It's about being willing to at least do a basic Google search first
[13:12:00] <Quxxy> Or to at least *write down* what the problem is
[13:12:24] <Quxxy> When I first started tutoring, I'd go out of my way to carefully explain things as best I could to everyone
[13:12:31] <zofrex> Quxxy: I've seen a 4th year masters student who didn't know arrays indexed from 0 in C and Java
[13:12:37] <Quxxy> I gave up when I kept getting people making the *exact* same mistake over and over *and over* again
[13:12:40] <Quxxy> They just *do not care*
[13:12:49] <zofrex> his C code didn't even compile, and his Java code had a catch(ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e) in every place he iterated over an array
[13:12:56] <Quxxy> And every second I waste on them is a second I *could* have spent helping someone who *does* give a shit
[13:13:02] <zofrex> he got a first from a top 3 UK university
[13:13:08] <zofrex> I'm salty because I got a 2:2 :(
[13:14:28] <Quxxy> That said, I've done serious overtime multiple times to stay with people who were genuinely trying to learn
[13:14:44] <Quxxy> We need more good programmers that give a shit :)
[13:15:06] <benh> My perspective here is colored by visiting the same physics lectures year after year and being unable to understand the material, and I like to think I'm not just too stupid or uncaring :(
[13:15:15] <Quxxy> Just don't get me started on the bloody cheaters
[13:16:00] <Quxxy> benh: Doesn't mean you are
[13:16:43] <Quxxy> My go-to story for this is that it took me three tries to "get" Python
[13:17:05] <Quxxy> Simply because it wasn't until the third "intro to Python" that happened to use the "right" words
[13:17:54] <benh> My theory is that I didn't build up enough intuitions in the previous lectures that i managed to pass regardless, but vov, i dropped out, it's all good now
[13:19:48] <benh> tho now I'm slaving away in the Delphi mines on an ERP codebase, so, stay in school, kids!
[13:20:56] <eddyb> if that comment goes under 0 I'll delete it. I think that's a good strategy. idk
[13:21:04] <eddyb> I should work on code
[13:21:10] <eddyb> at least there it cannot get too muddy
[13:22:02] * Quxxy goes back to upvote it
[13:22:08] <benh> eddyb: I don't disagree with your comment, I just don't think it's very applicable to the complexity budget question :P
[13:22:24] <eddyb> the budget is definitely a thing
[13:22:35] <benh> there ~is~ a usecase for dumbed-down languages, just like there's one for non-turing-complete DSLs, and that sort of thing
[13:22:37] <eddyb> I'd argue it's not as much about complexity though
[13:22:51] <eddyb> or rather
[13:22:56] <eddyb> it's not just a complexity cost
[13:23:02] <eddyb> it's a power-complexity ratio
[13:23:10] <eddyb> and Go is kinda failing miserably :P
[13:23:32] <benh> just think of Go as a network services DSL that's used to script its standard library
[13:24:25] <benh> wish i had the chatlogs handy of that conversion with a certified Smart Person who thought Rust was too complicated for even C++ programmers to put up with
[13:24:43] <benh> (while being somewhat a fan of it and trying to port eg. try! to C++)
[13:25:03] <eddyb> I have seen an attempt at try! for C
[13:25:10] <eddyb> but it's hard to generics :P
[13:25:53] <Quxxy> "OpenSSL will attempt to find an alternative certificate chain if the first attempt to build such a chain fails"  Oooh, this sounds fun
[13:26:23] <benh> somewhat unrelatedly i hope the OsStr situation improves :(
[13:26:52] <Quxxy> benh: In what way?
[13:27:27] <benh> Trying to do any of a number of reasonable things to a Path(Buf) seems to involve a lot of seemingly unnecessarily string conversions (and prayers for valid unicode)

[13:37:05] <Havvy> zofrex:  They really should just rename 1.0.2 to 1.2 and 1.0.1 to 1.1.
[13:37:23] <zofrex> 1.1.14/1.1.15 -> 1.1.16 and 1.2.2/1.2.3 -> 1.2.4 would imply stability too and be more in line with how the rest of the world versions things >.>
[13:37:37] <Havvy> Yes.

[13:57:44] <Manishearth> though I did physicsy things
[13:58:09] <Manishearth> (it was quite a surprise when one of my animations turned up in the presentation of a classmate)
[13:58:31] <benh> :D
[13:58:59] <benh> I'm not a fan of hn or /r/programming but I don't really know where to go to read about entry-level programming happenings
[13:59:04] <Manishearth> (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_force#/media/File:Nuclear_Force_anim_smaller.gif to be precise)
[13:59:11] <Manishearth> benh: basically yeah
[13:59:13] <Manishearth> benh: though I
[13:59:24] <Manishearth> 've gotten nice feedback on my own posts on proggit and HN so far
[14:00:09] <Quxxy> Manishearth: The hardest part of visualisation is working out how to do it :P
[14:00:11] <benh> what a scary animation
[14:00:21] <zofrex> HN does have some useful stuff, I find Twitter is a better source for keeping on top of current happenings though
[14:00:43] <benh> It's hard to read people's comments on a thing on twitter though
[14:00:57] <benh> HN comments are often bad but sometimes there's insightful stuff too that puts an article into context
[14:01:14] <Manishearth> benh: my animation on color confinement is scarier :p
[14:01:16] <benh> also reading HN by checking Known Good Commenters' new-comments pages is kinda bearable
[14:01:18] <Manishearth> benh: yep
[14:01:27] <Manishearth> benh: tptacek et al?
[14:01:40] <benh> depends on what you're into :p
[14:02:28] <mrmonday> my problem with proggit is that its SNR is rubbish, and also there's far too much stuff I don't care about (hey, guys, check out my cool new javascript framework!)
[14:02:31] <zofrex> thomas is great but 90% of his comments are correcting people saying silly things
[14:02:47] <benh> isn't that what the internet is all about? :P
[14:03:36] <Manishearth> zofrex: haha right
[14:03:47] <Manishearth> zofrex: he words things well though
[14:04:20] <benh> Maybe there should be a HN frontend that only shows submissions and comment threads that involve a poster on your whitelist
[14:04:41] <Lurkin> I always thought there should be a whitelist only messageboard.
[14:05:21] <benh> I like what twitter people are doing with shared blocklists and I'm curious how that would work for a more traditional messageboard
[14:05:50] <Manishearth> benh: https://github.com/sushant-hiray/tshn could be modified to whitelist

[14:26:19] <zofrex> 15.5 MB? that's obscene

[14:27:18] <niconii> the other thing is... it's reloading an entire mp4 every twenty seconds for no apparent reason
[14:27:26] <niconii> only the cache is saving me
[14:27:38] <Rym> rofl
[14:27:56] <Manishearth> zofrex: for some reason a lot of people *still( think that wanting a page to work okay without javascript is something only cave-hackers will want

[14:28:33] <Quxxy> Don't forget that everyone always has a connection to the internet at all times

[16:33:34] <RC9> jokes on you, i dont have a spleen >:D
[16:33:51] <WindowsBunny> huon: Also, to emit PDB debuginfo you'd have to use COM interfaces

[16:34:57] <huon> Manishearth: presumably if we know how to emit PDB it's easy to emit PDB?
[16:35:02] <huon> WindowsBunny: s/we/llvm/
[16:35:09] <mrmonday> I usually just mark as read/unread and archive

[16:35:24] <huon> Manishearth: yeah, isn't that emitting PDB?
[16:35:27] <Manishearth> huon: yep

[16:36:44] <huon> LLVM *has* to know how to generate the info
[16:36:48] <huon> it'll move code around

[16:38:14] <mrmonday> neither did I, until a few days ago when I put my CV up on job sites :3
[16:38:14] <WindowsBunny> Manishearth: and link.exe actually emits PDB data to a separate .pdb file
[16:38:19] <WindowsBunny> it isn't in the final binary
[16:38:28] <huon> Manishearth: it's not independent of the code
[16:38:34] <mrmonday> meh, there's no need to organise it when there's a search box
[16:38:38] <huon> Manishearth: in fact it's literally 100% dependent on the final code ;P
[16:38:43] <mrmonday> is my usual policy, anyway
[16:38:54] <WindowsBunny> the debug info needs to know all the addresses and stuff
[16:39:21] <WindowsBunny> which isn't known until llvm does all the codegen
[16:40:03] <Manishearth> huon: yeah but can't we just tell llvm what to stick in the data section? :p

[16:55:06] <WindowsBunny> dfockler: converting decimal to hex works, but also means you can't easily tell what the color would be by just looking at it
[16:55:48] <niconii> probably for the best really, just directly using the numbers for colors means most adjacent issues are basically going to have the same exact color but with a bit more/less blue
[16:55:49] <WindowsBunny> niconii: I propose sampling random locations in the sRGB representable portion of CIELAB

[17:37:18] <Tiffany> jemalloc uses mmap to allocate a heap, and then hands out individual allocations from within that heap

[17:58:30] <Quxxy> Fun random fact from my D days: I remember when Walter added code to DEFLATE-compress symbols because it was too easy to exceed the limits of the linker for symbol length
[17:58:49] * WindowsBunny adds ytain to his list of people to brutally maim
[17:59:01] <huon> Quxxy: so symbols were not only mangled but also compressed?
[17:59:06] <Quxxy> Yup! :D
[17:59:09] <ytain> pfffft
[17:59:10] <Quxxy> Well
[17:59:14] <Quxxy> Compressed if they got too long
[17:59:21] <Quxxy> The problem was... generic value parameters!
[18:00:14] <Quxxy> If you had a sufficiently complicated recursive template expansion with a symbol at the end, the compiler had to generate a symbol for it
[18:00:16] *** Joins: listochkin (listochkin@moz-u28j0j.interview.volia.net)
[18:00:26] <Quxxy> And that symbol had to include what amounted to the complete state of the template "program"
[18:01:10] <Quxxy> It was vaguely like if you memoised a function call, using a stack dump as the key
[18:01:30] <Quxxy> So yeah; he had to start DEFLATE compressing the symbols
[18:01:50] <Quxxy> Didn't help that DMD emitted OMF objects, which was the format Microsoft was using back in the DOS days
[18:01:56] <Quxxy> So it was a 16-bit format
[18:02:04] <Quxxy> And the linker, OPTLINK, was written in assembler around the same time
[18:02:09] <Quxxy> So changing it was basically *impossible*
[18:02:16] <WindowsBunny> wat
[18:02:21] <WindowsBunny> How old is D?
[18:02:26] <Quxxy> Aaah D... the language of horrific, nightmare-inducing toolchain problems
[18:02:28] <Quxxy> Not that old
[18:02:34] <Quxxy> Walter Bright wrote one of the first C++ compilers
[18:02:44] <Quxxy> It might have been the first *conformant* one
[18:02:55] <Quxxy> So dmc and optlink are *old as balls*
[18:03:02] <WindowsBunny> D is from 2006 according to wikipedia
[18:03:10] <Quxxy> DMD is new, but uses the dmc codegen backend and optlink as a linker
[18:03:27] <WindowsBunny> why was it using super ancient stuff?
[18:03:34] <Quxxy> So the frontend is new; everything else is older than sin
[18:03:48] <WindowsBunny> that's awful
[18:03:48] <Quxxy> ... because the code existed, worked, and Walter wrote it himself, so he was familiar with it
[18:03:59] <zofrex> Quxxy: that made me throw up a little in my mouth
[18:04:04] <Quxxy> Also, DMD was *closed source*

[18:04:41] <Quxxy> It just... ended up compounding problems down the line
[18:05:07] <Quxxy> Walter ended up translating OPTLINK to C years later, just to try and get it to the point where it was possible to modify it
[18:05:41] <Quxxy> Oh!
[18:05:48] <Quxxy> This was all also why it took so long to get a 64-bit version of D
[18:05:58] <Quxxy> The backend never supported it
[18:06:05] <Quxxy> And *nothing* else deals in OMF any more
[18:06:12] <Quxxy> So a heap of new stuff had to be written

[18:14:43] <ytain> WindowsBunny are you looking for ways to add pdb output to the llvm?
[18:14:51] <huon> it's legal to use flags for more than one press conference
[18:14:57] <huon> at least, last time I checked.
[18:15:18] <WindowsBunny> ytain: I'm interested in getting someone to get llvm to emit PDB debuginfo
[18:15:21] <Quxxy> No, see, they *are* re-using them; they just need to stand in front of increasingly larger numbers

[18:15:28] <Quxxy> It even has a pie chart
[18:15:37] <ytain> WindowsBunny there's a commit but I don't know if it is helpful
[18:15:44] <ytain> http://reviews.llvm.org/D7153
[18:15:57] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: fuck that news site
[18:16:15] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: Give me a link that doesn't require a subscription
[18:16:16] <Quxxy> What did it do?
[18:16:16] <huon> Quxxy: wait, holy shit
[18:16:30] <Quxxy> ... uh, I wasn't aware that link *needed* a subscription
[18:16:32] <huon> Quxxy: pop-up paywall
[18:16:37] <Quxxy> Really?!
[18:16:42] <Quxxy> I didn't see one
[18:17:00] <huon> I'm not in aus atm?
[18:17:08] <Quxxy> Is there any easy way to screencap a whole page in FF?
[18:17:11] <huon> maybe it's special US-only paywall
[18:17:11] <bluss> noscript it and you're as good as paid
[18:17:23] <WindowsBunny> hahahaha
[18:17:29] <WindowsBunny> firefox reader view lets me read it
[18:17:30] <ytain> I don't get the paywall popup
[18:17:34] <WindowsBunny> totally bypasses the paywall xD
[18:17:36] <bluss> I get it, not in the US
[18:17:39] <ytain> I use noscript, maybe that helps
[18:17:46] <WindowsBunny> of course, then I can't see the pie charts
[18:18:13] <Quxxy> If reader view works, maybe try F12 and kill the popup elements
[18:18:25] <Quxxy> Depends on how inept their devs are :P
[18:18:34] <huon> didn't work for me
[18:18:46] <huon> however I can see the pie charts under the popup element
[18:19:03] <Quxxy> I will imgur some screenshots
[18:19:24] <WindowsBunny> ytain: That just dumps the content of PDB files, not useful for emitting PDB data 
[18:19:39] <Quxxy> Oh great

[23:03:10] <huon> there's on track
[23:03:12] <huon> *one
[23:03:23] <bluss> Eridius: you're a notorious early adopter now
[23:03:34] <bluss> Eridius: why are you still here? We're 1.0 quality now :-)
[23:03:39] <lahwran> huon: and how many talks are going to be comedy
[23:03:45] <Eridius> haha
[23:03:52] <lahwran> Eridius: check out idris
[23:03:58] <lahwran> or ceylon
[23:04:11] <Eridius> lahwran: isn't Idris that language that's about dependent types?
[23:04:17] <Elaine> lahwran: http://rustcamp.com/schedule.html none of them!
[23:04:19] <lahwran> yep, and it's pretty early-stage
[23:04:24] <Elaine> although Gankro is pretty funny usually.
[23:04:35] <huon> haha funny or peculiar funny?
[23:04:37] <huon> :P
[23:04:38] <Gankro> bluh
[23:04:40] <Eridius> I haven't really looked at dependent types (although that talk at the rust 1.0 meetup was pretty neat)
[23:05:55] <Eridius> heh, funny that Idris explicitly says it uses eager evaluation. I guess it's because the feature list sounds so much like Haskell that they were afraid people would assume it was lazy?
[23:08:05] <XMPPwocky> https://play.rust-lang.org/?gist=d02f73ae9f671f0d47a5&version=stable look onto my works, ye mighty, and despair
[23:08:55] <huon> XMPPwocky: what are you doing
[23:09:07] <XMPPwocky> nothing good
[23:09:22] <XMPPwocky>     let mut ___=__;___=____::___::<__>(<_>::__(<_>::__(___)), __);
[23:09:32] <XMPPwocky> valid, meaningful
[23:09:52] <Eridius> XMPPwocky: why do you have the PartialOrd and PartialEq impls? They're not used
[23:10:00] <XMPPwocky> Eridius: oh, i forgot i wanted to do that
[23:10:28] <Eridius> I assume the goal is to make it as hard as possible to figure out which uses of < and > are for type parameters versus comparisons?
[23:11:16] <XMPPwocky> i don't even know anymore
[23:11:41] <niconii> XMPPwocky: you can change `let mut ___=` to `let mut ___@_:_=` fyi
[23:13:52] <niconii> playbot: let ___@_:_=1__6____;___
[23:13:53] -playbot- 16
[23:14:03] <XMPPwocky> it's worked too well, i'm trying to change it and i can't parse it mentally anymore
[23:18:27] <niconii> the problem with rust is there's not a whole lot of tricks you can do with it as far as obfuscation goes :c
[23:18:37] <niconii> ...i mean that's probably a good thing but
[23:18:38] <XMPPwocky> __::___(__, <_>::___(||(), ____::___::<__>(<_>::__(<_>::__(___)), __)))==__::___(__,||__)||__::___(__,||())==__;
