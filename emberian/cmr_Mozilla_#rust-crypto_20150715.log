[00:00:24] <bascule> more specifically: https://speakerdeck.com/tarcieri/thoughts-on-rust-cryptography?slide=130
[00:00:28] <eternaleye> Yeah, I saw your slide after I thought "These trait things would be perfect for crypto"
[00:00:32] <bascule> heh
[00:00:37] <eternaleye> But it's what really got me motivated to _do_ it
[00:00:47] <bascule> would be nice if they could be parametric/dependent around size
[00:00:54] <bascule> which I think is something Ilari has complained about quite a bit, heh
[00:01:27] <eternaleye> But for example, it was only with nrc's DST coercions landing that it become possible to apply a constraint to generic parameters that is equivalent to "must be a compile-time-sized array"
[00:01:54] <eternaleye> bascule: Only primitive, sized arrays can possibly impl std::ops::Unsize<[T]>
[00:02:22] <eternaleye> bascule: Your type that takes A: Unsize<[T]> now monomorphizes on array size.
[00:02:59] <eternaleye> If you do T: Unsize<[u8]> then you can use mem::size_of() and get some decent stuff going
[00:03:22] <eternaleye> And once ::SIZE assoc const lands, then even that's unneccessary.
[00:04:10] <eternaleye> But T: Unsize<[u8]> will accept [u8; n] forall n, and _only_ [u8; n]

[00:05:21] <eternaleye> (That reminds me; that REALLY needs to get used to fix the absurdity of the impl's for [T; n]  for n in 1..32.)

[00:07:56] <eternaleye> Hm, random thought. Could AEZ be a workable wide-block encryption mode for disk encryption if used with τ = 0?
[00:09:28] <eternaleye> I think it's explicit non-support of online encryption yields the same desirable properties...
[00:09:30] <eternaleye> *its
[00:12:28] <eternaleye> If you treat the sector number as the nonce, I think it actually meets the optimal achievable properties of a disk encryption mode...
[00:21:00] <eternaleye> Well, just fired off an email to Rogaway asking about it
[00:23:07] *** Quits: vks (quassel@moz-42n5l0.pools.vodafone-ip.de) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[00:32:02] <eternaleye> Being able to use the same cipher mode for sector-level, extent/file level, and network stuff would be pretty neat :D

[00:49:49] <Ilari> eternaleye: One could presumably set parameters on TLS context before starting handshake. Those things could include things like trusted certs and other stuff.
[00:51:00] <Ilari> eternaleye: And that server end-entity cert things was that one can set non-CA certs as trust anchors (which then only match the end-entity cert).
[00:51:00] <eternaleye> Ilari: Yes, my point is that on connecting to an unknown self-signed host, you don't have their cert yet in order to trust it.
[00:51:38] <bascule> Ilari: clients should have origin-bound certificates they send in their ClientHello!#$#!#$#! :o :o :o
[00:51:49] <eternaleye> Ilari: So you eat an additional handshake of latency
[00:52:10] <Ilari> eternaleye: Obtain the cert off-band.
[00:52:28] <eternaleye> Ilari: Er, yeah, I don't think that's going to fly in a general TLS lib.
[00:52:40] *** Joins: bpugh (bpugh@moz-715e47.ca.comcast.net)
[00:52:59] <Ilari> Who said this TLS lib is suitable for browsers?
[00:53:00] <Ilari> :-)
[00:53:10] <eternaleye> Ilari: Or SMTP, or IMAP, or...
[00:53:45] <eternaleye> Ilari: I'd honestly be much more in favor of TlsSession<V: ValidationPolicy>
[00:54:05] <Ilari> Security in SMTP is crap. Dunno how bad IMAP usually is (even tho I use it a lot).
[00:54:10] <eternaleye> Where implementations are things like "SystemCerts", "CustomCerts(...)", "Tofu", etc.
[00:54:29] <eternaleye> Ilari: Largely same as web, actually (for IMAP)
[00:54:41] <eternaleye> Ilari: Though for self-deployed stuff it is often a bit more Tofu
[00:55:42] <eternaleye> Ilari: Since IMAP is usually from the MUA, which has similar user-interaction capacities as a browser
[00:56:54] <eternaleye> Ilari: Also, out-of-band certs interacts REALLY poorly with short-lifetime certs that get rotated on a relatively quick basis
[00:57:24] <Ilari> How would one determine trust to one? By what signs the certs?
[00:57:30] <eternaleye> Ilari: Which is something that Google seems to be eyeing speculatively for various things, and LE is likely to try since they have auto-reissuance
[00:57:59] <eternaleye> *shrug*
[00:58:06] <Ilari> LE has both auto-reissue (which is good) and auto-rekey (which I think is much less so).
[00:58:10] <eternaleye> Ilari: Also, certs aren't the only trust model
[00:58:31] <eternaleye> Ilari: Augmented PAKE systems, for example, are sort of the duck typing of server auth :P
[00:59:00] <Ilari> Anyway, Let's say you have rapidly rotated cert. How you plan to determine if the cert you got from server is good or not?
[00:59:29] <eternaleye> Ilari: Well, for one it might be signed by other certs chained with it
[00:59:42] <eternaleye> Ilari: Those might be less rapid, but still not known ahead of time
[01:00:19] <eternaleye> Ilari: But really, it winds up devolving back into that if you don't already know them, you either need an extran handshake of latency, or out-of-band
[01:00:31] <eternaleye> Ilari: Neither is going to be a popular thing to impose
[01:00:55] <eternaleye> Ilari: Especially if what the client _actually wants_ is TOFU
[01:01:03] *** Quits: bpugh (bpugh@moz-715e47.ca.comcast.net) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[01:01:05] <eternaleye> Ilari: Because then it's double-latency, no choices.
[01:02:09] <eternaleye> I do agree that a blind true/false callback is far too easily abused
[01:02:25] <eternaleye> If someone wants to bypass entirely, it should _look_ ugly
[01:03:00] <Ilari> IIRC, one TLS library had so that there was system-wide(!) config file that contained the default cert pile, and then special cert piles for individual executables. If the appropriate trust anchor wasn't found there, the connect call aborted.
[01:03:41] <eternaleye> It should be something like TlsSession<CallbackValidationPolicy>({ validation: |state| Ok(state.session), Default::default() }) or such
[01:04:08] <Ilari> Then there are client certificates, which are whole another matter to validate.
[01:04:21] <eternaleye> Sure
[01:04:54] <Ilari> How did client certs work on freenode again (I actually have active connection right now with one, but don't remember)?
[01:05:19] <eternaleye> My point is more that by a.) assuming certs and b.) enforcing pre-trust, you're designing a lib people will just _not use_
[01:05:27] <eternaleye> Problem zero of security is deployment
[01:05:36] <eternaleye> If it's not used, it doesn't matter how safe it is.
[01:06:42] <eternaleye> Now, once people _use_ your lib, you can start boiling the frog, so to speak.
[01:06:58] <Ilari> Hmm... Reminds me of one music player. It has brower trust pile built into it. Don't remember if one could override SSL cert check.
[01:07:16] <Tiffany> ilari: you add your key fingerprint to nickserv
[01:07:35] <Tiffany> if you connect with a client certificate, it will show in /whois
[01:07:47] <Tiffany> [21:07] * [Tiffany] has client certificate fingerprint c3ed6297942883d3b21a0f35fcce53ceee6ab1dd
[01:08:23] <Ilari> Tiffany: Yeah, looking at instructions, it is given by openssl x509 -fingerprint, but is that whole cert fingerprint or SPKI fingerprint (I presume the first)?
[01:08:29] <Tiffany> eh
[01:08:46] <Tiffany> the trouble with the openssl fingerprinting instructions is that servers differ in what hashing algorithm they use
[01:08:50] <Tiffany> I've mostly seen md5 and sha1
[01:09:10] <Tiffany> the most foolproof way is to connect with a client certificate, and then whois yourself and copy the resulting fingerprint into nickserv
[01:09:32] <Tiffany> I don't know what it's a fingerprint of
[01:09:52] <Tiffany> I don't have any cert chains setup I don't think, just keys
[01:09:57] <Ilari> Looks like the entiere certificate.
[01:10:01] <Tiffany> ah

[01:17:40] <Ilari> eternaleye: As for current TLS server security on web, most of it is absolute crap.
[01:19:04] <eternaleye> Ilari: Oh, agreed.
[01:19:18] <eternaleye> Ilari: But making stuff people actually want impossible won't fix that.
[01:21:58] <Ilari> Some 36% don't have TLS 1.2. Some 60% suppor RC4. Some 32% don't support any kind of forward security (and of the rest, how many have proper key exchange?). Some 7% don't do proper renego fix (which is years old bug). Some 5% have bad cert chains. Some 16% support weak/insecure ciphers. Etc.
[01:23:14] <Ilari> 10% have 512-bit exchange strength. Which typically means those support EXPORT stuff, which should have been nuked from orbit a LONG time ago.
[01:36:38] <Ilari> SSL pulse has 21.3% A, but 77.3% non-F.  Which means over 50% have use some insecure crap TLS stack or have misconfig'd TLS stack.
[01:38:25] <Ilari> Actually, the number is even higher than the difference (56%) of the two, since not every F is because of bad cert or somesuch.

[02:58:05] <bascule> we did fixed-function multipliers for Curve25519 (or rather, a slightly more generic hardware implementation of the Montgomery ladder)
[02:58:28] <bascule> but like, the power argument against using an ARM or MIPS is going away
[02:58:40] <bascule> the real argument is what zeiris mentioned earlier
[02:59:04] <bascule> it'd probably be bad to have a non-updatable ARM-running-Linux in every device at least as things stand, lol

[02:59:32] <bascule> all that said we shipped our first ARM device and it does draw a lot of power
[02:59:50] <bascule> our future SoCs will draw a lot less

[03:46:42] *** Joins: dcb (textual@moz-v6l3du.ca.comcast.net)
[03:48:41] <bascule> while ChaCha20+Poly1305 is most likely to receive uptake in TLS soon, should we really build hardware around it specifically?
[03:49:10] <bascule> would be nice if the hardware were slightly more generic
[03:49:19] <bascule> all that said we mostly use fixed-function AES in our hardware, heh
[03:52:29] <eternaleye> Rogaway's paper about MRAE and its incompatibilities with online enc/dec convinced me thoroughly, and the only three entrants to CAESAR that meet that standard are AES-CMCC, HS1-SIV, and AEZ
[03:52:34] <eternaleye> And the first two are not stellar
[03:52:45] <eternaleye> HS1-SIV is completely non-parallelizable, for one
[03:53:36] <eternaleye> ...and CMCC is broken, it seems.
[03:53:59] <eternaleye> I wish the AE zoo did what the SHA-3 zoo did, and had a nice color-coded "status" column
[03:55:26] <bascule> which of those (if any) are nonce-reuse resistant?
[03:56:25] <eternaleye> bascule: Under Rogaway's strong definition? HS1 and AEZ (since CMCC is broken)
[03:56:53] <eternaleye> bascule: Can't be both online and MRAE, because online necessarily leaks prefix similarity
[03:58:06] <eternaleye> bascule: https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/189 lays it out
[03:58:22] <eternaleye> (the definition, and the incompatibility)
[03:58:23] <bascule> nice
[03:58:28] <bascule> thanks
[03:58:56] <eternaleye> bascule: I've linked it a few times, since it's also the paper that has CHAIN and STREAM
[03:59:01] <eternaleye> bascule: It's a _REALLY_ good paper
[03:59:49] <eternaleye> One thing is that, with MRAE, I kind of wonder if the nonce should even be a thing
[04:00:11] <eternaleye> Since it's _completely_ secure so long as the (AD, nonce, message) tuple is unique
[04:00:21] <eternaleye> Might as well fold the nonce in as part of the AD
[04:00:28] <eternaleye> And thus have unbounded nonce length
[04:02:50] <bascule> you'd think that'd be the default way they build it
[04:03:14] <bascule> I know certain constructions do that
[04:03:22] <bascule> but it'd be nice if it just worked that way by default
[04:04:01] <eternaleye> bascule: Well, that property is only necessarily true of MRAE
[04:04:04] <bascule> and for people who want their nonces to be derived from a counter or what have you have some "power user" version
[04:04:24] <bascule> I assume most people want to ship a nonce with their ciphertext
[04:04:43] *** Quits: dpc (dpc@moz-t6gr4b.ca.comcast.net) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[04:05:01] <eternaleye> bascule: Specifically, Rogaway's definition boils down to "if (AD, nonce, message) are unique, attacker gets _nothing_. If tuple repeats, attacker gets one bit of information: tuple repeated."
[04:05:09] <bascule> yeah
[04:05:24] <bascule> tuple repeated == you can see penguins :troll:
[04:05:28] <eternaleye> AEZ is even better
[04:05:39] <eternaleye> Because tau is variable, you can even do length hiding
[04:05:47] <eternaleye> And get extra integrity for free
[04:06:01] <bascule> but still that's a nice property versus umm
[04:06:08] <bascule> Douglas Crockford had a nice version
[04:06:16] <eternaleye> bascule: Well, it's the optimal property.
[04:06:31] <eternaleye> bascule: Without randomization, constant inputs = constant outputs.
[04:06:34] <bascule> how can I think Douglas Crockford is so awesome but hate him because he told a bunch of JavaScript people that JavaScript is a functional language and now they're all confused
[04:07:27] <eternaleye> bascule: Javascript contains a functional subset, rather.
[04:07:43] <eternaleye> bascule: A functional _language_ would enforce using only that subset...
[04:10:11] <bascule> so like
[04:10:17] <bascule> I said JavaScript is not a functional language
[04:10:23] <bascule> and Nadim challenged me on that lol

[04:30:00] <mcpherrin> I haven't ever used any packet mode actually
[04:30:05] <mcpherrin> maybe I will once I implement it :P
[04:30:08] <mcpherrin> give it til the weekend
[04:30:11] <Elaine> I looked into building a low-power portable computer using an e-paper display and they're all super expensive for pretty bad quality.
[04:30:28] <bascule> Elaine: have you seen the Voyage's display?
[04:30:41] <Elaine> Do they do something special compared to a stock Carta HD?
[04:31:38] <bascule> what's the PPI of those?
[04:31:53] <Elaine> It's the display in the Voyage :P
[04:31:58] <bascule> ok
[04:32:00] <bascule> *shrug*
[04:32:06] <bascule> Voyage has nice UX
[04:32:08] <Elaine> I don't know if amazon added a special coating or backlight or something though
[04:32:13] <bascule> you open up the case and it powers on and wakes up
[04:32:29] <bascule> and yeah it has the backlight that's sensitive to ambient lighting, which is nice
[04:32:45] <bascule> also closing the case puts it to sleep
[04:32:54] <bascule> so it's a lot like actually interacting with a book
[04:33:26] <bascule> but other than that yeah I guess it's really expensive for what it is heh
[04:34:07] <Elaine> I love my kobo aura hd to bits, looking to replace it relatively soon though

[04:48:54] <bascule> Elaine: yeah like, I was using Icoms with giant Ni-Cad batteries in the late 90s
[04:49:06] <bascule> I think the HTs themselves were $150 and the batteries like $50
[04:49:14] <bascule> they were large and heavy
[04:49:26] <bascule> and these Baofengs are technically superior in every regard and oh so cheap
[04:49:41] <bascule> and tiny and lightweight
[04:49:48] <bascule> and also double as LED flashlights!
[04:49:51] <eternaleye> bascule: And that's not counting inflation
[04:50:07] <Pierre_M> ah ham radios
[04:50:25] <Pierre_M> yes, the flashlight can be useful

[04:58:16] <bascule> :troll:
[04:58:22] <bascule> I haven't touched one of these for ahwile
[05:00:08] <mcpherrin> shit, I totally forget how to work this POS UI
[05:03:11] <mcpherrin> bascule: I couldn't remember what button got me FM radio
[05:03:14] <mcpherrin> wtf, "Call"??
[05:04:00] <bascule> yes, call gives you both FM radio and alarm!
[05:04:03] <bascule> for some reason
[05:04:16] <bascule> tap it to toggle FM radio mode
[05:04:21] <bascule> hold it to transmit an alarm
[05:04:40] <bascule> this is on a UV-5RA
[05:04:48] <mcpherrin> wait, does it actually *transmit* the alarm???
[05:04:51] <bascule> yes
[05:04:56] <mcpherrin> holy shit I had no idea
[05:05:02] <mcpherrin> I assumed it was just being annoying locally
[05:05:18] <bascule> yeah this was really fun when we went camping and had a bunch of people with them, heh
[05:05:28] <Pierre_M> taht sounds fun
[05:05:36] <Pierre_M> and yes, that alarm is annoying
[05:05:45] <bascule> it toggles on/off
[05:05:52] <bascule> so once it's going you can basically DoS any channel
[05:06:07] <bascule> we started out on GMRS6 and people were like fuck that once other people discovered alarm mode
[05:06:15] <mcpherrin> welp time to check the ARRL band chart to see who I was just spamming :|
[05:06:15] <bascule> and moved onto 3 or something?
[05:06:17] <bascule> then back to 6
[05:06:30] <Pierre_M> fun
[05:06:34] <bascule> yeah none of us were licensed to transmit on those frequencies
[05:06:36] <bascule> I used to be
[05:06:39] <bascule> does that count?
[05:06:46] <Pierre_M> eh, not really
[05:06:51] <bascule> heh
[05:06:53] <Pierre_M> go get your license renewed
[05:06:56] <bascule> we were in the mountains, whatever
[05:07:14] <Pierre_M> you might transmit up to 90 or so miles up there
[05:07:35] <bascule> I am pretty sure there were pretty big LoS blockages in the form of gigantic mountains
[05:07:41] <Pierre_M> as long as you have a claer LOS, ah
[05:08:07] <Pierre_M> whre i am there are a few perches I could sit and talk a state away, without a repeater
[05:08:30] <Pierre_M> though i probably do need a better antenna than the rubber duck for that
[05:08:55] <mcpherrin> Nobody really cares about people in the backwoods abusing FRS or GMRS :p
[05:09:18] <Pierre_M> ah, those ranges, not as likely
[05:10:06] <Pierre_M> how long did it take you to get those programmed into your baeofeng?
[05:10:26] <bascule> it was pretty easy for the UV-5RA
[05:11:00] <mcpherrin> They have a serial port on them too, and some reasonable OSS softwre
[05:11:10] <Pierre_M> yeah, I've used chirp, but with some pain
[05:11:17] <mcpherrin> yeah, pain :P
[05:11:28] <Pierre_M> the cd that came with my radio wasn't the right driver for it
[05:11:40] <bascule> yeah I was using chirp and it was fine actually?
[05:11:45] <bascule> I bought a BF-888S too
[05:11:52] <bascule> and that thing was comparatively a pain in the ass
[05:12:01] <bascule> apparently the frequency presents are all radio-specific
[05:12:08] <bascule> and there wasn't a profile for the BF-888S
[05:12:17] <Pierre_M> ouch
[05:12:18] <mcpherrin> it's just a TTL serial cable
[05:12:20] <bascule> so I had to use the chirp GUI to build the frequency table for it by hand
[05:12:22] <bascule> and then it like
[05:12:29] <bascule> refused to accept the programming repeatedly
[05:12:43] <bascule> there's some crazy trick you have to do with the knobs to put it into programming mode
[05:12:45] <Pierre_M> that is a pain
[05:12:46] <mcpherrin> I think I have one that's a knockoff FTDI
[05:13:04] <bascule> so anyway spend the extra $10 and get the radio that's not a pain in the ass and has a multicolor display and stuff, heh
[05:13:53] <bascule> aalthough
[05:14:02] <bascule> the BF-888S is nice in that it's totally turnkey
[05:14:12] <bascule> it has two knobs
[05:14:18] <bascule> power+volume
[05:14:19] <bascule> and channel
[05:14:41] <bascule> and the "UI" is all voice recordings, heh
[05:15:23] <mcpherrin> bascule: I have my UV5R set to do chinese voice prompts
[05:15:25] <mcpherrin> feels more legit to me
[05:15:36] <bascule> mcpherrin: yeah ditto lol
[05:16:12] <bascule> lacking a display, having the BF-888S speak english is nice
[05:17:41] <mcpherrin> bascule: shh says "Too many of my friends have the same cheap chinese radio that speaks chinese :("
[05:20:02] <bascule> when I was a wee little lad, this was high technology that you had to borrow from rich bankers who didn't mind loaning it out
[05:20:20] <bascule> so I say yes to the cheap chinese radios because they are awesome
[05:20:54] <mcpherrin> they really are.  Baofeng plus RTLSDR is totally the only way I'd get into radio these days
[05:21:07] <bascule> back when Radio Shack was still a reasonable place to buy Radios, $100 was entry-level for an HT
[05:21:23] <bascule> in, uhh, the late 90s or so
[05:21:47] <mcpherrin> I got licensed last year on a whim, and only really started playing with stuff this year
[05:22:31] <bascule> I have been unlicensed for 7 years, heh
[05:22:48] <bascule> also not sure I can get relicensed, but maybe the FCC is bad at keeping track of that stuff
[05:23:03] <Pierre_M> why wouldn't you be able to relicense?
[05:23:17] <eternaleye> Flawless: https://github.com/tessalt/echo-chamber-js
[05:23:35] <bascule> Pierre_M: umm scroll up lol
[05:24:06] <bascule> it's a bit worse than unlicensed GMRS transmissions in the mountains
[05:24:25] <Pierre_M> I can't scroll up far enough
[05:24:33] <bascule> great! :D
[05:24:44] <Pierre_M> was your license revoked?
[05:24:55] <bascule> not exactly
[05:25:00] <Pierre_M> just lapsed?
[05:25:08] <bascule> uhh, a little worse than that
[05:25:27] <Pierre_M> I don't see what is inbetween those two...
[05:26:03] <bascule> Radio stations must be licensed by the FCC pursuant to 47 U.S.C. § 301. The only exception to
[05:26:06] <bascule> this licensing requirement is for certain transmitters using or operating at a power level that
[05:26:09] <bascule> complies with the standards established in Part 15 of the Commission’s rules, 47 C.F.R. §§ 15.1
[05:26:12] <bascule> et seq. Your operation on frequency 93.9 MHz was measured at 65,504 microvolts per meter
[05:26:15] <bascule> (µV/m) at 3 meters. This exceeds the allowable unlicensed limit of 250 µV/m at 3 meters
[05:26:18] <bascule> established in Part 15. 
[05:26:22] <bascule> :D
[05:26:58] <Pierre_M> wow
[05:27:19] <eternaleye> bascule: Lemme guess; you were testing some control code?
[05:27:28] <eternaleye> bascule: Because that's 2^16-32
[05:27:34] <bascule> hahaha
[05:27:39] <bascule> it was more like 150W
[05:27:44] <Elaine> lol
[05:27:48] <Pierre_M> thats some serious power there
[05:28:21] <mcpherrin> lol 2^16
[05:28:23] <eternaleye> bascule: Can I call you Tim Taylor?
[05:28:26] <bascule> Pierre_M: I've done DX with 2kW, heh
[05:28:29] <bascule> but that was licensed
[05:28:34] <Pierre_M> gotcha
[05:29:52] <bascule> I've gotten shocked by a loose connector and 150W
[05:29:56] <bascule> definitely hurts, heh
[05:30:29] <Pierre_M> no doubt about that
[05:37:34] <Pierre_M> bascule, how was that whole thing worded, that might have been just a warning
[05:37:57] <Pierre_M> doesn't sound like something as bad as this. https://transition.fcc.gov/eb/Orders/2015/DA-15-51A1.html
[05:38:52] <bascule> oh yeah it's no problem at all
[05:39:02] <bascule> you just shut down the transmitter and never operate it at the same address again
[05:39:10] <bascule> and at that point you're not even breaking the law
[05:40:14] <Pierre_M> I'm guessing if you didn't get a fine, only a notice that you were in violation, you probably could renew your license with no problems
[05:40:48] <bascule> heh yeah, no fines involved
[05:41:19] <Pierre_M> which is probably lucky...the two violations i looked at, one fine was $12000, another was $22,000

[05:41:22] <Elaine> Oh amazon

[05:43:51] <mcpherrin> Elaine: haha, my roommate wrote that code
[05:43:53] <mcpherrin> I'll give him shit
[05:44:08] <mcpherrin> well, former roommate I guess, but I'll still give him shit
[05:44:40] <mcpherrin> (that's a data, not code proble, but still)
[05:51:47] <bascule> Pierre_M: yeah like, unlicensed operation is a way better way to go if you're doing anything you could potentially be fined for
[05:51:59] <bascule> heh
[05:52:33] <Pierre_M> officially, i disagree...but true.
[05:52:50] <Pierre_M> much easier to not be caught when you aren't identifying yourself...providing you don't stay put too long
[05:53:20] <Pierre_M> if you're being looked for...people can triangulate where you are fairly quickly

[05:59:14] <bascule> which probably won't work?
[06:00:18] <Pierre_M> hahaha
[06:00:52] <Pierre_M> oh you'd escape triangulation....whoever finds you may be cleaning you up with a mop...but you'd escape taht problem
[06:01:30] <eternaleye> Clearly, you pwn people who _are_ licensed's machines, and do it over the network :P
[06:01:34] <mcpherrin> bascule: quadcopter broadcast drones controlled by a laser uplink
[06:01:42] <mcpherrin> triangulate that!
[06:02:02] <Pierre_M> if you can bankroll that, that is
[06:02:11] <Pierre_M> I can't begin to imagine the cost
[06:02:34] <Pierre_M> the pointing algorithms alone would run thousands
[06:03:26] <Pierre_M> i remember a guy in college who was talking about a military satelite that ran as a repeater on certain frequencies
[06:03:54] <Pierre_M> he wanted to try to see if we could bounce a signal nationwide
[06:04:10] <Pierre_M> never did it, but I did spend a lot of time trying to figure out how long we could "test" before we had to beat it
[06:04:50] <Pierre_M> because then I don't think the FCC violation would be our worst consequence
[06:05:13] <mcpherrin> Pierre_M: I hear there's a bunch of Brazilians who use old US military repeater sattelites

[14:12:48] <Ilari> Also, be careful to check that algorithms the opposite end gives are actually enabled (or better yet, don't implement anything bad at all). There was Gnutls bug that allowed server to select MD5 for signatures, despite the fact that it was suposedly "disabled".
[14:13:28] <Tiffany> I am a fan of the do-not-implement approach to avoiding downgrade bugs
[14:15:44] <Ilari> Yeah, at least DJB and I are too.
[14:40:16] <Ilari> Unfortunately, it will probably be a long time until browsers can deimplement some of the TLS crap they presently support.
[14:50:31] <Ilari> Like RSA key exchange, DHE key exchange, all TLS versions below 1.2. Non-EMS connections, non-renego-fix connections, etc...

[17:42:10] <Ilari> Specifically, one would have to compute scalars x and y (not necressarily from the same group), such that encode(xA) = encode(yB), where A and B are the client and server DH public keys.
[17:45:57] <Ilari> Well, that is actually doable if server uses a weak DHE group (one that there is log table for).

[18:15:09] <bascule> also wtf sect571r1
[18:16:32] <Ilari> I would have thought that if somebody is using binary curves, the curve would be 283 or 409 or something like that.
[18:16:53] <Ilari> Also, binary curves. Bleh.
[18:18:14] <Ilari> The "odd" bitlengths are because binary curves need prime bitlength for security (in most cases).

[18:23:20] <Ilari> "The interface uses modern web technologies like JSON, CBOR, HTTP, CoAP, TLS, and REST." ... 
[18:25:36] <Ilari> CBOR is binary encoding of essentially superset of JSON. CoAP is essentially lightweight subset of HTTP.

[18:44:44] <mcpherrin> Yeah, you can upload a PGP key to your facebook profile

[19:19:39] <Ilari> Probably some sort of special things are going on, given that nobody sane runs binary curves on software. Prime curves are much more efficient.
[19:20:30] <Ilari> Well, one guess for the cause: Gotta have as many bits as possible!

[20:12:52] <Tiffany> so http downgrade attacks don't cause alarm, but broken https makes 50% of people bail out
[20:12:57] <Tiffany> this study is kind of a small sample size though
[20:13:43] <Tiffany> good thing both firefox and chrome are working towards marking http non-secure
[20:15:50] <mcpherrin> I can't help but hope that SSL certs are about to get a whole lot cheaper
[20:15:58] <mcpherrin> I wonder if I'll finally be able to afford a wildcard one
[20:16:19] <mcpherrin> Or maybe they'll jump way up in price because only srs bznss people need them now
[20:16:30] <mcpherrin> (with Let's Encrypt coming online this year)
[20:16:43] <Tiffany> it looks like let's encrypt doesn't have plans to have wildcard certs currently
[20:17:00] <Tiffany> I don't imagine the price will drop though
[20:17:17] <Tiffany> because now the main money income of CAs is going to be charging customers for better features on their certs
[20:17:36] <Tiffany> I don't know what the balance looks like, but I imagine they make most of their money off DV certs right now..
[20:18:04] <mcpherrin> Yeah, I know they're not doing wildcards, which is fine most of the time
[20:18:14] <mcpherrin> In particular, I want one for my personal sandstorm.io instance
[20:18:34] <Tiffany> I find subdomains are kind of overrated
[20:18:42] <mcpherrin> I will probably just make my own name-constrained CA
[20:18:53] <Tiffany> it's easy enough to just proxy stuff like sandstorm through nginx
[20:19:16] <mcpherrin> You need subdomains for sandstorm becuase of the JS security model
[20:19:20] <Tiffany> they can be useful for identifying multiple servers part of the same domain/network
[20:19:26] <Tiffany> oh
[20:19:49] <Tiffany> that's kind of gross
[20:19:50] <mcpherrin> Because JS can tamper with any other page in the browser on the same domain
[20:21:15] <mcpherrin> You can load stuff into an iframe, and if it's in the JS same origin, you can read the DOM out, or inject some JS (and steal cookies, or data, or whatever)
[20:22:00] <Ilari> Hmm... Is T-571 already broken enough to be less secure than P-521?
[20:26:52] *** Joins: _neal_ (neal@moz-of66u9.ca.comcast.net)
[20:29:41] <Ilari> Definitely looks to be broken (even without restricted case of FF assumption).
[20:31:39] <Ilari> And with restricted case of FF assumed, far below P-521 in security.
[20:32:40] <Ilari> In fact, seemingly less estimated security than even P-384.
[20:40:37] <Ilari> So apparently it is not just very little used curve, it is also apparently a broken curve. :-)
[20:57:26] <Ilari> Tiffany: As I have said, browsers are playing simon says with HTTP security.
[20:58:22] <Tiffany> this study is kind of old too, I guess
[20:58:30] <Tiffany> this is before all the nsa stuff was really popularized
[20:58:47] <Tiffany> from 2007, using IE 6 on windows XP
[20:58:57] <Tiffany> which is strange, wasn't vista around in 2007?

[20:59:02] <Tiffany> IE 7 beta apparently was
[20:59:13] <mcpherrin> Yeah but nobody liked vista ;)
[20:59:45] <Ilari> Well, HTTP downgrade indications haven't gotten better since then, but SSL errors are lots more annoying now.
[20:59:56] <Tiffany> I have never seen a vista machine that didn't have massive performance issues
[20:59:58] <Tiffany> yeah
[21:00:09] <Tiffany> most https errors can't be bypassed now
[21:00:19] <Tiffany> except for invalid certificates, which requires you to make multiple clicks through scary dialogs
[21:00:31] <Tiffany> it was a single click in IE 7
[21:05:23] <Ilari> Wonder what proportion of sites SSL labs thinks have a valid certificate (it is >75% in SSL pulse, since all such sites get F, and there are sites that get F for other reasons)
[21:07:01] <Ilari> *all sites with invalid certificate get F
[21:08:53] <Tiffany> http://www.selfsignedcertificate.com/ oh god, this site is gross
[21:09:28] <mcpherrin> www.selfsignedcertificate.com uses an invalid security certificate. The certificate is only valid for the following names: *.hostgator.com, hostgator.com 
[21:09:31] <mcpherrin> rofl
[21:10:04] <Tiffany> google is being unhelpful again
[21:10:18] <mcpherrin> You'd think they could at least use their site for itself
[21:10:21] <Tiffany> I want to know how many sites are using self-signed certificates, all I get are tutorials for generating a self-signed certificate in IIS
[21:11:25] <mcpherrin> Tiffany: I had a friend who downloaded all the HTTPS certs served on IPv4
[21:11:32] <mcpherrin> I wonder if he still has that data set
[21:11:40] <Tiffany> nice
[21:11:54] <Tiffany> it's kind of amazing that it's possible to scan the entire IPv4 internet
[21:12:09] <mcpherrin> that was for the "frankencert" paper, which I think found a few CVEs
[21:12:39] <Tiffany> 136 requests per second for a year...
[21:12:41] <mcpherrin> Tiffany: and extra amazing that you can do it in like an hour
[21:12:49] <Tiffany> using AWS or what?
[21:12:56] <Tiffany> I know someone did it with a botnet
[21:13:06] <mcpherrin> I doubt you could do it with AWS, I don't think they offer 10GigE
[21:13:29] <Tiffany> I mainly mentioned AWS because of the ease with which you can spin up a hundred instances
[21:13:34] <mcpherrin> oh sure
[21:13:41] <Tiffany> a hundred instances for an hour is only like a couple bucks

[23:41:32] <Ilari> And also, many HTTP "intermediates" are very crappy and cause problems.
[23:42:03] <mcpherrin> You say that until you're in the middle of nowhere with only a sattelite uplink ;p
[23:42:13] <mcpherrin> then you're gonna love your local caches and re-TCP-ers
[23:42:20] <eternaleye> mcpherrin: Sure, but then you run your _own_
[23:42:33] <mcpherrin> eternaleye: well, the sattelite ISP typically does.
[23:42:41] <eternaleye> mcpherrin: And re-tcp-ers don't break TLS anyway

[23:43:28] <mcpherrin> well, that's a special enough case you'll probably just trust an ISP root CA anyways

[23:44:17] <Tiffany> the rare exceptions are usually actually in a deal with the people running the site, e.g. Netflix OpenConnect
[23:44:41] <mcpherrin> Netflix isn't doing it that way anyways
[23:44:53] <mcpherrin> the client explicitly connects to a content server
[23:45:14] <Tiffany> yeah
[23:45:25] <Tiffany> Netflix is not any old http cache
[23:45:41] <Tiffany> also I used to have satellite internet and there was no cache to be seen

[23:47:39] <Tiffany> are those caches aggressive, or are they compatible with standard http caching?
[23:47:54] <Tiffany> it seems like it wouldn't improve latency if it kept standard compliant
