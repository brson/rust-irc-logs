[17:46:47] <aturon> larsberg: nice!
[17:47:02] <aturon> does the servo training not require much Rust know-how? i was surprised it was scheduled earlier in the week
[17:48:09] <larsberg> aturon: it doesn't and was originally put first because the Rust slot had fewer conflicts with teams (and there was more internal manager interest in Rust than Servo right now)

[20:57:59] <Manishearth> the web is dark and full of terrors
[20:58:03] <nmatsakis> if you could find me an irssi extension
[20:58:03] <Manishearth> come back to the terminal

[21:20:47] <larsberg> nmatsakis: I turn off all notifications for irccloud. The tab is still way too tempting, but at least I control it. It does reset all of its alert settings anytime you fully disconnect/reconnect, though.
[21:21:42] <nmatsakis> larsberg: hmm, how easy is it to turn notifications on/off? I actually find having a notification pop up *less* distracting, because I can quickly see if I care enough to respond ;)
[21:22:10] <nmatsakis> but I'd be happy if I turned them on explicitly at start of day
[21:22:11] <nmatsakis> and off at the end
[21:24:57] <larsberg> nmatsakis: the 'settings' tab controls the alert sound. Firefox is hooked into your desktop notifications, which I just turn off at the OS level, but I assume there's a way to do it on a per-site basis, too.
[21:25:30] <larsberg> (I set it to badges so that the FF logo in the dock gets a count, but no text popup because I'd have them going all day)
[21:26:10] <nmatsakis> larsberg: well i'll play with it; it'd be nice if you could right click on a tab and say "disable/enable notifications from this tab"

[21:38:03] <shu> larsberg: i talked with connor a bit, do you want set up a vidyo meeting tomorrow to talk about stuff
[21:38:13] <shu> larsberg: i'm not sure what you had in mind exactly to discuss
[21:40:43] <larsberg> shu: sure, I can chat tomorrow! I was mainly interested in what tuning parameters are available to the host/user agent via the SM APIs. e.g., can we turn off the JIT compiler if we're already rendering at 60fps? Just looking for more dials we can give cimes to tune back Servo's overall power usage if we're already hitting our perf target.
[21:44:40] <huon> nrc: thanks
[21:46:39] <shu> larsberg: yeah we can
[21:46:47] <shu> larsberg: could you schedule something in the afternoonish PST and cc me?
[21:50:37] <larsberg> shu: will do!

[23:47:05] <khuey> roc: so the stumbling block with your proposal is that we don't know what instruction pointer ranges are ARM/Thumb without DWARF
[23:47:12] <khuey> so we don't know what sequence of bytes to replace
[23:47:27] <khuey> and I don't think we can rely on having DWARF for everything loaded into a tracee's address space
[23:47:40] <roc> I was envisaging shimming by hand all the glibc functions that use these instructions
[23:48:06] <khuey> if it's only glibc ....
[23:48:07] * khuey looks
[23:48:12] <roc> and I understand you said that's impractical
[23:48:30] <khuey> well, glibc is pretty much all thumb
[23:48:33] *** Quits: zentner-kyle (Thunderbird@moz-u3dg2t.sfo1.mozilla.com) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[23:48:36] <khuey> so we might be able to do it programatically
[23:49:35] <roc> it's a bit slow to scan an entire binary, although hopefully on ARM it's easier than x86
[23:50:01] <roc> modulo the mode issue
[23:50:14] <khuey> Spidermonkey's JIT uses LDREX/STREX
[23:50:53] <roc> er
[23:50:54] * khuey looks at libxul
[23:50:55] <roc> really?
[23:50:57] <khuey> yes
[23:51:04] <khuey> or it appears to anyways
[23:51:07] <khuey> which is surprising
[23:51:24] <khuey> http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/js/src/jit/arm/Assembler-arm.cpp#1928
[23:51:25] <roc> you mean Spidermonkey code contains LDREX/STREX, or it actually codegens those instructions?
[23:51:28] <khuey> it has code to write those instructions
[23:52:26] <khuey> objdump -D libxul.so takes a while :D
[23:52:27] <shu> roc: khuey: i think ldrex/strex are used to implement cmpxchg for the arm backends
[23:52:32] <shu> in Ion
[23:52:38] <roc> why does jitted code use those?
[23:53:28] <shu> shared arraybuffers, i think
[23:53:29] * shu checks
[23:53:37] <roc> ah
[23:53:42] <roc> that would make sense :-(
[23:56:05] <shu> i don't know the exact problem, but since it's our codegen, we could generate extra instrumentation to help rr?
[23:56:31] <khuey> yeah, our stuff is doable
[23:56:41] <khuey> it's more that it's not just glibc that I'm noting
[23:57:04] *** Quits: mbx (textual@moz-qjbkeh.mtv2.mozilla.com) (Quit: My Mac has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[23:57:35] <roc> I guess inlined compare-and-swap intrinsics get pulled into various places
[23:57:51] <khuey> yeah
[23:59:05] <khuey> shu: the problem is that LDREX/STREX are a big problem for rr :/
[23:59:54] <shu> khuey: why are x86 locked insns not?
