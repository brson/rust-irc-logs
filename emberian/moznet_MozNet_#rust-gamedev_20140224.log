[00:25:47] <SiegeLord> Heh, as expected the borrow checker is making working with components rather tricky
[00:26:09] <ryeguy> what's the problem
[00:27:24] <SiegeLord> In this case, trying to get a mutable reference to one component while having an immutable one to another
[00:27:57] <ryeguy> are you doing something in parallel?
[00:28:45] <SiegeLord> No
[00:32:15] <SiegeLord> Here's my silly test: https://gist.github.com/SiegeLord/9179565#file-components-rs-L158
[00:32:38] <SiegeLord> The link is to the system's update method, which is giving me errors...
[00:32:59] <SiegeLord> I'll solve it eventually, but it's the fact that the problem exists at all is sometimes annoying :P

[00:35:03] <ryeguy> so is it the loc/vel references clashing?
[00:35:22] <ryeguy> line 163,164
[00:35:40] <SiegeLord> Yeah
[00:36:09] <ryeguy> I figured. The solution is to only pass ComponentSets into your systems, not the whole world
[00:36:31] <ryeguy> once you do &mut World you are borrowing all of your component sets as mutable

[00:37:46] <SiegeLord> Yeah, it's a bit of a pain to do it that way
[00:38:10] <ryeguy> i know, but on the upside you get better documentation via function signature
[00:38:12] <SiegeLord> But you gotta do what you gotta do
[00:38:23] <ryeguy> you can see what component sets it interacts with just by looking at the types
[00:38:37] <SiegeLord> Oh yeah, I suppose I can just pass the components it needs
[00:38:59] <ryeguy> haha, did you think i meant pass them all in all the time? that would be rough
[00:40:11] <SiegeLord> I keep forgetting that I'm not going to use inheritance for the update method
[00:40:23] <ryeguy> that is one thing that sucks
[00:40:23] <SiegeLord> So I can in fact use a different signature for each system, heh
[00:40:31] <ryeguy> it feels like you can be abstracting something
[00:40:34] <ryeguy> but they are all so different
[00:40:43] <ryeguy> macros might help somewhere..havent looked into it

[00:47:53] <SiegeLord> And with that change it all seems to fall into place... adding/removing components isn't all there yet, but it'll be straightforward to implement
[00:49:19] <ryeguy> don't forget to recycle your entity id's
[00:49:33] <SiegeLord> Yeah, and component ids
[00:49:51] <SiegeLord> Also straightforward
[00:50:47] <ryeguy> here'
[00:50:59] <ryeguy> here's mine, if you want it: https://gist.github.com/rlepidi/9179762
[00:51:10] <ryeguy> this is just the entity id recycling part
[00:52:07] <SiegeLord> My old system used tiny components... one for each POD variable
[00:52:41] <SiegeLord> It made it easy to do networking as I could serialize easily... but it was somewhat of a pain to deal with tons of components
[00:53:04] <ryeguy> heh
[00:53:06] <ryeguy> was that in rust?
[00:53:37] <ryeguy> i can kinda understand that approach if you wanted to keep everything packed together and you were using a language without value types (like java)
[00:53:37] <SiegeLord> No, in D
[00:54:17] <SiegeLord> Objects ended up looking like this: https://github.com/SiegeLord/SantasWar/blob/master/objects/red_player.cfg
[00:54:43] <SiegeLord> Not sure how easy it is to do networking with these larger components
[00:54:56] <SiegeLord> Probably not too hard, just need to write serialization code everywhere
[00:58:14] <SiegeLord> Or maybe we have a #[deriving(serialize)] thing, which would obviate that step
[00:58:36] <SiegeLord> In which case, there's no real benefit to tiny components
[00:59:13] <Jarrett> no wonder your name looked familiar SiegeLord 
[00:59:21] <SiegeLord> :P
[00:59:21] <Jarrett> I vaguely recall you using D ;V

[20:31:19] <o11c> &
[20:31:39] <cmr> #
[20:31:41] <nil> I'm finally setting the time aside to write a somewhat complex game in Rust. ._. how bad of an idea is this to do before the big 1.0?
[20:32:37] <cmr> nil: go for it!
[20:33:41] <nil> huzzah! I'll come back and complain directly to you if this turns out to be a horrid idea.
[20:34:28] <zokier`> i think it depends on how actively you will work. if you have spurts of developement and some quiet time inbetween then the language changes might be more painful than if you tinker constantly with your codebase anyways
[20:35:03] <nil> should be fairly consistent, though I do have something of an initial hurdle I'm trying to work out on paper.
[20:35:14] <cmr> :)
[20:35:47] <nil> I'm not familar enough with rusts std/extra library and the like yet to make a sound judgement, so I'd like to ask you all a question on design.
[20:36:29] <nil> If I have a large collection of mutable game state, and a large number of independently acting actors on their own tasks/threads. What's the best way to share that large bit of mutable game state to each one, as an immutable world view they can access?
[20:39:42] <nil> I'm thinking along the lines of modifing world state > locking it > sharing the immutable state as a "world view" to each task via Arc or similar > unlocking the game state for futher modification after all actors finish.
