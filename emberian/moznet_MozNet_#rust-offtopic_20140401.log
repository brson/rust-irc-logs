[15:12:54] <bjz_> eddyb: I've always been fascinated by the idea of having a game where the bugs were features :)
[15:13:16] <bjz_> it's a shame that Rust makes that so hard!
[15:13:45] <eddyb> r2 calls segfaults a feature

[15:14:26] <bjz_> r2?
[15:14:35] <eddyb> radare2
[15:28:16] <bjz_> eddyb: I liked this one: http://youtu.be/KMHiHCzn_MU?t=12m50s
[15:29:36] <eddyb> yogcast? ew
[15:29:57] <bjz_> I know, they got super bad
[15:30:13] <bjz_> they were great at the beginning
[15:31:24] <Havvy> bjz_:  It just means there will be more logic bugs and less safety bugs. So the bugs will actually be interesting instead of dangerous.
[15:31:33] <bjz_> Havvy: true
[15:31:38] <bjz_> Havvy: :)
[15:31:54] <bjz_> eddyb: I think they got lazy
[15:32:15] <bjz_> eddyb: the mindcrack folks actually do it because they are passionate
[15:33:01] <eddyb> and they have identities
[15:33:37] <eddyb> I was going to say something about childish fat grown men but then there's Guude :P
[15:34:16] <Havvy> I don't think I've ever liked the Yogscast.
[15:34:38] <Havvy> But then, I don't like watching people suck at Minecraft.
[15:35:57] <cmr> I can't stand let's plays
[15:36:05] <eddyb> Havvy: I'd recommend Etho and Vechz then
[15:36:06] <cmr> I find it to be a mindnumbing waste of time
[15:36:21] <eddyb> if anyone knows their stuff, it's them
[15:36:21] <cmr> I'm going to sit down and watch people play a game, instead of just playing it myself?
[15:36:24] <cmr> feh
[15:36:37] <Havvy> Etho bores me, only because he does stuff that I've seen Direwolf20 go through 3 or 4 times.
[15:36:43] <eddyb> cmr: ahh but I can have a LP in the background while I'm coding
[15:36:52] <eddyb> Havvy: haha
[15:37:09] <cmr> I can't pay attention to both, I can barely listen to complex musing while coding :p
[15:37:27] <Havvy> Direwolf20 has the advantage of being on a server of a ton of developers.
[15:37:39] <Havvy> One that updates over time.
[15:37:54] <eddyb> cmr: well, maybe it's because I do stupid things like "add &** at the place of every error"
[15:38:00] <eddyb> cmr: and not actual development of anything
[15:38:25] <eddyb> the secret of my success: lack of originality
[15:38:40] <eddyb> (needs more air quotes around "success")
[15:39:19] <Havvy> Likewise, SethBling basically shows his programs he writes in Command Blocks.
[15:39:57] <Havvy> And I was actually surprised I recognized DocM by voice.
[15:39:57] <eddyb> I watch the small silly stuff from SethBling
[15:40:30] <eddyb> cmr: did you open minecraft today, btw?
[15:40:31] <eddyb> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmM1wl2XQiE
[15:41:31] <eddyb> #minecraft on Freenode is #uk_politics again >_>
[15:42:08] <cmr> eddyb: no, I don't play minecraft anymore.
[15:42:27] <Havvy> If you like Minecraft (and especially Minecraft mods), you want to be on Esper.
[15:42:43] <eddyb> Havvy: #minecraft on Esper is terrible, though
[15:42:56] * cmr is irl friends with a #minecraft op
[15:43:23] <Havvy> Yes, for some reason the people in #minecraft decided to say that everything but Minecraft is the topic.
[15:43:32] <eddyb> not that
[15:43:43] <Havvy> Have things degenerated since I was last in that channel?
[15:43:59] <eddyb> were there not degenerate at any point?
[15:44:03] <eddyb> I gues many years ago
[15:44:16] <eddyb> the freenode channel is tighter on the rules, and Dinnerbunny actually is around to chat with the nice peoples in there
[15:44:28] <Havvy> Dinnerbunny = Dinnerbone?
[15:44:37] <Havvy> Or somebody else?
[15:44:41] <eddyb> yeah, DB
[15:44:50] <Havvy> There was a time when notch was in the Esper channel.
[15:44:58] <Havvy> And jeb_ and grumm.
[15:44:59] <eddyb> I guess nobody other than Vechz in SH:IM called DB dinnerbunny
[15:45:25] <Havvy> That's just because DB actually listens to Vechz.
[15:46:12] <eddyb> Havvy: skeletons pls
[15:46:27] <Havvy> Huh?
[15:47:17] <eddyb> Havvy: don't you know the skeleton changes were because Vecheszz?
[15:47:25] <eddyb> and then everybody got mad at DB
[15:47:36] <Havvy> Ah.
[15:47:41] <eddyb> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QV4wHjWFlNQ this map looks interesting, now let's find someone else :P
[15:47:42] <Havvy> I liked the skeleton changes.
[15:48:08] <eddyb> (captain sparklez is too silly for me)
[15:48:21] <Havvy> 1.8 snapshots. :/
[15:50:04] <bjz_> cmr: I preferred the yogscast when they did the hybrid LP/Machinima style stuff
[15:50:19] <bjz_> cmr: it was kind of goofy
[15:50:38] <bjz_> cmr: but yeah - they got burnt out by it
[15:51:37] <eddyb> bjz_: oooh, the RPG thing?
[15:51:47] <eddyb> I found that very interesting. but it was a long time ago
[15:52:00] <bjz_> eddyb: the Shadow of Israphel thing
[15:52:06] * cmr did not watch it
[15:52:53] <bjz_> eddyb: that was my first intro to them - it was super weird - it started off like it was going to be a lets play thingy, but then all this weird stuff started happening
[15:54:27] <bjz_> eddyb: like, there was this other guy on the server that the supposedly 'had no idea how he got on'. then they went on this journey and found a villages and things (before mincraft had generated villages)
