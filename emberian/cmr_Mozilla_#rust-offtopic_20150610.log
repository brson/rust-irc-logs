[01:17:36] <Quxxy> eddyb: Yeah that seems kinda suspect
[01:18:01] <eddyb> Quxxy: instantiation is what I call replacing impl Trait in a return type with _
[01:18:33] <eddyb> Quxxy: the _ goes in a vector, alongside the DefId of the `impl Trait` node, which identifies the anonymized type
[01:18:42] <Quxxy> de-anonymisation? :P
[01:19:02] <eddyb> at the end of type-checking that function ("writeback"), the _ is resolved and the concrete type is written in a table
[01:19:05] <eddyb> Quxxy: no
[01:19:15] <Quxxy> :(
[01:19:16] <eddyb> de-anonymization happens only in trans

[01:55:02] <eddyb> it's 5am
[01:55:03] <Quxxy> It's been like, *seconds* since I saw that post
[01:55:59] <Quxxy> eddyb: I'm afraid to build that, because it would be too tempting to just use them *everywhere*
[01:56:07] <Quxxy> I might never be able to write non-anonymised code again
[01:57:09] <eddyb> I've spoiled you
[01:57:18] <Quxxy> Ya have
[01:57:20] <eddyb> Quxxy: you could start writing an RFC for the simplified version :P
[01:57:41] <eddyb> impl Trait in return types of free functions and methods in impl blocks
[01:58:12] <eddyb> and in associated types in impl blocks (for which the concrete type has to be set by methods in the same impl block and they have to agree on what the concrete type is)
[01:58:37] <eddyb> Quxxy: type parameters in scope of the impl Trait are captured (so it behaves as if it were polymorphic over them even if the concrete type isn't)
[01:58:44] <eddyb> references aren't captured, though
[01:59:07] <eddyb> so you end up with <'a, T: 'a, U: 'a> ... -> impl Trait+'a
[01:59:20] <eddyb> which is a conservative approach
[01:59:28] <eddyb> I think nmatsakis is okay with it :D
[01:59:34] <eddyb> Quxxy: and that's about that
[01:59:51] <eddyb> Quxxy: none of the crazy generics-introducing or anonymous associated type stuff from the original RFC
[01:59:56] <eddyb> which nobody could agree on
[02:00:09] <Quxxy> I feel like I'd have to spend some more time with it before I could properly describe the corners of it
[02:00:31] <eddyb> it's not supposed to have corners
[02:00:32] <Quxxy> Seriously, I spent *days* pacing to work out the details for that loony CoroFn RFC I only partially wrote up
[02:00:42] <eddyb> it's an all-around neat feature
[02:00:46] <eddyb> *all-round
[02:00:51] <eddyb> Quxxy: Coro?
[02:01:13] <Quxxy> I mean, I like to be certain I understand everything that's going on before I write about it; I'm still not 100% comfortable with my mental model on why the lifetime bounds are needed
[02:01:25] <Quxxy> A closure type for resumable functions
[02:01:26] <eddyb> Quxxy: because it's 'static by default
[02:01:35] <Quxxy> For building generators
[02:01:56] <eddyb> (eeek coroutines with stack saving suck :P)
[02:02:12] <Quxxy> They were basically Python generators
[02:02:26] <Quxxy> I only picked the name because it had a convenient abbreviation :P
[02:02:45] <eddyb> Quxxy: the thing is that it's not obvious what lifetimes to assume the concrete type might have
[02:02:46] <Quxxy> Also, I was trying to bake in the semantics necessary to support Python-style generator coroutines
[02:02:51] <eddyb> they could come from anywhere
[02:02:55] <Quxxy> eddyb: Yeah
[02:03:21] <eddyb> so it's +'static by default (actually, it uses the elision rules for Trait types so &'a impl Trait should be +'a)
[02:03:22] <Quxxy> Let me put it like this: I *think* I understand, I'm just not at the really, *truly* believing it stage
[02:03:43] <eddyb> and if you include something in it, it has to be bounded with +'a, too, otherwise it won't live long enough
[02:03:51] <eddyb> :'a even
[02:04:02] <eddyb> or you could add :'static to all your type params
[02:04:11] <eddyb> but that restricts it unnecessarily
[02:05:16] <Quxxy> eddyb: This was the partial RFC I had written up, if you're curious: https://gist.github.com/DanielKeep/441b04e16adb817ac5b9#detailed-design
[02:06:42] <eddyb> Quxxy: btw, the lifetime requirements are identical to returning Box<Trait>
[02:06:52] <Quxxy> Makes sense
[02:07:37] <eddyb> Quxxy: why did you write that RFC :P?
[02:07:42] <eddyb> we all want generators
[02:07:52] <eddyb> that form is... somewhat odd
[02:08:08] <Quxxy> Because I'd never seen anyone propose that particular form, and I wanted to see if it made sense
[02:08:09] <eddyb> yield return is cumbersome
[02:08:23] <Quxxy> Best way to do that without actually *implementing* it is to try and explain how it would work :P
[02:08:32] <eddyb> wait, why catch the panic?
[02:08:32] <Quxxy> eddyb: I didn't know "yield" was already a keyword
[02:08:40] <eddyb> that's not something Rust should do
[02:09:03] <eddyb> CoroResume becomes Option<T> :P
[02:09:21] <Quxxy> eddyb: One of the things you can do with this is build a cooperative scheduler, but the thought of having to spin up a new thread for *every single context switch* made me queasy
[02:09:35] <Quxxy> But we can catch panics now *without* threads, so it's probably unnecessary
[02:09:53] <eddyb> very sketchy :P
[02:09:58] <Quxxy> This was months ago!
[02:09:59] <eddyb> I would let a panic kill the host
[02:10:01] <eddyb> oh
[02:10:17] <eddyb> anyways, the API isn't much more interesting than Iterator
[02:10:27] <eddyb> you need a different kind of API for async/await
[02:10:36] <eddyb> (which is *just* generators in dynamic languages)
[02:10:51] <Quxxy> Mmm
[02:10:55] <eddyb> the trick is to have multiple entry points and return an enum
[02:11:03] <eddyb> to allow a sort of "polymorphism"
[02:11:12] <eddyb> it's hard without A | B types tho
[02:11:23] <Quxxy> The next trick I'd planned was to work out the short-circuiting thing
[02:11:51] <eddyb> you want to be resumed with Vec<u8> if you can return ReadBytes(R)
[02:12:16] <eddyb> or &'a [u8] from a pool, even
[02:12:28] <Quxxy> What do you mean?
[02:12:43] <eddyb> "polymorphic" yield
[02:12:54] <Quxxy> Aaah, I see
[02:13:12] <eddyb> and if a different resume entry point is called, it will panic or something
[02:13:26] <eddyb> because it doesn't match the current state
[02:13:30] <Quxxy> Yeah, my best for that was "one unifying IO type to rule them all" :P
[02:13:36] <eddyb> Quxxy: that's fine
[02:13:38] <eddyb> for the action
[02:13:45] <eddyb> but how do you receive data of the right type?
[02:14:01] <Quxxy> Dynamic typing? :P
[02:14:18] <Quxxy> (I mean dynamic downcasting from one unifying IO result type to rule them all)
[02:14:39] <eddyb> ah
[02:14:51] <eddyb> but that requires allocationg
[02:14:54] <eddyb> unless, hmm
[02:15:02] <eddyb> I have considered using something like &move Any
[02:15:16] <eddyb> since it's passed *down* into the generator
[02:15:33] <Quxxy> But like I said, that was just a partial RFC
[02:15:35] <eddyb> so it would actually be valid until the next yield point
[02:15:40] <eddyb> which is trippy
[02:15:49] <eddyb> each yield result is like getting called
[02:15:55] <eddyb> so the lifetimes could reflect that

[04:36:10] <aotic> so... when we talk about 64 bit compilers like mingw-64, does that mean that the compiler's binary itself is 64 bits or that the compiler can emit 64 bit binaries?
[04:36:18] <aotic> or both?
[04:36:29] <cmr> It can mean anything
[04:36:44] <cmr> but usually at least can produce binaries targeting a 64-bit architecture
[04:37:00] <WindowsBunny> aotic: mingw-w64 is actually just a term used for a fork of mingw that is more up to date and supports both 32 and 64 bit
[04:37:11] <WindowsBunny> unlike the original mingw which nobody cares about anymore
[04:37:28] <cmr> yeah, mingw-w64 is just a project name, it doesn't imply anything about the bitness.
[04:37:56] <WindowsBunny> Typically there's two versions: i686 and x86_64 for 32 and 64 bit respectively
[04:38:21] <WindowsBunny> If you want to cross compile on Windows you're mad, don't even try
[04:38:21] <aotic> right, thanks.
[04:38:38] <aotic> ha, not quite there yet, it always just seemed ambiguous to me.
[04:39:18] <Quxxy> WindowsBunny: cmr: Worst.  Name.  *Ever*.
[04:39:30] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: k
[04:39:45] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: That's why I'd rather deal with MSVC's lovely naming
[04:39:48] <Quxxy> Seriously, I *ignored* mingw-w64 for *years* because I wanted a 32-bit toolchain
[04:40:21] <Quxxy> I never checked to see if it had a 32-bit build because why *would* it?
[04:40:37] <Quxxy> It'd be like having a 32-bit version of the 64-bit version of Windows
[04:40:47] <aotic> so I suppose it's possible to get a 32-bit build of mingw-64 and build for 64-bit architecture?
[04:40:56] <WindowsBunny> aotic: That's a cross compiler
[04:41:02] <aotic> ah, I see
[04:41:13] <WindowsBunny> typically you'd have a 32-bit mingw-w64 that targets 32-bit
[04:41:19] <WindowsBunny> and a 64-bit mingw-w64 that targets 64-bit
[04:42:14] <aotic> that's strange to me, why would the compiler even care what it's running on?
[04:42:31] <cmr> aotic: In general, it doesn't.
[04:42:44] <cmr> There are three relevant targets: build, host, and target.
[04:42:50] <Quxxy> aotic: Because cross-compiling is abnormal, so lots of programs assume things that don't hold true when you *are* cross-compiling
[04:43:04] <cmr> Build is where you built the compiler, host is where the compiler will run, target is where the binaries produced by the compiler on the host will run.
[04:43:11] <WindowsBunny> aotic: It's just that having the compiler be the same as your target means you can have a single consistent environment with everything using the same architecture
[04:43:29] <cmr> Not sure what you mean by "abnormal" but all modern compilers support cross-compiling natively, gcc is the only shitty experience with cross-compiling.
[04:43:58] <cmr> eg, all builds of clang can cross-compile to any target that clang supports.
[04:44:02] <Quxxy> cmr: gcc, plus all the related tooling.  Oh, and you need cross libraries, and I don't even *know* where that crap is supposed to go

[04:44:27] <WindowsBunny> typically setting up a cross compilation setup is annoyingly complicated compared to straight up native
[04:44:40] <WindowsBunny> also most prebuilt binaries on the internet are non-cross
[04:44:56] <WindowsBunny> so if you want a cross compiler, that usually means building from source yourself
[04:45:01] <WindowsBunny> which is already a pain
[04:45:02] <Quxxy> WindowsBunny: I prefer "confusing, excruciating and just generally hateful" :D
[04:45:22] <cmr> yeah, with gcc it certainly is!

[05:00:52] <niconii> ...i'd respond with Quxxy in katakana too if i had any idea how to actually pronounce it
[05:01:29] <Quxxy> I think it'd probably be ククジー
[05:02:59] <Quxxy> Possibly with a voiced チ... but I dunno how to type that; nor do I remember exactly what it sounds like :P
[05:04:25] <niconii> that'd be di, pronounced ji in standard japanese (i.e. tokyo dialect)
[05:05:04] <Quxxy> Mmm
[05:05:19] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: Don't worry, I've developed an immunity to myxomatosis
[05:05:28] <Quxxy> You sure?
[05:05:28] <niconii> ヂ and ジ are differentiated in some places though
[05:05:38] <Quxxy> Because the next step is a can of hair spray and a lighter...
[05:05:51] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: Oh, I light myself on fire regularly
[05:06:05] <Quxxy> I've seen some weird combinations used for foreign words
[05:06:23] * Quxxy sighs
[05:06:28] <Quxxy> Fine, orbital kinetic cannon it is
[05:06:33] <Quxxy> Let's see you resist *physics*
[05:06:33] <WindowsBunny> oh boy!
[05:06:53] * WindowsBunny opens his mouth so he can eat the tasty whatever that comes out of the orbital kinetic cannon
[05:07:12] <niconii> Quxxy: yeah, japanese will use ディ for di in foreign words to disambiguate the "d" sound
[05:07:48] <Quxxy> niconii: The one that gets me is *voiced vowels*
[05:08:01] <Quxxy> I haven't managed to figure out where in my head those are supposed to go
[05:08:08] <niconii> Quxxy: heh
[05:08:09] <Quxxy> They just... wat no why how
[05:08:32] <niconii> Quxxy: well, voiced u is a v sound, since the closest japanese has besides that is b
[05:08:39] <Quxxy> How is "イヴ" anything like "eve"
[05:08:50] <Quxxy> See, I *get* writing "eve" as イブ
[05:09:13] <Quxxy> But voicing a "u" just... makes a rougher-sounding "u"
[05:09:15] <niconii> yeah, it's a bit weird
[05:09:25] <Quxxy> You have to move your lips to get "vu", which isn't voicing
[05:09:27] <Quxxy> Which is *cheating*
[05:10:33] <niconii> well, there's already ha vs. ba, so i think that ship has sailed
[05:10:48] <Quxxy> True
[05:10:52] <Quxxy> They should just go back and fix it
[05:10:54] <Quxxy> All of it
[05:11:44] <niconii> yeah, there are some irregularities
[05:12:04] <niconii> though keep in mind this is *post* spelling reform japanese
[05:12:14] <niconii> before that, it was... worse.
[05:12:14] <Quxxy> *ahem* the pronunciation of 上
[05:12:21] <Quxxy> I don't even wanna know
[05:13:48] <niconii> let's put it this way
[05:14:15] <niconii> きょう (kyou) used to be spelled けふ (kefu)
[05:14:20] <niconii> but was still pronounced kyou
[05:15:10] <Quxxy> And people don't believe me when I say that Japanese is *more* insane than English
[05:15:19] <niconii> ahaha
[05:17:03] <niconii> by the way, the fact that particles still have odd spelling (は as wa for example) is a remnant of that whole thing
[05:18:35] <Quxxy> I've always liked how the way they deal with conditionals is *so* horrible, they had to introduce a particle whose sole purpose is to warn the listener that a condition is coming; the sentence is still (as far as I understand it) valid without it

[05:26:36] <c74d> …aren't vowels *usually* voiced?
[05:27:10] <c74d> (unless one's whispering.)
[05:28:00] <niconii> probably, yeah, though we're speaking of the voiced mark in japanese
[05:29:27] <niconii> usually it doesn't appear on vowels (never, in native japanese words)
[05:29:45] <c74d> mm, I haven't studied Japanese. I take it it means something other than “vibrate vocal cords”?
[05:30:34] <niconii> it does mean that for the most part, compare た ta with だ da
[05:31:40] <niconii> it's just that when vowels appear on their own without an initial consonant (あいうえお) they don't have that mark, since as you say, an "unvoiced vowel" isn't really a thing
[05:32:59] <niconii> but occasionally you'll see ゔ (which ends up being pronounced vu)
[05:33:43] <c74d> I believe some languages have voiceless vowels outside of whispers

[05:37:38] <niconii> that distinction isn't really made in the actual japanese writing system though

[11:11:56] <Layl> then the answer is "consistency" or "cargo culting behavior"
[11:12:31] <eddyb> I *think* they thought they were clever and instead of using some high section index for "null" they made you stuff the first one full of zeroes
[11:12:37] <eddyb> but I'm not sure where that's used
[11:13:09] <eddyb> (they do use high section index values for a few other things, but not SHN_UNDEF)
[11:14:18] <eddyb> oh, it's used for undef symbols. alongside SHN_ABS and SHN_COMMON which are 0xffXY
[11:14:37] <eddyb> and e_shstrndx

[11:35:04] <eddyb> it has come to this
[11:35:15] <Layl> I will probably hit the "as long as I can get away with" sooner than the "know my god damn shit"

[11:38:48] <eddyb> it's not a terrible language, it's just old
[11:39:07] <eddyb> and mostly useless in the tech industry
[11:39:21] <Layl> why do you need to know Romanian
[11:39:29] <cmr> because he's Romanian, probably.
[11:39:37] <eddyb> which is why the terminology used by CS teachers on C and C++ is COBOL
[11:39:47] <Layl> so for the same reason I need to know Dutch
[11:39:57] <Layl> you should follow the tactic I used
[11:40:12] <eddyb> because COBOL is the last programming language to make sense in Romanian
[11:40:13] <Layl> which is, do really really good on one bit so you can fail the rest
[11:40:34] <eddyb> Layl: it's not max, it's sum :P
[11:41:17] <Layl> for me, my dutch exam is 4 parts, calculated together like this:
[11:41:48] <Layl> (part[0] + ((part[1] + part[2] + part[3]) / 3)) / 2
[11:41:53] <fkaa_> pretty sure i'm going to uni next
[11:42:07] <Layl> it's always irritating to explain the dutch school system
[11:42:12] <fkaa_> another 3 years of my life ;_;
[11:42:13] <Layl> because it's so different from the US system
[11:42:43] <Layl> here basically, Uni is the equivalent of Ivy League in the USA
[11:43:06] <Layl> while HTS/HBO is the equivalent of Uni not Ivy League
[11:43:15] <eddyb> baseline is 1 then 3 sections each worth 3 points. the last one is a 2-page essay about some text from Romanian literature
[11:43:23] <Layl> MBO is just below community college
[11:43:43] <eddyb> I'm pretty sure I won't get anything for that last one so I can get at max a 7
[11:43:51] <eddyb> I need at least 5 to pass
[11:44:00] <Layl> for me they just had to make sure that I can barely speak the Dutch language
[11:44:15] <eddyb> second part is an opinion essay which may or may not suck
[11:44:23] <Layl> because of immigration, there's a problem in the netherlands with people not talking dutch at all
[11:44:53] <Layl> or in a dialect that can only be described as "broken 80s cool dude"
[11:45:27] <eddyb> and the first part includes analyzing a random piece of a poem or novel, that you likely haven't seen before. mostly simple stuff, but it has some short commentary that might lose me some points
[11:45:35] <eddyb> Layl: wtf is Ivy League
[11:45:43] <eddyb> I've seen it mentioned in places but I'm not sure what it is
[11:45:49] <cmr> A few old, presigious schools
[11:46:04] <cmr> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivy_League
[11:46:11] <eddyb> that's what I'd expect... so what's the different between uni and college then?
[11:46:18] <cmr> there is none.
[11:46:21] <cmr> in the US
[11:46:22] <eddyb> the only thing after highschool here that isn't uni is...
[11:46:24] <eddyb> cmr: oh
[11:46:38] <Layl> cmr: basically expected level of education though, right?
[11:46:52] <cmr> Layl: there is no difference.
[11:46:55] <eddyb> there's some "postliceeal schools" which are, well
[11:46:57] <Layl> no difference at all?
[11:46:58] <Layl> huh
[11:47:04] <cmr> Any rule you come up with to differentiate them is due to selection bias :P
[11:47:05] <Layl> that seems really odd to me
[11:47:23] <eddyb> come on wikipedia, no french?
[11:47:24] <Layl> the Netherlands has a compelex system of quality of study and requirements
[11:47:57] <Layl> it goes from primary, with no different levels, to secondary, which has MAVO/HAVO/VWO, to tertiary, which has MBO/HBO/HTS/Uni
[11:48:09] <eddyb> lol
[11:48:38] <Layl> primary school ends with a test called "Cito" which decides which school type you qualify for in secondary
[11:48:39] <eddyb> > Vocational schools are sometimes called "colleges" in Canada. However, a college may also refer to an institution that offers part of a university degree, or credits that may be transferred to a university.
[11:48:54] <eddyb> yeah, so, maybe we kinda have some of those
[11:49:00] <Layl> switching between school types isn't that hard, as long as you go down
[11:49:14] <eddyb> but if you do any education after highschool it's going to be an uni
[11:49:24] <eddyb> Layl: is there any specialization involved?
[11:49:29] <Layl> MBO requires minimum MAVO, HBO/HTS requires minimum HAVO, Uni requires minimum VWO
[11:49:49] <Layl> eddyb: usually specialization begins at the tertiary level
[11:50:03] <eddyb> meh
[11:50:03] <Layl> MBO still contains common subjects like Dutch and Math
[11:50:12] <Layl> but HBO/HTS/Uni generally drop those
[11:50:57] <eddyb> I am in a "maths/«informatics»" HS where "informatics" means IT and CS
[11:51:00] <Layl> for example, the study I'll be going to after my current exams will not have any subjects other than the ones that are needed for the job
[11:51:05] <eddyb> (we're kinda primitive :P)
[11:51:23] <Layl> so, I'll be getting subjects like, engine architecture, 3D art, production
[11:51:35] <Layl> but nothing like Dutch
[11:51:45] <Layl> at most English literature
[11:51:46] <eddyb> there's also natural sciences and "liberal arts" I guess, as far as highschool goes
[11:52:06] <eddyb> but we still have a lot of Romanian and English and French and history and geography and fml
[11:52:11] <eddyb> well, had
[11:52:14] <eddyb> IT IS OVER
[11:52:37] <Layl> interesting thing is, the school I'll be going to does not give subjects in a traditional way
[11:52:48] <eddyb> lucky you
[11:52:49] <Layl> they've entirely switched over to project based stuff
[11:52:57] <eddyb> what I've heard about the uni I want to get into
[11:53:02] <Layl> you work on game development projects with other students and attend lectures
[11:53:14] <eddyb> is that you do one or two CS courses and about 4 math ones and that's it
[11:53:43] <Layl> only disadvantage about the school I'll be going to is that they have a brutal entrence exam for most people ;)
[11:53:59] <Layl> they get about 4 times the amount of people applying than they can accept
[11:54:02] <Layl> so they get to be very picky
[11:54:09] <eddyb> same here but the exam is pretty stupid
[11:54:27] <Layl> this school can't afford to be stupid with the exam, because stupid people apply
[11:54:31] <Layl> they have to be filtered out
[11:54:36] <eddyb> well...
[11:54:47] <Layl> the study is one called "game development and design" so it sounds very attractive
[11:54:50] <fkaa_> don't you get accepted depending on your grades?
[11:54:55] <Layl> fkaa_: nope
[11:54:59] <fkaa_> wat
[11:55:08] <Layl> I don't have my exam grades yet
[11:55:11] <Layl> and I already got accepted
[11:55:23] <Layl> I even messed up on the test they did there
[11:55:32] <Layl> but I did great in the interview
[11:55:35] <Layl> which is what got me through
[11:55:37] <eddyb> Layl: even smart people won't have an easy time on the CS problem unless they know stuff that's not taught in highschools
[11:56:04] <Layl> the interesting thing is, this school basically requires you to come in with a portfolio of things you've already done
[11:56:24] <eddyb> but teach someone to XOR and they will flip bits for the rest of their lives
[11:56:38] <cmr> Layl: so sort of like an extended master class?
[11:57:02] <Layl> cmr: it's a complex study, they don't want to spend the first year teaching software development
[11:57:11] <cmr> right
[11:57:12] <Layl> and, like I said, they can be picky
[11:57:26] <eddyb> that's definitely better than all the choices in Romania ever
[11:57:40] <Layl> the day I was there for interviews, they were spread out over the day
[11:57:45] <eddyb> I think someone from my old class went to an UK uni that could be like that
[11:57:56] <Layl> by the time I arrived, a big group was already going in for the test
[11:58:03] <Layl> and by the time I left the waiting room was full again
[11:58:18] <Layl> I even got to see a few of the portfolio pieces of other students
[11:58:31] <Layl> some impressive, some not so much
[11:58:38] <Layl> some didn't bring shit
[11:58:46] <Layl> likely those didn't get through
[11:59:06] <Layl> the documents were very specific on the kind of portfolio pieces you had to bring
[11:59:55] <Layl> I brought a few TF2 maps I made, one with a demo file showing a playtest. I also brought 3 game engine projects I worked on before, all with a bit of interesting functionality and something I learned from it
[12:02:01] <Layl> interesting how some schools end up getting a lot of international students

[13:46:46] <Tobba> IPv6 with multihoming certainly doesn't scale
[13:46:55] <Tiffany> why not
[13:46:59] <Tobba> but there are issues with normal IPv6 as well
[13:47:12] <Tiffany> multihoming is pretty much just tunnelling
[13:47:16] <Tiffany> people have tunnelled for a long time
[13:47:19] <Tiffany> and the internet hasn't fallen over
[13:47:27] <Tiffany> multihoming requires a static server to bounce off, pretty sure
[13:47:29] <Tobba> IPv6 multihoming is not tunneling
[13:47:45] <kimundi> Does someone here happen to be familiar with https://github.com/simongog/sdsl-lite ? (burntsushi?)
[13:47:48] <Tobba> it uses the routing
[13:48:14] <Tiffany> okay, so I just looked this up
[13:48:17] <Tiffany> this is not the thing I was looking at
[13:48:47] <Tobba> in any case, IPv6 doesn't even solve the fundamental problem
[13:48:52] <eddyb>  BAH
[13:48:56] <eddyb> where's the IPv6 slides
[13:49:07] <eddyb> guess I need to search HN
[13:49:17] <Tiffany> what is the fundamental problem?
[13:49:35] <eddyb> huh
[13:49:36] <Layl> the fundamental problem that IPv6 solves is that IPv4 is running out
[13:49:39] <Tiffany> this provider independent address thing isk ind of dumb
[13:50:05] <eddyb> oh, was it http://haxpo.nl/materials/haxpo2015ams/D3%20-%20R.%20Schaefer%20and%20J.%20Salazar%20-%20Pentesting%20in%20the%20Age%20of%20IPv6.pdf
[13:50:08] <eddyb> that's probably it
[13:50:20] <Tobba> the fundamental problem is how locked everything is into IPv4
[13:50:23] <Tobba> IPv6 doesn't fix that
[13:50:36] <Tiffany> how could /anything/ fix that?
[13:50:48] <Tiffany> what do you expect IPv6 to do? descent from the sky riding a flying horse while wearing shining armour?
[13:51:00] <Tobba> plus the IPv6 transition plan is still nonexistent
[13:51:06] <Layl> so... the fundamental problem IPv6 doesn't fix is that IPv4 exists?
[13:51:08] <Tiffany> what do you mean nonexistent?
[13:51:17] <Layl> short of a very large emp device, I don't know what could fix that
[13:51:22] <Tiffany> it seems quite straightforward
[13:51:23] <eddyb> https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/26141
[13:51:27] <Tobba> it completely ignores reality and assumes everyone will magically upgrade to an IPv6 router
[13:51:30] <Tiffany> upgrade devices, slowly phase out ipv4
[13:51:32] <eddyb> spurious failures :|
[13:51:34] <Tobba> even though there's 0 benefit to doing that
[13:51:44] <Tobba> and then everything updates to IPv6, even though there's 0 benefit
[13:51:51] <Tiffany> there will be benefit when IPv4 addresses actually run out
[13:51:52] <Layl> Tobba: the benefit is that you can still run the internet when IPv6 is the only thing there is
[13:51:55] <eddyb> where are they keeping the build bots, in a nuclear power plant?
[13:51:56] <Tobba> then the whole internet supports IPv6 and we can phase out IPv4
[13:52:11] <Layl> it's like driving a car that runs on gas, but then the gas disappears
[13:52:18] <Tiffany> in asia, they are breaking up their last two /8s into 1024-address blocks to assign to ISPs
[13:52:25] <Layl> the benefit of an electric car then is that you can still drive your car
[13:52:32] <Tiffany> each ISP can only have 1024 customers before they have to use ISP-wide NATs
[13:52:41] <Tobba> it's not pretty no
[13:52:53] <Tobba> although like a third of the IPv4 space is owned by shit like the US postal service
[13:52:59] <Tobba> it doesn't really help
[13:53:19] <Layl> if we annex those IPs, we can go another 2 extra years
[13:53:21] <eddyb> I think cjdns uses IPv6 in an interesting way
[13:53:32] <Tiffany> the routing table for cjdns is impossible to scale, eddyb
[13:53:40] <Tiffany> and the routes derived from it are batshit insane
[13:53:51] <Tiffany> the people who get 'better pings' in cjdns are riding off utter coincidence
[13:53:58] <Tiffany> it routes via xor distance of public key
[13:54:07] <Tiffany> not by anything reasonable, like geographic location
[13:54:09] <Tiffany> or latency

[13:55:00] <eddyb> Tobba: that's just evil

[13:56:30] <Tobba> eddyb: in IPv6, fragmentation is an extension header
[13:56:34] <Tobba> which needs to be parsed in hardware
[13:56:40] <Tobba> fun for the whole family
[13:57:12] <mrmonday> you don't really need to handle them in hardware, except when you need incredible latency or multiple 100gig pipes
[13:57:36] <mrmonday> software can happily handle processing at nx10gigs
[13:57:50] <Tobba> mrmonday: so... all backbone routers
[13:58:03] <Tobba> which coincidentally noone wants to support IPv6 on because it's too fucking expensive
[13:58:46] <mrmonday> literally all routers support hardware ipv6 now anyway, so I don't see your point
[13:59:53] <Layl> no one wants to support IPv6?
[13:59:59] <Layl> I was unaware of that
[14:00:06] <Layl> I got IPv6 support without even realizing
[14:00:14] <Tobba> which is why* but still
[14:01:06] <Layl> at a certain point, a few big legacy companies and a lot of small companies that do not have an IT staff will suddenly have a rude awakening, after that everything will go back to normal
[14:01:57] <mrmonday> my ISP has decided on carrier grade NAT rather than IPv6 :(

[14:02:21] <Tobba> the transition plan isn't economically feasible
[14:02:41] <Layl> yet a lot of people already have transferred
[14:02:50] <mrmonday> Tobba: their reasoning is that all their clients have shit consumer routers with broken ipv6 support
[14:02:59] <Tobba> which is true
[14:03:01] <mrmonday> and they don't feel like buying new ones
[14:03:09] <Tobba> which is also true
[14:03:18] <Quxxy> I don't want IPv6
[14:03:21] <Layl> wait, in the USA does the ISP or the customer buy the router?
[14:03:27] <Layl> here it's supplied by the ISP
[14:03:34] <mrmonday> afaik, all their stuff supports IPv6, it's just the client end which doesn't
[14:03:36] <Tiffany> you can get your own router, but ISPs often provide really shitty ones
[14:03:40] <Tiffany> and charge you $5/month for it
[14:03:50] <Layl> here you /can/ upgrade but most routers don't need to be upgraded
[14:03:53] <Tobba> usually ARRIS crap
[14:03:57] <Quxxy> I choose to leave IPv4 on my router
[14:04:01] <Tobba> if you want to have some fun, those things are exploitable as fuck
[14:04:09] <Layl> they're usually some rebranded glass fiber router here
[14:04:27] <Tobba> (I'm amazed every day that ARRIS are still in business)
[14:04:29] <mrmonday> once I get a job, getting a new router is one of the first things I plan on doing
[14:04:35] <mrmonday> the ISP provided one is crap
[14:04:37] <Tiffany> I think my ISP has ipv6 support, but my router doesn't

[14:04:55] <Layl> but I like the look of them
[14:04:56] <mrmonday> not the worst I've had, but crap nontheless
[14:04:57] <Layl> I enjoy blinking lights
[14:05:13] <mrmonday> I'm planning on building my own :3
[14:05:43] <Layl> funny thing is, my PC is hitting a point where the HDD because the bottleneck instead of my network
[14:05:49] <Layl> *became
[14:06:00] <Layl> steam spent more time in "disk busy" than actually downloading
[14:06:15] <Layl> now I've upgraded to an SSD and I don't get that problem anymore, but it sure was funny
[14:06:18] <Tiffany> apparently this new router is IPv6, but it hasn't managed to obtain an IPv6 address
[14:06:31] <Tiffany> maybe the infrastructure here just hasn't been upgraded
[14:06:54] <Tiffany> I have centurylink, who haven't resorted to carrier NAT yet, they still use dynamically assigned IPs
[14:07:04] <Tiffany> I think they own more than one /16 and maybe even an /8
[14:07:07] <Tobba> if instead we'd have gone for a scheme that could still route to IPv4 addresses nicely there could at least be a transition plan
[14:07:22] <Tiffany> how would you even do that, tobba
[14:07:25] <Tiffany> it just doesn't work
[14:07:43] <Tiffany> there is no scheme you can do to extend the address space of IPv4 which doesn't break backwards compatibility
[14:08:14] <Tiffany> you can add more bits to addresses in an extension, but old routers won't forward them correctly
[14:08:35] <mrmonday> would be nice if it could be done 80s style
[14:08:38] <Tiffany> the best you can do is have 4->6 and 6->4 gateways
[14:08:39] <Tobba> demote traffic to IPv4 when crossing such a boundrary
[14:08:40] <Tiffany> and we have those
[14:08:48] <Tiffany> how do you demote? do you act as an NAT?
[14:08:50] <Tobba> except the support is patchy as fuck
[14:08:52] <mrmonday> "we're turning off the old one on this date. deal with it"
[14:09:46] <Layl> will be funny once ipv4 stops working because the USA will literally be the only country having trouble with it
[14:09:53] <Tobba> I'd give it a 50/50 that IPv6 either succeeds, or people stop supporting it once the hype dies down
[14:09:57] <Layl> in europe everything will continue to work fine
[14:10:05] <Tiffany> people aren't going to stop supporting it
[14:10:10] <Tiffany> the hype /has/ died down
[14:10:18] <Tiffany> that IPv6 day thing was like 3 years ago
[14:10:48] <Tiffany> june 6 2012
[14:10:55] <Tiffany> it's been exactly 3 years and 4 days
[14:11:15] <Tiffany> there's been no attempts at hyping ipv6 since then that I've seen
[14:12:00] <mrmonday> https://www.google.com/intl/en/ipv6/statistics.html - IPv6 usage is growing exponentially, it seems
[14:12:32] <Tobba> 7%, neat
[14:12:42] <Tobba> lol, at the time of IPv6 launch day it was at less than 1%
[14:13:10] <Layl> woah belgium has 32% IPv6 adoption
[14:13:36] <Tobba> major ISP must've rolled it out
[14:14:05] <Sho> Linux is shit omg
[14:14:11] <Tobba> Tiffany: I'm just slightly expecting someone to think "wait, we have this whole IPv6 network here which does exactly nothing, why do we need this"
[14:14:20] <Layl> Sho: that's like saying "computer is shit omg"
[14:14:25] <Tiffany> it doesn't do nothing
[14:14:26] <Layl> it's broad and uninformed
[14:14:37] <Tiffany> it provides a larger address space, and destroys the need for NATs
[14:14:53] <Tiffany> which makes p2p applications a hell of a lot easier to write
[14:14:54] <Layl> unless you meant to say "linux is THE shit"
[14:15:19] <Layl> Tiffany: it's also going to make life easier for botnet writers ;)
[14:15:36] <Sho> Layl: It's called exasperation
[14:16:04] <Tobba> the 6->4 tunneling thing is really a design wart though
[14:16:14] <Layl> a tip for things that only work well on linux while you still want to use a windows development environment, use vagrant
[14:16:18] <Layl> it's really neat
[14:16:24] <Tobba> there are currently what, 2-3 separate tunneling schemes?
[14:16:39] <Sho> Layl: I'm just terribly annoyed that the btrfs+CFQ stack still results in a basically unsuable desktop when kicking off an I/O heavy build
[14:16:57] <Sho> Layl: Despite group scheduling
[14:17:28] <Sho> It's back in "I started the build, let's walk away for 10 minutes" territory
[14:17:38] <eddyb> ehm
[14:17:40] <eddyb> get BFQ
[14:17:47] <Sho> I probably really should
[14:18:01] <Sho> I heard it might try for mainline soon
[14:18:17] <eddyb> it's pretty easy in NixOS but then you get to compile the kernel locally

[15:37:53] <eddyb> c74d: why are you hitting a kernel compile?
[15:38:07] <eddyb> did you set something for that intentionally?
[15:38:13] <Tiffany> eddyb: you could try out one of those code bounty systems
[15:38:21] <c74d> grsecurity doesn't seem to keep their old patches around. :\
[15:38:25] <Tiffany> but not one of those ones that intrudes into random projects like they own github
[15:38:51] <XMPPwocky> Tiffany: i still have like three millicents in some crappy altcoin from rust-lang/rust commits
[15:38:52] <c74d> eddyb: because I enabled grsecurity, which is a kernel patchset.
[15:38:56] <eddyb> c74d: fair enough
[15:39:04] <c74d> Unless Hydra is supposed to build that?
[15:39:13] <eddyb> is there a package name for it?
[15:39:20] <Tiffany> was it XPC, xmppwocky?
[15:39:23] <XMPPwocky> yeah
[15:39:39] <c74d> eddyb: Not AFAIK, it's `security.grsecurity`.
[15:39:41] <Tiffany> I think that's bitcoin but instead of finding prefixed zeros on a sha256 hash, they find prime numbers
[15:40:54] <XMPPwocky> my altcoin's PoW algorithm is cracking bitcoin private keys
[15:40:58] <XMPPwocky> it's self-regulating!
[15:41:27] <Tiffany> hahaha
[15:43:02] <Tiffany> it'd certainly encourage cryptanalysis on secp256k1
[15:44:11] <c74d> I have no problem compiling kernels… it feels like familiar Gentoo, minus the large-ish zsh script I wrote to automate configuring/compiling/installing kernels.
[15:44:13] <Tiffany> maybe it'd finally be broken
[15:44:35] <XMPPwocky> > Firefox seems slow to start. Click here for solutions...
[15:44:43] <XMPPwocky> all it gives me is "reset Firefox"
[15:44:56] <XMPPwocky> like, you do understand that the only reason i'm using firefox is for extensions
[15:45:15] <XMPPwocky> "Make your car go faster by removing the seats, pedals, and steering wheel!"
[15:45:48] <c74d> Tobba: does your suggestion work even if it's a configuration.nix thing rather than a package?
[15:47:52] <eddyb> c74d: the way I think it works is that the configuration is used like...
[15:47:53] <c74d> I ought to fix it upstream anyway. They're normally receptive to PRs, right? *goes to get phone*
[15:48:09] <eddyb> kernel = make_kernel { foo: configuration.foo, ... }
[15:48:13] <eddyb> (pseudocode)
[15:48:43] <eddyb> c74d: yeah (but I'm not sure if you'll see immediate results)
[15:48:57] <eddyb> patching kernels yourself is pretty easy
[15:49:13] <c74d> You mean patching manually, or with some Nix thing?
[15:49:20] <eddyb> lemme find it
[15:49:26] <eddyb> I have it in a gist
[15:49:37] <eddyb> Tobba: I feel like ranting again about how useless the gist search functionality is
[15:49:45] <eddyb> and yes, all my gists are private
[15:49:48] <c74d> Patching manually, I'm familiar with; patching Nixily, I don't know.
[15:50:05] <c74d> eddyb: Gists are searchable?
[15:50:11] <XMPPwocky> 500mb of ram used, 300mb swapped out to disk... i think my swappiness is too high
[15:50:30] <c74d> oh, but not “just my own Gists”
[15:50:55] <eddyb> c74d: it's not that
[15:50:57] <Tobba> c74d: there's a way, I think
[15:51:03] <eddyb> your own secret gists don't show up in the search results
[15:51:12] <c74d> I think there are terminal utilities that can list all of one's Gists, then one could grep them.

[15:51:29] <eddyb> for 3.17
[15:51:45] <eddyb> c74d: if you set the wrong hash, you'll get the downloaded one in an error message
[15:52:01] <c74d> hm, thanks.
[15:52:02] <eddyb> it's a bit verbose, but that's all you need to do
[15:52:57] <c74d> (you're using kernel patches downloaded over HTTP, unsigned, though? :C )
[15:53:23] <XMPPwocky> i want to see how much rust's perf improves with skylake's MPX
[15:53:31] <XMPPwocky> since it should make bounds checks even cheaper
[15:54:30] <Tiffany> at least they're hashed, c74d
[15:54:34] <Wraithan> immersing myself in rust for a week was wonderful, but now the missing shit in JS is super bothersome
[15:54:38] <Tiffany> although then you have to ask if eddyb got the hashes securely
[15:54:46] <c74d> Tiffany: sure, but— that.
[15:55:18] <Wraithan> I want pattern matching and enums and such
[15:55:19] <Wraithan> :/
[15:55:31] <c74d> Wraithan: try PureScript!
[15:55:36] <Tiffany> pretty much the only reasonable attack vector there is once you have hashes established between different computers though
[15:55:46] <Tiffany> is to have broken into the server and replaced the files
[15:55:51] <Tiffany> or use a second preimage attack
[15:55:55] <Wraithan> I (myself) banned all compile-to for our project at work (with good reason)
[15:56:19] <c74d> …heh.
[15:56:33] <Wraithan> I work at newrelic writing node instrumentation, I need to have my exact code injected, compile-tos can mess with that
[15:56:59] <XMPPwocky> you know what i want, i want a kernel that dynamically compiles modules when they're loaded for the first time
[15:57:19] <XMPPwocky> 95% of the modules that get built i'm never going to use, but i don't want to rule them out

[15:58:23] <c74d> the “but I can't know that the packager got the hashes securely” was what made me decide Portage and Nix weren't enough for me and I was going to start my own package manager… over half a year later, here I am, with only a stub of a project for a package manager… and having installed NixOS.
[15:58:39] <c74d> (Wraithan: to be clear, I wasn't laughing at you, only at myself.)

[16:20:56] <c74d> I suppose there's a way to make Nix build cURL with PolarSSL rather than OpenSSL?

[16:22:07] <eddyb> and make everything rebuild :P

[16:22:55] <c74d> eddyb: wouldn't PolarSSL need to implement OpenSSL's API? (it doesn't)
[16:23:02] <eddyb> ugh
[16:23:07] <eddyb> well then, I have no idea

[16:25:08] <c74d> I should look into that, thanks.
[16:26:44] <VShell> c74d: most reasonable thing to do would be to copy its definition out, edit it, and put your version in packageOverrides.

[16:26:59] <eddyb> you can do it with no copying
[16:27:26] <VShell> eddyb: yes, but its definition is complicated enough and tightly bound to OpenSSL enough that it'd be annoying to do.
[16:27:48] <Tiffany> I sure hope nobody ever tries to implement openssl's API
[16:27:52] <Tiffany> its API is half the problem

[16:28:30] <eddyb> with all of these forks
[16:28:44] <Tiffany> the forks are forks, not API reimplemtnations
[16:28:45] <eddyb> I guess none of them are new codebases, that's probably what you mean
[16:28:54] <Tiffany> polarSSL is its own thing
[16:29:00] <Tiffany> and it's a hell of a lot nicer to use
[16:29:32] <dfockler> What's the status of LibreSSL, is that supposed to be a drop in replacement for OpenSSL?
[16:30:02] <c74d> dfockler: it is, mostly.
[16:30:08] <c74d> (or so I've heard)
[16:30:18] <dfockler> ahh yeah it's a fork of OpenSSL
[16:32:15] <c74d> What's the cleanest/best-practice-y-est way of installing a program on NixOS such that it's available to the root user (being available to other users is okay but unnecessary)?
[16:32:27] <c74d> Just `nix-env -i`?
[16:32:52] <c74d> (or `-iA`)
[16:34:27] <eddyb> -i and -iA are equivalent, they just differ in how you refer to the derivation you want to install
[16:34:32] <eddyb> -iA is... -i -A
[16:34:41] <Astrum|Lap> why is it that no matter what cell phone carrier I'm under, I always live in an area with a poor signal -_-
[16:35:44] <c74d> I know; I thought -iA was recommended to avoid Nix evaluating the whole nixpkgs.

[17:11:31] <eddyb> c74d: it looks like it just disables pinentry if x11Support is false
[17:11:52] <c74d> Astrum|Lap: ##nix-darwin on freenode, but I'd say Nix is at least a seventh less shiny and a third less magic than NixOS.
[17:12:19] <eddyb> is pinentry referenced anywhere :|
[17:12:24] <eddyb> it has to be
[17:12:37] <c74d> referenced?
[17:12:46] <eddyb> like a Rust `mod foo;`
[17:12:53] <c74d> curses pinentry is totally a thing
[17:12:58] <eddyb> dammit github and your useless search
[17:13:27] <c74d> do you want the URL of the package file in nixpkgs?
[17:13:45] <eddyb> c74d: https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/top-level/all-packages.nix#L2542-L2545
[17:13:49] <eddyb> no, this
[17:13:51] <c74d> ah
[17:14:07] * c74d goes to read that in a terminal instead
[17:14:15] <c74d> (too much for DOM)
[17:14:37] <eddyb> works fine here
[17:15:00] <eddyb> so gnupg is just `gnupg20 = callPackage ../tools/security/gnupg/20.nix { };`
[17:15:08] <c74d> well, it *works*, but it slows down my computer
[17:15:28] <eddyb> so presumably you'd have
[17:15:46] <eddyb> packageOverrides { gnupg = pkgs.gnupg.override { ... } }
[17:15:58] <eddyb> but I'm not sure what you'd put there (...)
[17:16:03] <eddyb> maybe just x11Support = false;
[17:16:08] <eddyb> c74d: but pinentry might not work
[17:16:26] <c74d> Hm. First I tried installing GPG with `nix-env -iA nixos.pkgs.gnupg`; that installed GPG 2.0, but then it was not found when I tried to run it, so I tried `nix-env -i gnupg`, and that installed GPG 2.1.
[17:17:23] <eddyb> odd that 2.0 didn't work
[17:17:38] <c74d> GPG 2.1 didn't-work in the same way
[17:17:46] <eddyb> lol
[17:17:55] <eddyb> how did you run nix-env?
[17:18:10] <eddyb> it's user-local fwiw
[17:18:20] <c74d> `nix-env -i gnupg`
[17:18:32] <c74d> as root, intending to use GPG as root
[17:19:43] <eddyb> and it's not in /root/.nix-profile/bin/?
[17:21:17] <c74d> …oh
[17:21:23] <c74d> it's `gpg2` >_>
[17:21:58] <c74d> I've had `gpg` aliased to `gpg2` so long that I forgot that it's normally `gpg2` <_<

[17:27:23] <c74d> I expect I can get something similar for Bash when/if I've time
[17:27:41] <c74d> or… I was going to write my own shell too!
[17:28:16] <c74d> along with my own package manager… and Mir GUI shell…
[17:28:39] <c74d> which… didn't happen, of course.
[17:29:53] <eddyb> lol Mir
[17:29:56] <Tobba> eddyb: hm, I need to try writing drivers with enough reusable code that I can easily write an emulator for the de vice as well
[17:30:02] <Tobba> the device*

[17:31:43] <Tobba> eddyb: for my e1000 driver I have Register enum and bitflags for most registers
[17:32:58] <eddyb> c74d: the result is a new package that you have to put somewhere btw
[17:33:11] <eddyb> technically you could just add that your configuration.nix in the package list
[17:33:25] <eddyb> s/package/derivation :P
[17:34:09] <c74d> going by that page, I'm putting it in nixos.config.packageOverrides
[17:34:27] <eddyb> yeah, that's an option
[17:34:38] <eddyb> it can go in either configuration.nix or your user env

[17:36:10] <c74d> oh nice, tmux is on GitHub now
[17:36:50] * c74d wonders how soon their SourceForge project will start serving malware.
[17:41:58] <c74d> …now of course I'm getting greedy and wanting a way to do `pkgs.EVERYTHING.override { x11Support = false; }`
[17:43:24] <Tobba> c74d: are you going TTY-only?
[17:43:51] <fkaa_> what is "wayland" and how is it better than x11
[17:44:25] <c74d> Tobba: for now, will hopes of Wayland.

[17:45:29] <fkaa_> not quite
[17:46:03] <Tobba> it's like X11 but not shite
[17:46:20] <Tobba> i.e stable, fast and sane
[17:47:28] <c74d> fkaa_: it's designed in this decade, rather than being built atop a pile of 1980s hacks.
[17:48:01] <c74d> It's supposedly more secure, unlike X where any application can read other applications' input (like passwords).
[17:49:10] <c74d> and now they sign their releases, which X.org doesn't.
[17:51:20] <Tobba> I'm assuming it's also more stable
[17:51:32] <Tobba> I mean, last time I tried it, it crashed on startup
[17:51:37] <Tobba> but that's still pretty much more stable than Xorg
[17:51:38] <c74d> (and neither uses HTTPS for downloads, so one can only get a X release ~securely by having shell/physical access to their servers)
[17:52:07] <c74d> s/will hopes/with hopes/

[17:54:57] <c74d> ahh
[17:55:24] <c74d> the stdout-spew of GPG compiling… been too long since I've seen that.
[17:56:15] <c74d> (not that GPG spews more than any package of its size would)
[17:56:57] <eddyb> ehm
[17:57:07] <eddyb> c74d: I saw your EVERYTHING thing
[17:57:10] <eddyb> c74d: you can totally do that
[17:57:15] <c74d> oh?
[17:57:21] <eddyb> it's a functional language
[17:57:27] <eddyb> yes you can do that
[17:57:40] <eddyb> the question is: how many packages have x11Support?
[17:57:44] * c74d eagerly awaits replacement for USE-flags
[17:58:03] <c74d> Some: <https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=x11Support>
[17:58:34] <eddyb> does pkgs["foo"].bar work like pkgs.foo.bar?
[17:58:36] <eddyb> I forget :D
[17:59:03] <eddyb> I have a thing which gives me all the "kde5" packages
[17:59:11] <c74d> I think it's `pkgs."foo".bar`?
[17:59:18] <eddyb> wat
[17:59:30] <c74d> <eddyb> does pkgs["foo"].bar work like pkgs.foo.bar?
[17:59:33] <eddyb> so I use builtins.filter
[17:59:38] <c74d> unless they overload ["foo
[17:59:40] <eddyb> c74d: I meant like a map access
[18:00:04] <c74d> unless they overload ["foo"] as both indexing-with-string and list-of-strings
[18:00:32] <eddyb> oh because of their separator-less syntax?
[18:00:51] <eddyb> hmm
[18:00:53] <eddyb> (builtins.filter isDerivation (builtins.attrValues kdeApps_stable))
[18:01:03] <eddyb> presumably there could be a builtins.map

[19:14:32] <fmtq> Havvy: THIS IS SILLY
[19:14:48] *** Quits: larhat1 (Adium@moz-vlo5br.cable.virginm.net) (Quit: Leaving.)
[19:14:50] <Havvy> fmtq:  Why?
[19:14:55] <fmtq> really?
[19:15:00] <fkaa_> is that js
[19:15:05] <fkaa_> "const"
[19:15:09] <Havvy> fkaa_:  Yes.
[19:15:21] <eddyb> no, it's ES6
[19:15:39] <eddyb> what is colloqually known as JS is ES5 (if you're lucky) or ES3
[19:16:19] <Havvy> eddyb:  I've not seen anybody say ES6 is not JS.
[19:16:28] <eddyb> ES6 > JS
[19:16:44] <eddyb> Havvy: that is not the question!
[19:16:53] <eddyb> the question is if JS is ES6 (yet)
[19:17:07] <fmtq> "I've never seen anyone say an orca isn't a killer whale." 
[19:17:09] <Havvy> Technically JavaScript is just Mozilla's implementation of EcmaScript.
[19:17:20] <fmtq> :D
[19:17:36] <eddyb> Havvy: see?
[19:17:47] <eddyb> v8 implements ES
[19:18:06] <eddyb> wasn't node.js stable using a version of v8 which sucked at ES6?
[19:18:10] <dfockler> once you can run ES6 code in a .js file in a browser then it's javascript
[19:18:12] <eddyb> I know `let` was broken
[19:18:26] <Tobba> XMPPwocky: signal degredation doesn't really matter when the alternative is... no signal
[19:18:27] <eddyb> dfockler: you can in chrome if you set something in about:flags
[19:18:36] <Havvy> Also, I'm technically using the non-standard const that's in V8 since Node.js disallows const in non-strict mode and io.js requires strict mode to use ES6's const.
[19:18:53] <Tobba> the only cable I have that works is less than 1m long, and I can't chain it with a longer one because it was designed by a fucker
[19:18:56] *** Quits: Astrum|Lap (Astrum|Lap@moz-7enfbr.co.comcast.net) (Client exited)
[19:18:58] <fkaa_> i don't know js anymore
[19:19:03] <fkaa_> what has the world come to

[19:19:20] <FreeFull> I never knew js
[19:19:59] *** Joins: Astrum|Lap (Astrum|Lap@moz-7enfbr.co.comcast.net)
[19:20:09] <dfockler> It got list comprehensions too, like what?
[19:20:21] <Havvy> fkaa_:  "class" is mostly a bad way of trying to clean up constructors and inheritance. Only benefit I can see from it personally is the ability to inherit base objects (like Function or Array)
[19:20:33] <Havvy> List comprehensions were removed.
[19:20:41] <fkaa_> i kinda liked proto chains
[19:20:49] <fkaa_> reminds me of lua
[19:20:49] <Havvy> fkaa_:  They're still prototype chains.
[19:20:54] <fkaa_> :o
[19:21:08] <fkaa_> so just sugar?
[19:21:11] <c74d> I've realized I can verify the patch's signature against the patch in the store; it verified successfully, so I'm now using the hash from the store.
[19:21:13] <Havvy> Yeah.
[19:21:16] <fkaa_> ah
[19:22:35] <eddyb> c74d: oh, right. sorry for not suggesting that :D
[19:22:50] <Havvy> So, how is Rust's Result type in JS silly?
[19:23:19] <eddyb> I think fmtq was pointing out that the name is silly
[19:23:28] <fmtq> no
[19:23:30] <eddyb> also, Result is not specific to Rust, it's an ADT
[19:23:34] <fmtq> you just used the word type
[19:23:37] <fmtq> in reference to JavaScript.
[19:23:45] <eddyb> heh
[19:24:06] <fmtq> "what's silly about taking a concept from a static language and sadly trying to make JavaScript act like it?"
[19:24:11] <fmtq> DISAPPOINTMENT EVERYWHERE
[19:25:16] <eddyb> Havvy: something I pointed out is there's a very efficient way of doing this at the VM level
[19:25:41] <eddyb> Havvy: using alignments bits in the pointer
[19:25:51] <XMPPwocky> just load a patched copy of V8 in with Emscripten, and run your code on that
[19:26:17] *** Quits: blank_na1e (blank_name@moz-p4egrb.mi.frontiernet.net) (Quit: leaving)
[19:26:38] <Havvy> Yeah, there's a lack of many nice things (warn on usage, collect Vec<Result<T, E>> -> Result<Vec<T>, E>, no changing errors into other error types*)
[19:26:59] <Havvy> * though that's not so bad because JS is unityped, so it's not really necessary.
[19:26:59] <c74d> eddyb: well, when I started I was using fetchpatch, which edits the patch, so that wouldn't have worked.
[19:28:16] <Havvy> eddyb:  I don't think I can tell the VM to do that.

[20:36:59] <eddyb> To leverage the driver, the attacker first sends a special TCP/IP packet with the string “romanian.antihacker” to any of the hardcoded IPs belonging to infected server. In general, such servers are computers with direct Internet connectivity, such as a webserver or a proxy. The driver sees the packet, recognizes the magic string “romanian. antihacker” and saves the attacker’s IP for later use.

[21:38:37] <Tobba> tessellation is a part of core Vulkan?
[21:38:39] <Tobba> that's weird
[21:38:57] <WindowsBunny> I'm pretty sure my AMD APU should be able to support Vulkan given proper drivers
[21:38:58] <Tobba> I was expecting them to make it way more modular

[21:40:26] <eddyb> I guess it makes sense if you look at it as an acyclic graph and pick a root?
[21:40:51] <eddyb> any node could be the root

[23:06:59] <Gankro> So are numeric casts just like *super* platform specific or something? LLVM docs continue to be The Worst
[23:08:21] <huon> what do you mean?
[23:08:48] <huon> (as in, which casts?)
[23:09:09] <Gankro> float <-> int is exceedingly vague
[23:09:25] <Gankro> I'm inclined to assume we have the same behaviour as Java, which is actually useful and explains it
[23:10:13] <huon> it's unclear to me what is vague (other than the undefined behaviour)
[23:10:27] <Gankro> So we obviously don't cause UB when we cast numbers
[23:10:31] <Gankro> So what the hell is happening
[23:10:47] <huon> we do
[23:10:51] <Gankro> wat
[23:10:57] <huon> we haven't fix that bug

[23:58:45] <Tobba> that I'm aware of anyways
[23:58:48] <c74d> hm, 'k. thanks.
