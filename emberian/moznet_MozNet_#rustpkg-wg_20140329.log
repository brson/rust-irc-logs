[17:35:17] <Seldaek> wycats: do you have a plan already regarding package signing?
[17:36:09] <wycats> http://theupdateframework.com/
[17:37:45] <Seldaek> ah I did see that a while back.. didn't read much
[17:37:54] <Seldaek> I'll take a closer look thanks
[17:39:42] <wycats> :)
[17:57:19] <Seldaek> wycats: I think I had to deal with too much crap already for today to be able to go through the whole spec :)
[17:58:12] <Seldaek> sounds good though, and it is about time there was a well documented way to do this 
[17:58:27] <Seldaek> considering there's a new package manager once a week lately
[18:01:59] <wycats> :)
[18:02:13] <wycats> Confirm
