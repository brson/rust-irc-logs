[04:19:23] <bstrie> true, but that's a big if
[04:19:35] <bstrie> even in the best case it will take years for rust to become anything approximating "mainstream"
[04:19:40] <bstrie> language adoption takes time
[04:19:43] <joe128> yah
[04:20:08] <joe128> i was just impressed how fast rust is, about as fast as c
[04:20:25] <joe128> so it seems if rust has faster development time than c then it should slowly be getting popular

[04:21:46] <hkr> what people care about is how many useful software runs on that programming language
[04:21:56] <hkr> and for rust that number is going to be zero for a while
[04:22:06] <bstrie> no, what people care about is whatever they've been sold via marketing or indoctrinated with via schooling :P
[04:22:12] <hkr> that too

[04:22:58] <hkr> joe128: if you want some langauge that will help you learn rust faster when 1.0 comes out and will also get you a job, try python

[04:26:28] <bstrie> joe128: I do see rust as an evolution of c++ in a lot of ways, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's an outright replacement
[04:26:28] <scott> hkr: python is more anti-functional than many languages
[04:26:52] <scott> hkr: guido has said as much. he's not too interested in functional programming in python

[04:28:02] <bstrie> joe128: learning C++ will give you a very solid appreciation of rust

[04:29:07] <bstrie> hkr: I think it's very presumptuous of you to think that anyone can nail down what is and is not C++ :P
[04:29:15] <joe128> it just seems like manually moving pointers around is dumb when you can get the same speed in rust?

[04:30:42] <hkr> scott: both works
[04:30:46] <bstrie> hkr: because it's a meaningless phrase and we were in fact including that in our marketing copy at some point

[04:32:11] <bstrie> hkr: it's a lazy and shallow attempt at categorization
[04:32:16] <geofft> what is "hold"? 
[04:32:20] <scott> hkr: oh, so Haskell *is* OOP

[04:42:43] <scott> heh
[04:42:47] <meteredsection> so my answer is: whatever Rust implements is the essential subset of OOP :)
[04:43:11] <scott> but doesn't Servo want some kind of inheritance for some reason? I forget what I read about that
[04:44:26] *** Quits: Rym (y@moz-o8t.887.55.31.IP) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[04:45:50] <scott> subtyping/inheritance trees seem pretty quintessentially OOP, but they also make your type system into a pile of rubbish
[04:47:13] <meteredsection> is your question about the *definition* of OOP, or the *useful subset* of OOP?
[04:47:34] <scott> mostly the latter
[04:48:32] <meteredsection> I'm inclined to say that inheritance is harmful far more often than it's helpful, but I guess there are very specific circumstances where it's useful
[04:48:58] <scott> as far as the first is concerned, I have a hard time saying any language without subtyping supports OOP, and as far as the second is concerned, I feel like subtyping is not worth the trouble
[04:49:31] <meteredsection> agreed
[04:49:32] <scott> which seems to imply supporting OOP is never worth the trouble in my mind, which might be what I actually think

[04:52:12] <scott> I just remembered in my old Lisp-in-Ruby, in the end my compiler turned into a big switch/case on the type of the AST node instead of a traditional OOP design, and this was before I even knew most of what I know now
[04:52:21] <scott> I wanted sum types before I knew I wanted sum types
[04:52:50] <scott> meteredsection: F# might be an interesting place to look for answers to that question
[04:53:00] <scott> F# must have sybtyping, too. I wonder what it looks like there
[04:53:19] <meteredsection> sorta, and I really like F# (what little I know)
[04:53:32] <meteredsection> but yes, the CLR confuses the purity of the experiment

[04:55:03] <meteredsection> even before LINQ, but especially after
[04:55:28] <scott> only time I used it was just over a year ago, so quite modern
[04:55:36] <WindowsBunny> The .NET part of F# really ruins it a fair bit
[04:55:42] <scott> from what I've seen, early C# deserved it's bad-copy-of-Java reputation
[04:55:46] <scott> but that changed entirely
[04:56:45] <meteredsection> C# may have, but the .NET framework has always been relatively good - I think it compared favorably to Java, even in the early days
[04:56:50] <meteredsection> but I should be careful, I've never been deep in Java
[04:57:38] <scott> my knowledge on both is pretty shallow. all I know for sure is C# is more enjoyable
[04:59:08] <scott> hehe, I just remembered C++/CLI
[04:59:41] <scott> dealt with a bit of that a couple years ago, too... some bindings for a C++ library to C#
[04:59:46] <scott> I had to fix a horrible memory leak
[05:00:01] <scott> MS's special .NET versions of C++ are nuts
[05:00:12] <meteredsection> yes, that's a weird world
[05:00:27] <scott> the things people do with C++... Qt, C++/CLI, Objective-C++
[05:00:33] <scott> terrible ideas all around :P
[05:00:59] <scott> I like Qt as a library, but programming in not-quite-C++ strikes me as odd
[05:01:38] <meteredsection> ever played with Unreal Engine 4? totally in that category as well
[05:01:38] <scott> the other day I noticed a Gtk+ program that appeared to use a GNU extension to have some kind of lame smart pointers
[05:01:58] <scott> so neither of the major UI toolkits use popular languages :P
[05:02:11] <scott> meteredsection: I haven't
[05:02:25] <scott> it has custom preprocessor stuff, or just weird C++ libraries?
[05:02:52] <meteredsection> weird (to me) conventions, lots of opaque macros
[05:04:18] <meteredsection> I wonder how bad that can get in Rust while staying in the bounds of hygiene
[05:05:07] <scott> hygiene or no, macros can make anything unreadable

Parallel closures have the important property that they can be executed in parallel with one another without creating data races, even if they share the same environment. We also have a controlled means to grant mutable access to data in the environment where necessary.

[09:42:56] <mrmonday> such a typical haskeller attitude
[09:43:37] <mrmonday> I know a couple of guys who have a lot of love for Haskell, and that's exactly the kind of thing they'd say

[09:49:48] <scott> brilliant
[09:49:58] <mrmonday> or a consortium perhaps

[14:31:06] <barosl> As a general purpose language, Julia didn't feel good to me...
[14:31:31] <barosl> But I know its main purpose is scientific things, so my concerning may not matter
[14:32:01] <mrmonday> well, you only gave it a couple of hours, not a lot of time for it to grow on you
[14:32:10] <mrmonday> what didn/didn't you like about it?
[14:33:42] <barosl> First, `using` in Julia imports all the names that are exported

[14:34:01] <barosl> Of course it is a nit, but I hate these kinds of things
[14:34:23] <barosl> That's why I also hate Haskell's
[14:34:47] <barosl> And... strangely enough, it takes fairly long time to run something
[14:35:02] <barosl> $ julia server.jl
[14:35:08] <barosl> (takes 5 seconds)
[14:35:10] <barosl> And it starts
[14:35:30] <barosl> The time seems to be spent to compile(?) the file
[14:35:46] *** Joins: Rym (y@moz-o8t.887.55.31.IP)
[14:35:50] <barosl> But AFAIK, Julia's a JIT'ed language, isn't it?
[14:37:32] <mrmonday> it's LLVM based
[14:37:53] <mrmonday> which means you have to wait forever for LLVM to do whatever it does, before it starts jitting
[14:38:25] <barosl> Yes, but I mean, at least the program should start as soon as possible, no?
[14:38:26] <mrmonday> the using behavious is pretty much expected from anything scientific, since you don't really care where a function is, you just want to use it
[14:38:50] <mrmonday> barosl: you've still gotta turn the whole program into IR first
[14:38:57] <barosl> Oops
[14:38:57] *** kimundi is now known as zz_kimundi
[14:39:11] <barosl> Then there might need some caching, I guess...
[14:39:54] <barosl> But really, the start-up time is almost the same as the AOT compilation time of Rust!

[14:40:31] <mrmonday> there's a reason no one uses LLVM for JIT in major jitted products
[14:40:39] <mrmonday> except for Apple/Safari I guess
[14:40:54] <mrmonday> where it's a 4th layer of optimisation, and is only hit by long running stuff
[14:43:29] <bombless> MCJIT still needs improving I guess

[18:34:04] <reem> Trying out IRCCloud instead of Limechat, this is a pretty nice suite of stuff
[18:34:16] <reem> logging, persistent login, etc. all already there
[18:34:32] <XMPPwocky> i just use irssi on a vps
[18:34:35] <XMPPwocky> 11:34 -!- Irssi: Uptime: 124d 21h 49m 13s
[18:34:49] <cmr> I have znc running on a vm
[18:35:03] <XMPPwocky> mosh makes irssi usable directly
[18:35:17] <cmr> I host it for my friends as well, who like using gui clients.
[18:35:38] <scott> I've been using irccloud
[18:35:42] <scott> maximal laziness
[18:35:45] <cmr> I've considered switching to irccloud
[18:36:36] <reem> scott: my philosophy exactly
[18:37:00] <reem> I've tried irssi before but IRC really just isn't one of those things I want to spend hours configuring (like e.g. vim)
[18:37:03] <Tobba> I'd like IRCCloud but self hosted
[18:37:08] <Tobba> (it doesn't seem to have an option for that, anyways)
[18:37:12] <scott> that'd be cool
[18:37:14] <scott> it's closed source afaik
[18:37:23] <cmr> yeah I'd totally run an IRCCloud thing self-hosted
[18:37:30] <cmr> I pay for this server anyway for my website
[18:37:33] <XMPPwocky> i don't even have much of an irssi configured
[18:37:46] <cmr> I use a completely stock weechat
[18:37:47] <XMPPwocky> my only plugins are for ascii art and colors
[18:37:55] <scott> I even configured irccloud to some extent by installing and tweaking a dark user style, heh
[18:37:59] <XMPPwocky> 11b10u02t 13t06h04e05y 08a09r03e 11f12a02b06u13l05o04u08s
[18:38:26] <cmr> irccloud does look nice, I just don't feel like paying for it.
[18:38:31] <scott> I don't pay
[18:38:47] <XMPPwocky> Clearly, we should write a clone of it in Rust
[18:38:53] <scott> and since my desktop is always on, I still stay connected all the time
[18:38:56] <barosl> And a clone of irssi
[18:38:57] <XMPPwocky> not entirely joking
[18:39:00] <barosl> And of znc
[18:39:05] <scott> then I get IRC notifications on my phone, etc
[18:39:21] <scott> an irssi without perl plugins
[18:39:55] <barosl> irssi wasn't entirely satisfactory to me, that's why I've always wanted to create my own
[18:40:00] <barosl> Though I haven't tried znc yet
[18:40:31] <Tobba> I was gonna buy one of those $15/yr shitboxes (how do these hosts stay in business) and run ZNC on it
[18:40:38] <Tobba> but effort
[18:40:47] <tiffany> znc has worked out mostly for me
[18:41:02] <sillesta> XMPPwocky: like http://shout-irc.com/ ?
[18:41:11] <tiffany> I just updated to 1.6 and now client certs are broken on 2 of the 3 networks I use them on, though...
[18:41:13] <XMPPwocky> i think i'd want the client to be split into a bunch of parts that talk to eachother
[18:41:15] <tiffany> this is the one working network
[18:41:26] <Tobba> tiffany: heh yeah
[18:41:31] <scott> sillesta: that looks pretty nice
[18:41:34] <Tobba> nearly every network has self signed certs :(
[18:41:35] <XMPPwocky> so you have a backend, which is basically a traditional BNC
[18:41:56] <XMPPwocky> then it sends the middle layer updates on the state of channels, etc.
[18:42:08] <reem> ya, first major complaint is that irccloud is in a tab in chrome
[18:42:18] <sillesta> scott: it's very buggy though :-(
[18:42:19] <reem> which makes it way harder to find than an app in my dock
[18:42:27] <scott> sillesta: aw, too bad
[18:42:32] <XMPPwocky> and the frontend is a terminal, or a web page, or a GUI app
[18:42:44] <barosl> sillesta, That's because it's written in JS, we can do better with Rust!
[18:42:49] <XMPPwocky> the extra nice thing is you could work something like bitlbee into the middle
[18:42:51] <scott> reem: I've been moving towards having most things being a tab in chrome
[18:42:54] <sillesta> sometimes deletes all my channels because of what i think is node.js going crazy with async file access
[18:42:55] <XMPPwocky> ah shit i just invented libpurple
[18:42:59] <XMPPwocky> all the good ideas are taken
[18:43:00] <sillesta> barosl: exactly ^
[18:43:10] <scott> reem: makes it really easy to get going on a brand new machine or OS

[18:48:34] <scott> they go icon-only and stick to the left

[18:48:53] <tiffany> I would rather get a good nix config going
[18:49:06] <tiffany> drop it in, let it sync everything, and then have a fully configured new system
[18:49:12] * c74d3 uses both a client certificate and SASL for freenode, which is good for when one of the two goes down.

[19:07:39] <barosl> c74d, Huh, but in that case, you still cannot "fake" their account password, no?
[19:07:53] <c74d> barosl: "fake"?
[19:07:57] <tiffany> if I was running a hosting company I would probably mandate the use of key auth
[19:08:09] <barosl> Changing the account password will not make it encrypted
[19:08:18] <tiffany> well, not mandate, just default
[19:08:36] <tiffany> you hand over a public key to use for login at purchase time, and it gets you access to root
[19:08:43] <c74d> (Well, I also wouldn't try to run my IRC client on their 0.25-GiB-of-RAM plan, but then most people aren't in nearly as many channels as I am.)
[19:09:27] <c74d> tiffany: for login to the VPSs, or to one's account with the hosting company?
[19:09:30] <c74d> (or both)
[19:09:43] <tiffany> the VPS
[19:09:51] <c74d> Oh, that
[19:09:57] <tiffany> logging into the website would probably have an optional client key auth mechanism, but the UI is so fucking awful in browsers
[19:10:01] <tiffany> and supposedly insecure
[19:10:24] <c74d> Oh, that's one other thing — Atlantic.net only lets one have one of the 0.25-GiB-of-RAM VPSs at a time.
[19:11:06] <c74d> tiffany: I suppose you could let clients manage their accounts via SSH.
[19:11:23] <tiffany> yeah
[19:12:04] <c74d> TUI application with the same functionality as the Web application, as the login "shell" for clients.
[19:20:19] <XMPPwocky> idea:
[19:20:22] <XMPPwocky> write a libc in Rust
[19:20:26] <XMPPwocky> and call it "shipwreck"
[19:20:27] <XMPPwocky> why?
[19:20:30] <cmr> done, https://github.com/mahkoh/rlibc
[19:20:30] <XMPPwocky> because it's Rusty
[19:20:33] <XMPPwocky> and it's under the C
[19:20:34] <cmr> not done I guess
[19:20:36] <cmr> hur hur
[19:20:40] <cmr> that's a good one

[21:14:55] <tiffany> except those wallpapers people make involving tux (and often scantily clothed women)
[21:15:05] <scott> tux is the least bad of the mascots I'm familiar with

[21:16:03] <tiffany> http://terriblelinuxwallpaper.tumblr.com/ not safe for work, or for life
[21:17:48] <tiffany> I guess tux is a bad logo, yeah
[21:17:53] <tiffany> what's the deal with mascots anyway
[21:20:21] <tiffany> I always rag on the gnu mascot because it's all really terrible line arts

[21:35:55] <tiffany> that's from lldb
[21:36:10] <whipsch> 20 sided die?
[21:38:00] <scott> member function pointers :(
[21:38:40] <tiffany> I don't think there are any member function pointers being used in this case
[21:38:44] <tiffany> it's just lldb acting weird
[21:46:44] <tiffany> I actually got clang to segfault earlier as well
[21:46:47] <tiffany> but I think it was just a fluke
[21:47:55] <scott> I get to play with lots of C++ compiler bugs trying to complicate complicated stuff on z/OS with IBM's compilers
[21:48:14] <scott> stdlib differences, spurious errors, ICEs, backend crashes, the works
[21:48:27] <scott> clang and gcc get a lot more testing
[21:48:51] <scott> IBM's newer compiler versions are based on clang, though
[21:48:59] <scott> I'm using the old stuff
[21:51:11] <scott> what scares me more is the possibility of things simply being silently compiled incorrectly
