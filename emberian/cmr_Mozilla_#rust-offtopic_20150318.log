[04:17:47] <barosl> Ah, I see
[04:19:09] <barosl> So the history of Rust is basically outsourcing all the builtin features to the library thanks to the type system...
[04:19:16] <bstrie> essentially, yes
[04:19:45] <barosl> I saw recently there was a proposal to make ! not a special case
[04:20:05] <bstrie> hm, it is kind of special
[04:20:18] <bstrie> you'd need to make it unify with any other type
[04:20:24] <bstrie> not sure that's useful in general?
[04:20:49] <barosl> IIRC the author tried to make it less special using some coercion rule and others

[04:21:47] <barosl> I'm not sure that would be a good change or not, but to me when I first learned Rust ! seemed somewhat strange, so I'm curious what would happen to it in the long run

[14:36:21] <barosl> Uhm
[14:37:07] <barosl> Gankro, I want to make `r+` without a SHA seem like a "default". Currently it says `r+ SHA` first, and mentions you can omit it. But I want the reverse
[14:37:31] <barosl> If needed, we should separate the command into the two lines. one for `r+` and the other for `r+ SHA`

[14:48:43] <Gankro> barosl: Ah yeah I was thinking about something like that. Good call.
[14:49:38] <Gankro> barosl: Is there a good reason to offer r+ SHA at all?
[14:50:10] <barosl> Gankro, I guess someone may want the explicitness
[14:50:22] <barosl> e.g. acrichto still uses the full form
[14:50:33] <Gankro> Like it won't work if you pick an old, non-final, or wrong SHA, right?
[14:50:45] *** Joins: Rym_ (y@moz-859.d1r.39.217.IP)
[14:50:49] <Gankro> barosl: Does acrichto know he could not? ;)
[14:51:50] <barosl> Gankro, If you r+ without a SHA, and at the same time the PR author pushes another commit, you will mistakenly approve an invalid (potentially dangerous) commit
[14:52:05] <barosl> I believe that threat does not have much possibility, but still
[14:54:03] <Gankro> r+ (SHA): Accept a PR. Optionally, the SHA of the last commit in the PR can be provided as a guard against synchronization issues or malicious users.
[14:54:07] <Gankro> barosl: ^

[14:58:26] <barosl> Actually, there's a secret feature that lets you comment on the "files changed" tab, which eliminates the potential danger as well as removes the need to write a SHA
[14:58:49] <barosl> But it is completely obsolete now so I should regard it as dead code

[15:05:29] <Tobba> I'm going to continue a conversation that happened 13 hours ago and say: death to MIME
[15:05:39] <fmtq> please tell me more
[15:05:50] <Tobba> have you seen how MIME handles unicode
[15:05:52] <Tobba> good fucking lord
[15:06:06] <barosl> Is MIME related to Unicode?
[15:06:14] <Tobba> it's partially SMTPs fault as well though
[15:06:19] <barosl> I thought it was the way to indicate the type of the content
[15:06:24] <Tobba> barosl: it's the format mails are written in as well
[15:06:31] <Tobba> they have the most fucked up encoding schemes of all time
[15:06:40] <Tobba> and I think there are like 7 different ways to encode text that are used in different places
[15:06:49] <bombless> like `plain/text; charset=UTF-8`?
[15:06:52] <fmtq> aahahahahaha
[15:06:52] <fmtq> hahahahaha
[15:06:52] <fmtq> hahahaha
[15:06:52] <fmtq> =?UTF-8 what do you mean
[15:07:09] <barosl> But actually I want to admit that I kinda like UTF-7!
[15:07:13] <Tobba> due to the incredible complexity of the grammar, some of the previous encodings wouldnt work in other fields
[15:07:18] <fmtq> I have seen Uppsala University COMPLETELY fuck up SMTP 
[15:07:24] <fmtq> it causes Gmail on android to crash
[15:07:25] <bombless> UTF-7 is good for XSS attack
[15:07:29] <fmtq> because it can't parse the From: field
[15:07:32] <Tobba> christ
[15:07:38] <Tobba> mangles öäå?
[15:07:51] <barosl> UTF-7 is a great way to hide something in the ASCII form!
[15:07:53] <Tobba> åäö*
[15:08:02] <barosl> Of course including the XSS attempts!
[15:08:05] <barosl> I love it
[15:08:06] <bombless> Why not base64
[15:08:12] <fmtq> To: "=?ISO-8859-1?Q?All_participants_of_Swedish_Politics_saml=E4sning": ;, ?=@velox.its.uu.se
[15:08:12] <fmtq> just. 
[15:08:12] <fmtq> think about that
[15:08:23] <barosl> It also breaks the "normal" ascii characters, so I don't like it
[15:08:43] <fmtq> Tobba: it fucks up in hilarious ways, and it still tries Latin-1.
[15:08:48] <fmtq> look at the random ;,
[15:08:51] <Tobba> fucking latin-1
[15:09:06] <lahwran> fmtq: what the fuck am I looking at
[15:09:12] <fmtq> a broken To field 
[15:09:15] <fmtq> hahaha
[15:09:22] <Tobba> fmtq: it should say "All participants of Swedish Politics samläsning"
[15:09:27] <Tobba> err, lahwran
[15:09:30] <lahwran> what is that supposed to look oh
[15:09:37] <lahwran> with spaces?
[15:09:43] <fmtq> Tobba: no, it parses to: All participants of Swedish Politics samläsning: ;, @velox.its.uu.se
[15:09:48] <fmtq> that's the email address.
[15:09:52] <fmtq> spaces and random characters.
[15:09:52] <Tobba> it's the sender name, so probably--
[15:09:57] <lahwran> wait that's the actual email address?
[15:10:02] <fmtq> yes.
[15:10:04] <Tobba> jesus christ
[15:10:07] <Tobba> thats so mangled
[15:10:08] <fmtq> Gmail shits an entire brick
[15:10:09] <lahwran> the actual email address has a random space semicolon comma space sequence
[15:10:10] <bombless> haha
[15:10:11] <fmtq> they never fuzzed it 
[15:10:20] <fmtq> so I can't read emails if I get one of these
[15:10:23] <fmtq> because it prefetches the email
[15:10:25] <fmtq> and dies in the background
[15:10:34] <lahwran> oh man.
[15:10:43] <fmtq> my favourite part is the DKIM has a tempfail 
[15:10:45] <lahwran> that actually sounds somewhat exploitable.
[15:10:55] <fmtq> nah, it's Java
[15:11:01] <fmtq> it's just a ddos
[15:11:01] <lahwran> no I know
[15:11:04] <fmtq> well a dos
[15:11:05] <lahwran> it
[15:11:09] <lahwran> it's a targetted DOS
[15:11:12] <fmtq> yes
[15:11:15] <lahwran> yes, I meant exploitable as a DOS
[15:11:17] <lahwran> not anything more
[15:11:26] <Tobba> could be pretty useful
[15:11:26] <fmtq> someone who cares can report this
[15:11:32] <fmtq> I've reported bugs to google before.
[15:11:36] <fmtq> cbf
[15:11:37] <lahwran> heh.
[15:12:00] <lahwran> it'd work better if you send it to the gmail team *from an email address like that*
[15:12:20] <fmtq> AHA
[15:12:22] <Tobba> oh man
[15:12:27] <fmtq> ahahaha

[15:13:32] <Tobba> UU is pretty big
[15:13:43] <barosl> Gankro, Thanks, I'll check it later
[15:14:15] <fmtq> apparently it was sent by the side of the road 
[15:14:19] <fmtq> near Blåsenhus
[15:14:23] <fmtq> according to the coords

[15:15:07] <Tobba> thats pretty off
[15:15:23] <fmtq> my experience of UU so far can be summarised as: lol
[15:15:42] <fmtq> my experience of Swedish healthcare can be summarised as: fuuuu
[15:16:01] <Tobba> at least it
[15:16:05] <Tobba> at least it's mostly free
[15:16:13] <fmtq> I am an exchange student.
[15:16:15] <Tobba> though the waiting times are fucking ridiculous
[15:16:16] <fmtq> it is not free for me.
[15:16:21] <Tobba> welp
[15:16:22] <fmtq> non-EU.
[15:16:25] <fmtq> haha
[15:16:30] <fmtq> so ridiculous waiting times 
[15:16:32] <fmtq> + fees.
[15:17:03] <fmtq> also i got pneumonia while here 
[15:17:08] <fmtq> and then sinusitis 
[15:17:12] <fmtq> so I'm fucking living it up.
[15:18:32] <fmtq> I do enjoy living out of cafes though
[15:18:45] <fmtq> and watching Swedes be casually and usually accidentally racist towards SE Asians.
[15:21:00] <barosl> https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/23475
[15:21:03] <barosl> Wow, this is a fascinating [breaking-change]!
[15:21:43] <Tobba> fmtq: never noticed that
[15:22:00] <fmtq> Tobba: which part
[15:22:42] <bombless> Sad story..
[15:22:45] <Tobba> people being (noticably) racist towards SE asians
[15:23:05] <fmtq> well, swedish teacher asked the koreans if they were all sisters because htey shared the most common last name in Korea.
[15:23:10] <fmtq> every Australian in the room groaned
[15:23:17] <fmtq> ahaha
[15:23:25] <fmtq> it's mostly ignorance.
[15:23:35] <Tobba> oh
[15:23:35] <Tobba> lol
[15:24:11] <bombless> BTW I think `|x|:i32` and `fn foo():i32` is acceptable at the first place.
[15:24:15] <fmtq> but a country that constantly plays up its multicultural credentials should know a bit better than that 
[15:24:26] <fmtq> it's a pan-European issue though I think.
[15:24:43] <Zoxc> Sweden constantly plays up its multicultural credentials? =P
[15:25:09] <fmtq> the issue being ignorant of general things in SE Asia.
[15:25:29] <fmtq> Zoxc: uh, yes, yes it really does indeed.
[15:25:39] <fmtq> particularly on integration of asylum seekers.
[15:25:56] <barosl> What? We're all bros and sisters. Didn't you know that?
[15:26:00] <Tobba> swedish immigration stuff is a mess
[15:26:14] <fmtq> Sverigedemokraterna loves you
[15:26:20] <fmtq> and you love sverigedemokraterna 
[15:26:20] <fmtq> okay 
[15:26:29] <fmtq> we're not nazis, we have a blue flower
[15:26:36] <Tobba> I wouldn't dream of voting for SD
[15:26:44] <fmtq> SD or SvD?
[15:26:46] <fmtq> :P
[15:26:58] <Zoxc> fmtq: Isn't the issue being ignorant of things outside Europe?
[15:27:04] <fmtq> Zoxc: yes.
[15:27:12] <fmtq> Zoxc: Europe == World happens a lot here.
[15:27:17] <Tobba> I personally don't care much about the immigration side of things but the entire debate was a whole bunch of "ugh"
[15:27:21] <barosl> bombless, Is that form planned to be allowed in future?
[15:27:34] <Tobba> it seemed noone even wanted to bring up the question because they would get labelled racists
[15:27:39] <bombless> barosl: No.. I'm just saying
[15:27:41] <Tobba> and then people voted SD in, which is universally awful
[15:27:53] <fmtq> well, it looked more like
[15:27:53] <barosl> Hmm, but I liked it

[15:28:12] <Tobba> it is

[15:29:02] <fmtq> you're right
[15:29:08] <fmtq> sorry, confusing Dutch acronyms with Swedish

[15:42:34] <fmtq> if you mean totalitarian dictatorship models, yes

[15:42:55] <eddyb> fmtq: what *is* communism?
[15:42:57] <fmtq> one major flaw was the closeness of the state to the Orthodox church.
[15:43:10] <GaryOak_> has there ever been a true communist state?
[15:43:13] <fmtq> eddyb: an abstract idea based around the concept of collective ownership of the means of production.

[15:48:24] <eddyb> since those kinds of details don't show up in history books
[15:48:33] <fmtq> but as I said, capitalism isn't a social structure, nor is communism.
[15:48:39] <fmtq> they just make people behave in a certain way

[15:48:52] <fmtq> Sweden is capitalist, but has strong state controls on how money flows
[15:48:58] <fmtq> ie, the Nordic model.

[16:16:10] <fmtq> well depends
[16:16:14] <fmtq> if it was for political purposes
[16:16:18] <fmtq> it is by definition a terrorist activity

[16:16:32] <fmtq> now it means "the government doesn't like you."

[16:16:58] <fmtq> lahwran: research it more
[16:17:08] <fmtq> also historically it meant the monarch doesn't like you

[16:17:12] <fmtq> :P*
[16:17:21] <fmtq> even legitimate peasant uprisings were considered terrorist activities
[16:17:47] <fmtq> then in modern international law and post-enlightenment it started to mean specifically attempts at political advancement through the use of violence and fear tactics.

[16:24:48] <tiffany> fmtq: monarch has connotations such as divine power, life-long service, and blood line inheritance of the throne, though
[16:24:49] <lahwran> since that's so easy, the US's model has worked great
[16:25:13] <fmtq> tiffany: the US is one of the most religious countries int he world and holds atheists in lower esteem than muslims.

[16:37:14] <eddyb> vodafone has 30GB for 29€

[16:37:25] <fmtq> while neglecting massive things
[16:37:26] <GaryOak_> it was the issue of monopolistic practices that was the problem

[16:47:48] * eddyb should start a (joke) neotechnological party

[16:48:04] * Zoxc votes for eddyb's joke
[16:48:07] <fmtq> wikicommunists
[16:48:12] <Astrum|Lap> then again I find government in general to be strange
[16:48:27] <eddyb> too bad I have to wait for the law allowing an individual to form a party with just 3 signatures or something
[16:48:27] <Astrum|Lap> giving power to someone else to control you
[16:48:34] <Astrum|Lap> and yet we can't do without it
[16:48:40] <fmtq> Astrum|Lap: it is an exchange.
[16:48:43] <fmtq> ... usually.
[16:48:43] <eddyb> Astrum|Lap: [18:41] <fmtq> Astrum|Lap: you should read the social contract as well.
[16:48:50] <Zoxc> eddyb: How many signatures do you need now?
[16:48:59] <eddyb> Zoxc: 10k? I'm not sure
[16:49:04] <fmtq> 250k iirc

[16:50:12] <fmtq> Astrum|Lap: "why do humans separate themselves in cultural and national ideologues" is a good definition of strange
[16:50:20] <fmtq> but the concept of organisation as government is not really.
[16:50:29] <fmtq> because as I said, it is an exchange.

[19:09:17] <eddyb> dat engineering tho
[19:09:29] <tiffany> yeah
[19:09:35] <tiffany> the engineering of the candle is very elegant
[19:09:44] <eddyb> I mean, the gas is treacherous

[21:34:10] <huon> Gankro: sure
[21:35:38] <GaryOak_> tiffany: is there a point where quantum theory includes non-deterministic results, which general relativity doesn't account for?
[21:36:09] <tiffany> I don't really know anything about quantum field theory
[21:36:18] <tiffany> I read part of einstein's book about general and special relativity, though
[21:38:20] <huon> Gankro: I'm going to make a contain-rs/admin repo to contain the configuration files; is that OK?
[21:39:36] <huon> Gankro: actually, hm.
[21:40:04] <Gankro> huon: Might be good to have a repo for org and external review-requests
[21:41:52] <huon> Gankro: I don't understand what you mean
[21:44:54] <Gankro> huon: So I'd like contain-rs to be like a collective service. You have some collections code, you poke us, someone looks it over. Maybe we adopt the code for extended maintenance.
[21:45:13] <Gankro> Also being able to log meta-issues of like "all the collections need X"
[21:45:26] <Gankro> So basically having a repo for this would be good, I think
[21:46:27] <huon> Gankro: that seems... unrelated to what I was talking about?
[21:46:43] <Gankro> huon: Basically double-duty repo
[21:47:01] <huon> my repo was just a suggestion to contain Homu's cfg.toml file?

[21:47:12] <bvssvni> eddyb: I have an idea for how to type check arbitrary type systems
[21:47:38] <Gankro> huon: but the same repo can be used for oragnization too
[21:47:43] <bvssvni> eddyb: remember you said the idea of working on AST was too brittle
[21:53:47] <bvssvni> eddyb: I thought of it, and I think there is a way to put some constraints on type systems without giving up all the freedom
[21:55:32] <bvssvni> eddyb: I ended up with something more similar to your idea, even though I don’t know the details of what you have
