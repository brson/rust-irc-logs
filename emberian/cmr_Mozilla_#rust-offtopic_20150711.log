[09:08:18] <Quxxy> Ok, I'm bumming around the D forums, looking at some discussions about Rust
[09:08:34] <Quxxy> Someone who clearly hasn't used Rust is banging on about how Rust is shit

[09:09:07] <Quxxy> And then, as proof, he links to code *I wrote in 2007*, which does something *completely different*

[10:53:19] <fkaa> eddyb: you're a doctor in rust yes?
[10:59:04] <fkaa> would it make sense to be able to "implement" enums on a type. say you have a single `u64` and you want to use first 10 bits for the tag, and the rest of the bits for varying values depending on the tag. it'd be really cool if you could do like: type SomeType = u64; impl enum for SomeType { fn get_tag(&self) -> u32 { self << 10 } ... }

[10:59:47] <eddyb> wat

[11:00:35] <fkaa> good question, maybe it doesn't make any sense :s
[11:00:59] <eddyb> fkaa: anyways, if you're thinking of executing arbitrary code during pattern-matching, that's very likely to never become a thing

[14:07:07] <Elaine> I've once again come at that unfortunate point in my life where I think, "I want to write a web app"
[14:07:31] <Tiffany> have you considered trying ur/web?
[14:07:43] <Tiffany> I've had it on the backburner for when I have that thought
[14:08:07] <wrl> i have been eyeing elixir/phoenix as of late
[14:08:23] <Elaine> I've tried to use it in the past but found it hard to understand and use.
[14:08:29] <Elaine> (ur/web)
[14:08:46] <wrl> phoenix: http://www.phoenixframework.org/
[14:08:49] <wrl> the docs are surprisingly good
[14:08:59] <Elaine> I might do that, I like elixir
[14:09:13] <Elaine> Haven't looked at it for webdev, since I'm not a webdev, heh
[14:09:23] <eddyb> > do, end
[14:09:31] <eddyb> ugh
[14:09:32] <fkaa> lua?
[14:09:45] <wrl> eddyb: settle down settle down
[14:09:53] <Tiffany> do you have a problem with algol-style syntax, eddyb?
[14:10:01] <eddyb> Tiffany: as a matter of fact, I do
[14:10:04] <Elaine> it's still block structured so who cares
[14:10:19] <eddyb> Elaine: my visual input processors :P
[14:10:25] <Elaine> get new ones ;P
[14:10:48] <wrl> all i hear is "ugh semicolons i can't stand semicolons"
[14:11:18] <fkaa> is there any reason to use do, end over {}?
[14:11:22] <fkaa> other than personal preference
[14:11:32] <Elaine> is there any reason to use {} over do, end?
[14:11:35] <Elaine> other than personal preference
[14:11:36] <eddyb> shape and direction is so much easier to visually scan than anything else
[14:11:45] <fkaa> easier to parse? :)
[14:11:50] <fkaa> not that it matters
[14:11:54] <Elaine> is it?
[14:12:03] <Elaine> I don't think so, certainly not by machines.
[14:12:30] <eddyb> it's more or less identical for machines
[14:12:50] <eddyb> other than the fact that you have to handle identifier boundaries
[14:12:57] <eddyb> doa is not do a etc.
[14:13:24] <eddyb> grrrr coherence is being a tough nut to crack
[14:13:38] <Tiffany> I saw a blog post which talked about how {} are sideways when used to identify blocks
[14:13:38] <Elaine> Tiffany: I like the idea of ur/web at least.
[14:13:41] <Tiffany> which kind of defeats the point
[14:14:10] <Elaine> but it seems rarely used and poorly documented
[14:14:20] <Tiffany> I use indentation to move through code
[14:14:25] <eddyb> I want to teach it a new trick and every time I take the 10 minutes to recompile the compiler, it just gives me the same error
[14:14:35] <Tiffany> seriously, go look at some code with no indentations
[14:14:40] <Tiffany> it doesn't matter whether you use {} or do/end
[14:14:44] <Tiffany> it will be painful to read
[14:16:43] <Elaine> you heard it here, folks
[14:16:46] <Elaine> go is slower than php: http://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/
[14:16:53] <wrl> hah
[14:17:08] <Tiffany> whoa
[14:17:18] <Tiffany> ur is really fast on there
[14:17:23] <Elaine> it seems that none of those benchmarks go about 1k req/s
[14:17:40] <Elaine> or rather, that's the latency, ignoring parallelism
[14:18:11] <Elaine> inverse latency obviously
[14:19:16] <Elaine> alright where's the source for this benchmark something is amiss

[14:22:11] <Elaine> interesting and strange
[14:23:03] <fkaa> is there anything about php that is slow? i just hear how awful it is
[14:23:12] <eddyb> isn't it interpreted?
[14:23:20] <eddyb> or was until some recent version?
[14:23:21] <fkaa> not even sure if it's a interpreted or compiled language
[14:23:28] <Tiffany> it's an interpreted languages with buckets and buckets of things which make it impossible to optmize, both manually and automatically
[14:23:31] <eddyb> it's also parsed on every request
[14:23:38] <Tiffany> that too
[14:23:45] <Elaine> that's not true
[14:23:55] <Tiffany> oh
[14:23:58] <Elaine> you don't need to use it with cgi
[14:24:04] <Tiffany> fastcgi elaine
[14:24:09] <Tiffany> it sends a request containing the file to execute
[14:24:16] <Tiffany> I think there's a thing to cache the bytecode
[14:24:19] <Tiffany> but it's optional iirc

[14:27:13] <Elaine> eddyb: anyway the zend engine doesn't do anything special but hhvm has a jit etc.
[14:27:20] <Tiffany> yeah, there is hhvm
[14:27:22] <Elaine> Tiffany: there's no reason it has to do fastcgi in that manner
[14:27:28] <Elaine> that isn't the way fastcgi usually works
[14:27:36] <Elaine> I'm amazed that that's how php applications chose to use it
[14:28:19] <Elaine> (if it is, haven't found anything concrete on the webs)
[14:28:27] <Tiffany> how does fastcgi usually work, then?
[14:29:05] <Tiffany> it's my understanding that it sends all the http request headers, and some other bits, including the filename of the php file to execute, to the fastcgi server, and then the server either parses that file or loads it from its bytecode cache, and executes it
[14:30:14] <Tiffany> and in order to cache bytecode, you have to have something like php-xcache installed, which is optional and not installed by default
[14:30:33] <Elaine> fastcgi is a binary protocol for sending key-value pairs and streams, framed, over some other stream... it's not http or php-specific.
[14:30:50] <Tiffany> I know that
[14:31:14] <Elaine> so you could have a persistent process written in php that handles fcgi stuff.
[14:31:19] <Tiffany> oh
[14:31:19] <Elaine> like every other language does.
[14:31:24] <Tiffany> I see
[14:31:29] <Tiffany> yeah, that makes sense
[14:31:52] <Tiffany> php is weird in that regard, being the fastcgi server, instead of having the application be the fastcgi server
[14:32:04] <Tiffany> the amount of initialization and stuff that php pages do every request is kind of crazy
[14:32:42] <Tiffany> with the application being the fastcgi server you don't need any of this SCRIPT_FILENAME nonsense either
[14:32:47] <Elaine> right
[14:32:50] <Tiffany> that I spent an awfully long time trying to get to work
[14:33:37] <Tiffany> I think a lot of php users actually like that it executes anew for every request
[14:33:49] <Tiffany> because it means you can spam the hell out of global variables
[14:33:50] <Elaine> it used to leak like a sieve so that was nice.
[14:33:54] <Elaine> that too, yeah.
[14:34:16] <Elaine> don't need a deallocator when you're going to die in 500ms anyway
[14:34:23] <Tiffany> doesn't it still use non-cycle-detecting reference counting?
[14:34:26] <fkaa> random thought: is there any reason js/lua variable assignment defaults to global namespace?
[14:34:30] <Elaine> I don't know what the zend engine does.
[14:34:44] <fkaa> i thought that is generally frowned upon
[14:34:47] <Tiffany> fkaa: because they're both from the 90s, designed by people who don't into language design
[14:35:33] <Tiffany> I think at that time everyone was still picking up the pieces from the BASIC craze and smalltalk had penetrated somewhat into the design space of new languages
[14:35:52] <fkaa> lua is that old?
[14:35:57] <Tiffany> yeah
[14:36:00] <Tiffany> older than JS
[14:37:08] <Tiffany> lua-1.1 is dated as february 1995 on their ftp
[14:37:26] <Tiffany> it's apparently from 1993
[14:37:41] <Tiffany> javascript is from 1995
[14:37:50] <fkaa> macaroneys
[14:37:54] <fkaa> that's before my time
[14:39:56] <bluss> has anyone else experimented with faux 2D slices in rust?
[14:40:17] <Elaine> bluss: like, a strided view over a packed multidimensional array?
[14:40:25] <bluss> transmute (*const T, u16, u16, u16, u16) into a &[T]
[14:40:27] <bluss> yes
[14:40:35] <bluss> only works for small slices ^
[14:40:39] <Elaine> er, not quite what I was thinking off
[14:40:50] <Elaine> that's crazy, don't do that :P
[14:41:00] <bluss> it's crazy but it's not broken
[14:41:08] <bluss> you transmute it into a fat pointer, but not &[T]
[14:41:10] <bluss> just &Vie
[14:41:11] <bluss> w
[14:41:38] <bluss> the only problem is the interface around the size limit
[14:43:18] <bluss> Elaine: we've got no allowance for custom fat references so we have to make sue with the 16 bytes we have

[16:09:07] <bluss> eddyb: yes the point it so allow a custom reference type (fat pointer since it's larger than one pointer)
[16:10:43] <eddyb> bluss: why?
[16:10:47] <whipsch> http://i.imgur.com/bO9KK8I.jpg lovely display issue to wake up to
[16:11:05] <eddyb> bluss: do you need a type that works with more than just borrowed references?
[16:12:16] <bluss> hm it's for a strided matrix view, for example if (*const T, u16, u16, u16, u16)  or something larger was a custom fat pointer
[16:12:20] <Tiffany> whipsch: what is that?
[16:12:32] <bluss> it would have a matching owning array of the same kind of representation
[16:12:40] <Tiffany> it looks like an old rune language
[16:13:32] <eddyb> bluss: the owning array doesn't have split width/stride
[16:13:43] <eddyb> bluss: or do you actually want that?
[16:13:44] <bluss> why not, it can have that?
[16:14:05] <whipsch> Tiffany: idunno, the whole display was like that.  was happening on windows host as well, so i blame windows
[16:14:08] <bluss> my current ndarray project works like that, so you can slice, transpose etc the array too
[16:14:26] <bluss> eddyb: imagine you want to impl Index to slice a custom multidimensional array.. Now the return type
[16:14:34] <eddyb> bluss: ah!
[16:14:36] <bluss> eddyb: that return type is the thing I need, that rust doesnt' support yet
[16:14:40] <eddyb> okay, that's a valid point
[16:14:55] <bluss> japaric has a fork of rustc that supports it I think
[16:15:12] <Quxxy> ᚨᛕᚴ
[16:15:15] <eddyb> japaric does it by having the pointer be an user type
[16:15:20] <eddyb> which I don't agree with
[16:15:38] <eddyb> bluss: one trick you could use...
[16:15:55] *** Quits: Binero (Binero@moz-rp278g.access.telenet.be) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[16:15:55] <bluss> aha
[16:16:33] <eddyb> using a trait you could map [T] -> [T], [[T]] -> [[[T]]], [[[T]]] -> [[[[[T]]]]], etc.
[16:16:54] <eddyb> 1 -> 1 + 0, 2 -> 2 + 1, 3 -> 3 + 2
[16:17:08] <eddyb> that would give you the storage space for all the values you need
[16:17:31] <eddyb> you would have a wrapper around it so the meaning of the values is private
[16:17:49] <bluss> maybe. It's easier to just use a stride number for each dimension
[16:17:54] <eddyb> what?
[16:18:12] <bluss> yes
[16:18:21] <eddyb> the compiler *only* stores strides
[16:18:42] <eddyb> you don't need to add strides, you need to add dimensions
[16:18:55] <eddyb> and, well
[16:19:10] <eddyb> an N-dimensional slice gives you [usize; N] to work with
[16:19:21] <eddyb> I like that more than japaric's stuff :P
[16:20:29] <bluss> A multidimensional "slice" will not necessarily be contiguous
[16:20:38] <eddyb> bluss: a slice type will be
[16:20:39] <bluss> say (0..2) x (0..2) in a 4 x 4 matrix again
[16:20:56] <eddyb> a library slice will have to add (N-1) dimensions <= their respective strides
[16:21:24] <bluss> ok I don't understand. I only know the numpy ndarray representation
[16:21:39] <eddyb> bluss: the type [[[T]]] doesn't exist right now in Rust
[16:21:44] <eddyb> however, it has a very strict definition
[16:22:02] <eddyb> it's an erased [[[T; W]; H]; D]
[16:22:38] <eddyb> bluss: it can't be anything else, and right now we're being overly restrictive so it doesn't work
[16:22:57] <bluss> so it's not useful for the ndarray's slice
[16:23:23] <eddyb> (the trans code for DSTs is not the greatest and it assumes one single pointer-sized piece of information for all fat pointers)
[16:23:27] <eddyb> bluss: yes
[16:23:47] <eddyb> bluss: however, you can add N-1 dimensions to it to store all the data you may need
[16:24:19] <eddyb> bluss: and have it work with Index and whatnot
[16:24:33] <eddyb> bluss: as a bonus, you only need one library type for any number of dimensions
[16:25:02] <bluss> ok that's interesting, but can I store arbitrary data in the length fields?
[16:25:09] <bluss> for a &[[[T]]]
[16:25:50] <eddyb> bluss: it only has to be valid data if you're exposing it like that
[16:26:16] <bluss> so you're saying my current hack with   struct Foo([T]) and &Foo isn't broken :)
[16:26:19] <eddyb> bluss: if you have &Struct with Struct holding a [[[T]]] field, the meaning of those fields is up to you
[16:26:24] <eddyb> bluss: well...
[16:26:42] <eddyb> I would suggest switching to struct Foo(PhantomData<T>, [()]) just in case
[16:26:45] <bluss> storing [u16; 4] in the size field
[16:26:48] <bluss> ok
[16:27:09] <bluss> hm
[16:27:09] <eddyb> I was going to use a (Mmap, [()]) wrapper to store a starting position in a mmap'd file in the "length" bit of a pointer
[16:27:13] <eddyb> also for an Index hack :D
[16:28:34] <bluss> hm ok now I understand the [[[T]]] idea at least
[16:28:59] <eddyb> and you can write a recursive impl to do fancy things with [A] where A might also be a [_]
[16:29:32] <eddyb> with working associated constants you could have a safe method to return the dimensions as a [usize; N]
[16:29:38] <eddyb> bluss: and Vec<[T]> can be made to work
[16:29:43] <eddyb> it's all great stuff
[16:30:18] <eddyb> but I forgot all about it and there wasn't any activity in that area, other than japaric's different approach
[16:30:35] <eddyb> bluss: you know...
[16:30:48] <bluss> eddyb: I'm not sure the slice solution is the end of it
[16:30:57] <bluss> eddyb: we need custom reference types for other things
[16:31:18] <eddyb> there could be a wrapper for extra data, e.g. GoesInFatPointer<[[[()]]]>
[16:31:30] <eddyb> that only worked with N-dimensional slices of ()
[16:31:50] <eddyb> and gave you the tools to work with those values
[16:32:09] <eddyb> oh, but it wouldn't work so well because you need to mutate the values on your type
[16:32:40] <eddyb> bluss: can all of them stash data in [usize; N] arrays after the data pointer?
[16:33:18] <bluss> don't know, sounds very hacky
[16:33:34] <eddyb> IMO it's less hacky than japaric's custom *fat pointer*
[16:33:52] <eddyb> oh
[16:34:00] <eddyb> bluss: I screwed up q_q
[16:34:13] <eddyb> not entirely, but you can't use that solution as-is
[16:34:48] <eddyb> bluss: guess what size_of_val returns if you use [[[[[()]]]]]
[16:35:03] <bluss> it's unsized
[16:35:06] <eddyb> (I guess you also need [T; 0] instead of PhantomData<T>, for alignment)
[16:35:08] <eddyb> bluss: yes
[16:35:15] <eddyb> unsized means dynamically sized
[16:35:25] <bluss> yes
[16:35:32] <eddyb> sizeless types are rare and do not even exist in Rust atm
[16:35:41] <eddyb> bluss: size_of will return 0
[16:35:46] <eddyb> size_of_val, I mean
[16:35:57] <eddyb> for any data stored in those usize's
[16:36:01] <bluss> wut? doesn't it require T: Sized
[16:36:07] <eddyb> that's the point
[16:36:23] <eddyb> if it did, it would be useless
[16:36:39] <bluss> ok I see
[16:36:52] <eddyb> bluss: too small of a size_of_val is memory unsafe if you can have owned values of that type
[16:37:04] <eddyb> there is a solution, which japaric also needs
[16:37:22] <eddyb> impl<A> !Sized for GoesInFatPointer<A>
[16:37:32] <eddyb> impl<A> Sizeable for Matrix<A>
[16:37:43] <eddyb> (and then you compute the size based on what your values *mean*)
[16:37:59] <bluss> hm that's messy
[16:38:00] <eddyb> Sizeable could be implemented in the library for slices anyways
[16:38:02] <eddyb> bluss: why?
[16:38:24] <bluss> no reason the ndarray slice needs a defined size
[16:38:37] <eddyb> there's no solution for user-defined DST layouts that doesn't involve introducing Sizeable
[16:38:48] <bluss> it represents a multidim range of elements, might be sparsely laid out in memory
[16:38:54] <bluss> so size isn't so meaningful
[16:39:31] <eddyb> you can use ([T; 0], [[[()]]]) or whatever if you don't need owned values of it
[16:39:35] <eddyb> bluss: ehm, that's not true
[16:39:35] <bluss> it doesn't represent a contiguous value
[16:39:50] <eddyb> size is the size of the allocation
[16:40:10] <eddyb> even if your view is reduced or sparse
[16:40:46] <eddyb> bluss: generally, a dynamic size of 0 should be okay if you can't produce e.g. Box<Matrix<[[T]]>>
[16:41:33] <eddyb> you likely want a different type, maybe related to Vec<[T]>, anyways, for building dynamically sized multi-dimensional arrays
[16:42:35] <bluss> my current experiment with it has the number of dimensions in the type
[16:42:40] <bluss> I think that's a necessary evil

[16:44:35] <bluss> one way of representing an array is just   elements: Vec<T>, dimensions: (usize, usize, usize), strides: (usize, usize, usize)
[16:44:55] <bluss> if the tuple of dimensions is a type parameter, that's what I mean by number of dimensions in the type

[17:00:00] <eddyb> uh oh I don't remember the "rotator"
[17:00:15] <eddyb> even more software pipelining!
[17:00:55] <Tiffany> hmmm
[17:00:59] <Tiffany> you know what
[17:01:19] <Tiffany> you could imagine the scratch pad as being registers
[17:01:30] <eddyb> yeah, it's a register file
[17:01:38] <Tiffany> the belt is mostly a fancy bypass network
[17:01:41] <eddyb> I mean, that's kinda what SRAM is after all, no :P?
[17:02:11] <Tiffany> I wonder how fast accesses to scratch are
[17:02:25] <Tiffany> because whenever the output latches of a functional unit need to be reused, it transparently relocates that belt location to scratch...
[17:02:39] <eddyb> I remember some 3-cycle delay thing, but I think that was the spiller
[17:02:42] <Tiffany> it must be pretty big
[17:02:47] <Tiffany> oh yeah
[17:02:53] <Tiffany> it was a 3 cycle spill-fill pair
[17:03:04] <eddyb> Tiffany: the relocation is actually limited
[17:03:18] <Tiffany> maybe it's 2 cycles to spill and one to fill?
[17:03:25] <Tiffany> but that still doesn't make sense
[17:03:35] <eddyb> by the number of belt items you can drop
[17:03:39] <Tiffany> it would have to happen in the read phase of the cycle in order to not require a stall
[17:03:49] <Tiffany> oh
[17:04:05] <eddyb> I mean, by the number of items you can drop on the belt
[17:04:06] <Tiffany> maybe they use something faster than scratch for belt then
[17:04:24] <eddyb> Tiffany: the 3-cycle thing is a background spiller engine detail
[17:04:30] <Tiffany> the scratch is kind of strange
[17:04:30] <eddyb> spill and fill are 1-cycle each
[17:04:43] <Tiffany> oh
[17:04:45] <eddyb> but data is moving in the background after the spill
[17:04:49] <Tiffany> you know what
[17:04:52] <eddyb> it trickles :P
[17:04:54] <Tiffany> traditional registers have this problem too
[17:04:58] <Tiffany> that's why bypass networks exist
[17:05:04] <eddyb> taadaaa
[17:05:24] <Elaine> what's a bypass network?
[17:05:36] <eddyb> so traditionally you work with registers and spill to the RAM (stack)
[17:05:43] <Tiffany> elaine: bypass networks are when the CPU will directly hook the outputs of one function unit into the inputs of another, bypassing registers
[17:05:53] <Elaine> dynamically, a la a crossbar?
[17:05:55] <Tiffany> writing and subsequently reading from registers takes more than the time in between cycles
[17:05:57] <eddyb> on the Mill, you work with the bypass network and spill to a register file which may be paged out to the RAM
[17:06:00] <Tiffany> yeah
[17:06:03] <Tiffany> I think
[17:06:11] <Tiffany> the mill makes the bypass network explicit
[17:06:29] <Tiffany> the default storage is in the output latches of function units, and belt locations are simply pointers to either output latches or scratchpad locations
[17:06:32] <Tiffany> just like a bypass network
[17:06:35] <eddyb> but it all happens in the background and the spiller engine can be clever enough to avoid noticeable latencies
[17:06:51] <eddyb> unless you recurse really *really* fast
[17:07:20] <Tiffany> can the register file end up paging all the way out to swap?
[17:07:34] <eddyb> yeah
[17:07:41] <Tiffany> that's pretty funny
[17:07:50] <Tiffany> imagine waiting 10 milliseconds on a fill
[17:07:59] <eddyb> just like spilled registers in stack memory can on traditional systems
[17:09:04] <eddyb> Tiffany: a lot of what the Mill is doing is "our worst case is not worse than the worst case of existing solutions"
[17:09:25] <Tiffany> yeah yeah
[17:09:27] <Elaine> well, everything they're doing is that, Godard says so frequently.
[17:09:38] <eddyb> hmm
[17:09:49] <Tiffany> I was surprised when he said that everything was on sweat equity in the recent talk
[17:09:57] <Tiffany> I guess that explains why things seem to be moving slowly
[17:10:46] <eddyb> http://liberomnia.org/wiki/Computer/The_Mill/Memory_Block_Diagram.svg.html
[17:11:14] <Elaine> it's moving even slower than it may seem; in 2009 he talked about having 70+ patents in progress and working on an optimized FPGA implementation, but already having a good ASIC
[17:11:30] <eddyb> so the scratchpad is at the L1 level
[17:11:37] <eddyb> Elaine: huh, ASIC in 2009?
[17:12:01] <Elaine> ASIC is easier than FPGA in many ways.
[17:12:24] <eddyb> for equivalent performance?
[17:13:16] <Elaine> large combinational logic is easier to synthesize in a performing manner for an ASIC than on an FPGA.
[17:13:18] <eddyb> L0 instruction caches? I don't remember this on the Mill wiki
[17:13:32] <Elaine> stuff like large crossbars are hell on an FPGA etc
[17:14:25] <eddyb> http://millcomputing.com/wiki/Prediction
[17:15:11] <eddyb> why would I not be surprised if a Mill CPU would have embedded support for DWARF metadata for some debugger-helping reason?
[17:16:20] <eddyb> http://millcomputing.com/wiki/Memory oh, there are I$0{e,f} on there but there's no "L0" being used to refer to them
[17:21:45] <eddyb> > Every turf has three well known regions, each with the expected permissions. The code region is executable. The data region is readable and writable and contains both the initialized data and the uninitialized data. The constant region is read only. These regions are not contained in the PLB but instead are contained within CPU registers.
[17:22:19] <Elaine> http://www.ac.usc.es/arith19/sites/default/files/SSDAP3_ArithmeticOnTheMillArchitecture.pdf
[17:22:22] <Elaine> btw
[17:22:26] <eddyb> they better be called CS, DS and... well, no, there is .rodata segment
[17:32:40] <eddyb> ● Standard cell ASIC process
[17:33:04] <eddyb> Elaine: I'm not sure that means they had an ASIC, but rather that they didn't need anything fancier
[17:33:19] <eddyb> "Key hardware in Verilog" is the more important bit from there IMO
[17:33:45] <eddyb> have they been refining it since, while also working on the software?

[23:41:50] <Skyler> would be cool to use something more intuitive than verilog
[23:42:05] <Elaine> Skyler: it's a scala DSL so you get the full power of scala for metaprogramming
[23:42:33] <Skyler> :o
[23:43:11] <Elaine> And 100% of it is synthesizable, and there are no hidden pitfalls like latch inference
[23:43:39] <Elaine> it's a little rough around the edges in terms of the tooling, esp around error messages, but I like it a lot so far
[23:44:06] <Skyler> that's awesome
[23:44:14] <Skyler> I'm glad to see HDLs getting love at all
[23:44:19] <Skyler> seems like they're picking up steam
[23:44:30] <Elaine> another thing to look at is probably Bluespec
[23:44:47] <Elaine> but it's proprietary, which I'm trying to avoid
[23:45:01] <Skyler> right
[23:45:38] <Elaine> Chisel can also generate very fast cycle-accurate software sims
[23:45:59] <Elaine> and has a decent test harness (you poke/peek the entire state of the device from scala)
[23:46:52] <Skyler> all first party? iirc altera never offered a free software simulator
[23:46:59] <Elaine> yeah
[23:47:08] <Skyler> cool
[23:47:17] <Elaine> it's not fantastic, it's super primitive compared to an actual EDA
[23:47:19] <Elaine> but it's workable
[23:47:27] <Elaine> for the level of complexity I'm dealing with so far
[23:47:48] <Elaine> risc-v uses it for everything though
