[00:20:51] <cmr> I can really only give generic advice that you sit down and work out all the components you need, who should own what, etc...
[00:21:22] <cmr> The closer you can get your ownership into a tree, the easier it will be.
[00:22:02] <JustAPerson> the problem is that things at the very edges of the tree need access to things at the root
[00:24:30] <cmr> https://github.com/PistonDevelopers/current might be of use?
[00:34:33] <JustAPerson> cmr: seems to be just a library wrapping over similar Rc<RefCell> idioms, and you're left using .borrow() everywhere.
[00:35:21] <JustAPerson> So I have an Application struct, which would be the root of my ownership tree. I'm considering just have a global static to the single Application instance in.

[01:55:27] <a5i> but Idk when I should start Ruby
[01:55:47] <tiffany> a5i: if your project is scaling upwards and your project is written in a language that is not designed for it, the number of  bugs and hacks appears to be increasing exponentially
[01:55:50] <WindowsBunny> Start ruby when you want to start doing things that are better done in ruby than JS
[01:56:08] <WindowsBunny> I found ruby very easy to learn when I tried it a couple years ago
[01:56:19] <WindowsBunny> then again, most things are easy compared to Rust and C++ :P
[01:56:31] <tiffany> it seems like you're almost inevitably going to have performance problems with ruby though

[02:11:33] <zwarich> nah, that's lame
[02:11:41] <zwarich> plausible deniability
[02:12:08] <zwarich> I remember once finding a paper that would convert recursive fib to iterative fib
[02:12:35] <cmr> and only fib, or more general?
[02:12:42] <zwarich> more general
[02:12:51] <zwarich> there's also a technique to compile structure recursion on algebraic types into Deutsch-Schorr-Waite style pointer reversal
[02:12:55] <zwarich> so you use no stack space to recurse
[02:12:57] <zwarich> OH YEAH
[02:13:21] <scott> sometimes I wonder why compilers don't do non-tail-recursive fib -> tail-recursive fib (likewise for factorial, etc) since it seems like a mechanical translation
[02:13:43] <theme> scott, *seems*
[02:13:45] <zwarich> scott: LLVM will actually do factorial and one level of fib IIRC
[02:13:57] <zwarich> it's harder with accumulators and multiple recursive calls
[02:14:30] <zwarich> also much more useless, since it rarely occurs in practice
[02:14:44] <scott> er, yeah, the fib transformation isn't as obvious, but factorial is really basic
[02:14:46] <zwarich> there is a useful generalization of tail recursion optimization that LLVM doesn't do
[02:15:28] <scott> I've mostly seen this in the context of haskell and you wouldn't write the above functions with explicit recursion anyway
[02:15:29] <zwarich> the MLton guys call it 'contification', but basically the idea is to take groups functions that always return to the same point (i.e. have the same continuation) and make them all basic blocks in the same function

[02:21:42] <zwarich> in a lot of their use cases (e.g. low-level kernel / driver programming) they are the only option

[02:24:35] <tiffany> it must be nearing a hundred
[02:25:22] <zwarich> anyways program logics with decision procedures exist that can handle most of these data structures
[02:25:48] <zwarich> they can tell you that your invariants are preserved or generate a counter example

[03:03:19] <tiffany> oh my
[03:03:49] <tiffany> as for myself, for the longest time I was unable to run a project locally, so I had to push to a test server in order to test my changes
[03:04:05] <tiffany> I eventually discovered that the reason I couldn't run the binary locally was because it had to be in a super specific place

[04:38:43] <eddyb> it makes sense, but they're shitting over ergonomics
[04:38:56] <theme> eddyb, btw you should properly qualify "they"
[04:39:10] <theme> don't just get angry over everyone ^_^
[04:39:16] <eddyb> theme: fuck everyone

[04:39:54] <eddyb> I have to make an effort to not explode like strcat used to
[04:39:57] <Yurume> :<
[04:40:12] <eddyb> are you fine with breaking changes? then do it right
[04:40:16] <Yurume> (I don't think this is an usual symbol for subtyping?)
[04:40:26] <eddyb> and stop pretending you can encode lints in the type system
[04:40:49] <eddyb> you can't even use size_of at compile time
[04:40:57] <theme> well... Copy exists due to the ergonomics, any way
[04:41:10] <eddyb> theme: no
[04:41:12] <theme> IMHO
[04:41:29] <eddyb> Copy encodes language semantics
[04:41:41] <theme> eddyb, I mean that semantics that help with ergonomics
[04:41:52] <theme> Let me clarify that
[04:41:52] <eddyb> having it being minimally restrictive is good, but misses problematic cases
[04:41:59] <eddyb> we have lints for the problematic cases
[04:42:02] <theme> "implicit copy exists due to the ergonomics"
[04:42:07] <eddyb> or even nice semantics
[04:42:16] <eddyb> like with for, we can sometimes borrow mutably
[04:42:25] <cmr> WindowsBunny: how did you miss the COLOR_* constants from user32?
[04:42:45] <eddyb> cmr: WindowsBunny has all the colors already, what are you talking about :P?

[04:43:05] <WindowsBunny> cmr: Because I haven't actually gone through most of the headers fully
[04:43:11] <cmr> WindowsBunny: bindgen!!!
[04:43:12] <WindowsBunny> cmr: Most of the stuff is added as desired
[04:43:21] <cmr> bindgen :|

[04:43:38] <theme> Actually, red, green, blue, yellow
[04:43:40] <theme> WindowsBunny, ^
[04:43:43] <WindowsBunny> cmr: The last time I tried to use rust-bindgen on the microsoft headers, it errored and gave up

[04:44:07] * theme detects bad mood
[04:44:08] <eddyb> but no, that would make me look bad. very bad
[04:44:20] <Yurume> eddyb: I think Copy is basically an encoding of "primitive" semantics in the type system, no?
[04:44:28] <eddyb> Yurume: yeah
[04:44:37] <theme> Yurume, eddyb, yes. Like java for some types
[04:44:39] <eddyb> Yurume: but people are misusing it in lieu of lints
[04:44:46] <eddyb> fuck having to be polite to terrible things people write
[04:44:50] <eddyb> the people might not be terrible
[04:45:01] <eddyb> but sometimes they just write crap on the internet
[04:45:09] <Yurume> I do think that Copy is too much used than absolutely needed
[04:45:10] <eddyb> and you can't call it what it is
[04:45:18] <Yurume> but as long as it is not *incorrect*, I'm fine with that
[04:45:25] <theme> eddyb, btw most people didn't even mention lints
[04:45:43] <theme> oh... wait
[04:45:52] <eddyb> theme: any type which is Pod but not Copy is encoding a lint in the type system
[04:46:08] <theme> you want a `no_copy` lint?
[04:46:16] <eddyb> theme: no
[04:46:21] <eddyb> I want a lint for large copies
[04:46:35] <eddyb> and some of the smarter solutions for iterators
[04:46:36] <theme> lint for a Copy impl for large types?
[04:46:41] <eddyb> theme: no!
[04:46:45] <eddyb> the Copy impl is fine
[04:46:46] <theme> ???
[04:47:14] <theme> apparently, you have a slightly irregular way of thinking about Copy
[04:47:26] <eddyb> you can't make [u8; 100] Copy, and leave it off for[u8; 512]
[04:47:49] <eddyb> the implementations are fine
[04:47:52] <eddyb> they should be maximal
[04:47:57] <Yurume> eddyb: isn't that part just a limitation of the current type system?
[04:47:58] <eddyb> theme: you can lint *copies* of large types
[04:48:02] <eddyb> Yurume: not really
[04:48:05] <theme> eddyb, what about isize?
[04:48:08] <eddyb> I could give better examples
[04:48:10] <Yurume> is that supposed to be intentional?
[04:48:11] <theme> how many bytes is that?
[04:48:26] <eddyb> you can lint *unoptimized copies*
[04:48:28] <theme> btw you count copied bytes, right?
[04:48:29] <Yurume> I don't think so, [[[u8; 16]; 16]; 16] is 4KB and still Copy afaik
[04:48:57] <eddyb> Yurume: I still may want to Copy it
[04:49:08] <theme> eddyb, .clone()?
[04:49:16] <eddyb> theme: .clone() is implemented in terms of Copy, so no
[04:49:30] <eddyb> also, constants
[04:49:31] <eddyb> *sigh*
[04:49:34] <eddyb> Yurume: I explained this in my reddit post
[04:49:44] <eddyb> Yurume: you can be very smart, precise, correct *if you use lints*
[04:49:47] <theme> Except that I don't understand
[04:49:52] <eddyb> if you try to encode lints in the type system
[04:49:54] <eddyb> it's very limited
[04:50:03] <eddyb> and it limits valid code
[04:50:06] <eddyb> for *no* fucking reason
[04:50:11] <eddyb> it's like being mean
[04:50:14] <eddyb> why would you be mean?
[04:50:25] <eddyb> when you have the better choice of being nice
[04:50:36] <eddyb> it's less mental overhead on Copy impls

[04:51:18] <Yurume> oh indeed, you exactly pointed out that [u8; 1 << 31] is still Copy
[04:51:20] <c74d> (Lints are... the compiler passes that generate warnings?)
[04:51:28] <Yurume> yes.
[04:51:39] <eddyb> c74d: or errors
[04:51:41] <Yurume> more accurately, "static analyses" that are not type system.
[04:52:01] <theme> eddyb, ok... so where do you want your lint to activate?
[04:52:03] <Yurume> (lifetimes, OTOH, are a part of the type system.)
[04:52:14] <theme> at the copy? at the Copy impl?
[04:52:28] <eddyb> theme: at the copy
[04:52:50] <theme> eddyb, is it measured by the number of bytes copied?
[04:52:56] <eddyb> you can do that
[04:53:10] <theme> eddyb, in that case, there are problems with isize on different systems
[04:53:16] <theme> and backwards-compatibility
[04:53:17] <eddyb> you can't do that if you mess with the Copy impl instead of actual uses
[04:53:18] <Yurume> eddyb: my prime concern on Copy is that the incorrect impl of Copy has to be prohibited by other means than the type system, which makes me sad
[04:53:33] <eddyb> Yurume: incorect copy == pointers?
[04:53:40] <Yurume> so it really is a special kind of traits that are not generalized
[04:53:47] <Yurume> probably.
[04:53:59] <Yurume> (I cannot think of other examples)
[04:54:09] <eddyb> reddit comment should include "pointers shouldn't be Copy"
[04:54:14] <Yurume> yup
[04:54:17] <eddyb> (even if you might be able to implicitely copy them)

[04:54:58] <theme> eddyb, what should implement Copy?
[04:55:03] <theme> in your idea
[04:55:09] <eddyb> theme: everything that would be Pod
[04:55:10] <Yurume> at an expense of more clone() calls (that will be optimized out anyway), we get the coherent set of safe traits and unsafe traits and nothing else
[04:55:22] <theme> eddyb, and what "would be Pod"?
[04:55:26] <theme> everything that can?
[04:56:18] <eddyb> theme: Pod is defined pretty clearly in the RFC
[04:57:15] <theme> eddyb, should something that currently holds only data, but *might* carry `Vec<T>` in the future, implement Pod?
[04:57:33] <eddyb> theme: no, but such cases usually also have destructors already
[04:58:26] <theme> eddyb, what about Range?
[04:58:42] <eddyb> theme: why would Range ever be anything more than a pair?
[04:59:00] <eddyb> or do you mean iterators being copyable in general?

[05:00:04] <theme> eddyb, what happens if you do `while let Some(x) = foo.next() {...}`?

[05:00:18] <Yurume> ?
[05:00:56] <eddyb> Yurume: don't think so. Pod would be an unsafe trait

[05:03:55] <cmr> that's basically the only operation I *really* care about
[05:03:58] <WindowsBunny> cmr: But OsString on Windows uses wtf-8 internally

[05:04:20] <cmr> Fine, how do I get *anything* I can get a pointer out of?
[05:04:24] <WindowsBunny> We could do .to_utf16 and .to_utf16_with_null

[05:04:41] <WindowsBunny> myosstr.encode_wide().collect::<Vec<_>>()
[05:04:46] <WindowsBunny> cmr: like that :D

[05:04:49] <cmr> really?
[05:04:56] <WindowsBunny> yeah
[05:05:00] <eddyb> Yurume: but it's missing the part where Copy's lint duties are offloaded to real, useful, *lints*

[05:05:05] <Yurume> eddyb: ah, okay.

[05:05:54] <eddyb> Yurume: while they want two traits
[05:05:56] <Yurume> yeah, that is understandable
[05:05:57] <eddyb> for no real good reason
[05:06:00] <theme> eddyb, there are edge cases like this: http://is.gd/1ZiNFX
[05:06:00] <WindowsBunny> cmr: in fact, the rust installer bundles the docs
[05:06:10] <eddyb> theme: *sigh*
[05:06:12] <WindowsBunny> cmr: We just don't host them online
[05:06:17] <WindowsBunny> but we let you download them
[05:06:29] <eddyb> theme: nobody writes code like that, let's be serious
[05:07:02] <eddyb> it's worse if you write foo().next() and don't realize you're calling it *every iteration*

[05:35:05] <theme> did you mean {(...)}?
[05:35:10] <eddyb> no

[05:35:25] <eddyb> {...} is a block expression
[05:35:59] <eddyb> and that was written before the current vec! macro, I believe

[05:36:31] <eddyb> that doc is bad because it doesn't exemplify blocks

[05:37:20] <eddyb> ($val.0) works fine
[05:37:22] <eddyb> the block is extra
[05:37:46] <eddyb> if you're trying to make me see a problem where a beginner might confuse macro syntax
[05:37:52] <eddyb> theme: I'm sorry, but that's too hard
[05:38:09] <eddyb> and the docs are totally bad
[05:38:19] <eddyb> best practices, yo
[05:38:37] <theme> I was talking about the Copy and Iterator, I think
[05:39:02] <eddyb> if you use `for` loops and not try to shoot yourself in the foot
[05:39:14] <eddyb> then we can provide less problematic semantics for that
[05:39:28] <theme> eddyb, there are legitimate reasons to use `while let`
[05:39:30] <theme> in this case
[05:39:36] <theme> such as peek()
[05:40:07] <eddyb> theme: those same reasons happen to overlap with "non-exclusive mutable borrows of an lvalue iterator in for loops"
[05:40:18] <eddyb> what exactly was wrong with those?
[05:40:23] <eddyb> I understand implementation screwups
[05:40:39] <theme> Copy make those problems very very hard to find
[05:41:20] <eddyb> no
[05:42:10] <eddyb> the problem is for loops look like they might be mutating an iterator (when they're not passed a collection)
[05:42:22] <eddyb> when they're actually pretty dumb about it
[05:43:47] <eddyb> theme: we're taking Copy off of some times as a large hammer/rug to cover up other problems
[05:44:25] <theme> eddyb, isn't that an easy way to detect hard problems?

[05:45:19] <eddyb> theme: you're coming up with artificial examples
[05:45:32] <eddyb> that can be solved with saner for loop semantics
[05:45:36] <theme> Ok...
[05:45:50] <theme> maybe it's just me that doesn't understand when stuff are copied
[05:45:58] <theme> eddyb, when are things copied, any way?
[05:46:00] <eddyb> theme: using an lvalue as an rvalue
[05:46:13] <eddyb> is when a move/copy happens (depending on whether the type is Copy or not)
[05:46:23] <theme> eddyb, what about autoref?
[05:47:03] <eddyb> how is that at all relevant?
[05:47:35] <eddyb> {x} for example always takes an rvalue x, and will move/copy out of x if it's an lvalue
[05:47:39] <eddyb> that's what I'm talking about
[05:47:39] <theme> (0..10).next()
[05:47:43] <theme> does that copy?
[05:47:46] <eddyb> no
[05:48:05] <theme> wait, I confused l and r
[05:48:14] * theme somehow mentally parsed lvalue as "literal value"
[05:49:01] <theme> hmm

[16:56:27] <a5i> WindowsBunny, tiffany, are you implying I shouldnt learn ruby ?
[16:56:43] <tiffany> go for it, I guess
[16:57:08] <a5i> I'm open to debate if I shouldnt
[16:57:17] <tiffany> my experience with ruby is that it has never-ending performance problems
[16:57:22] <a5i> I want to improve my webdev stack, Ruby seemed like something I need to know
[16:57:36] <tiffany> it may be pretty close to python on benchmarks, but every ruby application I've run has ended up chewing tons of CPU and having huge latencies
[16:57:53] <Astrum|Lap> ruby is useful in things other than webdev
[16:57:54] <tiffany> and everyone agrees that ruby runs pretty slow in real applications
[16:57:55] <a5i> depends on the platform also
[16:58:48] <Astrum|Lap> the one complaint I have about ruby in the webdev area is it's pretty much non-stop magic
[16:59:03] <Astrum|Lap> you kind of have to dig deep to understand it
[16:59:20] <a5i> Ruby, right out of the box isnt concurrent, but runs fine
[16:59:40] <a5i> if you dig deep like Astrum said, you can have 1 billion views per month
[17:00:33] <tiffany> my experience with discourse is that in development mode it took over a second per page load and in production it just errored out
[17:00:51] <a5i> tiffany, when?
[17:01:00] <tiffany> twitter had enough trouble with ruby that they switched to scala
[17:01:06] <cmr> a5i: that's only 386 requests per second.
[17:01:07] <tiffany> it was a long time ago
[17:01:16] <cmr> (for 30 days)
[17:01:21] <tiffany> I thought that seemed kind of low, cmr
[17:02:04] <Astrum|Lap> they switched to scala?
[17:02:09] <Astrum|Lap> that's... silly
[17:02:12] <a5i> tiffany, yeah a long time ago, they fixed alot of stuff
[17:02:19] <cmr> if you have 8 cores, that's 49 requests per second, which is *well* within the reach of even fairly slow code.
[17:02:31] <a5i> also Twitter didnt use Rails correctly, but still use it today in some parts

[17:02:56] <tiffany> I don't really like going down the rabbit hole of "correct" usage
[17:02:57] <cmr> writing code at scale in anything but the most efficient manner possible is ecologically irresponsible.
[17:03:24] <a5i> Then what should I learn instead of Ruby...
[17:03:27] <tiffany> cmr: and fiscally irresponsible
[17:03:36] <cmr> a5i: I'm not saying you shouldn't learn Ruby
[17:03:46] <a5i> Ruby/RaILS has a pretty big market share
[17:03:56] <cmr> In my opinion, stressing out over learning something is pointless, just spend a month learning it and then move on.
[17:03:57] <a5i> its still #1 framework in webdev
[17:03:58] <tiffany> how many servers does it take for it to be worth a programmer?
[17:04:11] <tiffany> about 4 dedis, I would imagine?
[17:04:21] <tiffany> no, more than that
[17:04:25] <tiffany> well, depends on salary
[17:04:34] <tiffany> and on the dedi
[17:05:22] <cmr> I think Ruby's worth knowing, even if just for the large amounts of code written in it that one might want to send a patch to...
[17:06:09] <tiffany> I'll go easy and say it's a $400/month dedi and a $100k/year programmer, in that case the programmer is worth 20 servers

[17:24:35] <mrmonday> crap.
[17:25:04] <mrmonday> on the other hand, if you get 20 you automatically have a deep understanding of category theory
[17:25:23] <mrmonday> which is pretty cool, but you do lose the ability to have a coherent conversation about anything CS related

[17:26:48] <tiffany> the compiler generates all your sql, html, css, javascript, and inter-site links, and makes sure they're valid
[17:27:18] <barosl> Yeah, that's what I heard. But I cannot even imagine how it can happen in real world
[17:27:28] <lahwran> urweb?
[17:27:31] <lahwran> is that like urbit?
[17:27:36] <tiffany> no
[17:27:40] <lahwran> oh
[17:27:46] <lahwran> I was wondering what the web would look like in urbit
[17:27:57] <barosl> Maybe something like Haskell's Clay + Blaze but more advanced?
[17:28:08] <tiffany> the language is ur and the /web is (one of?) its standard library
[17:28:20] <tiffany> I don't know what clay and blaze are
[17:28:34] <tiffany> I am pretty familiar with generating SQL from a type-safe representation
[17:28:59] <barosl> Yeah, they are type-safe versions of CSS and HTML repsectively
[17:29:40] <lahwran> type safe css, eh?
[17:29:43] <barosl> So the missing piece that Ur might have implemented would be the interconnection between type-safe representations of the existing web technologies
[17:29:44] <lahwran> how does *that* work?
[17:30:18] <barosl> It just has several keys and values that are applicable to an element

[17:44:19] <mrmonday> though the new ones look terrible

[17:55:13] <cmr> mrmonday: doesn't look like it

[22:31:39] <flan3002> Those look neat though...
[22:32:28] <flan3002> I'm wondering what they consider "entry-level" problems...
[22:36:12] <flan3002> Ugh, why do I even update? Nothing /ever/ compiles with dependencies... -.-
[22:37:02] <XMPPwocky> lol
[22:37:05] <XMPPwocky> last time i updated
[22:37:12] <XMPPwocky> one of my dependencies started triggering an ICE
[22:37:14] <XMPPwocky> that was fun
[22:38:46] <flan3002> "Oh, neat, an ICE. I had nothing else to do than tracking down why this happens, and I'm totally not getting frustrated by this breakage."
[22:39:28] <fmtq> it's the new freemium model
[22:39:33] <GaryOak_> Does ICE stand for Internal Compiler Error?
[22:39:39] <fmtq> they push a specific breakage to you hoping you will fix it
[22:39:51] <XMPPwocky> lo
[22:39:52] <fmtq> "you're already invested in yoru codebase, now fix the compiler >:]"
[22:40:11] <eddyb_> well
[22:40:16] <eddyb_> it worked for me
[22:40:30] <eddyb_> asm! wasn't integrated properly with the borrow checker and whatnot
[22:40:54] <eddyb_> now I clean lots of shit in the compiler
[22:41:07] <eddyb_> I can stop any time I want
[22:41:10] <eddyb_> but do I want to stop?
[22:41:23] <eddyb_> fmtq: forget nerd sniping
[22:41:48] <eddyb_> fmtq: make something ugly and watch perfectionists turn it into a work of art

[22:45:38] <Gankro> To show a function is surjective you just find its roots right???
[22:46:17] <tiffany> ICEs are fun
