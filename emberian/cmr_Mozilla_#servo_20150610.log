[01:36:58] <pcwalton> cascading is 1x,1.82x,3.77x on x86 and 1x,1.92x,3.68x on ARM

[01:37:15] <mwu> nope! just ./mach test
[01:37:18] <pcwalton> I guess what isn't scaling is flow construction?
[01:37:27] <pcwalton> perhaps it's all the atomic ops in there

[01:38:20] <mwu> larsberg: in which case, the cpu layout tests all pass

[05:51:13] <Manishearth> If it's owned we're fine
[05:51:25] <Manishearth> wait no
[05:51:35] <njn> owned, I think
[05:51:52] <Manishearth> okay
[05:51:57] <Manishearth> njn: where exactly?
[05:52:27] <Manishearth> found it
[05:52:28] <njn> Manishearth: LocalLayoutContext, which is stored in TLS; it contains RefCell fields
[05:52:47] <Manishearth> njn: hm
[05:53:06] <Manishearth> njn: this could cause panics. Perhaps. Need to be a bit careful. But we don't need to think about that now really
[05:53:12] <SimonSapin> Manishearth: re cascade() doing something clever, what line of code?
[05:54:18] <Manishearth> SimonSapin: the use of intrinsics::discrimimant_value()
[05:54:48] <Manishearth> SimonSapin: basically the whole function\
[05:54:51] <Manishearth> https://github.com/servo/servo/blob/542519ebfd073662bc9421ac5fa0aa01ebc0d6fe/components/style/viewport.rs#L276
[05:55:57] <njn> Manishearth: I could not add that impl for RefCell, so that anyone who wants to measure a RefCell field has to explicitly call borrow() and thus think it over?
[05:57:54] <Manishearth> njn: ?
[05:58:05] <Manishearth> why couldn't you add the impl?
[05:58:17] <njn> Manishearth: I was *able* to, but perhaps I should not?
[05:58:18] <Manishearth> you need to add it in mem.rs
[05:58:23] <Manishearth> njn: nah, add it
[05:58:36] <njn> eh, ok
[05:58:50] <Manishearth> njn: it will only crash if we try to measure memory whilst someone else is writing to the refcell
[05:58:57] <njn> yes
[05:59:08] <Manishearth> our refcell usage generally doesn't have borrows that go on for a long time
[06:01:43] <njn> what could possibly go wrong :P
[06:01:51] <njn> still, that's life with RefCell, I guess
[06:01:56] <Manishearth> hah
[06:02:15] <Manishearth> eh, it crashes during a memory measurement; not a major concern. refcell iseeus can be debugged easily
[06:02:20] <Manishearth> ... usually

[06:08:45] <SimonSapin> Manishearth: oh, in viewport.rs. I was thinking of properties.rs. Anyway, the idea is that you can have multiple declarations for the same descriptor, but only the one with the higher cascading order will win
[06:09:10] <SimonSapin> there is no selector specificity or !important in @viewport, so the cascading order is just the source order
[06:10:24] <Manishearth> ah
[06:10:39] <Manishearth> SimonSapin: are you usign the discriminant to give priority? because ... don't
[06:11:01] <SimonSapin> Manishearth: no, the discriminant is just to tell which descriptor it is
[06:11:38] <SimonSapin> it’s the hashmap key, the all cascade separately

[10:07:26] <cmr> if it's not tested, it's broken!
[10:08:11] <nox> Everything is broken until property-based testing becomes more popular then.

[10:58:45] <jgraham> Maybe I should get it translated to latin and put on a coat of arms
[10:58:50] <zmike> "everything is broken after I'm done with it" has been mine for years
[10:59:28] <zmike> a coat of arms is much classier than my bumper sticker
[11:00:14] <jgraham> "
[11:00:17] <jgraham> "omnia dissipatus est"
[11:00:28] <jgraham> I think that sounds suitable :)
[11:02:32] <eddyb> jgraham: "everything is dissipated"?
[11:02:41] <eddyb> that's what Romanian latin-guessing goes
[11:02:46] <eddyb> s/what/how
[11:02:57] * jgraham is just trusting Google translate
[11:03:16] <eddyb> presumably there's not much choice in latin for "destroyed"
[11:03:38] <eddyb> jgraham: there's "fractus"
[11:03:41] <zmike> I think if you went with words like "crushed" or "smashed" you'd get a better translation
[11:03:56] <eddyb> infractus
[11:03:57] <eddyb> broken, weakened, affected, broken into, impaired, humble
[11:04:07] <zmike> nice
[11:04:08] <eddyb> so "omnia infractus est"
[11:04:30] <eddyb> makes me think of broken bones TBQH
[11:04:42] <zmike> sure, but in relation to code
[11:05:34] <eddyb> (there's 17 translations of "broken" according to google translate. I didn't think that much of latin)

[16:27:51] <mbrubeck> SimonSapin: Could you review https://github.com/servo/unicode-bidi ? I'm just starting to write the Servo code to integrate it into our inline layout, but the crate itself should be ready for review.  It's only about 500 lines if you exclude tests and comments.
[16:28:49] <Ms2ger> Calling smontagu :)
[16:29:25] <mbrubeck> I'm not sure I want Gecko hackers seeing how un-optimized my naive code is.  :)
[16:31:15] <Ms2ger> Wait, you don't run the tests yet? :)
[16:31:52] <mbrubeck> Not yet!  But it's next on my to-do list
[16:32:27] <mbrubeck> Though first I want to get at least a proof-of-concept Servo integration, so I can make sure that the whole architecture makes sense before investing any more into it.
[16:34:13] <mwu> larsberg: got osx working
[16:34:39] <mwu> osx mangles its c++ a little bit differently, and I had to turn off jemalloc in SM
[16:37:08] <larsberg> mwu: excellent! let me know if you need me to re-run WPT/CSS/etc. tests on the linux or mac builders
[16:37:35] <mwu> larsberg: sure. going to run all that locally first though so maybe this afternoon if I'm lucky
[16:38:34] <Manishearth> mwu: I thought c++ mangling was specced?
[16:38:50] <Ms2ger> mwu, so did we decide on what to do about JSRef?

[16:39:41] <mwu> Manishearth: but AFAICT, osx has different typedefs for int64_t/uint64_t than glibc

[16:42:35] <eddyb> mwu: the long vs long long issue on x64?
[16:43:07] <mwu> Ms2ger: currently punting on that, but I think we should eliminate the RawLayout*Helpers and make sure layout functions only call methods defined on LayoutJS
[16:44:13] <mwu> eddyb: IIRC on glibc, it tries to use long int for int64_t, and on osx it uses long long
[16:44:58] <mwu> glibc uses long long on 32 bit though, so I'm going to blame glibc for this

[22:40:44] <pcwalton> wow, getting an element's ID from layout requires 5 memory barriers
[22:40:48] <pcwalton> that seems… a little excessive
[22:43:18] <pcwalton> holy cow, getting an element's ID is really expensive in script
[22:43:29] <pcwalton> most of our selector matching is in there
[22:44:16] <pcwalton> paging Ms2ger
[22:44:20] <pcwalton> or anyone who knows DOM stuff
[22:45:07] <pcwalton> we do linear search to find each attribute and that seems excessive
[22:45:44] <gw> id/class is special cased though right?
[22:45:55] <pcwalton> not in get_id()

[22:49:18] <pcwalton> gw: it looks like class is, but id isn't
[22:49:29] <pcwalton> well, that's gonna hurt :)
[22:49:37] <pcwalton> shouldn't we be using some kind of hash table for attributes?
[22:49:44] <gw> pcwalton: ah, that might be what I remembered seeing. should be an easy win
[22:49:56] <pcwalton> I don't know anything about how the DOM is implemented in Gecko but that seems like it should be an obvious win

[22:50:19] <gw> pcwalton: I wonder if a hash table is going to lose to a linear array since they are (I assume) typically small and the memory indirection might outweigh the linear search?
[22:51:25] <fabrice> pcwalton: pretty sure we have a hash table for ids in gecko
[22:52:16] <pcwalton> gw: yeah, quite possibly
[22:52:17] <gw> oh, I see, for the id lookup itself. yea that makes sense
[22:52:21] <pcwalton> also attribute selectors are relatively rare
[22:52:31] <njn> gw: can you give a "@bors-servo: r+" in #6309? Something went wrong at the merge step, so I rebased and repushed my branch; hopefully it'll work this time
[22:52:31] <crowbot> Issue #6309: Instrument FreeType allocations. - https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/6309
[22:53:41] <gw> njn: done. I think it probably got confused by the direct push/revert to servo earlier

[23:04:10] <gw> pcwalton: how big is the bloom filter structure?
[23:04:21] <pcwalton> gw: pretty big I think. memset dominates the profile
[23:04:30] <pcwalton> take_task_local_bloom_filter constantly memsets it out I think
[23:04:33] <pcwalton> we should not do that
[23:05:07] *** Quits: jviereck (Adium@moz-l8ebtf.sfo1.mozilla.com) (Quit: Leaving.)
[23:05:19] <gw> pcwalton: ah. that might be improved if we can enable neon memset a bit

[23:05:49] *** Joins: rohinpatel (rohinpatel@moz-ed0fdd.resnet.ubc.ca)
[23:06:01] <pcwalton> I think there's no need to memset -- if we're really concerned about making sure we don't drop the bloom filter twice on unwind (why we would I'm not sure -- why drop it at all?) then we should just set a boolean flag
[23:06:21] <nmatsakis> ok so -- I tweaked my improved caching around trait matching, brought down script crate compilation time (locally) from 7:30m to 5:00m
[23:06:27] <pcwalton> \o/
[23:06:28] <nmatsakis> I'll try to open a PR soon...
[23:06:36] <nmatsakis> (I havent' done more profiling to see if there's more to be had...)
[23:06:44] <gw> \o/
[23:06:46] <pcwalton> that's a 50% improvement
[23:07:05] <nmatsakis> yeah, not bad
[23:07:48] <nmatsakis> gotta go...just wanted to mention that before I run off :) (just saw the numbers...)

[23:17:49] <Savago> This is interesting. If I edit /boot/config.txt and add framebuffer_depth=32 rust-layers succeed to get a configuration and servo gets to a point where it actually opens a window. Then it will exit with ‘x error code=42 major=0 minior0’.
[23:19:29] <pcwalton> can I put an Atom in a static?
[23:19:31] <gw> Savago: if you place a breakpoint here https://github.com/servo/glutin/blob/servo/src/x11/window/mod.rs#L30 you'll be able to see which X call is failing
[23:19:56] <Savago> gw: I will try it.
[23:20:30] <gw> pcwalton: it should be safe if it's a static atom (i.e. exists in the static hash table). if that doesn't work, we can probably make it work

[23:49:38] <pcwalton> removing the bloom filter didn't make selector matching scale better, but it did make it take less time, which means that overall we may scale better than before since the other parts of style recalc scale better

[23:52:56] <pcwalton> argh, forgot to make something private in a crate upstream of script :(
[23:53:17] <pcwalton> njn: yes, but not well (60% improvement over sequential on 4 cores)
[23:53:42] <pcwalton> overall, I have style recalc at a 2x improvement on 4 cores on ARM, but it's 2.3x with 4 cores on x86
[23:54:05] <pcwalton> it seems that the problem in style recalc is selector matching
[23:54:17] <pcwalton> this stuff is really tricky to measure since it's kind of a global problem
[23:54:40] <pcwalton> layout seems good though -- 2.41x on x86, 2.55x on ARM
