[03:47:23] <dougxxx> Looks kind of like traits to me.
[03:47:40] <frozendevil> a class declares itself as conforming to a protocol, which doesn't really say anything about implementation
[03:47:54] <o11c> frozendevil: if you implement that behavior, you have *an* implementation of the trait
[03:47:57] <dougxxx> That's what a trait does. 
[03:47:59] <frozendevil> traits, from what I understand, take a type and add a specific method to them
[03:48:03] <o11c> no
[03:48:16] <o11c> a trait is an interface - a collection of methods
[03:48:34] <dougxxx> to be fair #[deriving()] does though
[03:48:35] <cmr> possibly with default implementations, that don't need to be specified in concrete impl's
[03:48:37] <o11c> you impl a trait for a class by providing bodies for the methods that don't
[03:48:54] <frozendevil> ok, that makes sense

[03:50:24] <frozendevil> well, the root of my question comes from the Sprocket NES talk where he said that the only solution to making the opcode table was using macros
[03:50:37] <dougxxx> havvy: you have to import the trait into the current scope to pick which one to use.
[03:51:17] <Havvy> Does `Trait.method(implementor, ...args)` work?

[04:33:47] <cmr> Eridius: this is true of computation, though, not just io
[04:33:57] <Eridius> except that computation is doing something useful with its time
[04:33:59] <ChrisMorgan> (By live TCP upgrades, I meant upgrades of a program while keeping all existing TCP connections open.)
[04:34:05] <Eridius> blocking on I/O is just tying up resources without actually using them
[04:34:32] <Eridius> ChrisMorgan: I would assume you could do something using libnative, at the least by using libc and the underlying fds
[04:34:45] <cmr> I had an example in mind when I said "blocking in a green task can make sense" but I can't remember anymore, and anything I try to reconstruct doesn't make sense.
[04:34:56] * Eridius assumes libnative provides a way to wrap fds back up in the I/O objects, but that may not necessarily be true
[04:35:09] * ChrisMorgan will require live upgrading in the future
[04:36:27] <Eridius> ChrisMorgan: hrm, native::io::net::TcpStream does not provide any way to create one from an fd. I think if you can add that (or file a ticket for someone else to add it), then you should be able to do what you want
[04:36:29] <o11c> ChrisMorgan: using libnative and low-level I/O, it's definitely possible. Just avoid the equivalent of the FILE* wrapper
[04:36:44] <Eridius> and of course the equivalent on TcpListener/TcpAcceptor (not sure what the difference is between those two)
[04:37:00] <Eridius> or of course you could just use libc directly and avoid the Rust wrappers
[04:37:25] <ChrisMorgan> One would, I expect, write a library to do such live upgrading conveniently.

[04:38:04] <cmr> I presume such things would live in the future libos
[04:39:16] <ChrisMorgan> Managing state across an upgrade could be difficult and would, I suppose, require deep knowledge of the ability to restart, or only having short-lived connections, if it were a server, so that you can just stop accepting new connections while you clear the current queue, then restart and start accepting again.
[04:39:45] * ChrisMorgan wants to write an decent object database like ZODB in Rust
[04:40:07] <cmr> or ideally, send the listening fd to the new process so *it* can seamlessly handle new connectinos while you flush the old.

[04:57:58] <o11c> I usually do 2 levels of indentation - one for the () of foo, and one for the {} of the lambda
[04:58:07] <sfackler> extra lines in function calls are usually indented
[04:58:12] <sfackler> foo(something,
[04:58:17] <sfackler>     something_else);
[04:58:17] <Eridius> I never add two levels of indentation across a single newline
[04:58:37] <Eridius> if I hard-wrap function arguments, I indent to the level of the first argument, but that doesn't hold here because the newline occurs in the lambda
[04:58:45] <sfackler> and iterator chains look a bit cleaner:
[04:58:50] <sfackler> foo.map(|x| {
[04:58:55] <sfackler>         x.bar()
[04:59:00] <sfackler>     })
[04:59:07] <sfackler>     .filter(...)
[04:59:08] <Eridius> and if the close ) of the function starts a line, it has the same indentation as the function, not its argument, which means it's not indented
[04:59:10] <sfackler>     .collect();
[04:59:25] <strcat> foo.map(|x| {
[04:59:30] <strcat>     x.bar()

[05:04:38] <strcat> you have a choice between a useless blocking CSPRNG and a non-blocking one

[05:07:31] <strcat> but only featureful inits like systemd do that, not random embedded ones that are probably just bourne shell or something

[06:25:53] <mib_5ozevz> or do you have to handle it

[06:26:55] <Eridius> without proper trust, the only thing you get from gpg is an assurance that multiple emails signed with the same key were all signed by the same person (assuming proper security of private keys)

[06:27:36] <Eridius> if you have a genuine need to confirm identity, you should hold it to a higher standard of trust
[06:27:39] <strcat> Eridius: it's useful in the very real sense that if you get an email you are suspicious about, you can look back at past emails
[06:27:40] <Eridius> and confirm the key out of band

[06:28:32] <Eridius> strcat: sure, if you regularly get signed emails from someone and one day they email you without a signature, that's something that warrants extra scrutiny
[06:28:42] <strcat> or an incorrect signature
[06:29:14] <strcat> the mail client is supposed to automatically associate them and warn you if it isn't the same key

[06:30:48] <Eridius> strcat: in any case, my point is that incorrectly trusting a key is fundamentally dangerous (assuming you have a real need for signing/encrypting in the first place. If nobody's ever going to attack you, then it hardly matters)
[06:30:49] <strcat> it's simply that if you meet someone (say, me) irl, you sign each other's keys (at w/e trust level)

[06:32:23] <Eridius> strcat: yeah, sure, if I meet you irl
[06:32:27] <strcat> the arch linux package signing model has 5 trusted 'master' keys, each master key has a revoke key
[06:32:28] <Eridius> I can trust you that way
[06:32:42] <strcat> so there are 10 keys distributed among the devs that are in control
[06:32:52] <Eridius> my point is I don't want to have to worry about the trust model, because one mistake can open me up to exploitation
[06:32:54] <strcat> other keys are trusted if they have 3+ signatures
[06:33:20] <mib_5ozevz> Eridius: Please don't trust strcat unless you are encrypting your messages on this irc with his public key. kthanks
[06:33:22] <Eridius> e.g. I accidentally trust someone to sign keys that I shouldn't, and they start signing malicious keys that impersonate other people
[06:33:25] <strcat> so as an arch user, you fully trust 5 master keys, but you can install packages signed with many keys - they are managing your trust for you, since you fully trust them

[08:08:48] <huon> allocator with size pools can go straight to the pool, rather than having to have a map from pointer -> pool
[08:08:55] <companion_cube> (less things to remember in the heap structure)
[08:08:56] <huon> (or some other device for it)
[08:09:04] <huon> Yurume: for C libs, or for Rust?
[08:09:08] <Yurume> huon: I actually guess malloc-like allocator can be useful for some occasions
[08:09:09] <mib_5ozevz> is there anyway to design generic code that allows a decision to be expressed statically or dynamically... like whether to decide on an allocator statically or dynamically?
[08:09:11] <cmr> these arguments are compelling but backed up by no data.
[08:09:12] <Yurume> for Rust.
[08:09:17] <huon> because allocators will give us pluggable "malloc" in Rust
[08:09:21] <Yurume> right
[08:09:35] <huon> e.g. a Vec<T, CHeap> would be sanely C-interopable
[08:09:39] <huon> *-operable
[08:10:01] <eddyb> http://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/2213vw/reminder_t_is_not_going_away/cgiuuio?context=5
[08:10:04] <huon> we currently don't guarantee that the default allocator is malloc, so we can even change to jemalloc now
[08:10:09] <Yurume> huon: some C libs do expose the allocator interface, as they can give some allocated pointer down to the caller, so such allocator-adapters can be useful in this case
[08:10:10] <eddyb> and here I thought strcat was all serious and stuff
[08:10:22] <Yurume> not a general case though
[08:10:22] <cmr> (it even *was* jemalloc for some time)
[08:10:23] <huon> Yurume: yup (that's what I was referring to by (naive) :) )
[08:10:31] <huon> can do it for sqlite etc.
[08:10:46] <huon> cmr: I was meaning calling jemalloc symbols directly, rather than using it as a substitute for the `malloc` symbol
[08:10:55] <cmr> ah, yes.
[08:11:12] <mib_5ozevz> I remember hearing an issue about whether allocators should be part of the cstor or the type... can't we have it both ways?
[08:11:22] <cmr> mib_5ozevz: "cstor"?
[08:11:25] <huon> mib_5ozevz: I think it has to be both
[08:11:31] <huon> cmr: constructor, presumably
[08:11:33] <cmr> ah
[08:11:41] <cmr> it certainly needs to be both.
[08:11:45] <huon> mib_5ozevz: you need to store the allocator to in the type be able to free it
[08:11:59] <mib_5ozevz> huon: ?
[08:12:00] <huon> s/to in/in/
[08:12:00] <cmr> arenas have a concrete value, they aren't usably just from a type with no instance.
[08:12:13] *** Quits: alan_andrade (alan_andra@moz-8862F69E.hsd1.ca.comcast.net) (Input/output error)
[08:12:15] <huon> "you need to store the allocator in the values to be able to free it" is what I meant to say
[08:12:35] <huon> and the way to make them generic is via an allocator type parameter
[08:12:37] <Yurume> huon: well, the allocator exposed by C libs *might not be* equal to the stdlib malloc()/free(), thus it would be more like Vec<T, MallocLike> with Vec::with_allocator(MallocLike::new(malloc_fn, free_fn)) (some bikeshedding aside).

[08:12:56] <huon> Yurume: yeah, I guess it would be something like that
[08:13:04] <eddyb> huon: hmm, what about arena-allocated vectors?
[08:13:11] <eddyb> huon: incremental pushing would result in bloat :/
[08:13:13] <huon> eddyb: what about them?
[08:13:29] <eddyb> but for something like the AST, it could work well
[08:13:30] <mib_5ozevz> huon: ah. so I could make a generic allocator that even defers the decision about what allocator/logic to use until runtime if I wanted to right?
[08:13:37] <huon> eddyb: only constant multiple (about 2)
[08:13:58] <huon> eddyb: (assuming you're allocating in exponentially increasing chunks)
[08:14:23] <eddyb> huon: I was thinking, the "allocator" value would just be an unit struct that's contravariant to the lifetime of the arena, right?
[08:14:29] <huon> mib_5ozevz: yeah, theoretically you could do that via a trait object (or an enum, if you only have a fixed-at-compile-time number of allocators to choose between)
[08:14:32] <eddyb> so the entire thing acts as a &'a T

[08:14:38] <huon> eddyb: it would need a reference to the allocator, I think
[08:14:40] <huon> but yeah
[08:14:42] <eddyb> huon: why?
[08:14:43] <cmr> eddyb: erm, where is it going to put its backing store?
[08:14:51] <huon> eddyb: to be able to get memory when it needs it
[08:14:54] <eddyb> aaaah right :(
[08:15:14] <eddyb> you could still have something custom around [T], I guess
[08:15:17] <huon> Vec<T, ArenaAlloc<'a>>
[08:15:21] <huon> etc.
[08:16:56] <mib_5ozevz> What about cases like embedded architectures like AVR where you practically have to use the libc that comes with AVR?
[08:17:05] <cmr> mib_5ozevz: why do you?
[08:17:08] <eddyb> there is no libc on AVR :P
[08:17:13] <huon> mib_5ozevz: what about them?
[08:17:15] <mib_5ozevz> performance
[08:17:19] <eddyb> there couldn't be ;)
[08:17:20] <cmr> that's not true.
[08:17:26] <mcpherrin> I never use a libc on AVR :p
[08:17:29] <cmr> one can reimplement everything any libc does in pure rust.
[08:17:44] <huon> mib_5ozevz: (a generic allocator interface allows one to substitute symbols in.)
[08:17:54] <eddyb> what would libc be on AVR? you have no syscalls
[08:18:01] <eddyb> and no heap
[08:18:04] <huon> "substitute symbols" as in use the system's malloc
[08:18:22] <cmr> eddyb: avr has a libc.
[08:18:26] <cmr> eddyb: of course it has a heap.
[08:18:35] <cmr> it's the area of memory that malloc manages.
[08:18:41] <cmr> you don't need syscalls for a libc.
[08:18:47] <mib_5ozevz> but I mean can you still write a libc less rust and still be able to use a libc backend for the types in the rust lib?
[08:18:54] <huon> yes
[08:19:05] <eddyb> cmr: but then that's like a third of libc left
[08:19:05] <cmr> eddyb: http://www.nongnu.org/avr-libc/
[08:19:14] <huon> assuming we arrange the stdlib correctly
[08:19:17] <eddyb> nothing useful AFAIK
[08:19:56] <huon> eddyb: nothing useful?
[08:20:12] <eddyb> maybe I'm being a case of complete tunnel vision
[08:20:13] <cmr> I believe avr-libc is a compliant libc.
[08:20:26] <cmr> it even has streams.
[08:20:36] <eddyb> how can it be standard compliant without an OS?
[08:20:52] <cmr> .... you realize libc is designed such that it can be used without an OS?
[08:20:53] <eddyb> and with less than a page of RAM?
[08:20:57] * eddyb is confused
[08:21:08] <eddyb> (the equivalent of a x86 page, that is)
[08:21:10] <cmr> avr doesn't have a single page...
[08:21:12] <huon> eddyb: nothing here is useful? http://www.nongnu.org/avr-libc/user-manual/modules.html
[08:21:23] <cmr> eddyb: you should go find yourself a copy of the C spec :P
[08:21:31] <mib_5ozevz> lol I'm assuming rust will work on mmu-less archs
[08:21:48] <cmr> mib_5ozevz: of course.
[08:21:52] <eddyb> cmr: pretty sure POSIX requires syscalls
[08:21:56] <cmr> eddyb: not POSIX.
[08:22:00] <cmr> eddyb: C. POSIX and C are separate.
[08:22:14] <cmr> "libc" as in glibc or musl has a *lot* of crap not in the C standard
[08:22:21] <eddyb> cmr: doesn't avr-libc claim something about POSIX?
[08:22:41] <cmr> no.
[08:22:41] <Yurume> mib_5ozevz: Rust the language will work on MMU-less archs. libnative and libgreen wouldn't work though :p
[08:22:45] <eddyb> the avr/* stuff is obviously AVR specific and not part of any standard
[08:22:46] <mcpherrin> eddyb: "some additions inspired by POSIX" basically
[08:23:15] <cmr> it neither claims nor delivers on any POSIX conformance.

[15:08:17] <Tobba> its a computation represented as a series of steps... whatever that means
[15:08:22] <bstrie> companion_cube: both of those allow a new learner the opportunity to start from a base of experience, if they know what either "class" or "pointer" means

[15:09:28] <benh> companion_cube: a function is a bunch of code with an parameter list and a return type, nothing mathy about that, really
[15:09:42] <companion_cube> what's a type, benh?
[15:09:44] <bstrie> companion_cube: basing new terms off of existing terms gives us the ability to fast-track people into learning new concepts if they already understand the existing terms. it's strictly an optimization
[15:09:50] <benh> "int" or "string" or similar
[15:09:52] <Tobba> I never kinda liked functional programming because it seemed to make things 1000 times more complicated than they ever needed to be

[15:10:30] <sw17ch> Tobba: nah, it’s not the case :)

[15:11:32] <SiegeLord> In my experience, Rust helped me read Haskell a bit better ;)
[15:11:37] <Tobba> I ended up not bothering to learn it due to the syntax
[15:11:47] <sw17ch> SiegeLord: \o/
[15:11:48] <Tobba> rusts syntax is kinda bad but haskell feels pretty awful
[15:12:02] <SiegeLord> I never understood typeclasses and pattern matching until Rust showed it to me in a friendly way
[15:12:03] <sw17ch> Tobba: it’s ugly at first, but once you can see it, it makes a lot of sense
[15:12:11] <sw17ch> a lot of the core ideas in the language show up in the language
[15:12:14] <Tobba> I tried messing with it and absolutely nothing made sense
[15:12:15] <companion_cube> bstrie: I see you point, it's better to have names that give intuition, but well, we can't change everything written in almost one century of computer science
[15:12:21] <Tobba> everything had a different syntax for no appearent reason
[15:12:30] <Tobba> the lack of entropy in that thing would blow a physicists mind
[15:12:51] <SiegeLord> You mean the excess entropy? :P
[15:12:52] <sw17ch> Tobba: likely the difference in syntax is because everything is an _expression_ rather than a _statement_
[15:12:54] <companion_cube> you mean a syntax different from C?
[15:13:02] <benh> companion_cube: we happily change between method and function and subroutine and proc and whatnot between languages, I don't think we need to stick to 'monad'
[15:13:26] <sw17ch> and that leads to some odd things. expressions whos result aren’t inspected aren’t meaningful in haskell. in langauges like C, we can have statements that change the state of the system.
[15:13:27] <benh> not that i have a better alternative in mind...

[15:13:33] <bstrie> SiegeLord: indeed, I tried to use scheme back in my formative years and it traumatized me, coming from a java background. like, literally reduced me to tears. it took R to teach me all about first-class functions, and python to teach me about default arguments, and javascript to teach me about closures
[15:13:37] <sw17ch> functions with types like void foo(void); make sense
[15:13:38] <companion_cube> and remember that "lambda" is much older
[15:13:42] <Tobba> it just felt like they could never make up their mind
[15:13:53] <benh> "static method", "member function", you can use either either way imo
[15:14:02] <Tobba> there were like 3 different ways to do a multiplication which were all invalid in certain circumstances for no appearent reason at all
[15:14:02] <companion_cube> aww
[15:14:07] <Tobba> maybe I should try it again
[15:14:19] <companion_cube> "method" is really a OOP-term
[15:14:35] <benh> yeah, so really OOP-y languages use it for everything :)
[15:14:37] <bstrie> companion_cube: but, we can. we can absolutely change them. your attitude is defeatist. we've *already* changed them. rust's "lifetimes" are "regions" in the literature, a name that we consciously avoided

[15:14:49] <Tobba> yeah

[15:15:00] <sw17ch> Do you have an example?
[15:15:00] <benh> there's / division and `div` division, anyway
[15:15:02] <Tobba> iirc you could write RPN into that thing but only *sometimes*
[15:15:08] <sw17ch> oh :)
[15:15:11] <companion_cube> bstrie: agreed. Although "region" is nowhere as fundamental as "lambda" in CS
[15:15:11] <sw17ch> (*) 1 2
[15:15:13] <sw17ch> vs
[15:15:14] <sw17ch> 1 * 2
[15:15:19] <sw17ch> vs (* 1) 2
[15:15:22] <Tobba> yeah it was weirder
[15:15:28] <sw17ch> parital evaluation!
[15:15:29] <benh> Tobba: I think there's some deeper simplicity that you're missing for all the incidental syntactic complexity
[15:15:30] <sw17ch> :D
[15:15:30] <companion_cube> otoh it's going to be hard to find a name for "monad", I think

[15:15:40] <Tobba> benh: I actually get that one
[15:15:49] <bstrie> companion_cube: the point is, we design a language consciously to appeal to programmers first, and only second to computer scientists (and only where appealing to computer scientists does not interfere with the first goal)
[15:15:54] <Tobba> the second one is just pure inconsistency
[15:15:55] <sw17ch> (*) 1 2 — evaluate an operator like a function

[15:16:37] <sw17ch> Tobba: really, try it again some time.
[15:16:45] <Tobba> the logic would be so inherently convoluted that noone else could possibly understand it - do not combine with alcohol for the love of god
[15:16:45] <sw17ch> the syntax seems odd at first
[15:17:02] <sw17ch> Tobba: oddly enough, Haskell is reslient to alcohol
[15:17:12] <sw17ch> if you can’t work out the types, it won’t let you compile :)
[15:17:15] <sw17ch> much the same with Rust
[15:17:16] <sw17ch> :)
[15:17:24] <Tobba> waking up to an actually working code that you have no idea how it works is amazing
[15:17:37] <sw17ch> any way, this is #rust, not #haskell
[15:17:57] <sw17ch> but either way, i’d encourage you to try and look past syntax and try and understand why syntax is the way it is
[15:18:08] <Tobba> I actually understand the partial evaluation thing
[15:18:12] <sw17ch> often times, especially in languagues like Haskell, Rust and ML
[15:18:14] <Tobba> but iirc the syntax for say, do
[15:18:16] <Tobba> was absolutely insane
[15:18:18] <sw17ch> the syntax is explicit and meaningful

[21:35:29] <libfud> if I write it out in a file like randomstuff.rs 
[21:35:32] <libfud> it compiles fine
[21:35:49] <huon> oh, I see, if you move the `extern crate rand` to the crate root it will work
[21:35:54] <libfud> but if I put it in a module that randomstuff.rs uses, say, common/randomutils.rs
[21:35:55] <kimundi> generalelectrix: #[repr(u8)] on the enum
[21:36:04] <huon> extern crate rand introduces a new name in the current scope
[21:36:09] <huon> and use is always from the top of the crate
[21:36:26] <huon> so to be able to write `use rand::...` the `rand` name needs to be at the top of the crate
[21:36:52] <kimundi> libfud: use self::rand::... would work anywhere to access a extern crate rand; in the same module
[21:36:58] <huon> btw, it's much better to write `for _ in range(0, size) { ... }` than a manual loop with `while`

[23:51:13] <AlexMax> Why does the rustlang front page link to the nightly version of the win32 rust compiler instaed of 0.10?
[23:51:27] *** Joins: dpc (Mibbit@moz-88B014CD.nvidia.com)
[23:51:41] <dpc> Congragulations. Did I missed the 0.10 party? :D
[23:51:44] <mcpherrin> AlexMax: We recommend people use the nightlies
[23:51:56] <dpc> BTW. The libraries are still build as 0.10-pre .
[23:52:11] <AlexMax> but 0.10 was just released today...?
[23:52:41] <dpc> I'm building master from like 1 hour ago.
[23:52:56] <mcpherrin> AlexMax: The releases are really just snapshots in time, so you could use 0.10 today, but tomorrow we'd tell you to use a nightly :)
[23:53:13] <acrichto> dpc: the PR to update the versions to 0.10 was merged only very recently
[23:53:25] <AlexMax> I guess if I want a stable language I need to wait

[23:53:53] <bstrie> ChrisMorgan: in retribution for the downvotes that you received in the HKT thread, I have clarified rust's positions on monads in the /r/rust css
[23:53:53] <AlexMax> and i mean that in a sincere way, not a snide way
[23:54:08] <mcpherrin> AlexMax: Indeed, though a lot of how the language works is mostly in place now, so it's fine to learn, but I wouldn't start writing a million line code project
[23:54:14] <acrichto> bstrie: hahahaha

[23:54:29] <AlexMax> mcpherrin: What is the impetus torwards a stable release anyway?
[23:54:46] <ChrisMorgan> Both of my posts in that thread got down to 0 but they're back at 4-6 or so now.
[23:55:13] <AlexMax> as an outsider who only vaguely knows some of the potential benefits (that excite me), are the developers perhaps afraid that there's going to be this big "gotcha" post-1.0 where some assumptions just don't hold true?

[23:55:25] <AlexMax> Kind of like what happened with Go and generics.
[23:55:26] <ChrisMorgan> bstrie: but cmr points out that saying that Rust does not have monads is factually incorrect.
[23:55:47] <AlexMax> (Although afaik go developers just handwave the lack of generics away)
[23:55:51] *** Joins: lucian (lucian@moz-8408FDFA.cable.virginm.net)
[23:56:21] <AlexMax> (and the developers of go take a "Don't ask us about what we're expierimenting with in terms of generic programming")
[23:56:29] <Denommus> I'm trying to implement an entity-component system library, but I'm stuck at one point: which would be the best approach to abstract my entities, a struct or just an id that I reference in my components?
[23:57:17] <AlexMax> Seems like you would want to stick to a 0.99 release for like a year and see what real-world issues come up before going to 1.0
[23:57:38] *** Quits: lucian (lucian@moz-8408FDFA.cable.virginm.net) (Ping timeout)
[23:57:53] <Denommus> ChrisMorgan: well, but it doesn't have *general* monads
[23:58:05] <brson> AlexMax: i'm currently hoping for 1 release cycle of stability before 1.0, not 1 year
[23:58:28] <brson> figuring out the most strategic time to release is hard and all the answers are wrong

[23:58:52] <Denommus> I wouldn't think it would be a good idea to wait too long for an official release
[23:59:05] <ChrisMorgan> I suppose the priv-by-default change was done before 0.10?
[23:59:07] <Denommus> I'm excited to use it in an actual project, but my managers would never allow while it is unstable
