[03:32:13] <dougxxx> Hey, if I want to feature suggest for cargo, what's the best way? Or should I just post here?
[03:32:24] <cmr> dougxxx: here. ping wycats
[03:32:38] <dougxxx> (I just discovered how install -s in npm and bower automatically update your manifest file and pin the version you just installed; it's very cool)
[03:32:40] <cmr> although opening an issue on the repo (see topic) probably isn't a bad idea?
[03:33:36] <dougxxx> righto~

[03:42:29] <wycats> Yep
[03:43:17] <wycats> You'd want to pin the version in the lockfile and just use a semver in the manifest but that's a small detail :)
[03:43:43] <wycats> Basically cargo has a pinning story already regardless of what your versions say
