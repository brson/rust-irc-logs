[01:38:35] <bascule> haha no!
[01:38:36] <bascule> awesome
[01:38:46] <bascule> AFL looks pretty cool. I haven't tried using it though
[01:39:30] <kmc> that screenshot is from literally the first time I ran afl successfully
[01:39:39] <bascule> hahahaha
[01:39:50] <kmc> on anything, C or Rust
[01:42:27] <kmc> i'm working on building rustc itself with instrumentation
[01:43:03] <bascule> yeah that's awesome
[01:43:23] <bascule> were you still thinking of adding various memory protections (e.g. ASLR, stack canaries) to unsafe Rust?
[01:44:04] <kmc> well I think it's important to have that
[01:44:06] *** Joins: erickt (erickt@moz-l8ebtf.sfo1.mozilla.com)
[01:44:23] <kmc> and at least ASLR needs to be applied consistently to be much good

[01:44:49] <kmc> I don't know if I'll personally work on that stuff, though
[01:45:42] <eternaleye> kmc: afl.rs looks incredibly cool - once I pick up my 9p implementation again, I'm definitely going to feed it through :D

[01:46:09] <bascule> it was awesome
[01:46:34] <eternaleye> He probably got flames from people who disagreed with his read of bitcoin's politics.

[01:46:39] <bascule> lol
[01:46:42] <kmc> is it because it ignited a huge shitfest about bitcoin on reddit

[01:47:41] <bascule> because... I guess they tried to do it themselves and couldn't figure it out?

[01:47:58] <eternaleye> That way lies Bass-O-Matic

[01:48:51] <bascule> what's a differential cryptanalysis?
[01:49:13] <bascule> Sybilproofing via solving the nothing-at-stake problem is, in fact, the easy part
[01:49:15] <eternaleye> Anyone can create a problem they are incapable of solving themselves.
[01:49:38] <bascule> the hard part is creating a provable distributed consensus algorithm
[01:50:37] <bascule> https://twitter.com/bascule/status/525010557787987968
[01:50:59] <bascule> apparently someone threw that on a slide at Ricon
[01:51:06] <bascule> but yeah trying to make a cryptocurrency involves both
[01:51:55] <eternaleye> I'd really-for-serious be very interested in a social psychologist doing a comparative study of bitcoin and religion.
[01:53:06] <eternaleye> I'm seeing similar meme complexes show up in bitcoin as I see when discussing religion with people.
[01:58:46] <Ilari> Does Poe's law apply? :->
[01:59:10] <tiffany> I've never talked to anyone fanatic about bitcoin
[01:59:22] <tiffany> I do like cryptocurrencies though
[02:00:03] <eternaleye> I'm less fond of cryptocurrencies than I am of unlinkable spend protocols
[02:00:29] <eternaleye> I think cryptocurrencies, overall, wind up conflating too much of the monetary problem with the security problem.
[02:01:18] <eternaleye> Chaum-esque e-cash holds much more of my attention than stuff like bitcoin or other pure-cryptocurrencies

[02:24:28] * bascule makes a private gist for safekeeping ;)
[02:25:36] <Tobba> I want to see a cryptocurrency that uses homomorphic encryption to disguise the transaction amounts (and preferably the involved addresses)
[02:26:10] <Ilari> Are there any practical fully homomorphic encryption systems?
[02:26:35] <bascule> Tobba: that's more or less what Zerocoin is intended to do...
[02:26:37] <Tobba> not that I'm aware of, but something partially homomorphic could be enough
[02:26:45] <bascule> https://gist.github.com/tarcieri/f4cbc1a73c15b658a65f
[02:27:00] <Tobba> bascule: I thought it just obfuscated the target addresses, not the amounts
[02:27:04] <eternaleye> Sadly, though, this is a limiting factor IMO:
[02:27:06] <eternaleye> >> The plan is to make an altcoin, powered by the new Zerocash Protocol, that provides consumers with the financial privacy they expect from debit cards, credit cards, and cash.
[02:27:25] <bascule> eternaleye: where'd you read that?
[02:27:30] <bascule> I talked with Zooko about that in person
[02:27:38] <eternaleye> Bitcoin's scale protects it against 51% (and other sybil attacks) to some extent, but a new altcoin? Not so much.
[02:27:42] <eternaleye> bascule: http://zerocoin.org/
[02:27:44] <bascule> if there was an announcement I missed it
[02:27:49] <eternaleye> bascule: Very bottom, "the road ahead"
[02:27:54] <bascule> aah
[02:28:24] <bascule> Zooko's trying to get funding for a new Zerocash startup
[02:28:34] <bascule> and buying up all the Zerocoin IP from Matt Green et al
[02:28:37] <eternaleye> Zerocoin itself? Strong. Basing it in the blockchain? Has some real caveats.
[02:28:42] <bascule> lol yeah
[02:28:56] <eternaleye> I'd love to see a construction basing it in Stellar though
[02:30:35] <Ilari> Distributed consensus... It is actually harder to deal with maliscous nodes than merely bad ones, even to point of needing more redundancy.
[02:30:52] <Tobba> I went to /r/bitcoin
[02:30:54] <Tobba> I then promptly left
[02:31:16] <Tobba> that subreddit seems like one hell of a cesspool
[02:31:22] <bascule> lololol
[02:31:42] <bascule> I just work on using cryptography to pretect real money instead of Buttcoins
[02:31:55] <eternaleye> bascule: You're such a square :P
[02:31:57] <bascule> money transfers are a hard business and Buttcoin punts on all the hard problems
[02:32:04] <Tobba> I remember when the bitcoin crashed and they had a suicide hotline number in the banner
[02:32:17] <bascule> and it seems a lot of the current work is trying to reinvent what is more or less a bank
[02:32:22] <bascule> hahahahaha Tobba 
[02:32:28] <Tobba> that was funny to me
[02:32:31] <Tobba> I'm a terrible person
[02:32:57] <Tobba> I think that was when it went over $1000 and a lot of people crashed out
[02:33:04] <Tobba> so it plummed like fuck
[02:33:11] <Tobba> cashed out*
[02:33:12] <eternaleye> bascule: Part of why I like Stellar so much is it doesn't pretend to be a currency; instead it's a distributed transfer system.
[02:34:00] <bascule> yes, it's a distributed consensus protocol!
[02:34:02] <bascule> seems good
[02:34:25] <bascule> I love when I say "Distributed consensus algorithms should be designed by PhDs who are well-versed in temporal logic" or something to that effect
[02:34:29] <bascule> and the Blockchainiacs reply
[02:34:31] <bascule> WHAT ABOUT SATOSHI?
[02:34:45] <bascule> yeah, he made the world's crappiest distributed consensus algorithm that sort of seems to work?
[02:34:58] <bascule> "BUT IT'S WORLD-SCALE" yeah morons, so is Spanner
[02:35:41] <Tobba> I haven't actually seen any systems that would work on the same scale as the blockchain
[02:35:45] <Tobba> link to a paper on Spanner?
[02:40:23] <bascule> https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en/us/archive/spanner-osdi2012.pdf
[02:40:39] <bascule> I am guessing Spanner's transaction volume is probably 2 orders of magnitude higher than Bitcoin
[02:41:21] <bascule> Square actually does about an order of magnitude more transactions than Bitcoin, although our GPV is roughly equivalent
[02:41:29] <bascule> and we have a tiny infrastructure
[02:41:36] <eternaleye> bascule: A better response to "But it's world-scale" is probably "Yeah, so is X.509."
[02:41:36] <bascule> also Spanner is storing much larger data than Bitcoin

[02:43:38] <Ilari> Insertion sort was the one that is much faster with almost-sorted input than random input?
