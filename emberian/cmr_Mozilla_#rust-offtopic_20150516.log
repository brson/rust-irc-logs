[05:32:56] <eddyb> it should have results waay before it reaches pigeonhole completion

[05:34:14] <eddyb> a couple of them might be
[05:34:35] <huon> (well, not problematic, but it increases the probability of matches)
[05:34:52] <eddyb> and I didn't have an easy time picking some of the answers because multiple ones could have fit
[05:35:40] <eddyb> taking 100% and assigning parts of ot to each answer seems like a potential next step

[11:05:43] <Havvy> huon:  Only time that's happened for me is when a dependency updated and failed to properly follow SemVer.
[11:07:31] <huon> this appears to be caused by `cargo test` followed by `cargo bench`
[11:08:33] <huon> but, ooh, yeah, travis and I have different versions of deps
[11:15:30] <eddyb> Rust 1.0 is not unlike FDA approving a HIV vaccine
[11:16:15] <eddyb> I would pick something from the past but FDA is newer than the first vaccines

[11:23:52] * huon is dumb
[11:27:44] <Havvy> huon:  What was it?
[11:29:50] <huon> Havvy: integer overflow that was only trigger by a benchmark
[11:30:07] <huon> of course, `cargo bench` disables debug assertions so it wasn't picked up then

[11:30:23] <Havvy> Ah.
[11:31:01] <huon> but `cargo test` will now run benchmarks as tests, but I wasn't running `cargo test` with the right flags to pick up the benches
[11:31:06] <huon> (locally)
[11:31:26] <huon> I'm dumb because I should read the travis logs properly, which would've told me this straight away :P
[11:31:45] <Havvy> Ah, yeah. Always read the logs.

[13:25:47] <Havvy> I don't /like/ using IRC OP powers. But sometimes they are what is called for.

[13:28:36] <Havvy> Mutabah:  I'd expect Freenode to have more people doing this to be honest, if it wasn't for the fact that this behavior is something I've only seen by one person.
[13:29:03] <Mutabah> Havvy: I was going to say (before -osdev) that #osdev on freenode sometimes gets spammers
[13:29:23] <Mutabah> Not often though, the network opers are usually on it pretty quickly
[13:29:26] <mrmonday> I also believe most of the channels on freenode which get hit hard have bots which handle basic spam like the above automatically
[13:29:29] <Havvy> Spammers yes, but not the same guy who comes back over and over again...
[13:29:31] <Tiffany> apparently it's because they don't like firefox
[13:29:58] <Mutabah> Havvy: #osdev used to get trolls
[13:30:08] <Havvy> Tiffany:  Australias made him think that Firefox was a Chrome clone and that it put "advanced users" into a second class citizen bucket.
[13:30:11] <Mutabah> Well, a troll that did a decent job of wasting everyone's time
[13:30:21] <Tiffany> it's pretty easy to setup an irc bot which you can op in a channel to ban people who try to repeat something more than twice
[13:30:33] <Mutabah> Tiffany: Three times
[13:30:35] <Tiffany> there might even be a mode flag for that under inspircd
[13:30:42] <fkaa> in servo now :s
[13:30:43] <Havvy> Yeah...I could add it to rustbot at some point.
[13:30:44] <Mutabah> Probably
[13:30:56] <mrmonday> there's a load of mode flags for spam with modern ircds, yeah
[13:30:59] <Tiffany> but it is probably something that should be done at the network-level yeah
[13:31:13] <mrmonday> rate limiting and such iirc
[13:31:34] <mrmonday> I think #rust has some of it set up, could be wrong though

[13:56:34] <mrmonday> the only issue I have is when I surface back to the real world everything seems to be in slo-mo :p
[13:56:50] <Tiffany> usually only let's plays, where it's spread out over 30 minutes, as opposed to more informational videos which are basically already in fast forward
[13:56:58] <Tiffany> the host talks fast, and they cut out stopping to breath
[13:57:51] <mrmonday> I find it really annoying trying to watch any youtube videos that have a host, they seem to spend most of their time not actually talking about the actual content, that's actually why I started
[13:57:57] <mrmonday> and now I do it for most things
[13:58:30] <mrmonday> I wish I could go faster than 2x for some things, there's no button for it though

[14:10:21] <Havvy> I've actually seen more ban evasion out of Kiwiirc, though only because Freenode allows Kiwiirc but doesn't properly do cgi-irc.
[14:11:08] <Tiffany> it's been a while since I've actually seen ban evasion through mibbit
[14:11:11] <Tiffany> it's usually just random trolls
[14:11:24] <Tiffany> someone with a mib_ name shows up and starts spamming vitriol
[14:12:09] <FreeFull> The usual solution at that point is to ban all of mibbit, temporarily
[14:12:11] <Havvy> Mibbit is one less step between the user and the channel.
[14:12:30] <Tiffany> there's a channel list built into mibbit though?
[14:12:43] <Havvy> Yes.
[14:12:55] <Havvy> Though it's as easy as doing /list in other clients.

[15:22:45] <Havvy> barosl:  Defects get fixed as patch level equivalents.

[15:35:52] <mrmonday> I would say here's a great place to ask Rust questions
[15:36:02] <mrmonday> depending on what you're asking I guess
[15:36:41] <mrmonday> I've seen people ask obscure questions about other languages in #rust and get answers too... not that I'd reocmmend that
[15:37:09] <ogham> #rust-offtopic: Asking questions on #rust-offtopic about asking questions on #rust-offtopic.
[15:39:03] <mrmonday> I'm pretty sure there's a series of meta rust channels lying around somewhere, I forget what they were called though
[15:39:48] <Tiffany> clearly there needs to be #rust-rust
[15:40:40] <a5i> Rust is intimidating for me :[
[15:42:58] <mrmonday> a5i: what's your background? what do you find intimidating?
[15:43:04] <mrmonday> perhaps we can take the edge off :)
[15:44:43] <a5i> mrmonday: There used to be an area in the book called "Intermediate"
[15:45:03] <a5i> and about 3/4 of thats stuff looked intimidating 
[15:45:28] <a5i> my background is kinda mixed
[15:45:48] <a5i> I can say I've never dealt with Generics and Rust's Type system
[15:47:32] <ogham> it's always infuriating at first being told by the compiler that your code is wrong

[15:49:26] <mrmonday> do you have experience with other languages?
[15:50:09] <barosl> Oooh, the in-tree version bumped to 1.2!
[15:50:15] <mrmonday> ogham: I love it when the compiler tells me I've done something wrong... ideally they'd tell me everything I've done wrong and by the time I get it compiling it works flawlessly, but we're a way away from that right now :p
[15:50:15] <barosl> Great, great
[15:51:28] <ogham> oh, totes! but it can be annoying translating your thoughts into the language that the compiler can understand.

[19:56:48] <Tiffany> I thought I might as well add it
[19:57:17] <Tiffany> you could think of it as conditioning myself to think in terms of megaseconds, which are within an order of magnitude of weeks
[19:57:35] <c74d> I've never understood what those are for, except maybe for non-human-facing things
[19:57:42] <Tiffany> particularly, a megasecond is 1.65 weeks
[19:57:49] <Tiffany> it is 1 million seconds
[19:57:59] <Tiffany> SI prefix time is pretty nice
[19:58:15] <c74d> hm, I guess that makes sense, though I doubt that was an intended purpose of week numbers
[19:58:28] <Tiffany> and if mars sees colonisation within my lifetime, I won't having to deal with the fact that days on mars are about 1/30th longer
[19:58:41] <c74d> (I mean, I never understood what week numbers were for)
[19:58:55] <Tiffany> I can just say "let's do this in a megasecond from now" not "ah.. fuck.. how do I convert earth days to mars days"
[20:01:19] <Tiffany> a mars year is 2.135 earth years
[20:01:46] <Tiffany> and its day is 24 hours, 37 minutes, and 22 seconds long
[20:02:17] <Tiffany> or 88642 seconds
[20:04:13] <Tiffany> it's not like heinously off
[20:04:18] <Tiffany> but it cycles around every 38.5 days
[20:04:35] <Tiffany> which leaves a lot more room for subtle mistakes than say, metric
[20:04:50] <Tiffany> plus, the units would be the same
[20:04:58] <Tiffany> nobody is going to go around saying "earth days" and "mars days"
[20:05:01] <Tiffany> they're just going to say "days"
[20:05:09] <Tiffany> well, they will if they're trying hard to be clear
[20:05:20] <Tiffany> like how people will say the timezone when being careful
[20:05:53] <Tiffany> converting between date systems is a total lost cause
[20:07:48] <Tiffany> like when someone gives you a number in feet when you need meters, you'll usually notice that it's much larger than it should be, or that it's annotated as 'ft' instead of 'm'
[20:07:58] <Tiffany> and that has still led to rocket crashes
[20:08:01] <panicbit> We should give up the concept of time, it's too complicated to deal with. It would be so much easier to exist at every point in time :P.
[20:08:17] <fkaa> i'm addicted to agar.io

[20:16:49] <c74d> Wolphram|Alpha is telling me that “quinsa” is an SI prefix, for 10^45. :|
[20:17:01] <c74d> Wikipedia says it's a brand of beer.

[20:17:50] <Tiffany> I don't trust wolfram|alpha to be reliable
[20:18:08] <Tiffany> it confuses photometry and radiometry units
[20:18:10] <Tiffany> and it angers me

[20:19:57] <Tiffany> it looks like there's no standard prefixes beyond yotta
[20:20:03] <Tiffany> although there might be nonstandard prefixes
[20:21:04] <Tiffany> myria- is a pretty awesome obsolete prefix
[20:21:09] <Tiffany> myriameter, or 10 kilometers
[20:23:13] <Tiffany> "In 2010, UC Davis student Austin Sendek started a petition to designate "hella" as the SI prefix for one octillion (1027).[12] The petition gathered over 60,000 supporters by circulating through Facebook and receiving a significant amount of media coverage.[13] Although the Consultative Committee for Units considered the proposal, it was ultimately rejected. However, hella has been adopted by certain websites, such as Google 
[20:23:13] <Tiffany> Calculator[14] and Wolfram Alpha.[15]"

[23:48:34] <eddyb> oh gosh
[23:48:43] <eddyb> I just stumbled upon the diversity thing
[23:49:41] <huon> be careful. :)
[23:52:40] <eddyb> was the announcement that bad? I didn't pay too much attention
[23:53:09] <eddyb> huon: you know what nobody pointed out? that there's a fuckin' penguin on one of the sub-teams
[23:53:28] <cmr> the conversation was a bit too serious for that :P
[23:54:16] <eddyb> it makes me sad but it's worse than the bugs we didn't get to fix for 1.0
[23:54:39] <eddyb> if you knew this was going to happen, one year might have not been enough to "fix it"
[23:54:44] <huon> eddyb: people have worked out that a person's picture doesn't necessarily correspond directly to their identity
[23:54:51] <huon> e.g. there's also a gorilla
[23:55:01] <huon> and a frog
[23:55:03] <eddyb> hehe
[23:55:08] <huon> and a cat
[23:55:10] <huon> and two robots
[23:55:16] <XMPPwocky> i seem to recall seeing a lens flare
[23:55:19] <cmr> such diversity!
[23:55:25] <huon> and a drain(?).
[23:55:40] <eddyb> this is what happens when you internalize avatars
[23:56:02] <bombless> hmm what penguin
[23:56:14] <cmr> eddyb is the penguin.
[23:56:25] <bombless> oh

[23:58:05] <eddyb> so I was worried sick tonight about coming up with a good look for my prom next week
[23:58:27] <bluss> going as a penguin?
[23:58:44] <eddyb> the internet likes to remind me how little I am in a troubled world
