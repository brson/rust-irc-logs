[01:15:51] <csherratt> Does anyone else feel a looming issue with abandoned projects in crates.io?
[01:16:00] <Elaine> looming?
[01:16:31] <Elaine> it's pratcially already here :P
[01:16:47] <csherratt> haha... yeah
[01:16:58] <csherratt> :(
[01:17:50] <jpernst> i suspect that's inevitable in any system where things stay forever once added
[01:19:05] <csherratt> Fair enough. It's just a bigger problem since the name gets taken forever.
[01:19:28] <jpernst> yeah
[01:19:47] <csherratt> So even if people want to take over maintenance for the author, they can't.
[01:19:52] <jpernst> i'd almost be in favor of some kind of transitive expiration where crates can go away if they aren't downloaded or taken as a dependency in a long time
[01:20:11] <Elaine> that breaks old/archived code though :(
[01:20:15] <jpernst> that's true
[01:20:19] <jpernst> it's a tough problem to deal with
[01:20:23] <Elaine> the nice thing about crates.io is that once you have a package, it will never ever break.
[01:20:58] <jpernst> i suppose the cost we have to accept for that is lots of noise in the system over time
[01:21:02] <Elaine> yeah
[01:21:05] <csherratt> Well, unless they wildcard an upstream component that changes.
[01:21:21] <Elaine> true
[01:21:25] <Elaine> lock files are important
[01:21:44] <jpernst> i wildcard everything until it breaks, then only downgrade then
[01:21:45] <jpernst> so far haven't had to
[01:23:58] <jpernst> also cargo update every day, if my deps change course somehow i want to know immediately

[01:36:00] <csherratt> jpernst I have.
[01:36:11] <jpernst> impressions?
[01:39:42] <csherratt> I ended up forking it because I just wanted a fibre implementation and I found that there were a bunch of features that didn't make sense in that context.
[01:40:07] <jpernst> yeah, it seemed like a bit of a grab bag
[01:40:42] <jpernst> was the fiber implementation solid though?
[01:41:05] <jpernst> i suspect it is since it seems like it's partially based on libgreen, but coroutines tend to have subtle gotchas in their implementations
[01:41:45] <csherratt> I have not had any major problems with it, the problems I did find are problems that need changes in `std` to work around.
[01:42:03] <csherratt> They don't have much of a scheduler right now. it's just yield.
[01:42:17] <jpernst> interesting
[01:42:27] <jpernst> that's ok for my purposes since i'd probably do the scheduling myself
[01:42:27] <csherratt> It handles panics and threads running to completion correctly, which is nice.
[01:42:32] <jpernst> cool
[01:43:47] <jpernst> is your fork public or did you just copy/paste the bits of it you wanted?

[01:44:43] <jpernst> cool, thanks

[04:17:58] <Layl> SDL now uses hardware acceleration as well
[04:18:38] <Elaine> And hopefully having an actually useful renderer, SDL's is still a steaming pile.
[04:19:10] <jpernst> yeah, i like sdl2 but i never use the renderer part
[04:20:06] <Layl> honestly what I just want is something that takes textures and source/destination cordinates
[04:20:10] <Layl> and turns it into triangles
[04:21:31] <Elaine> extending that to support transformations should be simple, and then from there animations, and then you've reinvented piston-sprite.
[04:21:35] <Elaine> :P
[04:21:46] <Layl> I'm not supporting transformations or animations
[04:21:51] <Layl> just cordinates to triangles

[07:30:05] <neikos> Reason for that is that I want a scene to be able to draw the scene that is 'behind' it, but if I want to apply an effect to it IIRC I have to use a framebuffer and draw that with a shader I wrote.

[09:34:26] <eddyb> so I had some #kitchenthoughts about game storylines
[09:34:45] <eddyb> there's linear ones and some branching/your-decisions-actually-matter ones
[09:35:48] <eddyb> you could model most choices with ADTs: each choice is a sum type, e.g. Red | Blue and choices are combined in a product type
[09:36:01] <eddyb> e.g. (Red | Blue, North | South)
[09:36:49] <eddyb> it's possible some choice combinations are invalid, so you could neste sum types instead: Red(North | South) | Blue(West | East)
[09:37:30] <eddyb> this gives you a finite set of plots
[09:37:38] <eddyb> now, what's missing here?
[09:37:50] <eddyb> I'd say lambda calculus. parametric polymorphism. functions!
[09:38:25] <eddyb> though there is one game I've heard of, that does basically the first step of what I'm thinking of
[09:38:54] <eddyb> Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor
[09:39:29] <eddyb> the Nemesis system can be considered a story-building primitive

[11:07:53] <tomaka> I just got something very interesting
[11:08:08] <tomaka> remember glutin sometimes returning an error with o/s code 0 (which is supposed to indicate success)?
[11:08:18] <eddyb> I remember you talking about it, yes
[11:08:18] <tomaka> I just got an error code 2004 instead
[11:08:30] <fkaa> modern!
[11:08:45] <tomaka> and someone on a forum said "I have this issue as well, but sometimes it's just error code 0"
[11:09:01] <tomaka> so that's probably the problem
[11:09:18] <tomaka> now that it means, I don't know, according to forums it's because OpenGL contexts aren't thread safe
[11:09:33] <tomaka> if you try to make an OpenGL context current in a thread while it's used in another thread you get this error
[11:09:52] <tomaka> but that doesn't help me since glium is entirely single threaded

[11:24:29] <tomaka> the problem is that there are also problems on android/ios/emscripten, because these platforms are callback-based
[11:24:42] <tomaka> so if I have to redesign glutin's API to be safe I have to take these into account as well
[11:24:58] <tomaka> but again, http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/japbcvpavbzau9dbuaxf.jpg
[11:25:06] <fkaa> emscripten is a target?

[11:25:24] <tomaka> well, no
[11:25:29] <tomaka> emscripten is like an o/s
[11:25:37] <tomaka> you can make basic operations and it just works
[11:25:54] <tomaka> but if you want to output an image or a sound, or get mouse input or whatever, it's platform-specific
[11:26:27] <fkaa> gfx has an issue about making it work on emscripten, is it just like writing a gles backend?

[11:27:10] <tomaka> creating a webgl context on emscripten is handled by glutin in a platform-specific way
[11:27:16] <tomaka> then webgl is very similar to opengl es
[11:28:06] <tomaka> webgl is probably too primitive to be handled by gfx though
[11:28:39] <tomaka> of course the problem right now is that compiling any rust program to emscripten is incredibly painful

[13:56:06] <Layl> Vulkan was announced when it was still in the drafting phase
[13:56:13] <Layl> they were still writing the spec
[13:56:27] <Layl> driver developers didn't even get to throw code at screens yet
[13:56:52] <Layl> and once the specs get fully released, you can bet it's going to be another year until the first decent driver support is out
[13:57:08] <Layl> and another 5 years until intel supports it
[13:57:13] <mib_ivm7mx> i hope it supports a real language for shaders
[13:57:15] <eddyb> nono that's not true
[13:57:21] <eddyb> Layl: intel already have a driver
[13:57:25] <Layl> mib_ivm7mx, it has SPIR-V
[13:57:47] <Layl> which is an intermediate bytecode language
[13:58:22] <Layl> you can stuff glsl into that or something

[14:14:55] <amstrad> new language / platform / framework every other week
[14:15:04] <amstrad> we don't need that in the graphics scene
[14:16:07] <Tiffany> all the articles were showing off that demo powerVR made and talking about how awesome it is, and then there's like one sentence at the bottom of the page about how it won't be published until later this year
[14:16:17] <eddyb> I didn't expect a new OpenGL release after Vulkan's conception
[14:16:22] <Tiffany> and even when it does come out, we'll probably get another wave of articles, but then the coverage will die out again

[14:16:28] <eddyb> fuck the old guard
[14:16:29] <Tiffany> nobody is going to notice that a game uses vulkan behind the scenes
[14:16:35] * eddyb ducks and runs
[14:17:04] <Tiffany> I didn't really think about the future of opengl post vulkan
[14:17:11] <tomaka> Why are they even showing graphical demos of vulkan?
[14:17:12] <Tiffany> I suppose it makes sense that they'd continue making new versions
[14:17:16] <tomaka> that's stupid, it will look the same as opengl
[14:17:43] <fkaa> "it looks so vulkan!"
[14:17:55] <Tiffany> you can batch more objects without bottlenecking on CPU
[14:18:02] <Tiffany> which is pretty much the only way vulkan could look better than opengl
[14:18:33] <amstrad> eddyb: what does Vulkan do better than OpenGL?
[14:18:36] <fkaa> NV_command_buffer and some beefy machine and it's identical
[14:18:39] <amstrad> what problems does it solve?
[14:18:44] <amstrad> why do we need it?
[14:18:46] <mib_ivm7mx> a less horrible shader language would be nice
[14:18:54] <fkaa> spir-v solves that
[14:19:18] <Tiffany> amstrad: it solves the validation bottleneck problem, makes the API less of a horrifying state machine, makes drivers simpler to implement
[14:19:21] <fkaa> not that glsl is so horrible anyway
[14:19:26] <tomaka> OpenGL will probably accept spir-v as well
[14:19:34] <Tiffany> it replaces glsl with SPIR-V, so you can use any language you want for a shading language, including rust
[14:19:38] <amstrad> Tiffany: you need a state machine at some level
[14:19:39] <fkaa> yup, i think there's an extension already tomaka 
[14:19:45] <tomaka> no :o
[14:19:48] <Tiffany> amstrad: you don't need one as complicated as opengl
[14:19:53] <fkaa> or maybe not
[14:19:54] <Tiffany> opengl's state machine is enormously complex
[14:19:59] <Tiffany> there are literally hundreds of global variables
[14:20:10] <amstrad> Tiffany: its not that complicated (fixed function died LONG ago)
[14:20:15] <Tiffany> yes it is
[14:20:22] <Tiffany> open up apitrace sometime and just look at the list
[14:20:38] <Tiffany> if you do anything complicated with opengl, you'll be dealing with at least a dozen variables
[14:20:39] <amstrad> Tiffany: you don't have to use all that
[14:20:44] <Tiffany> no, you're wrong
[14:20:48] <Layl> would some people just finally give up clinging to fixed functions already
[14:20:50] <Tiffany> the state is not exclusive to fixed function
[14:20:55] <Tiffany> glEnable still exists
[14:20:58] <Tiffany> glBindBuffer still exists
[14:21:11] <Tiffany> all the FBO configuration options still exist
[14:21:22] <Tiffany> indeed, FBOs didn't even exist in fixed function
[14:21:24] <amstrad> Tiffany: they need to exist
[14:21:24] <Layl> like, minecraft, entirely uses fixed functions, only the latest of the latest version has an option to use VBOs
[14:21:25] <Tiffany> but they are still stateful
[14:21:27] <fkaa> Layl: blame compatibility contexts
[14:21:30] <Tiffany> no they don't
[14:21:36] <amstrad> Tiffany: i want a buffer of this format
[14:21:38] <Tiffany> vulkan makes all that state explicit
[14:21:39] <amstrad> of this size
[14:21:43] <Tiffany> instead of global
[14:21:58] <amstrad> Tiffany: what is wrong with GLHandles?
[14:22:00] <Tiffany> if you can't understand the benefit of getting rid of global variables, I'm not going to try to explain to you
[14:22:20] <amstrad> Tiffany: they can be scoped, but that needs to be handled by the application
[14:22:25] <amstrad> what is wrong with that?
[14:22:29] <Tiffany> they cannot be scoped
[14:22:35] <amstrad> they can by the application
[14:22:45] <amstrad> if the application is smart about things
[14:22:45] <Tiffany> you can only implement a wonky push/pop system
[14:22:49] <Tiffany> that is not making the variables scoped
[14:22:57] <amstrad> Tiffany: stacks are not wonky
[14:22:59] <Layl> opengl contexts is why global variables are bad
[14:23:43] <Tiffany> the benefit of vulkan is that it makes the drivers enormously simpler - and don't try to argue this point, lunarG has already written a vulkan driver for intel and it is far smaller
[14:23:44] <amstrad> global state used to be a nightmare in OpenGL, then we dropped fixed function, and it was manageable
[14:23:52] <Tiffany> and that it gives applications more control
[14:24:01] <Tiffany> they don't need to deal with global state, the driver doesn't need to *validate* that global state
[14:24:28] <Tiffany> opengl has a limited set of abstractions which map to it performantly, and they're awkward
[14:24:33] <amstrad> Tiffany: i never had any problems with OpenGL state
[14:24:37] <Layl> big part of vulkan is that the driver doesn't need to validate anything at all
[14:24:41] <Tiffany> vulkan has powerful abstraction capabilities, and allows you to do multithreaded rendering
[14:24:50] <Layl> you can optionally make it validate things, but it isn't required by default
[14:24:52] <mib_ivm7mx> opengl still has state unless you are using bindless api
[14:24:53] <Tiffany> you haven't used opengl in any significant degree then

[14:37:13] <eddyb> Tiffany: they were doing a lot of stuff based on runtime values, IIRC
[14:37:22] *** Joins: harrisonclarke (harrisoncla@moz-uur7pt.eastlink.ca)
[14:37:31] <eddyb> like a few dumb loops
[14:38:06] <eddyb> I don't recall the exact details, but it wasn't even the best you can do in Java
[14:39:12] <eddyb> I should have the decompiled source *somewhere*
[14:39:34] <Tiffany> the issue is that minecraft does a lot of stuff other than terrain, I think
[14:39:46] <eddyb> oh that was just the chunk building code
[14:40:06] <Layl> minecraft does do plenty of things other than terrain, but terrain's the big one
[14:40:11] <Tiffany> I'll fire it up right now and see what percentage of time is spent in terrain rendering
[14:40:15] <Tiffany> it wasn't big, from what I remember
[14:40:26] <eddyb> lots of entities can kill it
[14:40:36] <eddyb> I don
[14:40:46] <eddyb> *I don't even know where to extract entity models from
[14:40:50] <Layl> does minecraft use instancing for the entities?
[14:40:54] <Tiffany> no
[14:40:54] <eddyb> they might still be using that weird builder stuff
[14:40:56] <Layl> oh who am i kidding of course it doesn't
[14:40:59] <eddyb> Layl: hahaha wtf is instancing
[14:41:36] <eddyb> we're talking about a game who made its creator a fortune in this decade via immediate mode

[14:41:49] <eddyb> classy
[14:41:57] <Tiffany> alright, on 1.8.7 it's only spending about 50% of the time drawing the terrain
[14:41:58] <fkaa> eddyb: well, users don't give a crap about that
[14:42:08] <eddyb> fkaa: except when their perf sucks
[14:42:11] <Tiffany> my view dist is on 8 chunks
[14:42:17] <Tiffany> which is what used to be normal view distance
[14:42:21] <fkaa> then they complain about perf, not immediate mode :p
[14:42:53] <eddyb> I really wanted to do something about minecraft
[14:43:02] <eddyb> but I cba to work off of decompiled Java code
[14:43:09] <eddyb> and there's just too much of it
[14:43:16] <fkaa> could fork some alpha version
[14:43:21] <fkaa> or even classic
[14:43:23] <Tiffany> ah, hold on
[14:43:28] <Tiffany> level includes everything in the world
[14:43:28] <eddyb> fkaa: that's kinda harder
[14:43:30] <Tiffany> terrain is only 18%
[14:43:36] <Tiffany> entities are 15% and that's just natural spawns
[14:43:41] <Tiffany> animals, zombies, etc
[14:43:43] <mib_ivm7mx> what else is there too minecraft
[14:43:44] <fkaa> *much* smaller codebase
[14:43:59] <eddyb> fkaa: 1.9 might finally have block state mappings per world
[14:44:09] <fkaa> not sure what that means
[14:44:09] <eddyb> which is what I halted hematite development on
[14:44:23] <eddyb> fkaa: that means you don't need to know what IDs map to what blocks state
[14:44:30] <Tiffany> 36 entities take as much time to render as the entire terrain of the world
[14:44:35] <Tiffany> that's how bad immediate mode is
[14:44:37] <mib_ivm7mx> hah
[14:44:43] <eddyb> you can already render arbitrary block states because they're described by JSON files
[14:45:19] <eddyb> fkaa: https://github.com/PistonDevelopers/hematite/blob/master/src/minecraft/data_1_8_pre2.rs#L84

[14:45:48] <eddyb> the grep commands are to be ran in decompiled source to find the right classes

[18:52:50] <tomaka> javascript has workers, which are basically threads that can only communicate with the other threads via message passing

[23:42:20] <Layl> hm, what would actually be better performance wise, a map grid of int IDs then it gets looked up in an array what actual tile it is, or a map grid of refcells directly pointing to tiles
[23:42:54] <fkaa> ints i would assume
[23:43:26] <Elaine> RefCells don't point, they contain.
[23:43:42] <Elaine> The grid of indices would likely use less memory.
[23:44:02] <Elaine> depends on the occupancy rate.
[23:45:05] <Layl> but what would run faster
[23:45:18] <Elaine> Hard to say.
[23:45:31] <ytain> the vector of indices
[23:45:35] <ytain> will run faster
[23:45:50] <aatch> ytain, not necessarily. Depends on access patterns.
[23:46:10] <Layl> assume the types are in a vector lined up anyways
[23:46:43] <aatch> Layl, when you said `map grid of refcells directly pointing to tiles", so you actually just means a "map grid of RefCells"?
[23:46:47] <Layl> all that's stored in the type is a location in a tileset
[23:47:29] <Elaine> one some GPUs you could probably upload that array to the GPU and use instancing to draw the entire thing with one draw call.
[23:47:36] <Layl> I mean a map of tiles in a game, and I'm wondering if I should use int IDs or references or something else to point to tile types for tiles
[23:48:15] <Layl> related question, what's the best way to have a multidimensional array in rust anyways
[23:48:32] <Elaine> Vec<T> with the proper indexing arithmetic.
[23:48:36] <WindowsBunny> Layl: Why not use Cell instead of RefCell?
[23:48:53] <Layl> because I still don't understand what the hell Cell is
[23:48:58] <WindowsBunny> Try to use Cell whenever it is possible to make the data Copy, because it's so much faster
[23:49:11] <aatch> Layl, it's like RefCell, but will Copy data and no overhead.
[23:49:17] <aatch> but with*
[23:49:56] <WindowsBunny> Always use Cell instead of RefCell when possible
[23:50:00] <Layl> I don't quite get what that means it's doing
[23:50:16] <Elaine> Cell has no runtime impact.
[23:50:23] <Elaine> It doesn't *do* anything.
[23:50:41] <Layl> I'm suspecting I misunderstand what refcell is doing
[23:50:45] <Elaine> seems so.
[23:50:52] <aatch> Layl, what do you think RefCell does?
[23:51:20] <Layl> I think it gives a runtime guard to mutable access to a value
[23:51:38] <WindowsBunny> Layl: RefCell has counters that make sure there is only 1 mutable borrow OR only immutable borrows
[23:52:13] <WindowsBunny> while Cell doesn't allow borrows, instead it atomically copies/inserts the value, where atomically is in the sense of a single thread and is not safe with multi-threading whatsoever
[23:52:34] <Layl> I see
[23:52:41] <WindowsBunny> so Cell is the single-thread analogue of Atomics
[23:53:09] <Layl> right but this is getting a bit away from my original problem with that I need to store a 2D map of tile types
[23:53:19] <Layl> still, thanks for explaining
