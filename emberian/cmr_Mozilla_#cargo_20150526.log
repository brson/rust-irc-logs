[01:41:31] <Tobba> could also be worth mentioning the current impure nature of libstd?
[01:41:59] <Sonarpulse> oh what's that?
[01:42:06] <Sonarpulse> I'm 6 mounths behind on rust basically
[01:42:14] <Tobba> actually, since it's a part of the compilers lib directory, I guess it can be counted as pure
[01:42:22] <Sonarpulse> other than following the obvious like beta and 1.0
[01:42:26] <Tobba> I meant in the Nix sense
[01:42:42] <Sonarpulse> yeah even there
[01:42:58] <Sonarpulse> i built most of libstd with cargo np
[01:43:10] <Sonarpulse> so it's seems no worse than any other library in principle

[01:53:53] <Sonarpulse> yeah the tone is totally wack
[01:54:48] <Sonarpulse> Probably a mix of me feeling kinda tired today, and being peeved with cargo being silly :)
[01:56:23] <Tobba> it might be nice to have an override mechanism instead
[01:56:34] <Tobba> to allow passing your own libstd easily to "cargo build"
[01:57:29] <Tobba> the implicit libstd doesn't usually interfere much, but if you were to have core, alloc etc as dependencies you'd have 5 deps in your Cargo.toml, and would need to rebuild those for every project (sadness)
[01:57:57] <Sonarpulse> you sure about the rebuild?
[01:58:08] <Tobba> well not "need"
[01:58:13] <Tobba> cargo just... does that
[01:58:15] <Sonarpulse> it's been a while
[01:58:31] <Sonarpulse> i thought it cached them (some what) in .cargo/
[01:58:37] <Tobba> only sources
[01:58:49] <Sonarpulse> oh ok
[01:59:09] <Sonarpulse> well caching builds globally is essential
[01:59:20] <Sonarpulse> (though less essential if you can do it with nix ;)
[01:59:27] <Tobba> especially for this, might have to get that in first
[01:59:40] <Tobba> (need to make sure that's Nix-friendly as well, oh boy)
[01:59:44] <Sonarpulse> by my "phase 3" definitely
[02:00:08] <Sonarpulse> yeah that will take some manuvering
[02:00:36] <Tobba> that could actually end up needing a cargo.conf, good fun
[02:01:37] <Tobba> some kinda caching system which is independant of cargo, but cargo invokes it by default
[02:01:47] <Tobba> so it could be overriden to use the Nix store when appropriate
[02:01:51] <Sonarpulse> yeah

[03:52:55] <Dabo> o11c, The main reason for that right now is the lack of a stable ABI for rust afaik
[03:53:25] <Dabo> since rust has just reached API/stdlib stability, there really hasn't been time I don't think to stabilize the binary representation as well
[03:54:12] <Dabo> thus it is kind of impossible to separate rust projects into dylibs for distribution
[03:56:02] <Dabo> Once rust actually stabilizes a compiled representation of libraries, the ecosystem will definitely start shifting towards distributing libraries using system package managers and compiling without static linking
[03:56:10] <Dabo> but until that stability exists, it is pretty much impossible

[04:32:57] <Sonarpulse> Dabo: Not to nit-pick, but there is no technical challenge, just include rustc commit hash or whatever. I agree the benefits are dimished while rust's abi changes with greater frequency than your averge distro's release cycle.
[04:34:20] *** Quits: harrisonclarke (harrisoncla@moz-uur7pt.eastlink.ca) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[04:34:39] <Dabo> Sonarpulse, true, but if someone's going to build a way for rustc to dynamically link libraries automatically in such a way that would use this, it would be much easier to build an ABI first anyways
[04:34:56] <Dabo> I mean you still have to build the facility to use the dynamic libraries as well
[04:35:44] <Dabo> and I'm *pretty* sure that code representation will still change between compilings on the same rust compiler depending on what all code is built - at least this is what I found when I tried to use rust's dylib module to load libraries
[04:36:18] <Sonarpulse> what's the last bit there?
[04:36:21] <Sonarpulse> that doesn't sound good
[04:37:00] *** Quits: bjz (bjz@moz-jen.vl0.177.183.IP) (Quit: My Mac has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[04:37:13] <Dabo> Sonarpulse, I was at one point trying to load dynamic libraries and use them, but the code would randomly crash depending on what libraries I included in the program using the dynamic library and the dynamic library itself
[04:37:30] <Dabo> It was a while ago, so the state of that might have changed, but that was my experience
[04:37:43] <Dabo> if I built them both using the exact same set of libraries and everything it worked perfectly well
[04:38:11] <Dabo> this is without using #[repr(C)] or extern or anything, just std::dynamic_lib
[04:38:12] *** Joins: dcb (textual@moz-j72nfe.ca.comcast.net)
[04:38:24] <Dabo> and trying to call methods on structs in the dynamic library
[04:41:31] <Sonarpulse> hmm
[04:44:22] <Dabo> I mean I don't think the ABI is really defined at all - it just is guaranteed to run correctly in binaries
[04:44:51] <Dabo> the optimization could change it so that a trait or struct is completely different in a dynamic library and the binary which loads it
[04:44:58] <Dabo> even if the source code is the same

[05:27:06] <o11c> Dabo: that is really not a problem at all
[05:27:19] <o11c> the only problem is that the current Rust vision does not involve installation at all
[05:28:16] <Dabo> o11c, the problem I described basically makes it impossible to tell if a rust binary will crash when using some pre-compiled library, if that isn't what you're talking about then I guess it isn't
[05:28:35] <Dabo> o11c, could you describe what you mean by installation?
[05:29:29] <Dabo> It seems to me that installing in a linux environment pretty much means you want to dynamically link dependencies so they can be shared
[05:29:43] <Dabo> if you're ok with statically linking all dependencies into the binary, then packaging that works fine
[05:30:33] <Dabo> I could probably explain more if you elaborate on what specifically is the problem
[05:39:10] <o11c> Dabo: no, really, it's not
[05:39:24] <Dabo> could you elaborate?
[05:39:38] <o11c> rust *has* a way of avoiding collisions between incompatible libraries
[05:39:52] <o11c> it *could* have had an awesome install-capable package manager to go with it
[05:40:16] <Dabo> yes, but wouldn't that be kind of pointless if dynamic libraries are still unstable
[05:40:19] <o11c> but instead we're stuck with this half-assed "bundle everything in a local directory"
[05:40:37] <Dabo> it has been my experience that even when using the same libraries in dynamic libraries, just having a different number of libraries makes it incompatible
[05:40:43] <o11c> Dabo: for a given rustc installation, if you use the exactly same library versions, it is meaningful
[05:40:45] <Dabo> same libraries and versions
[05:41:03] <o11c> and there is absolutely no reason this feature should be developed *last*
[05:41:06] <Dabo> if I didn't include all of the same crates in both the binary and the dylib, the code would randomly crash when using it
[05:41:20] <Dabo> o11c, it isn't being developed last
[05:41:28] <Dabo> there are still many, many things left to be developed
[05:41:38] <o11c> well, it should have been the very first feature
[05:42:27] <Dabo> I guess the creators of rust found creating a usable compiler more important than usable dynamic libraries
[05:42:48] <Dabo> I mean at this point rust has barely begun
[05:43:03] <Dabo> it's literally just stabilized the structure of source code
[05:43:49] <Dabo> o11c, I feel certain that it will be developed in time, and it won't be that long before we have a usable way to share compiled libraries
[05:44:34] <Dabo> there isn't really anything we can do about decisions that were made so long ago
[05:44:59] <o11c> I was here when cargo started being developed
[05:45:05] <o11c> I pointed out these problems
[05:45:16] <o11c> I said "you need to keep in mind how distros are going to package this stuff"
[05:45:20] <o11c> they said "we don't care"
[05:45:34] <Dabo> yes, that is a decision 
[05:45:51] <Dabo> I think creating something like this would involve a lot of work in rustc as well as cargo though
[05:46:13] <Dabo> not entirely sure about that, but I think that rustc doesn't have everything that is needed quite yet
[05:47:18] <o11c> uh
[05:47:22] <o11c> trust me, it does
[05:47:45] <Dabo> ok
