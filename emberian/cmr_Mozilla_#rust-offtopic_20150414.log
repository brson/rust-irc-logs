[01:38:24] <niconii> bvssvni: so, i've messed around a bit with your inference language... thingy, or at least my understanding of it
[01:39:08] <bvssvni> niconii: how do you like the idea?
[01:39:24] <niconii> bvssvni: ran into some issues with the syntax, which wasn't very clear, but
[01:40:05] <niconii> bvssvni: here's some stuff i ended up with: http://puu.sh/hda0w/d54b90ff5a.txt
[01:41:11] <niconii> bvssvni: basically i establish some rules, and then i'm able to compose them to make inferences about other relations fairly easily
[01:41:26] <bvssvni> niconii: nice!

[01:44:05] <bvssvni> niconii: I have some notes here https://github.com/PistonDevelopers/piston/issues/736#issuecomment-83789228
[01:44:52] <bvssvni> niconii: f(x) -> x’ means x is mutated

[01:49:47] <niconii> bvssvni: yeah, i ran into the problem that the example you'd given, `add [is_zero] (bool, bool) -> bool`, wasn't easily composable
[01:51:01] <FreeFull> I don't get what  `add [is_zero] (bool, bool) -> bool`  means
[01:51:20] <FreeFull> Given how add was defined before
[01:51:27] <bvssvni> FreeFull: add [is_zero] is how the is_zero property behaves under addition
[01:51:39] <niconii> FreeFull: it's the equivalent of `add [zero] -> zero` in my link
[01:52:01] <niconii> FreeFull: i changed bvssvni's syntax to better fit my tastes
[01:52:51] <FreeFull> bvssvni: Oh
[01:53:07] <FreeFull> But how does the language derive that?
[01:53:27] <libfud> what's with the square brackets?
[01:53:29] <FreeFull> It'd have to run is_zero on all integers, or have some sort of reasoning about is_zero
[01:53:42] <bvssvni> FreeFull: it doesn’t, it believes what you tell it
[01:54:01] <FreeFull> Ok
[01:54:07] <bvssvni> the idea is that parts of the inference is specified by the user, parts of it checked by the compiler
[01:54:09] <FreeFull> That's much easier to implement
[01:55:09] *** Quits: swgillespie (swgillespie@moz-upj.3un.220.167.IP) (Quit: My MacBook Pro has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[01:57:19] <niconii> FreeFull: in my example code, for instance, i explicitly define three rules
[01:57:39] <niconii> FreeFull: `zero -> even`, `even -> odd`, and `add [zero] -> odd`
[01:58:02] <niconii> er
[01:58:10] <niconii> `add [zero] -> zero`, sorry
[01:58:37] <niconii> and then i can infer `add [zero] -> odd` by composing them like `add [zero] -> zero -> even -> odd`
[02:00:06] <bvssvni> I use the brackets as a shorthand for `f [g, h] (x, y) -> [i] z`
[02:00:13] <FreeFull> Yeah
[02:00:53] <bvssvni> there are cases where there is an asymmetric relationship
[02:01:44] <bvssvni> and for set `bool = { true, false }` you can have `and [true, false] (true, false) -> [false] false`
[02:02:03] <bvssvni> which becomes `and [:] (true, false) -> false`
[02:03:04] <bvssvni> so the `[:]` operator is a shorthand for a specific asymmetric relationship that is common for objects related by set and members, such as types and values
[02:05:04] <bvssvni> in this language values and types are at the same level
[02:06:26] <bvssvni> my notes are here https://github.com/PistonDevelopers/piston/issues/736#issuecomment-89749649 , feel free to add comments

[04:23:26] <libfud> I really need to buy a rubber duck
[04:25:12] <adu> libfud: all the time
[04:25:14] <scott> heh
[04:25:38] <scott> sometimes I go join a channel, get ready to ask a somewhat complicated question, and them immediately realize the answer
[04:25:46] <libfud> yeah
[04:25:48] <scott> the process of preparing the question always makes things clearer
[04:26:03] <libfud> so I have this wart here
[04:26:04] <libfud> https://github.com/libfud/XBTVEd/blob/interface/src/tags.rs
[04:26:29] <libfud> and it just occurred to me that he proper solution is a hash table, not a struct
[04:26:32] <libfud> like
[04:26:41] <libfud> what's the point of a struct whose fields are entirely optional?
[04:26:59] <libfud> am I mistaken in thinking a hashtable would be better?
[04:27:31] <scott> perhaps
[04:27:44] <libfud> it'd also *greatly* simplify modifying the value of a tag, or the presence of that tag's key in the first place
[04:27:52] <scott> a hashtable is a bit different in that you can add things with arbitrary keys, while the struct has a fixed set of keys
[04:27:58] <libfud> as well as printing it
[04:28:02] <libfud> right
[04:28:13] <scott> on the other hand, that struct full of None's is probably wasting a lot of space compared to a hashmap with a couple things set
[04:28:25] <libfud> well
[04:28:33] <libfud> if you say that a key has to be a member of an enumeration
[04:28:36] <libfud> that limits it
[04:28:38] <libfud> doesn't it?
[04:28:55] <scott> yeah, that would work
[04:29:03] <libfud> and seeing as I already have such an enumeration
[04:29:12] <scott> for some reason I thought of string keys, but an enum is good
[04:29:18] <libfud> it's pretty foolish to do anything with that struct
[04:29:23] <libfud> string values, enumerated keys
[04:29:33] <libfud> the only thing that is then limited
[04:29:37] <libfud> oh
[04:29:38] <libfud> crap
[04:29:50] <libfud> not all the values of those fields are actually strings
[04:29:57] <scott> lol I just realized the same thing
[04:30:09] <libfud> I feel like there has to be a way around this
[04:30:19] <libfud> tagged unions probably
[04:30:48] <libfud> TagValueTypes { Line(String), Lines(Vec<String>), Foo(Bar)... }
[04:30:52] <libfud> er, ADT
[04:30:54] <libfud> whatever
[04:31:14] <scott> tagged union, enum, ADT, sum type, it's all the same :P
[04:32:15] <scott> as ugly as a struct full of Option is, it's actually looking like one of the better possible solutions
[04:33:50] *** Quits: adu (ajr@moz-0foa9t.md.comcast.net) (Client exited)
[04:39:57] <libfud> you think so?
[04:41:32] <scott> it's a bit more precise since it forces e.g. series to be String and season to be u8
[04:41:49] <scott> the hashmap with an enum wouldn't restrict that
[04:41:59] <scott> but I guess it all depends on your usecases
[04:42:01] <libfud> oh
[04:42:03] <libfud> that's true
[04:42:07] <libfud> damn
[04:42:11] <libfud> maybe my insight wasn't so great
[04:42:44] <libfud> in terms of this editor, it doesn't actually matter if they're strings or not
[04:43:07] <libfud> but if you use those types then you can see if it's garbage for the tag or not
[04:43:25] <libfud> like, a running time of "Clint Eastwood" wouldn't make sense
[04:56:11] <libfud> wow I had no clue that python didn't have enums for so long
[04:56:19] <libfud> and you have to import them in 3

[11:17:38] <libfud> oh how I hate C++
[11:18:34] <libfud> my program crashed
[11:18:39] <libfud> compiler gave me no warnings

[11:20:29] <libfud> oh
[11:20:33] <libfud> it actually pointed me to my rust code
[11:20:41] <libfud> (in an unsafe block)
[11:21:12] <barosl> lol

[11:21:15] *** Joins: bytewise (bytewise@moz-eh3idl.adsl.alicedsl.de)
[11:21:54] <barosl> libfud, That seems like a classic temporary value problem
[11:22:13] <libfud> so
[11:22:15] <libfud> what should I do?
[11:22:42] <barosl> You should retain `CStr::from_ptr(name)` for the block scope
[11:22:43] <mrmonday> man, writing unsafe code in Rust is far worse than writing C/C++
[11:23:05] <barosl> `let a = CStr::from_ptr(name); match String::from_utf8(a.to_bytes().to_vec())`
[11:23:06] <mrmonday> I never think about memory safety and stuff in Rust, I just expect the compiler to handle it for me
[11:23:19] <mrmonday> at least in C/C++ I'm on my toes :p
[11:24:24] <libfud> oh
[11:24:29] <libfud> thanks barosl 
[11:25:56] <barosl> libfud, Now you should apologize to C++!
[11:26:03] <libfud> Never.
[11:26:07] <mrmonday> you do owe it an apology I think
[11:26:10] <libfud> I hate it for myriad other reasons
[11:26:18] <mrmonday> gotta be civil
[11:26:21] <libfud> I'll say that I was off base in blaming it for this in particular
[11:26:59] <mrmonday> oh, sure, we're not asking you to let it off the hook for everything, just to apologise for blaming it when it didn't do anything (this time...) :p
[11:27:31] <libfud> ok
[11:27:56] <libfud> it's not C++'s fault for this particular instance, which was in fact my own mistake.
[11:33:03] <mrmonday> I'm thinking that I might start writing out a list of assertions/assumptions made for every unsafe block I write
[11:33:22] <mrmonday> either as assert!s or as comments if I can't codify it
[11:33:34] <mrmonday> might force me to think about what I'm doing
[11:33:40] <mrmonday> /better document it
[11:33:47] <libfud> man what the heck

[20:48:24] <GaryOak_> Really? Linked Lists?
[20:49:02] <tiffany> garyoak: well, linked lists are entirely based on memory latency, and memory hasn't gotten faster as fast as CPUs have, so it's a much leveller playing field
[20:49:53] <tiffany> iterating a linked list that isn't in cache because it hasn't been accessed recently or is too large to fit will hit main memory every single time, and overall ends up being over a hundred times slower than walking a vector
[20:50:53] <GaryOak_> how is a vector being implement then that makes it so much faster?
[20:51:04] <tiffany> a vector is contiguous
[20:51:15] <tiffany> to access the next element, you simply access the memory directly adjacent to the current one
[20:51:22] <GaryOak_> but it's mutable
[20:51:25] <tiffany> you don't have to dereference a pointer into who knows where
[20:51:40] <GaryOak_> sure
[20:51:44] <tiffany> since vector access is linear in this respect, the CPU can predict it, and load in lines ahead of time
[20:51:57] <tiffany> a hit to L1 cache takes 4 cycles
[20:52:03] <tiffany> a hit to main memory takes over a hundred
[20:52:20] *** Quits: eerie_ (eerie@moz-njefna.red.bezeqint.net) (Connection closed)
[20:52:29] <tiffany> depending on the memory used, the configuration of that memory within the system, and the CPU speed
[20:52:32] <GaryOak_> so it's that the cpu can optimize for the contiguous memory accesses
[20:52:53] <tiffany> there's a very serious dependency issue going on
[20:52:55] <JustAPerson> tiffany: from that "Why most languages are slow" main memory loads are apparently 240 cycles, but that's only the first cacheline
[20:53:01] <JustAPerson> ~240 on haswell
[20:53:02] <tiffany> in order to load the next element of a linked list, the current one must be known
[20:53:09] *** Quits: sigma (sigma@moz-ohog4c.range86-135.btcentralplus.com) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[20:53:16] <tiffany> which means you have a sort of fencepost between every single element, which exposes the full memory latency
[20:53:19] <tiffany> which is over a hundred cycles
[20:53:42] <tiffany> with a vector, the CPU already knows the exact memory address of every single element in a vector
[20:53:48] <WindowsBunny> with a vector you can have multiple elements in the same cache line as well
[20:53:51] <tiffany> it can tell the memory to load those elements ahead of time
[20:53:55] <tiffany> yeah, that too
[20:53:56] <JustAPerson> GaryOak_: contiguous data is nice because main memory is read along cache lines (64 bytes)
[20:54:16] <GaryOak_> so it'll end up being in the same cache line
[20:54:30] <JustAPerson> and all loaded at once, avoiding another 240 cycle latency
[20:54:31] <tiffany> I think it can be even more significant on consoles
[20:54:42] <tiffany> the PS4 uses GDDR5 memory, which is optimized for massively wide accesses
[20:54:45] <tiffany> because it's used in GPUs
[20:54:53] <WindowsBunny> high bandwidth, high latency
[20:54:54] <tiffany> I don't know if the cache line length is wider or what
[20:55:03] <tiffany> but yeah, latency is around 600 cycles there
[20:55:13] <WindowsBunny> so contiguous access is super important
[20:55:14] <JustAPerson> frightening
[20:55:22] <GaryOak_> but is the vector you are talking about mutable?
[20:55:35] <WindowsBunny> mutability has nothing to do with it?
[20:55:36] <tiffany> why are you mentioning mutability?
[20:55:39] <tiffany> mutability doesn't matter
[20:55:54] <tiffany> if you have to reallocate the vector because of appending to it, sure, that takes a hit
[20:55:58] <GaryOak_> well isn't that why you want to use a linked list in the first place
[20:55:59] <tiffany> but mutating elements inside the vector goes to cache...

[20:56:26] <tiffany> the funny thing about linked lists
[20:56:38] <tiffany> is that you still have to do O(N) lookup to find your insertion point, to do insert-in-middle
[20:56:40] <JustAPerson> insertion is pretty fast when the entire vector is in cache. It's still O(N) behaviour though
[20:56:52] <tiffany> in many case, it's actually faster to do O(N) insertion for a vector
[20:56:58] <GaryOak_> yeah you have to walk through to the correct link
[20:57:01] <tiffany> because you don't have to do the 100x slower walk
[20:57:47] <tiffany> pretty much the only reason you could have to use an actual linked list is some strange notion of purity and simplicity (lisp, most functional languages) and atomicity (kernels)
[20:57:59] <tiffany> you can't pause to reallocate a vector when you're in the middle of an interrupt handler

[21:01:26] <tiffany> kernels have other fun things which hurt performance too
[21:01:41] <tiffany> like they usually don't use vector instructions because having to save FP registers is far too bothersome
[21:01:52] <tiffany> for example, AVX-512 has a total of 2 kilobytes of registers that have to be dumped to stack

[21:12:00] <zwarich> for batch processing, sorted linear data is OP
[21:12:22] <zwarich> I've often wondered what the best way to represent IR for an SSA compiler really is
[21:12:33] <zwarich> LLVM is extremely pointer heavy, which makes it easy to use but causes perf problems
[21:13:20] <tiffany> yeah, I really love my engine's rendering pipeline
[21:13:33] <tiffany> as time goes on, I smooth it out into linear batch processing more and more
[21:13:48] <tiffany> it's quite fast and a lot less verbose than it used to be
[21:14:17] <zwarich> compilers are annoying because they at least require dynamic tree operations, if not general dynamic directed graph operations
[21:15:42] <zwarich> I guess you could come up with a cache friendly sparse DAG representation, and then layer loops on top of that

[22:01:54] <fmtq> he's writing it in Java SWT 
[22:02:01] <GaryOak_> oh gawd
[22:02:13] <GaryOak_> haha I don't know what that is
[22:02:26] <fmtq> JHorizontalBarAbstractFactoryBuilder
[22:02:31] <JustAPerson> "oh gawd" is an appropriate response
[22:02:38] <eddyb> fmtq: oh but you haven't seen it
[22:02:45] <eddyb> "though I did just make the first UI layout linear constraint solver in Rust (that I know of), so that's something"
[22:02:48] <fmtq> JInsertBaconReceiveThermometers 
[22:02:55] <eddyb> System [a.x1(=0), a.y1(=0), a.x2(=600), a.y2(∈[0, inf]), b.x1(=0), b.y1(∈[-inf, 400]), b.x2(∈[0, inf]), b.y2(=400), c.x1(∈[-inf, 600]), c.y1, c.x2(=600), c.y2(=400)]
[22:03:01] <GaryOak_> I hope there's an JAbstractGridbagFactory
[22:03:06] <fmtq> ∈ ?
[22:03:09] <fmtq> why
[22:03:20] <fmtq> who allowed UTF-8 
[22:03:23] <eddyb> and it looks like https://i.imgur.com/btbVGSw.png
[22:03:32] <fmtq> ¬_¬
[22:03:42] <eddyb> the colored windows
[22:03:55] <fmtq> that is not actually the worst thing I've ever seen
[22:04:04] <fmtq> that's almost a compliment
[22:04:07] <eddyb> the good news is that now I can build things on it!
[22:04:39] <GaryOak_> I was thinking, "that looks a lot like Kate", then oh
[22:04:46] <eddyb> that *is* kate
[22:04:48] <fmtq> so what 
[22:04:51] <fmtq> it uses SDL?
[22:04:55] <eddyb> fmtq: no, glutin
[22:05:02] <fmtq> quaintin
[22:05:21] <fmtq> wait
[22:05:25] <fmtq> you use mibbit for IRC?
[22:05:31] <fmtq> that's the nightmare of the day for me
[22:05:43] <eddyb> it's intentional
[22:05:51] <GaryOak_> eddyb: What is your design philosophy for it?
[22:05:51] <fmtq> why
[22:06:03] <eddyb> fmtq: I should not be online
[22:06:13] <fmtq> eddyb: that's dumb and you should feel dumb
[22:06:14] <GaryOak_> or is it just really simple
[22:06:17] <eddyb> I am because the libraries I'm using suck
[22:06:30] <eddyb> and I had to ask for help in #rust-gamedev
[22:06:38] <eddyb> next thing I know is I'm logging my progress
[22:06:43] <eddyb> fmtq: I should make a twitter account
[22:06:54] <fmtq> are you a brand
[22:07:00] <fmtq> eddbys programming bong hits
[22:07:00] <eddyb> GaryOak_: your name sounds familiar
[22:07:10] <fmtq> he is a pokemon villain
[22:07:15] <eddyb> isn't SolidOak an IDE thing?
[22:07:29] <GaryOak_> yeah, I think it's a rust thing
[22:07:37] <eddyb> unrelated Oak?
[22:07:41] <fmtq> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Oak
[22:07:58] <GaryOak_> https://github.com/oakes/SolidOak
[22:08:03] <GaryOak_> yes unrelated oak
[22:08:31] <XMPPwocky> "why is my VPS so laggy all of a sudden"
[22:08:32] <fmtq> nobody will ever uncover my identity 
[22:08:32] <tiffany> gross, combining dark and light themes
[22:08:38] <XMPPwocky> right i'm on the other side of the country now
[22:08:51] <eddyb> tiffany: isn't kate5 pretty <3?
[22:09:03] <eddyb> I went with dark because why the heck not
[22:09:07] <tiffany> the colours aren't very good either
[22:09:18] <GaryOak_> nothing but critics in here
[22:09:27] <GaryOak_> lol
[22:09:33] <eddyb> maybe I should make it clear what's my working environment and what's the thing I'm working on, in my screenshots
[22:09:39] <GaryOak_> haha
[22:09:46] <eddyb> "look for simple RGB patterns for the latter"
[22:09:48] <GaryOak_> I love the RGB color scheme
[22:10:13] <eddyb> hmm, my constraints all have at most 2 terms

[22:10:36] <eddyb> maybe it was a good thing I didn't try to implement a simplex algorithm
[22:12:21] <eddyb> this is all fun and whatnot... but I don't even have event propagation yet...

[23:30:28] <niconii> eesh
[23:30:40] <niconii> xmonad works well for me as a window manager and all
[23:30:50] <niconii> the problem is that i don't actually *know* much haskell
[23:31:02] <niconii> so every time i have to mess with the config, it's a challenge
[23:31:28] <niconii> luckily it's not a common occurence, but...
