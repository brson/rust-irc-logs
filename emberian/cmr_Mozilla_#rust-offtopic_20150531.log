[00:01:11] <cmr> Astrum|Lap: fine, I guess?
[00:01:22] <cmr> Astrum|Lap: what are you looking for specifically?
[00:01:39] <Astrum|Lap> well I haven't really been keeping up with what they're doing with it
[00:01:43] <Astrum|Lap> since I rarely use windows
[00:02:30] <cmr> biggest user-facing change is probably re-introduction of start menu, replacing the modern homescreen, and the ability to run modern/"universal" apps in a window.
[00:02:34] <Astrum|Lap> is it a small iteration (aside from the re-imagining of the metro interface) or are there lots of changes?
[00:03:07] <cmr> nothing too major user facing besides that really.
[00:03:24] <Astrum|Lap> what about behind the scenes
[00:03:51] <cmr> lots of changes, especially around the Windows SDK, the "Windows Runtime" and .NET with .NET Native and CoreCLR and stuff.

[00:39:13] <eddyb> hang on
[00:39:17] <eddyb> that doesn't make sense
[00:39:39] <eddyb> you need control-flow analysis to find the cases in which you need to return default values
[00:40:06] <XMPPwocky> wtf is a default, say, pointer?
[00:40:06] <eddyb> unless... unless it does something like store to a local and return from that local... and it starts out with the default value
[00:40:10] <XMPPwocky> it's not null right
[00:40:10] <eddyb> XMPPwocky: null
[00:40:14] <XMPPwocky> aaagh
[00:40:16] <eddyb> what else?
[00:40:17] <huon> eddyb: the only case is falling off the end of the function, or a `return` with no value
[00:40:37] <huon> (both of which are easy to detect with no CFA)
[00:40:45] <XMPPwocky> eddyb: i don't understand why new languages keep having nullable pointers
[00:40:53] <eddyb> XMPPwocky: I actually have no idea
[00:40:58] <eddyb> starless might know
[00:41:31] <eddyb> huon: what about if x.foo() { return x; } else { return y; }?
[00:42:04] <eddyb> wait, it generates C
[00:42:21] <huon> eddyb: dead code is fine :P
[00:42:22] <eddyb> (that by itself is kind of cheating)
[00:42:43] <eddyb> I wonder what it does for mangling
[00:43:10] <cmr> why is that cheating?
[00:43:13] <fmtq> I would use 6 concatenated uuids
[00:43:50] <eddyb> cmr: because it acts more like a templating preprocessor than anything else
[00:43:57] <starless> eddyb: I might know why new languages allow all pointers to be null?
[00:44:15] <starless> eddyb: No theoretical deity could explain that.
[00:44:22] <XMPPwocky> my new language compiles to a gigantic amalgamation of C++ templates
[00:44:26] <fmtq> starless: could but won't
[00:44:32] <XMPPwocky> which then generate C++
[00:44:39] <eddyb> starless: you might know what Nim does for default values of pointers

[00:45:42] <fmtq> wait fuck
[00:45:44] <fmtq> it's 2:45am
[00:45:51] <fmtq> schlafen I must 
[00:45:55] <cmr> eddyb: So uh, why is compiling to non-C target languages not being a "template preprocessor"
[00:46:40] <eddyb> because you're doing slightly more work than applying rewrite rules on top of C :P
[00:46:52] <starless> eddyb: oh wait, I uninstalled Nim after I got called a troll
[00:46:54] <XMPPwocky> rust is a bunch of rewrite rules on top of llvm IR

[00:48:47] <eddyb> between Nim and Go, I don't know which implementation choice I care for more
[00:48:54] <eddyb> but Nim has generics
[00:49:41] <eddyb> which they conflate with macros IIRC. at least a bit. it's not like they need a wildly different expansion strategy
[00:49:53] <eddyb> it's all syntactic sugar on top of C

[00:58:41] <starless> well that doesn't sound /that/ bad

[01:01:17] <eddyb> why do you chain Result::map?
[01:01:35] <cmr> because I've been awake for too long to be responsibly writing code.
[01:01:55] <eddyb> also, I never write Vec::new()
[01:02:02] <cmr> vec![] is a travesty
[01:02:13] <eddyb> I might propose making Vec::new() usable in constants

[01:03:39] <starless> I mean "the D", not intentional that error
[01:04:18] <c74d> starless: I only used D once, to write a program that I at least in part wrote only to try D.

[13:56:27] <Tiffany> fmtq: the best part is how some people argue that our fossil fuel resources are somehow actually renewable
[13:56:43] <Tiffany> coal doesn't form anymore, ever since bacteria learned how to eat dead plants
[13:58:16] <Tiffany> oh, nevermind, I'm wrong
[13:58:26] <Tiffany> I'm pretty sure cosmos said that
[13:58:45] <Tiffany> there was a certain period in time which formed a hell of a lot more coal than any other time though
[14:00:33] <Tiffany> hm
[14:00:37] <Tiffany> maybe I just misinterpreted it
[14:01:58] <Tiffany> ahh
[14:01:59] <Tiffany> that's why
[14:02:23] <Tiffany> coal from lignin doesn't form anymore, since bacteria evolved to metabolise it
[14:02:29] <Tiffany> coal forms from other sources
[14:02:55] <Tiffany> a large amount of the coal we have is from the carboniferous era, and most of that comes from trees
[14:03:05] <Tiffany> from wood*

[15:14:45] <fmtq> the healing power of crystals is unquestionable, Quxxy

[15:15:20] <Tiffany> because all those periods are millions of years
[15:15:22] <fmtq> it's simply not a relevant factor to not use fossil fuels.
[15:15:29] <Tiffany> oh

[15:32:36] <eddyb> grrr
[15:32:49] <eddyb> is there a way to list the apps that run background shit?
[15:33:17] <eddyb> when things start crashing (low RAM, I believe), I see all sorts of stuff crash that wasn't supposed to be running in the first place
[15:33:45] <eddyb> as in, I didn't touch it since the last phone boot and it's not some service that makes sense to run in the background
[15:33:57] <fmtq> why do normal people not have these kinds of problems
[15:34:02] <fmtq> eddyb: why
[15:34:15] <eddyb> worse still, after the background process crashes, that app that wasn't supposed to be running starts, as if it was running before
[15:34:34] <eddyb> fmtq: because those people can afford phones 16 times more powerful than the apps they use would need if they weren't coded by retarded monkeys
[15:35:03] <fmtq> that is too complex of a sentence
[15:35:10] <fmtq> I understand it but it still doesn't answer the question
[15:35:14] <fmtq> you in fact made it all about yourslef 
[15:35:14] <fmtq> lol
[15:35:16] <eddyb> sure it does
[15:35:27] <fmtq> you are clearly projecting about an app 
[15:35:36] <fmtq> and possibly implying your phone is shit cheap 
[15:37:47] <eddyb> normal people get a new phone when they have any sorts of issues like this. possible before, because they don't know how to install cyanogen(mod) to get a newer version of the software, which runs fine on the older hardware, modulo the apps that don't give a fuck
[15:38:16] <eddyb> I could claim there's a conspiracy to push newer hardware by having apps consume more and more resources even when they don't need them

[15:41:55] <fmtq> calm the fuck down eddyb

[16:58:04] <bstrie> Manishearth: oh no all my bing searches!!
[16:58:29] <Manishearth> Who says I don't have access to your Google searches too?
[16:58:37] <Manishearth> Google started being evil years ago
[16:58:46] <Manishearth> did anyone stop and  think why?
[16:58:49] <bstrie> joke's on you, I use firefox! that means yahoo is my search engine!

[16:59:12] <Manishearth> tfw MS doesn't secretly own Google
[16:59:20] <Manishearth> bstrie: true story: everyone uses Chrome/FF/Google here
[16:59:38] <bstrie> and ubuntu, I bet
[16:59:48] <Manishearth> nah, it's all windoes boxes
[16:59:55] <Manishearth> though most interns have ubuntu laptops :p
[16:59:59] <bstrie> as they noodle around on their iphones
[17:00:02] <Manishearth> they even do their CI on windows boxes
[17:00:04] <Manishearth> it's a nightmare
[17:00:20] <bstrie> CI on windows boxes running linux vms, surely
[17:00:39] <Manishearth> I heard someone mention RHEL in conjunction with testing and I asked them what they meant by that. apparently it was some obscure internal acronym (not Red Hat Enterprise)
[17:00:45] <XMPPwocky> bstrie: why would they be running VMS?
[17:02:07] <Manishearth> Our manager was giving the intern next to me some stuff to read up and work on. There were some extra things he didn't have links for so he's like ""Okay, you should also learn about X and Y; Google it ... <pause> <afterthought> or bing it <shrug>"
[17:02:23] <bstrie> XMPPwocky: dave cutler reminiscing

[17:05:38] <eddyb> bstrie: also, can we stop mentioning niko's daughter? that's just creepy
[17:06:09] <Manishearth> yeah that sounded strange to me too
[17:06:22] <bstrie> Manishearth: you have no idea what the context here is :P
[17:06:35] <Manishearth> well out of context it was a bit strange
[17:06:38] <eddyb> Manishearth: now remember how bstrie looked at the 1.0 launch
[17:06:43] <Manishearth> haha
[17:06:52] <bstrie> that's how I look every day!
[17:06:58] <bstrie> those are my clothes!
[17:09:13] <Manishearth> eddyb: I still don't get the context though
[17:10:00] <eddyb> the context was the "password" for writing unsafe code
[17:10:05] <eddyb> unless you mean something else
[17:10:39] <Manishearth> the context bstrie mentioned
[17:10:49] <Manishearth> that context I got, stil lwas a tad strange there
[17:11:13] <Manishearth> you generally don't mention a person's family specifics on the internet
[17:12:19] <bstrie> niko mentions his daughter all the time :P
[17:13:34] <eddyb> not... on IRC
[17:13:43] <eddyb> unless it's a timezone thing
[17:14:06] <eddyb> bstrie: still, that doesn't make you less of a creep :P
[17:14:38] <bstrie> how else do you think I know about her! and what her real name is! and eddyb, given your *private messages* to me last year, don't start accusing me of being a creep :)

[17:47:47] <bstrie> Quxxy: I wouldn't go creating a thing that looks like a rust file but doesn't compile
[17:48:09] <Rym> Does rustc allow shebangs?
[17:48:20] <Quxxy> Rym: I believe so
[17:48:26] <Quxxy> At least, it didn't choke on the one I gave it
[17:48:42] <bstrie> it does
[17:48:46] <bstrie> it does allow them, that is
[17:48:55] <Quxxy> bstrie: But if you need dependencies, you can't feed the source file to rustc by itself *anyway*
[17:49:19] <Quxxy> I acknowledge the drawback, although I remain unconvinced that it's *that* big a deal :)
[17:51:01] <Rym> See, I'd prefer a bit more like rustdoc, but with prefix-manifest. e.g. you don't specify a `main` so it wraps your code inside `extern foo; extern bar; fn main() { %% }`
[17:51:32] <Rym> foo,bar etc would be from whatever dependencies you've listed, perhaps with renames?
[17:52:01] <Quxxy> Rym: See, I thought about it, but realised that package name and lib name *don't have to match*
[17:52:24] <bstrie> Quxxy: I'd expect this to work like python, where it just attempts to use whatever packages on the system happen to match my "extern crate foo" declarations
[17:52:33] <Quxxy> `cargo ffi` is *already* enough of a complete nightmare; I *really* don't want to have to talk to cargo at all, if I can help it
[17:52:52] <cow_2001> c74d: where did you see my messages?
[17:53:09] <cow_2001> c74d: in such a way that you've replied here
[17:53:38] <Quxxy> bstrie: The issue there is that, currently, that would limit you to basically just what ships with Rust
[17:53:56] <Quxxy> It also seems a little silly to have a package manager *right there*, and not use it
[17:54:01] <bstrie> Quxxy: sounds like you need to implement cargo install first :P
[17:54:06] <Quxxy> OH HELL NO
[17:54:40] <Quxxy> I've had but a peek at the cargo codebase, and I already want to jump off a cliff :P
[17:55:09] <Rym> Quxxy: got an example of package and libname being different? 
[17:55:27] <eddyb> I thought messing with the unification algorithm in rustc was going to be easy
[17:55:58] <Quxxy> All the win32 crates are, I believe; ole32-sys, shell32-sys, uuid-sys
[17:56:05] <Quxxy> The crates themselves all lack the -sys suffix
[17:56:25] <Quxxy> The problem is that if I guess wrong, the user's script will refuse to compile, which is a lousy failure mode
[17:56:56] <Quxxy> Trust me, I was *really* tempted to do it for --expr
[17:57:01] <bstrie> Quxxy: if I have `extern crate time;` in a file that I'm passing to cargo script, then I expect cargo to do whatever it takes to figure out what time is and get it on my system without my intervention! I'm a user, I'm lazy, and if I could be arsed to do it myself then I'd be making a cargo.toml!
[17:59:01] <Quxxy> bstrie: That would be cool, except that crate names don't have to match packages, and AFAIK that information isn't in the index, there are crates in both rustlib and crates.io with the same name, where you don't want the rustlib one *and* that would involve actually parsing the source, which I *really* want to avoid
[17:59:41] <bstrie> Quxxy: you are caught in a contradiction of wanting to both help people be lazy and also be lazy yourself. the center cannot hold
[17:59:56] <bstrie> if you want to enable laziness in others, you must work very hard!
[18:00:07] <Quxxy> Not necessarily; I feel there is a reasonable compromise to be found :)
[18:00:32] <Rym> Quxxy: in the example I gave above, foo-sys in the toml prefix would get turned into `extern crate foo` ?
[18:00:43] <Quxxy> Plus, if I make it *almost* good enough, eventually it will annoy someone more motivated than me to go and fix it :D
[18:00:58] <Rym> I don't think you can infer from the `extern crate` name, but you can infer from the Cargo.toml name?
[18:01:05] <Quxxy> Rym: There's *no rule* that says it has to work like that
[18:01:51] <Quxxy> It could be `raymond_luxury_yacht` -> `throat_wobbler_mangrove`
[18:02:05] <Quxxy> If `cargo script` gets it wrong, *ever*, you end up with a dependency that's impossible to use from a script
[18:02:28] <Quxxy> Unless you start adding even more switches or metadata to compensate
[18:02:57] <Quxxy> ... it *might* be worth it for --expr
[18:02:58] <Rym> Quxxy: but if you have the cargo name, you can get it's libname which each crate should only have one of? (Or am I wrong on the one libname per crate?)
[18:03:22] <Quxxy> There's no way for me to get that without actually linking against cargo
[18:03:48] <Quxxy> That takes this from "nice and easy hack" to "someone please kill me"
[18:04:13] <eddyb> huh
[18:04:30] <Quxxy> I actually started cargo script to get away from cargo ffi
[18:04:31] <eddyb> this is confusing
[18:05:33] <c74d> cow_2001: <ircs://chat.freenode.net:6697/haskell-blah>
[18:05:47] <Rym> Ah, right :P
[18:07:03] <cow_2001> O_O
