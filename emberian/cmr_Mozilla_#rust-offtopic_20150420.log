[05:08:46] <niconii> eesh
[05:08:59] <niconii> it's been a while since i've looked at some actual c code
[05:09:07] <niconii> it's kinda hard to look at now
[05:11:24] <whipsch> i actually think the noise seems slightly reduced after looking at abunch of rust
[05:11:24] <whipsch> but i still dont really like reading c code
[05:11:34] <whipsch> it just seems... lame :D
[05:12:40] <niconii> there's just so many awkward little things you have to deal with
[05:13:19] <niconii> you've gotta worry about mallocs and frees, you've gotta worry about . vs ->, you've gotta worry about null pointers...

[05:18:58] <bombless_> I actually like to see code in x86 asm, as long as the logic is cristal clear to me.

[05:20:27] <bombless> cause I think in that case x86 is with less noise than C
[05:20:36] <niconii> i'm more alright with asm than i am c
[05:20:52] <niconii> c has a lot more gotchas involved

[05:23:07] <bombless> I was comparing Blink code with Servo, and I found that Servo code is much more clear.
[05:23:52] <bombless> Try compare https://github.com/servo/servo/blob/8b8daa24b8d25c531ea74a70b4b6e25cb3d7d58c/components/script/dom/document.rs#L1000-L1006 with https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/blink/+/master/Source/core/dom/
[05:24:42] <bombless> Hmm its another guy who pasted that Blink link for getElementById so I just don't bother to find the exact line number for Blink.
[05:24:53] <bombless> and the discussion is in Chinese so ...
[05:28:57] <niconii> hmm... i kinda miss forth
[05:30:05] <niconii> forth was both really flexible and really simple

[10:08:21] <flan3002> bombless - I wonder what's more sensible from a usability perspective... one or two enums for commands and replies?

[12:40:45] <flan3002> bombless - This [ http://ix.io/i0C ] is currently generated at build time, but I don't see a way to translate the types properly without hardcoding them...
[12:42:31] <flan3002> bombless - I'll just copy this and scrap the buildscript.
[12:42:34] <bombless> flan3002: rustdoc! nice try. I personally think those info will hurt debugging though, so I may just forget it at early stage.

[12:45:36] <bombless> *specializing
[12:46:32] <flan3002> bombless - Sure, that may be possible, but translating e.g. "[ <target> ] <mask> *( "," <mask> )" is non-trivial, and probably not worth it for a onetime job.
[12:47:43] <bombless> flan3002: It's what I never tried to do, so this will be the first funny thing in this work for me. Thus I don't want to miss it.
[12:48:46] <flan3002> bombless - It'd be cool if it works, but I'll go with hand-editing them for now. I'll make sure to swap it once/if your solutions works. :)

[16:36:19] <libfud> that was annoying
[16:36:39] <libfud> I accidentally hit ^x^s
[16:36:49] <libfud> since I've been doing that so much in emacs
[16:37:17] <libfud> bvssvni: did I ask you something before I disconnected?
[16:38:01] <Astrum|Lap> pfft, emacs
[16:38:29] <libfud> I like it, and that's all that matters to me
[16:38:35] <bvssvni> libfud: yes “do you have a time limit of when you’d like to have it usable?"

[16:39:13] <Astrum|Lap> so I don't have to use their staggeringly terrible toolchain
[16:39:38] <bvssvni> libfud: Conrod is in the middle of a major redesign :P
[16:39:39] <libfud> other than like, seeing something in a couple months would be nice
[16:39:45] <bvssvni> libfud: ok
[16:40:00] <libfud> bvssvni: that's probably good
[16:40:29] <libfud> I like using it as it is, and I think it's pretty nice to use, but it can be a bit unwieldy, for reasons I've already talked about
[16:40:55] <libfud> I guess gui code is inherently a pain to write out
[16:42:38] <Astrum|Lap> nah, it just means we haven't found a better way yet
[16:43:48] <libfud> hmm
[16:44:06] <libfud> I wonder if I can have a pop up window without spawning a new thread
[16:44:22] <libfud> last time I tried that, the original window went completely blank
[16:45:46] <libfud> yep
[16:45:49] <libfud> still happens
[16:46:07] <libfud> the buttons are still present, but not drawn
[16:46:15] <tiffany> but astrum, if they open source their toolchain everyone will steal their trade secrets! because you totally can't do that from binary reverse engineering!
[16:46:38] <tiffany> also, I also use emacs
[16:46:49] *** Joins: bombless (_@moz-hfm6qt.0v2u.0v40.0da8.2001.IP)
[16:46:55] <Astrum|Lap> from what I know, that is their reason and they are saying it with a straight face
[16:46:59] <libfud> if I do spawn a new thread for a pop up window, and move it over the parent, it has that effect of showing artifacts
[16:47:06] <tiffany> neovim is kind of tempting since its core is reasonable
[16:47:08] <tiffany> it's all async
[16:47:14] <tiffany> but there's no org-vim
[16:47:17] <tiffany> well
[16:47:25] <tiffany> there is, but it's a pale imitation of the real thing
[16:47:40] <tiffany> I think there's some kind of gpg thing for vim? I don't really know
[16:47:44] <Astrum|Lap> so I'm forced to use 17GB of crapware that isn't even maintained anymore (their newer toolchain isn't free in either sense of the word, and doesn't even support older chips)
[16:47:47] <tiffany> I do know that emacs comes with gpg built in
[16:47:48] <libfud> why not use evil
[16:47:57] <tiffany> why should I use evil?
[16:48:12] <tiffany> I just use the emacs layout
[16:48:15] <libfud> if you like vi keybindings
[16:48:29] <libfud> er, modality, whatever
[16:48:29] <tiffany> I'm not particularly attached to vim's keybindings
[16:48:33] <XMPPwocky> Astrum|Lap: stuff like that is basically the only decent argument for software patents
[16:48:42] <tiffany> the commands are cute, but I was always having trouble with switching between modes
[16:49:18] <libfud> I think I prefer emacs' package management to vim's
[16:49:23] <Astrum|Lap> XMPPwocky: how so
[16:49:41] <bvssvni> libfud: mindtree want to ask you something over in #rust-gamedev
[16:50:24] <XMPPwocky> Astrum|Lap: well, the original point of patents was that people kept inventing things, keeping how they worked secret, and then dying
[16:50:49] <tiffany> eh
[16:50:55] <XMPPwocky> so the idea was that if you made patents public, but gave them legal protection, inventors would disclose how things worked in exchange for exclusivity 
[16:50:57] <tiffany> emacs and vim package management are both pretty much equally mediocre
[16:51:13] <tiffany> I think both support ssl downloads but none of the official repositories do
[16:51:27] <tiffany> and I don't think either even checksums
[16:51:28] <Astrum|Lap> ah, yeah, I can see that, XMPPwocky 
[16:51:37] <tiffany> so I'm pretty sure you can trivially mitm and inject malware into someone's text editor
[16:51:58] <scott> most vim package managers use git
[16:52:23] <tiffany> most vim package managers use multiple download mechanisms but the vast majority of packages are https github git repositories
[16:52:36] <Astrum|Lap> oh well, the FPGA is nice in either case
[16:52:42] <Astrum|Lap> I just wish I didn't have to use their crap
[16:52:46] <tiffany> I don't think that git is safe from tampering at all
[16:53:04] <Astrum|Lap> although technically someone is reverse engineering it (the lx9 anyway)
[16:53:05] <tiffany> but https helps
[16:53:13] <tiffany> I guess the vim situation is a bit better, then
[16:53:18] <Astrum|Lap> been workingo n it for years now, they still have a long way to go
[16:53:21] <tiffany> but vim package managers are awkward to use
[16:53:24] <tiffany> or at least they were when I used vim
[16:53:36] <scott> the one I use is dead simple
[16:53:44] <tiffany> in emacs I can just M-x list-packages, then hit u and x
[16:53:44] <scott> vim-plug. I think it's similar to vundle
[16:53:52] <tiffany> I have used vundle
[16:54:10] <tiffany> one thing I've noticed that makes managing vim packages annoying is that they often have components written in C/C++
[16:54:36] <tiffany> which of course have nightmarish fragmentation when it comes to their build systems
[16:54:40] <tiffany> and I am not helping in that regard
[16:54:46] <scott> I have one like that which requires recompilation (YouCompleteMe with its C++ and C# completion using libclang)
[16:54:53] <tiffany> my projects are all either using tup or python + ninja
[16:55:03] <scott> well, I don't think the C# part uses libclang

[16:56:20] <tiffany> cmake is probably the most painful build system I've ever used
[16:56:40] <scott> when YCM upgrades, I go to its dir and ./install.sh --clang-completer --omnisharp-completer
[16:56:47] <scott> then I'm good to go
[16:56:53] <tiffany> I think install.sh does something stupid which meant I couldn't use it
[16:57:06] <tiffany> it's been like a year though
[16:57:39] <tiffany> right now I just use company's own clang backend which works fine, it just doesn't have LCS

[17:02:34] <WindowsBunny> tiffany: Meanwhile people using VS with C# or C++ get wonderful autocomplete out of the box
[17:05:20] <tiffany> VS has the privilege of shipping with a compiler, windowsbunny
[17:05:27] <XMPPwocky> "compiler"
[17:05:30] <tiffany> and no, gcc doesn't count
[17:05:48] <tiffany> gcc refuses to expose an API comparable to libclang because of RMS thinking it will be used for evil
[17:06:10] <tiffany> so your options for autocomplete out of the box are: ship llvm
[17:06:49] <tiffany> I think there's some distribution of emacs which comes with an autocomplete plugin out of the box
[17:06:59] <tiffany> it might be that one that was abandoned
[17:07:33] <tiffany> VS is also a really large download
[17:07:53] <tiffany> emacs is 90 megabytes to download, vim is 25-30
[17:13:18] <Astrum|Lap> I thought gcc was changing direction
[17:13:23] <Astrum|Lap> and becoming more like llvm
