[01:24:41] <niconii> nil: has to do with srgb vs rgb
[01:26:04] <niconii> nil: basically, red/green/blue channels on monitors aren't actually linear (i.e. rgb(127,0,0) is not half as bright as rgb(255,0,0))
[01:26:27] <niconii> nil: and that's called the sRGB color space
[01:27:15] <niconii> nil: and the vast majority of images are in that sRGB color space
[01:27:44] <niconii> nil: but opengl uses linear math in its calculations (it uses the "RGB color space")
[01:28:13] <niconii> nil: so, if you want correct results, you want to load textures as sRGB (which converts them to RGB)
[01:28:23] <niconii> nil: do all your shading and calcualations and stuff
[01:28:37] <aatch> TL;DR: color be hard yo
[01:28:39] <niconii> nil: and then convert to sRGB again to display it -- this is called gamma correction
[01:29:25] <niconii> nil: glium uses sRGB framebuffers by default now (it used to be RGB)
[01:29:42] <niconii> nil: so basically, tl;dr, load your textures as sRGB

[01:31:24] <kmcguire> i dunnn
[01:31:24] <nil> so would I load them as sRGB via the image library, or when I create the texture itself from the loaded data?

[01:31:28] <FreeFull> No, he's saying that 0.5 is half as bright

[02:26:14] <kmcguire> well its far more complicated than i thought
[02:26:15] <Yurume> FreeFull: if my memory is correct, it's 1/2 - 1/3 - 1/4 - 1/5 - ... - 1/100? perhaps?
[02:26:19] <Yurume> 1/1018
[02:26:20] <Yurume> 1/101*
[02:26:35] <FreeFull> Yurume: Meant to be  1 - 1/2 + 1/3 - 1/4 + ...
[02:26:58] <Yurume> AFAIK -/ doesn't work in that way, but well, my J knowledge is shallow
[02:27:00] <FreeFull> playbot: (0..100).rev().map(|x| x + 1).map(|x| 1.0 / x as f64).fold(0.0, |b,a| a-b) // I'm not sure if that fold is right
[02:27:02] -playbot- 0.688172
[02:27:05] <kmcguire> hmm i just recently seen that series..
[02:27:12] <kmcguire> it reminds me of computing the digits of PI
[02:27:17] <FreeFull> Ok, that's better
[02:27:32] <FreeFull> Had b and a the wrong way around
[02:27:52] <FreeFull> kmcguire: It's actually approximating the natural log of 2
[02:28:05] <kmcguire> FreeFull, how well does it optimize?
[02:28:16] <FreeFull> The convergence isn't very good
[02:28:30] <FreeFull> You're better off calculating the natural log in the normal way
[02:29:15] <niconii> kmcguire: it's part of the APL family, where conway's game of life is a one-liner

[02:29:47] <niconii> kmcguire: so short J code doing lots of complex stuff isn't that surprising
[02:29:54] <FreeFull> kmcguire: J tends to be quick
[02:30:18] <kmcguire> well i will have to check it out
[02:30:20] <FreeFull> One thing about J is that you want to read it right to left
[02:31:00] <kmcguire> reminds me of my friend from egypt
[02:31:13] <FreeFull> 3 * 2 - 1 gives 3 in J
[02:31:33] <Yurume> (since it's 3 * (2 - 1))
[02:31:47] <Yurume> J is interesting, but my head is not ready for that
[02:32:09] <FreeFull> _1 + 3 * 2 gives 5 (_1 is -1)
[02:32:39] <kmcguire> 2 * 8 + _1 would be 14
[02:32:56] <kmcguire> why do it like that?
[02:33:17] <Yurume> kmcguire: other syntactic elements work better in that way, surprisingly.
[02:33:32] <kmcguire> that is a surprise

[12:18:47] <tomaka> oh you want to use glium/glutin for android?
[12:18:58] <kmcguire> yea
[12:19:03] <tomaka> \o/
[12:19:27] <tomaka> I'm not totally sure that glutin-android compiles though, but if it doesn't the fixes are probably easy
[12:19:50] <kmcguire> ok so instead of using `glutin` i need to use `glutin-android` ?
[12:19:55] <tomaka> nono
[12:19:57] <kmcguire> oh
[12:20:01] <tomaka> I mean the part of glutin that contains the code for android
[12:20:06] <sillesta> i've got an android to test against
[12:20:08] <kmcguire> oh ok i got it
[12:20:12] <tomaka> glutin has a lot of conditional compilation

[12:20:34] <kmcguire> ok ok well.. let me recompile rust for android and then give it a shot

[14:53:12] <kvark> eddyb: what works? you extended a lifetime?

[14:56:34] <eddyb> there is just no safe way to do it

[15:05:50] <eddyb> ugh. this probably can't work at all with actual lifetimes in the reset state
[15:05:55] <kvark> but what makes you think that 'a : 'b bound will hold?
[15:06:19] <kvark> in a real case, these are unrelated lifetimes
[15:06:23] <eddyb> it will always hold :P

[15:09:05] <eddyb> kvark: you can't do that
[15:09:24] <eddyb> Rust doesn't have a concept of unrelated lifetimes
[15:09:50] <eddyb> or rather, every lifetime is comparable to another lifetime
[15:09:54] <eddyb> total order something something
[15:10:12] <eddyb> at least lifetimes in reference values, passed around
[15:10:25] <kvark> so, supposing one lifetime is lines 1-3, and another is lines 4-6. How are they comparable?
[15:10:58] <eddyb> in that case they probably don't coexist
[15:11:21] <kvark> exactly
[15:11:39] <eddyb> which means you can't pass both of them to the same function
[15:11:50] <eddyb> which is a prerequisite for your initial question
[15:13:00] <kvark> well, with 'static thing I can do that
[15:13:29] <eddyb> so can you with 'a
[15:13:36] <eddyb> because 'a can be 'static
[15:13:52] <eddyb> you have to reset after each sub-block though

[15:14:32] <kvark> eddyb: yes, with 'static I can reset and continue. With your 'a: 'b reset doesn't help, it seems
[15:14:57] <eddyb> kvark: with 'a reset, the compiler will infer the lifetime "from the future"

[15:20:59] <kvark> it's not going to work for the real case though, because the use/reset cycles are non-local, so Rust will unlikely be able to get this "future" lifetime

[20:50:30] <kvark> Layl: no, we don't have anything like that, and I believe we should be. Context is provided by another library (glutin, glfw, sdl), so that's where the graphics card should be selected, AFAIK.

[20:51:02] <kvark> *and I believe we should NOT be
[20:51:37] <Layl> I'm asking because I'm getting a bug report from someone that has a mac mini who seemingly can't use GLSL 1.2 or 1.4 shaders
[20:51:50] <Layl> so I'm trying to figure out where the problem here would come in
[20:52:01] <Layl> because it seems to me that a mac gets its drivers bundled with it
[20:52:15] <kvark> Layl: are you using GLSL 1.2 or 1.4 shaders?
[20:52:27] <Layl> currently 1.4, previously 1.2
[20:52:36] <Layl> the problems appears with both
[20:52:39] <kvark> switch to 1.50 core, and OSX will work, but you'll cut off the lower HW
[20:52:49] <kvark> or provide both 120 and 150 core like our cube example does
[20:53:13] <Layl> I need ivec2 so I can't provide lower than 1.3
[20:53:38] <Layl> which is a bit of a shame since I probably want to support a lack of any graphics acceleration

[20:56:04] <kvark> it's a general problem with shaders and OSX, unrelated to gfx, at least until we have some sort of shader abstraction/generation
[20:57:32] <Layl> there's probably no chance of a software rendering backend to GFX is there
[20:57:36] <Layl> unless I write one myself
[20:58:06] <kvark> Layl: we are considering to have a Rusterize as a backend, but it didn't went past the talks

[21:00:21] <Layl> *shakes fists* appleeee
[21:00:22] <ytain> err that's only the version of glsl that is accepted
[21:00:43] <ytain> the mac mini here has intel hd3000
[21:01:51] <sillesta> it should be able to support 150
[21:02:23] <ytain> it doesn't, i tried

[21:02:39] <Layl> did you try "150" or "150 core"
[21:03:06] <ytain> yes
[21:03:14] <ytain> only #version 330 is accepted
[21:03:18] <sillesta> https://developer.apple.com/opengl/capabilities/index.html states that hd 3k does max 3.3
[21:03:31] <sillesta> 150 (3.2) should work
[21:03:38] <sillesta> :(
[21:03:39] <ytain> you can tell the user to download from mac app store the utility called glview
[21:04:16] <Layl> huh, apple's software rendering supports opengl 4.1
[21:04:20] <Layl> that's surprisingly high
[21:04:30] <kvark> sillesta: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZO_Dh70B2I there are more

[23:16:18] <LysanderAkili> hi
[23:17:01] <LysanderAkili> ran into weird issue.
[23:17:33] <LysanderAkili> src/main.rs:69:25: 69:35 error: use of undeclared type name `GLGraphics`
[23:17:34] <LysanderAkili> src/main.rs:69 fn draw_ui<'a>(gl: &mut GLGraphics, ui: &mut Ui<GlyphCache<'a>>, app: &mut APP) {
[23:17:53] <LysanderAkili> isn't it supposed to be GLGraphics due to recent changes? 
[23:18:06] <LysanderAkili> I updated all of the piston packages
[23:19:41] <LysanderAkili> oh haha wow, after three hours I already found the issue
[23:19:43] <LysanderAkili> xd

[23:32:31] <nil> LysanderAkili, yea that tends to be the standard with rust packages / modules, even for acronyms it's always Uppercase
[23:32:44] <nil> IRC would be Irc, and similar
