[01:27:46] <Ilari> Lol... Combine too big DH reuse times and side-channel-leaky DHE implementation. If you can dump the DHE private key, you can MITM connections (in TLS 1.2) until the private key changes. Even if the server prefers ECDHE.
[01:28:45] <Ilari> Oh, and thanks to the way DHE works, the implementation might very well be side-channel-leaky.

[19:13:38] <Ilari> SHA3-512 is horribly slow.
[19:16:18] <Ilari> It is already half the speed of SHA-512. And if you need to run two of those, one quater.
[20:12:32] <Tiffany> why does hardware support for crypto need to be integrated into the linux kernel?
[20:12:48] <Tiffany> it seems silly
[20:14:47] <eternaleye> Tiffany: Because Linux doesn't have a good story for userspace device drivers of any kind
[20:15:28] <eternaleye> Tiffany: It doesn't have cheap IPC, properly isolating devices requires hardware Linux doesn't want to hard-dep on (IOMMU), some hardware isn't isolatable even with that given how the kernel is designed, etc
[20:16:01] <Tiffany> I guess I was thinking more special case
[20:17:01] <Tiffany> I figure that anyone needing a hundred gigabits per second of crypto would be okay using a library which has the ability to mmap the hardware and deal with it from user space
[20:17:20] <Tiffany> and then doing it in software in user space when it's not available
[20:17:26] <eternaleye> "the ability to mmap the hardware" is the issue there.
[20:17:39] <eternaleye> That's what I meant about isolating devices
[20:17:45] <Tiffany> I was thinking mainly of how people hack together applications on the raspberry pi
[20:17:54] <eternaleye> Without an IOMMU, if that device has memory access, that's kernel root right there.
[20:18:04] <Tiffany> yeah, I guess
[20:18:08] <eternaleye> No chance of upstreaming.
[20:18:25] <Elaine> Tiffany: gpio is different though, it's like exposing a serial port.
[20:18:32] <Elaine> and decently standard interface.
[20:19:05] <Tiffany> it still seems like nobody would want to use this interface unless they knew for sure that hardware was sitting behind it
[20:19:11] <Tiffany> or it wouldn't be worth the context switch
[20:19:18] <eternaleye> Tiffany: Not needing libraries.
[20:19:28] <eternaleye> Tiffany: For embedded, that alone is a benefit
[20:19:32] <Tiffany> oh, I guess
[20:19:37] <Tiffany> and you probably have to do big batches to have reasonable perf
[20:19:56] <eternaleye> Also, if it can use sealed keys, it provides an isolation boundary
[20:20:00] <Elaine> plus I think the kernel needs a lot of stuff for ipsec etc
[20:20:12] <eternaleye> (The kernel already has sealed keys support)
[20:20:25] <eternaleye> Which can't be dumped to userspace without a kernel exploit
[20:20:53] <eternaleye> Actually, though...
[20:21:15] <eternaleye> If they add ECDSA support to the kernel, that alone is probably a key-dumping exploit, if userspace can control nonces.
[20:21:51] <eternaleye> And I very much doubt sealed keys get algorithm-locked, so that opens cross-protocol attacks
[20:22:01] <eternaleye> Ick.

[20:56:51] <eternaleye> Oh god, and the API provides raw RSA, not even something sane like padding it
[20:57:15] <eternaleye> https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/crypto/rsa.c
[20:57:34] <eternaleye> It just straight-out reads the message as a bigint, and does RSA.
[20:58:31] <eternaleye> That's vulnerable to malicious messages for key extraction, and almost certainly has massive timing leaks since it uses a general MPI kernel lib
[20:58:59] <eternaleye> nopenopenopenope
[20:59:26] <Ilari> And those timing leaks can presumably be used to dump the keys.
[21:00:51] <eternaleye> Probably, yeah.
[21:08:14] <eternaleye> It does seem to separate RSA keys from (hypothetical) DH keys from symmetric keys
[21:08:25] <eternaleye> Though I doubt it'll separate DH keys from DSA keys
