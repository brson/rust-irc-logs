[16:55:45] <acrichto> Seldaek: do you want to mock-out a design for https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/8965 ?
[16:56:47] <Seldaek> hmm yes I guess
[16:57:06] <Seldaek> if I manage to fix some other stuff before being too drunk :P
[16:57:10] <Seldaek> then I'll get on that
[16:57:17] <Seldaek> what stabilities are there?
[17:01:32] <acrichto> dbaupp: would know more than I would
[17:03:46] <Seldaek> ok, guess it's night-time there though
[17:03:50] <Seldaek> damn it :p
[17:04:52] <Seldaek> acrichto: but the thing is.. should we show something on every page or only show when it's not marked stable?
[17:05:04] <Seldaek> well, rather marked unstable
[17:05:14] <Seldaek> I think if nothing is there it shouldn't show anything
[17:06:01] <acrichto> yeah if there's nothing we shouldn't show anything
[17:28:24] <cmr> Seldaek: we have the same stabilities as nodejs
[17:28:40] <Seldaek> I don't know those :p
[17:28:54] <cmr> http://nodejs.org/api/documentation.html#documentation_stability_index
[17:28:54] <Seldaek> but they do have docs ;) http://nodejs.org/api/documentation.html
[17:29:23] <Seldaek> good, gives me color codes already
[17:35:00] <Seldaek> they do it once per module though it seems?
[17:35:07] <Seldaek> where does rust have it?
[17:35:26] <cmr> it can be an attribute on any item.
[17:35:52] <cmr> https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/8921
[17:36:33] <cmr> The lints currently only check the "edges" of the AST: i.e. functions,
[17:36:35] <cmr> methods[2], structs and enum variants. Any stability attributes on modules,
[17:36:37] <cmr> enums, traits and impls are not checked.
[17:39:28] <Seldaek> mkay
[17:39:50] <Seldaek> I'll try to make something generic enough that it can be placed anywhere
[17:39:57] <Seldaek> then let acrichto deal with the hard problem :P
[17:47:14] <Seldaek> it's sad
[17:50:07] <Seldaek> ah man 
[17:50:18] <Seldaek> wrong channel I guess
[17:50:18] <cmr> hm?
[17:50:24] <cmr> oh
[17:50:33] <Seldaek> no sadness here
[17:50:38] <Seldaek> move along
[17:50:39] <cmr> ok :P
[17:50:39] <Seldaek> :p
[18:04:40] <Seldaek> acrichto, cmr: http://seld.be/rustdoc/master/std/cleanup/fn.debug_mem.html ?
[18:05:06] <cmr> https://github.com/mozilla/rust/blob/master/src/libstd/cleanup.rs#L58
[18:05:12] <cmr> What is that ever even supposed to do? :P
[18:05:18] <Seldaek> it's not amazing but I had too much beer and I am satisfied with it for now :P
[18:05:18] <acrichto> seems kinda small
[18:05:33] <Seldaek> okay 
[18:05:39] <acrichto> looks fine to me though
[18:05:45] <acrichto> it's certainly better than nothing!
[18:05:46] <Seldaek> I thought, if it has to be applied on any item on a mod page or struct 
[18:05:51] <Seldaek> it shouldn't be too huge
[18:06:01] <cmr> I like it
[18:06:05] <Seldaek> but if it's for the main item we could make it bigger
[18:06:20] * acrichto peers at the css
[18:07:05] <Seldaek> it's all at the end
[18:07:09] <Seldaek> all the non mangled stuff
[18:07:24] <cmr> I notice that the [src] and the stability block isn't lined up with the fqn
[18:07:30] <cmr> And now that I've noticed it I can't unnotice it
[18:07:47] <Seldaek> hehe
[18:07:56] <Seldaek> what has been seen can not be unseen yes
[18:08:07] <Seldaek> the stability is I think
[18:08:14] <Seldaek> the src block is a stub anyway we need an icon
[18:08:26] <Seldaek> and it's not in the rust-rustdoc anyway
[18:08:29] <Seldaek> so not emergency
[18:08:41] <cmr> http://i.imgur.com/sIpblDF.png
[18:08:50] <cmr> yeah
[18:08:54] <cmr> it's just... irking me :P
[18:09:31] <Seldaek> hm
[18:09:52] <Seldaek> in chrome the bottom of the text is pretty much alined
[18:10:10] <cmr> ah well
[18:10:23] <cmr> can only do so much with the web
[18:10:26] <Seldaek> cross-platform/browser line height is a bitch :/
[18:11:15] <cmr> http://i.imgur.com/V12Zic6.png mm
[18:11:56] <Seldaek> the unstable is more or less ok no?
[18:12:35] <cmr> yeah
[18:12:55] <Seldaek> also what's with the ugly blue gradient :p
[18:13:09] <Seldaek> I mean, that is a lot more disturbing than a 1px misalignment
[18:13:20] <cmr> school computer
[18:13:36] <cmr> although I'm the maintainer of this lab image, so I could change it :p
[18:13:46] <Seldaek> yeaaah, I'm glad to be old :p
[18:14:32] <Seldaek> we had such awful school machines they wiped the full disk every reboot, after a year of use it took them 15-20min to boot because the drives were so damaged
[18:15:04] <Seldaek> and obviously someone thought it was fun to turn them off every evening
[18:15:19] <cmr> yikes
[18:15:43] <cmr> This lab is setup to pxeboot linux and use nbd for the root drive, with a ramdisk for local modifications
[18:15:44] <Seldaek> anyway acrichto do you need anything else from me for now? I guess it's fairly straightforward with the css?
[18:16:12] <Seldaek> that sounds a lot saner.. then again, it wasn't a CS school
[18:16:18] <Seldaek> can't really blame them
[18:16:47] <cmr> yup. this is the open source labs, we are self-managed. the official school computers are much messier :)
[18:20:28] <acrichto> Seldaek: nah that should be good, thanks!
[18:32:19] <Seldaek> acrichto: np, the border-colors are the same as node btw
[18:32:39] <Seldaek> so it's totally standard compliant or something
[18:33:06] <acrichto> lol
[18:35:03] <Seldaek> acrichto: actually, maybe instead of the border: line, use "border-left: 5px solid #000;" if you like this better: http://seld.be/rustdoc/master/std/cleanup/fn.debug_mem.html
[18:35:30] <Seldaek> then I'll probably come back with a new version later when I show the girlfriend and she screams at me :p
[18:36:20] <acrichto> aye aye

[19:52:39] <acrichto> dbaupp: there aren't any current examples of stability attributes in libstd/extra now, are there?
[19:54:09] <acrichto> Seld: are you Seldaek but with less ake?
[19:54:11] <acrichto> aek*
[19:54:26] <acrichto> huh, anyway, #[deprecated = "foo"]
[19:54:35] <acrichto> the message doesn't really have a great spot in the documentation right now
[21:37:08] <dbaupp> acrichto: no, I don't think so (although there is a testcase)
[21:37:26] <acrichto> dbaupp: eh yeah I just wrote a small one and saw what it looked like
[21:37:35] <dbaupp> acrichto: and deprecated, experimental, unstable, stable, frozen and locked are the levels (syntax::attr has an enum)
[21:38:04] <acrichto> ended up using attr::find_stability
[21:38:08] <acrichto> yay for keeping things in sync
[21:38:16] <dbaupp> yup, that's what it's for :)
[23:24:23] <cmr> acrichto: is the search broken? http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/master/std/index.html
[23:24:32] <cmr> Hm, no
[23:24:36] <cmr> Well
[23:24:38] <cmr> Maybe?
[23:24:43] <cmr> I typed in "set" and nothing visibly changed.
[23:25:01] <acrichto> weird
[23:25:04] <acrichto> Seld: ^
[23:25:14] <acrichto> I may have an old version of the JS
