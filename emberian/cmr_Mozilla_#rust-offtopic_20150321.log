[01:44:24] <tiffany> you should not be using mongo as an SQL replacement
[01:44:31] <Astrum|Lap> (it was a joke)
[01:44:37] <tiffany> oh good

[01:45:49] <Astrum|Lap> if javascript and SQLs inbred cousin had a baby, it'd be mongo
[01:46:29] <tiffany> it's hard for me to take mongo seriously
[01:46:51] <tiffany> if you care so little about your data that you're letting to drop it on the floor after a power failure, why are you saving it in the first place? piping to /dev/null would be much faster

[01:49:06] <scott> you can't just say that. we need evidence
[01:49:12] <scott> please benchmark /dev/null
[01:49:22] <tiffany> the one thing mongo has going for it versus other nosql stores is that it at least doesn't irreparably corrupt itself after a failure
[01:49:37] <tiffany> since when it flushes, it writes an entirely new file, then replaces the old one
[01:50:46] <tiffany> although
[01:51:04] <tiffany> unlink() + link() isn't atomic
[01:51:19] <tiffany> so it would need some way of looking for new database files that haven't been link()ed yet on startup
[01:51:24] <tiffany> I wonder if it has such a thing

[03:09:01] <cmr> I guess that makes sense as a place to put it

[03:11:27] <cmr> my heart hopes that the analytics on how many people turn off autoplay will make the "feature" go away, but I suspect that more people just want to watch cat videos, and are happy if the google overlords decides which video to play next so they don't have to.
[03:13:15] <XMPPwocky> i have the issue that youtube suggestions knows "videos related to a political issue are related"

[03:14:12] <cmr> that'd be interesting. sentiment analysis on the automated transcripts to not suggest opposing sentiment.
[03:14:29] <cmr> as a basic first-pass.
[03:14:55] <tiffany> youtube suggestions are great for conspiracy theorists
[03:15:00] <tiffany> non-stop ufo videos
[03:16:02] <XMPPwocky> it also doesn't shy away from recommending... abrasive things
[03:16:05] <XMPPwocky> so you walk away from a video on, say, kittens being great
[03:16:20] <XMPPwocky> and you come back to "ALL KITTENS SHOULD BE THROWN INTO A FIRE
[03:16:26] <Astrum|Lap> echo chamber
[03:16:53] <scott> the main thing for them to optimize is getting people to watch "just one more" video (specifically to see the ads on it)
[03:17:12] <Astrum|Lap> I'm so sick of ads on youtube
[03:17:20] * scott uses an adblocker
[03:17:22] <Astrum|Lap> especially the stupidly long ones attached to a 1:30 video
[03:17:27] *** Havvy[Hex] is now known as Havvy
[03:17:28] <XMPPwocky> .. you know, this autoplay thing is probably going to make youtube's stats worse
[03:17:32] <cmr> one of my friends has started exclusively getting ads in russian.
[03:17:35] <XMPPwocky> as far as how well their ads perform
[03:17:37] <cmr> it's hilarious
[03:17:42] <Astrum|Lap> there was some unimaginably long ad for... I dunno, wal-mart or something the other day
[03:17:46] <XMPPwocky> cmr: oh yeah i watched a daddy yankee video once and got spanish ads for weeks
[03:17:51] <Astrum|Lap> it was easily 10x longer than the clip
[03:17:54] <tiffany> I don't mind youtube ads all that much
[03:17:58] <XMPPwocky> and interestingly, targeted ads about the .SOY tld
[03:18:01] <XMPPwocky> i'm white as heck
[03:18:07] <scott> can't they all be skipped after 5 seconds?
[03:18:10] <Havvy> There probably shouldn't be ads on videos less than 2 minutes long.
[03:18:12] <tiffany> what does that have to do with anything?
[03:18:12] <cmr> scott: no, not all of them
[03:18:17] <scott> ah
[03:18:31] <tiffany> scott: only the ones longer than 30 seconds
[03:18:46] <cmr> not even all of those, IME
[03:18:46] <Astrum|Lap> erm... well this ad was super long
[03:18:50] <Astrum|Lap> and Id idn't see any skip button
[03:19:11] <tiffany> most youtube ads are okay for me
[03:19:16] <tiffany> you know what's the worst?
[03:19:21] <cmr> I agree, youtube ads don't bother me most of the time.
[03:19:25] <tiffany> on pandora, getting the same exercise DVD ad every single time
[03:19:31] <cmr> eugh yeah
[03:19:33] <tiffany> the same, extremely abrasive ad
[03:19:34] <tiffany> every time
[03:19:59] <tiffany> also terrible is sites with shitty video players which force you to watch a 1080p ad
[03:20:08] <tiffany> so it loads like .2 seconds of ad, plays it, then waits .8 seconds to buffer
[03:20:14] <WindowsBunny> lol
[03:20:17] <tiffany> for 5 minutes
[03:20:27] <XMPPwocky> Youtube should be preloading the video you actually wanted to watch while the ad plays
[03:20:30] <XMPPwocky> and yet
[03:20:37] <WindowsBunny> Since I only use html5 on youtube, and I use an adblocker, I've never seen any video ads on youtube at all lately
[03:20:50] <tiffany> I use the html5 player but I don't have an adblocker
[03:20:50] <XMPPwocky> ooh, you know they should do
[03:20:53] <Astrum|Lap> XMPPwocky: yeah
[03:21:00] <tiffany> I removed abp when I discovered that it was literally doubling my memory usage
[03:21:03] <WindowsBunny> tiffany: get ublock
[03:21:06] <tiffany> and haven't bothered to try ublock
[03:21:07] <Astrum|Lap> but then again I'm pretty sure that happens on hulu
[03:21:10] <Astrum|Lap> which I will never use
[03:21:16] <Astrum|Lap> (again)
[03:21:17] <WindowsBunny> ublock is so nice
[03:21:28] <scott> I switched from abp to ublock a few months ago
[03:21:35] <scott> no noticeable changes other than reduced memory usage
[03:22:28] <XMPPwocky> Anyways, you know what YouTube should do
[03:22:43] <Astrum|Lap> disable all comments?
[03:22:48] <XMPPwocky> Cache the *next ad* they'll play in Web Storage
[03:23:00] <XMPPwocky> then, when you load a page, the ad can insta-play with no buffering
[03:23:07] <XMPPwocky> and they can load the video in the background
[03:23:15] <scott> they don't know the ad in advance
[03:23:18] <scott> it depends on the video
[03:23:27] <XMPPwocky> oh, didn't know they did that
[03:23:52] <scott> everything is targeted these days
[03:24:09] <tiffany> kindle caches ads
[03:24:13] <XMPPwocky> well sure, but i didn't think they'd specifically go on the current video
[03:24:14] <Astrum|Lap> that's the laziest targetting ever
[03:24:30] <tiffany> because there's no guarantee of internet access

[03:42:36] <tiffany> there was only one original
[03:42:53] *** Quits: swgillespie (swgillespie@moz-rn1.vmq.232.104.IP) (Quit: My MacBook Pro has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[03:42:56] <tiffany> the original movie didn't age too well, unfortunately
[03:43:00] <tiffany> but it's still pretty fun
[03:43:09] *** zz_kimundi is now known as kimundi
[03:43:28] <tiffany> the CGI was pretty mind blowing for the time period, but they don't stand up too well today
[03:43:50] <tiffany> it was all rendered on a PDP-10
[03:43:54] <cmr> I'm willing to write off aged CGI, but I think the whole premise is dumb and find the plot unenjoyable.
[03:43:57] <tiffany> using straight CSG rendering rather than triangles
[03:44:04] <tiffany> why is the premise dumb?
[03:44:19] <tiffany> okay

[03:45:18] <tiffany> I gave it the benefit of the doubt and quite enjoyed the movie myself
[03:45:39] <Astrum|Lap> I think we were in that weird gap for a while where everyone tried cg but cg wasn't good enough yet
[03:45:49] <Astrum|Lap> now movies look amazing

[03:46:25] * Astrum|Lap knows what a homomorphism and monoid is
[03:46:26] <tiffany> hardcore category theory
[03:46:44] <tiffany> but yeah, movies do look pretty damn good these days
[03:46:53] <tiffany> the aesthetic of tron legacy is just so good
[03:47:14] <tiffany> black mirror surfaces and neon lights make for an amazing combination
[03:47:50] <tiffany> the costumes are pretty interesting too
[03:47:52] <Astrum|Lap> though now we tend to overuse cg
[03:47:57] <Astrum|Lap> *cough* star trek *cough*
[03:48:07] <tiffany> I liked star trek's use of bloom and HDR
[03:48:27] <tiffany> people sure did complain about the lens flare though
[03:48:57] <Astrum|Lap> though perhaps that was a subtle homage to the first star trek movie's hours of kaleidoscope 'special effects'
[03:49:19] <Zoxc> Astrum|Lap: Do you like Forbidden Planet?
[03:49:40] <Astrum|Lap> never seen it
[03:49:56] <cmr> I went into 2000 a space odyssey with a very wrong mindset, and was extremely disappointed, especially by that endless "breakthrough special effect" scene
[03:50:02] <tiffany> I liked forbidden planet
[03:50:11] <tiffany> oh yeah
[03:50:15] <tiffany> I didn't like that scene either cmr
[03:50:16] <cmr> having read the book and rewatched it (and grown up a lot) I appreciate it more but... even still.
[03:50:18] <tiffany> it lasts 20 minutes btw
[03:50:26] <tiffany> I loved the movie overall though
[03:50:48] <tiffany> I look forward to 3001: the final odyssey
[03:50:55] <Astrum|Lap> I don't even remember 2000 a space odyssey well
[03:51:04] <tiffany> it's 2001
[03:51:10] <Astrum|Lap> shh
[03:51:12] <cmr> whoops, sorry
[03:51:14] <cmr> :P
[03:51:17] <tiffany> you should go and watch it
[03:51:32] <Astrum|Lap> I remember the obelisk... weirdness
[03:52:02] <Astrum|Lap> and space baby
[03:52:15] <cmr> I like the book a lot more than I like the movie. I'd recommend the book to anyone, but not the movie.
[03:52:24] <Zoxc> I remember walking inside a circle
[03:52:26] <tiffany> I haven't read the book
[03:52:52] <Astrum|Lap> ugh, this makes me want to watch a movie
[03:53:14] * Zoxc just saw The Imitation Game. Odd title
[03:53:35] <Astrum|Lap> I watched Metropolis a while ago
[03:53:39] <Astrum|Lap> that movie is amazing
[03:54:15] <Astrum|Lap> not the giorgio one btw
[03:56:19] <tiffany> that one is on my list to watch
[03:56:48] <Astrum|Lap> Metropolis?
[03:56:56] <tiffany> yeah
[03:57:13] <Astrum|Lap> it's very unusual
[03:57:40] <Zoxc> Opening Weekend: $1,070 (USA), Oh how nice
[03:57:40] <tiffany> I have found that my preference in movies has been increasingly towards the unusual
[03:57:44] <tiffany> or at least ones that have cult followings
[03:58:03] <Astrum|Lap> I tend to enjoy less mainstream stuff
[03:58:36] <Astrum|Lap> some of my favorite movies are Watchmen, Eternal Sunshine, and Paint Your Wagon, heh
[03:59:17] <cmr> One of my favorite movies to watch is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_IV, through mst3k.
[04:06:36] <Zoxc> Anyone like The Outer Limits reboot? =P
[04:07:34] <cmr> I loved it when I was younger (when it was still on TV), but only discovered that it was The Outer Limits the other week when a friend helped me remember what it was :P
[04:09:03] <Zoxc> What about First Wave? I find that very calming
[04:09:24] <cmr> haven't heard of it
[04:09:56] <cmr> though I may have seen it, I watched a lot of sci-fi channel when I was a kid.
[04:11:35] <Zoxc> I saw some of it when I was younger. No sci-fi channels here though (I think)

[05:07:06] <c74d> I think generally only Google ads (and the odd remaining non-JavaScript ad) survived my can't-load-.js-files-over-HTTP issue, though.
[05:09:49] <Astrum|Lap> I dunno how sourceforge is still a thing
[05:10:11] <Astrum|Lap> google code couldn't survive against github
[05:11:10] <Havvy> Google Code was never a commercial product either. It couldn't survive because it didn't have any backing.
[05:11:49] <Astrum|Lap> well... google backed it a bit...

[05:12:08] <Havvy> But AFAICT, 20% projects don't exist anymore.
[05:14:23] <c74d> My main guess at SourceForge's survival would be inertia. Though one of a slightly more conspiracy-theoristic bent could suspect propaganda from Eric Raymond (who I've heard rumored to be/have been a shareholder) or other warlords.

[05:22:20] <c74d> While I'm not saying any of them aren't "dead and outdated", there's still very much stuff on SourceForge that got pulled into my Gentoo system (I know because all those packages starting failing to fetch when I forbade fetching of sources over HTTP in favor of HTTPS). libpcre was the only one I remember, but there were plenty others.

[18:14:44] <Yurume> Gankro, well, grisu is faster but sometimes has to fall back to dragon.

[18:41:33] <barosl> *tape*?
[18:41:35] <Tobba> exactly!
[18:41:37] <tiffany> of course, it costs as much as a house, and that doesn't include the tape cartridges
[18:41:45] <Tobba> barosl: tape is really common for storing huge amounts of data

[18:42:09] <Tobba> clearly we need to upgrade Seek to u128
[18:42:09] <Gankro> Tobba: You'd need to set up such a SAN and then make a file that fills it
[18:42:19] <tiffany> there's a robotic arm which goes and gets each tape cartridge, and plugs it into the reader
[18:42:23] <Tobba> Gankro: I'll download the internet

[18:43:53] <Tobba> I was suggesting to make the worlds craziest RAID
[18:44:45] <Tobba> it would take like 9 million disks

[18:56:04] <c74d> oh, never mind me, I don't even know Rust....
[18:56:10] <tiffany> yeah, that scene looks silly to me
[18:56:28] <Hannibal_Smith> barosl, to me it was interesting how the security was handled by different IA, like giving "different opinion and work together" approach rather than a single IA to take all the actions
[18:56:45] <Hannibal_Smith> Something like MAGI from Evangelion
[18:58:40] <barosl> tiffany, The scene that I remembered was https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogvMnx-2nFg#t=4m35s
[18:58:49] <barosl> Although it manages books, which are more old-fashioned, rather than tapes!
[19:00:03] <barosl> Hannibal_Smith, The only thing I learned from Evangelion is, if you want to do something clever, you need to extract human brain to a machine!
[19:00:06] <tiffany> heh
[19:00:21] <barosl> Evangelion itself is an example, plus MAGI
[19:00:33] <tiffany> this is pretty cool though

[19:09:37] <tiffany> the old AI researchers who think that you could run a human-equivalent intelligence on a 1MHz CPU and a couple megahertz of memory were quite optimistic

[19:10:18] <Hannibal_Smith> Ahahah
[19:10:40] <tiffany> I think the current estimate is hovering around 2025 if moore's law holds, and that's for just having human-level intelligence, rather than emulating a human brain
[19:10:58] <tiffany> the latter is probably going to be pretty damn inefficient because of the substrate difference
[19:11:25] <Hannibal_Smith> Time will tell, as always

[21:24:31] <ogham> Wait: RJ-45 cables have eight pins, and SD cards have eight connectors. Just solder the ethernet wires to the SD card contacts! I did the maths, and 8 == 8, so it has to work.
[21:25:20] <Tobba> oh dear
[21:25:27] <Tobba> that could actually work in some really low speed mode
[21:25:32] <c74d> USB's Universal-ness scares me; I don't trust either of these systems, but I also don't want either doing untoward things to the other by pretending to be a HID.
[21:25:36] <ogham> It could!??
[21:26:03] <c74d> PCI cards are cards that need to be stuck in the side of the computer, right? I don't think there are any slots for those.
[21:26:19] <Tobba> PCI cards go inside
[21:26:33] <c74d> oh
[21:26:52] <ogham> PCMCIA maybe? I used to have an ethernet one of those, I think.
[21:27:06] <ogham> Not that that's any help, since you said you didn't have any slots.
[21:27:14] <ogham> I'm also thinking of laptops for some reason
[21:28:16] <c74d> The Windows system is a laptop, would there be room (and slots) inside? (And, how would I get the Ethernet cable in without a proper hole in the case?)
[21:28:20] <c74d> I don

[21:28:43] <c74d> 't have any PCI cards, anyway (as far as I know).
[21:28:57] <tiffany> laptops generally do not have free PCI slots
[21:28:58] <Tobba> c74d: okay so it's a really old laptop, but it should have some expresscard slot or something
[21:29:00] <c74d> ogham: Maybe? It's not hypothetical.
[21:29:05] <ogham> It might just be easier to download and upload whatever you need

[21:29:56] <Tobba> c74d: shouldn't it have built-in wifi at least

[21:30:13] <c74d> 2015-03-13 17:25:07 <c74d> I don't like this; I don't want to move into this future where I can't fall back to Ethernet if I need it.
[21:31:35] <ogham> You'll no doubt have to get some kind of adapter
[21:31:41] <ogham> It's the new cool
[21:31:43] <c74d> Tobba: it does, but I only want to connect it to the Internet through a proxy that only allows it to connect to whitelisted IP addresses.
[21:32:06] <c74d> hm
[21:32:10] <ogham> Couldn't you configure that at the router level?
[21:32:15] <tiffany> I wonder if host-to-host USB connection is a thing
[21:32:24] <Tobba> tiffany: it is
[21:32:31] <Tobba> I have a weird cable that does that, it's super old though
[21:32:38] <Tobba> fuck knows how that works, was probably proprietary
[21:32:48] <ogham> It's a thing, but I've never actually got it working
[21:33:06] <c74d> ogham: My router is a black box since I lost the optical disc with the control software, and I don't believe it was especially featureful anyway.
[21:33:13] <tiffany> you can apparently buy female-to-male USB cables

[21:34:25] <tiffany> and whether I will be able to directly link two computers and run ethernet over it
[21:34:40] <tiffany> I'm guessing one way would be to have one computer act as an ethernet device
[21:34:47] <tiffany> which probably requires controller support...
[21:34:55] <tiffany> oh yeah, and USB is request-based
[21:34:57] <tiffany> goddamnit
[21:37:07] <c74d> ...I could move the router from the main ISP connection point in the room where it currently is to a secondary ISP connection point in the room where the Ubuntu computer is, connect the Ubuntu computer to the router via Ethernet (it's currently connected via Wi-Fi), then set up the Ubuntu system as an ad-hoc Wi-Fi access-point, then have the Windows laptop connect to that access-point,
[21:37:08] <c74d> and run some program on the Ubuntu system to implement the whitelisting.
[21:37:09] <tiffany> I wish USB would get over the stupid request-based protocol already
[21:37:12] <tiffany> it's horrible
