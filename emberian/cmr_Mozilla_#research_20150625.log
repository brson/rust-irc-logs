[00:24:39] <mccr8> lkuper: ping
[00:25:16] <lkuper> mccr8: pong
[00:26:02] <mccr8> lkuper: so if you want to know about __exposedprops or whatever, you want an XPConnect person.
[00:26:18] <lkuper> mccr8: yeah, who would you suggest?
[00:26:32] <lkuper> just saw your tweet -- happy to wait until next week, it's not urgent
[00:27:20] <mccr8> lkuper: so there's Bobby Holley (bholley on IRC or bholley@mozilla.com) would probably work
[00:27:25] <mccr8> lkuper
[00:27:27] <mccr8>  err
[00:27:42] <mccr8> we have a big meeting this week, so probably IRC is not a great way to get in touch right now
[00:27:49] <mccr8> but you can just fire off an email
[00:27:51] <lkuper> yeah, I noticed
[00:27:59] <mccr8> just explain you are at intel and working on river trail or whatever
[00:28:22] <mccr8> lkuper: another person would be Gabor Krizsanits (gkrizsanits@mozilla.com)
[00:28:23] *** Joins: mchang (mchang@moz-mmq.ebl.81.192.IP)
[00:28:49] <mccr8> So you could email one of them, or CC them both on it or something, and tell them I sent you if you want.
[00:29:04] <lkuper> I might just wait until next week and try finding them on IRC

[00:29:54] <mccr8> lkuper: I assume this is some problem like you are trying to use exposed props but it is broken now?
[00:30:15] <lkuper> I think so, but the error I'm seeing doesn't have to do with __exposedProps__ specifically
[00:30:51] <mccr8> I don't recall offhand if there is a guide to converting it but maybe there is.
[00:31:27] <lkuper> I just have this suspicion because it happens in this place where we are using this wrapper thing that uses __exposedProps__.
[00:31:39] <lkuper> issue filed here (it's really vague, unfortunately): https://github.com/IntelLabs/RiverTrail/issues/58
[00:31:46] <mccr8> lkuper: yeah it went through a lot of changes in the last few years, so that's possible.
[00:31:54] <mccr8> I don't know how old a version you were working against, or when it broke
[00:31:58] *** khuey|away is now known as khuey
[00:32:04] <lkuper> I think it may have just broken in FF38?
[00:32:20] <lkuper> I should check some other versions to be sure
[00:32:22] <mccr8> lkuper: ah ok.
[00:32:47] <mccr8> lkuper: you can use mozregression to bisect. it will get you down to a specific changeset.
[00:33:08] <mccr8> lkuper: which also could give you some information about what changed, if it was intentional.
[00:33:23] <mccr8> lkuper: but checking different versions first is reasonable too. ;)
[00:34:10] <mccr8> lkuper: if it is really some kind of recent regression then it wouldn't be unreasonable to file a bug in Core :: XPConnect, assuming you have some test case people can look at.
[00:34:14] <lkuper> it definitely still worked as of FF35

[00:35:08] <mccr8> (mozregression works by doing bisections using existing builds so it is pretty fast)
[00:35:18] <mccr8> http://mozilla.github.io/mozregression/
[00:35:24] <lkuper> yeah, just found it
[00:36:25] <mccr8> it looks like at least some of the wrapper work was in 36 (like https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1081985 ) so it is possible that something might just need to be fixed in the addon
[00:36:38] <mccr8> but bholley or gabor should be able to help you figure out what that is.
[00:37:27] <lkuper> awesome, that's what I'm hoping.  thanks for the leads
[00:37:49] <mccr8> np, let me know if you have any more problems figuring out what to do next
[00:38:11] <mccr8> you can email me (amccreight@mozilla.com) or find me on IRC or whatever
[00:40:11] <lkuper> cool, thanks again!
