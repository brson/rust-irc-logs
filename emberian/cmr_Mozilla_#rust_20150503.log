[03:12:31] <talchas> mkomitee: well, logically it would be wrapping a *mut krb5_principal_data
[03:12:52] <talchas> but if you don't want to bother defining an extra struct type you aren't using anyway, you could just call it void*
[03:13:01] <mkomitee> I was hoping I could treat that as an opaque ptr, since I won’t actually extract anything from it.
[03:13:09] <talchas> yeah, what you have works
[03:13:30] <mkomitee> It works in that it compiles & doesn’t segfault. It doesn’t work in that it doesn’t function.
[03:13:43] <talchas> it's just that C-api-wise that struct is krb5_principal_data, which is why you have the extra * in the fn
[03:13:46] <mkomitee> If you look at the examples/c/aname2lname.c file, that actually works.
[03:13:53] <talchas> well, I haven't looked at the code yet, just the types :P

[04:23:22] <talchas> you can truncate the vector to strlen(vec), which removes all the extras

[06:34:42] <darkfox> I see
[06:35:24] <woboats> My experience has been that boxed traits are of somewhat limited application.
[06:35:38] <reem> ^ agreed
[06:35:54] <Mutabah> woboats: They're good for arbitary APIs (like C++'s pure virtual classes)
[06:36:07] <reem> they’re often the “easy way out” at the cost of significantly reduced flexibility over generics
[06:36:20] <reem> but sometimes you do need them (mostly heterogenous collections)
[06:36:52] <woboats> The sad thing is that they're enticing because they're less verbose than generics.

[06:37:48] <reem> really the worst thing is the interaction with OIBITs like Send and Sync
[06:38:09] <darkfox> What I'm trying to do is parse a toml file - where some sections need to be parsed to specific structs that share a trait..
[06:38:11] <reem> you have to make those decisions up front, which is rarely what you want (most types prefer to not make a decision at all, and be usable in both contexts)
[06:38:22] <darkfox> All just config file parsing here.
[06:38:32] <reem> darkfox: Have you seen the toml crate?
[06:38:41] <darkfox> reem: I'm using it :)
[06:38:49] <woboats> darkfox: Is it possible to parse them instead to variants of an enum?
[06:39:01] <reem> Nice. So the issue I anticipate is that you can’t decode into a trait object because you don’t know what type you’re decoding to.

[06:41:29] <darkfox> That might work...

[10:21:59] <AngelOfSol> So I'm trying to write an iterator adaptor that works exactly like take_while EXCEPT that it doesn't consume the last element.  I got this so far: http://is.gd/wZSV3A.  For some reason though, it ends up consuming the last character and i have no idea why.

[10:32:47] <bluss> AngelOfSol: to truly both look at the next element and still have the iterator untouched, restrict it to clonable iterators only

[11:52:54] <FreeFull> Lilly: - is automatically changed into _ now
[11:53:06] <Lilly> yeah but the issue is the crate name is still rustc-serialize, so racer can't find the src
[11:53:12] <Lilly> because it looks for rustc_serialize
[11:53:37] <cmtptr> "If you’re matching on an enum which has variants, you can use .. to ignore the value and type in the variant" -- I can't use '_'?
[11:53:41] <FreeFull> This is just an issue with racer?
[11:53:44] <bluss> ah then racer needs to be updated for the new way it works
[11:53:50] <Lilly> Yeah I guess
[11:54:00] <bluss> cmtptr: _ is to ignore one field, .. is to ignore all or the rest
[11:54:07] <cmtptr> OptionalInt::Value(_) =>
[11:54:08] <cmtptr> ooh
[11:54:12] <cmtptr> okay, thanks
[11:54:16] <Lilly> Well I'm not completely sure that's the issue, but racer won't find any suggestions for rustc_serialize, but it will for other libraries

[13:09:38] <frankmcsherry> So I'm playing around and a bit confused. If I transmute a *const u8 to a *const T, but the alignment is wonky, what happens with std::slice::from_raw_parts? Seems to "behave" on playpen, but I thought dodgy alignment was supposed to make computers sad.

[13:12:29] <Mutabah> on other archs (e.g. ARM), accesses need to be aligned (or a fault is generated)
[13:12:43] <Mutabah> And x86 can have alignment faults turned on

[13:14:41] <SDX2000> but could you please tell me what is the best way of indexing into a string?
[13:15:01] <SDX2000> I am trying to write an expression parser in Rust
[13:15:18] <Mutabah> SDX2000: Iterate it
[13:15:27] <SDX2000> All the parsing algorithms on the internet they seem to use indexing heavily
[13:15:51] <SDX2000> how do you back track a stream?
[13:16:03] <SDX2000> I mean can you back track while you are iterating?
[13:16:12] <SDX2000> is there an elegant solution for this?
[13:16:20] <Mutabah> SDX2000: Not often iirc, but you can take a copy of the iterator
[13:16:41] <SDX2000> what about the char_at method
[13:16:46] <Binero> I have this odd error:
[13:16:48] <Binero> src/main.rs:1:1: 1:16 error: failed to resolve. Did you mean `self::rustc_serialize`?
[13:16:50] <Binero> src/main.rs:1 #![feature(plugin)]
[13:16:50] <Mutabah> SDX2000: That iterates internally
[13:17:01] <SDX2000> ohh so O(n) then?
[13:17:07] <Mutabah> SDX2000: Yep
[13:17:11] <SDX2000> :(
[13:17:17] <frankmcsherry> It seems like someone could/should write a &str/String wrapper that scans it once and determines the offsets of each character. It would save lots of trouble / questions, I think. :)
[13:17:34] <SDX2000> I guess cant help if underlying string is utf8
[13:17:41] <SDX2000> yeah :)
[13:17:42] <Mutabah> frankmcsherry: I don't see what would need to randomly index a string?
[13:17:50] <Mutabah> frankmcsherry: Even parsers can usually work with just a char stream
[13:17:57] <SDX2000> PEG parsers need to backtrack while parsing
[13:18:08] <Mutabah> SDX2000: You can state save iirc
[13:18:14] <frankmcsherry> Mutabah: See, it's just that folks would like that. :)
[13:18:17] <cmr> SDX2000: you can clone the iterator.
[13:18:25] <SDX2000> nice
[13:18:35] <Mutabah> Yep, clone the iterator at backtrack points
[13:18:37] <SDX2000> what is the overhead for cloning an iterator?
[13:18:41] <cmr> none
[13:18:41] <Mutabah> Pretty cheap operation
[13:18:48] <SDX2000> Very cool
[13:19:03] <SDX2000> thanks guys you have been super helpful
[13:19:07] <Mutabah> It's basically just taking a copy of two words (for string iterators, the internals are just &str, a fat pointer)

[13:59:34] <Mutabah> Manishearth: I assume that supports something like unsafe impls?
