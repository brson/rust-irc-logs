[06:36:12] <aatch> nmatsakis, '+m' is moderated, meaning only people with voice or higher can talk.
[06:38:19] <eddyb_> nmatsakis: nice to see you around :P
[06:46:33] <nmatsakis> eddyb_: hi :) been a long week.
[06:47:03] <eddyb_> hectic and short for me
[06:48:12] <eddyb_> sleeping during the day, spending nights watching prison break and mangling rustc
[07:36:02] *** Quits: laumann (thomas@moz-n9e72h.0.fullrate.dk) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[08:02:42] <jroesch> eddyb_: looks like your PR landed
[08:02:50] <jroesch> probably gonna break my PR in the queue 
[08:02:56] <eddyb_> my what?
[08:03:07] <eddyb_> I know it got r+d
[08:03:22] <eddyb_> jroesch: if you need r=niko on something let me know
[08:03:31] <jroesch> yeah no clue yet, just pretty sure
[08:03:46] <jroesch> I just got a GH notification from bors doing the merge
[08:04:44] <jroesch> ah maybe I mis-read it
[08:04:52] <jroesch> looks like it is still doing its thing
[08:04:56] <jroesch> not sure why I was notified 
[08:05:01] <jroesch> maybe bors doing merges
[08:05:14] <eddyb_> oh it went into testing
[08:06:02] <jroesch> nmatsakis: is going on vacation starting tomorrow-ish so hopefully we can make some progress w/o him
[08:06:27] <jroesch> I'm going to look into implementing default type parameter fallback in parallel next week
[08:06:49] <eddyb_> all the cool things are happening(!!)
[08:07:04] <eddyb_> jroesch: I can't make progress without '_ though
[08:07:21] <jroesch> eddyb_: yeah I feel good coming out of the work week
[08:07:25] <jroesch> I think we have a path forward
[08:07:33] <jroesch> Niko has a prototype MIR as well
[08:08:22] <jroesch> eddyb_: I'm gonna try to meet up with Niko for breakfast tomorrow and will see if we can talk it over before he leaves
[08:08:39] <aatch> jroesch, can you get him to put that MIR somewhere then?
[08:08:50] <jroesch> I'll ask, not sure if it is "done"
[08:09:27] <aatch> jroesch, don't really care, I'm just interested in what he has. I've been trying to figure out a good design for such a thing for ages.
[08:09:41] <jroesch> aatch: yeah we wrote out one on paper the other day
[08:09:51] <jroesch> afaik
[08:10:38] <jroesch> aatch: I'll inquire he is going to be on vacation for at least a week or so
[08:10:59] <eddyb_> a lot of this feels one year late
[08:11:54] <eddyb_> jroesch: actually, I'll have the last batch of exams next week so that's not too baf
[08:11:57] <eddyb_> *bad
[08:12:04] <jroesch> it would of been nice to have more, but we had so many other things going on last year
[08:12:44] <jroesch> eddyb_: yeah I was there a couple of weeks ago, no fun
[08:12:54] <eddyb_> I made the mistake of getting a summer job last year instead of hacking on the compiler
[08:13:13] <eddyb_> rustc is love, rustc is life
[08:13:15] <jroesch> have to pay the bills at some point ;)
[08:13:23] <jroesch> I've also been there as well
[08:14:05] <eddyb_> jroesch: pay me to develop an industry-grade compiler instead of doing tech support tyvm
[08:14:52] <eddyb_> worst of all the exams is the Romanian one, mostly literature
[08:15:12] <eddyb_> there is a pretty good chance I'll fail it and not much I can do about it
[08:15:51] <eddyb_> but that's Monday and after that I can start living a more specialized life
[08:17:01] <eddyb_> aatch: I've heard arielb1 has an updated branch of your TyDef work
[08:17:10] <eddyb_> do you know anything about that?
[08:17:18] <jroesch> ahhh the feeling of exams on horizon, I was paranoid about failing undergraduate chemistry for the past 3 weeks before finishing my B.S/M.S work
[08:17:28] <aatch> eddyb_, nope. I vaguely remember it being mentioned.
[08:17:41] <eddyb_> it would clean up a bunch of stuff in my recent refactor
[08:18:05] <jroesch> I'm gonna sleep talk to everyone tomorrow, will probably have a chance to get some actual work done now that the ww is over
[08:18:08] <eddyb_> a bunch of Ty methods take tcx. I kept them on Ty so that I can remove the argument later
[08:18:19] <eddyb_> jroesch: seeya
[08:19:35] <eddyb_> aatch: the 1.7 compiler is going to be so neat :D
[08:20:01] <aatch> eddyb_, heh, hopefully.
[08:21:15] <eddyb_> I am tempted to make Block into a monad
[08:21:28] <eddyb_> so DatumBlock becomes Block<Datum>
[08:22:10] <eddyb_> Block defaults to Block<()>
[08:23:38] <eddyb_> well, not so much a monad
[08:23:55] <eddyb_> because you need the extra stuff in Block
[08:24:17] <eddyb_> but working with it generically
[08:25:34] <eddyb_> hmm
[08:25:41] <eddyb_> B<Datum>
