[00:10:57] <bstrie> zwarich: how would we do that? what certificates would a user use to verify it?
[00:13:53] <Eridius> note that the script is being loaded over https, so if you trust the normal SSL certificate infrastructure (which people do every day with important passwords) then you should be ok
[00:14:22] <bstrie> Eridius: right, which is why this entire debate is silly, but it doesn't keep goobers on the internet from making a fuss about it
[00:15:14] <brson> yeah, the thing that worries me most is just bugs in all that sh code running as root, not that it will be mitmd
[00:15:32] <Eridius> brson: agreed, which is why it would be nice if the script itself could request sudo only when necessary

[00:21:32] <c74d> If the script's signature verifies, it's less likely that there's malware in it; the key might be tampered with, but if it's verified through the web-of-trust, it's less likely to have been, and the same for the keys that signed the Rust key, and the keys that signed those keys, and the keys that signed those… 
[00:21:37] <GBGamer> if anyone's wondering from earlier: I ended up just switching to get_unchecked() instead of taking away bounds checking on indexing
[00:21:55] <GBGamer> (because, turns out, there is a get_unchecked() that I didn't realize existed
[00:21:58] <GBGamer> )
[00:22:51] <c74d> I certainly wouldn't say that signing releases completely prevents malware from being injected into them uncaught (even if people check the signatures), but I do think it helps.

[00:33:54] <brson> Eridius: noted. i'm not familiar, but that looks like a much more usable service than plain gpg
[00:35:00] <Eridius> yeah, it's more friendly, but the really big win is it lets you easily validate through other trusted sites (especially social media sites) that the key you're looking at belongs to the person in question
[00:35:13] <Eridius> so you can look at that pgp.mit.edu link and see my name, but you don't know the key is actually mine unless you trust someone else who's signed it
[00:35:45] <Eridius> but with keybase.io you can see that my public twitter account, my reddit account, 3 domains I control, my hacker news account, etc. are all serving as proof that the key is mine
[00:36:02] <Eridius> https://keybase.io/eridius
[00:37:03] <scott> and keybase makes you verify those connections by proving you control the accounts on the other services?
[00:37:25] <scott> I see, it has links to the proof
[00:37:28] <Eridius> yeah, you have to post a thing on those various services (for example, with GitHub you have to post a gist) that contains a cryptographic signature of a statement claiming ownership of the key
[00:37:34] <Eridius> and the proofs have to be persistent, so other people can verify them later
[00:38:10] <Eridius> and people can publicly "track" each other, which basically means posting a signature listing all of the proofs they validated for someone, so you can use those trackings as further verification
[00:38:58] <Eridius> which serves as protection against someone gaining ownership of someone else's account and deleting all the existing proofs and substituting their own fake proof (if they've compromised the person's account elsewhere, or otherwise spoofed them)
[00:39:11] <cgaebel> we should also be allowed to sign our crates.io releases with gpg (or some nice shortcuts for keybase) :P
[00:39:21] <Eridius> because if that user was tracked by anyone else, those tracking statements now serve as evidence that the previous proofs were deleted

[00:42:11] <GBGamer> brson: what is a "mergfunc"
[00:42:30] <GBGamer> Because, I'm an enterprising student :P
[00:42:53] <aatch> brson, maybe a better option is to make a more robust "type use" analysis.
[00:43:44] <aatch> brson, since a lot of our bloat is from things like the `len` method on Vec<T>
[00:43:57] <aatch> Which doesn't depend on T at all.
[00:45:27] <GBGamer> aatch: maybe allow for implementations on Type<T> which don't depend on T
[00:45:42] <aatch> GBGamer, well Vec as a whole still does.
[00:45:46] <Eridius> impl Vec<_> { fn len() ... }
[00:45:50] <GBGamer> i.e., impl Trait for Vec { /* you can't access any of type T here */ }?
[00:46:14] <Eridius> although that would be really iffy, for example, the offset of a field from the start of the struct depends on all previous fields
[00:46:22] <Eridius> so it would be hard to explain what things you can and can't do in such a definition
[00:46:37] <aatch> Well I was thinking that you could use an effects-based system.
[00:46:41] <Eridius> "you can't access any fields of the struct if any previous field uses the type parameter"
[00:46:44] <cgaebel> why syntax changes? what's wrong with just an optimization pass that detects this?
[00:47:05] <aatch> Based on field access, at least as a first step.
[00:47:18] <aatch> Using pretty much what Eridius said.
[00:47:28] <GBGamer> perhaps a thing that says, if you don't access any fields of type T, then optimize
[00:47:38] <GBGamer> (that function)
[00:47:41] <aatch> GBGamer, still doesn't work.
[00:47:55] <aatch> GBGamer, since the offset of the field can depend on type T
[00:48:07] <GBGamer> doesn't rust have undefined structs?
[00:48:17] <GBGamer> sorry, I don't know what to call that

[00:51:11] <aatch> At any rate, you might not be able to rearrange the fields.
[00:51:26] <aatch> Since if we did implement it, we'd need an opt-out.
[00:51:39] <GBGamer> #[repr(C)]
[00:51:39] <GBGamer> ?
[00:51:50] <Eridius> today, the only way to get a guaranteed field order is #[repr(C)]
[00:52:27] <aatch> Does that work on generic types?
[00:52:47] <GBGamer> I think so?
[00:52:50] <GBGamer> let me check
[00:53:00] <huon> yes
[00:53:12] <aatch> At any rate, why use an algorithm that doesn't work in that case?
[00:53:36] <brson> GBGamer: the simplest analysis to do might be to look for functions with a single type param with no bounds. every instance of that function for types with the same size/align should be identical
[00:53:52] <brson> that analysis alone would apply to a lot of Option and Vec fns
[00:54:09] <Eridius> that's only true if the function also doesn't reference the type T anywhere
[00:54:19] <GBGamer> brson: very true
[00:54:33] <GBGamer> Eridius: that's what brson's saying
[00:55:03] <GBGamer> Also, you'd have to differentiate between NonZero and Zeroable
[00:55:11] <aatch> not if the function contains, say, `needs_drop::<T>`
[00:55:14] <huon> brson: types can have an implicit Drop bound

[01:01:03] <aatch> How about something a bit more constructive? I'd prefer an analysis that can be changed without it breaking everything. Which was part of the problem the old type-use stuff had.
[01:02:17] <aatch> Rather than trying to figure out cases where the type parameter doesn't matter, define when the type parameter doesn't matter. You can always build on top of that.
[01:03:02] <aatch> Especially if we can avoid doing *any* type substitution to start with.
[01:03:55] <aatch> Since there are cases (especially in methods) where the type parameter is irrelevant.

[01:09:24] <aatch> brson, I might write something up. My idea basically boils down to: rather than find specific cases we can optimize, eliminate type parameters we don't need.
[01:10:41] <huon> there are now 2000 [rust] questions on stack overflow
[01:12:35] <aatch> It also opens up the potential for doing stuff like splitting functions based on potential type parameter properties. I imagine that the only significant difference between many functions taking a `&T` where T:?Sized, is the Sized-ness of T

[02:36:42] <aatch> GBGamer, well I'm doing it in terms of dependence on type parameters. specifically whether or not the size/alignment of the type is dependent on the input parameters (with a little fudging to handle stuff like Box<T>)
[02:37:46] <aatch> GBGamer, for functions, it's a bit like an effect (similar to unsafe), where dependence is based on the function signature and the body of the function.
[02:39:51] <aatch> And only a few expressions actually make a difference if the signature isn't dependent on the type.
[02:41:09] <aatch> Basically, if you have a value whose type has a dependence on a parameter, you access a field with an offset with a dependence and call a function with a dependence.
[02:41:39] *** zz_kimundi is now known as kimundi
[02:42:02] <aatch> There's a few details I haven't worked out yet, like method calls (since method selection may be dependent on the type parameter).
[02:42:50] <GBGamer> aatch: where would method selection be dependent on type parameter?
[02:43:46] <GBGamer> (where you could have some of them be calling the same function)?

[02:45:03] <aatch> GBGamer, like I said, I'm not sure. I have a feeling that it'll only matter if the method being called is dependent on a type parameter, and therefore it just works out.

[04:08:56] <GBGamer> *** No rule to make target `.../src/rustllvm/ExecutionEngineWrapper.cpp'
[04:08:57] <kmc> RAII is about tying resources to object lifetimes, not to scopes
[04:09:13] <kmc> it would only make sense to use RAII for this if we had an object that is unconditionally tied to a scope
[04:09:18] <kmc> i.e. non-movable types
[04:09:24] <bstrie> zwarich: "abandon RAII" is fud
[04:09:38] <kmc> abandon RAII for this particular case where it doesn't actually work
[04:09:39] <zwarich> bstrie: "not use RAII for this use case"?
[04:09:52] <bstrie> zwarich: I'll take that :)
[04:10:06] <zwarich> the main lesson I took from it all is to follow the academic forms of substructural type systems more closely
[04:10:09] <zwarich> linear means linear damnit

[04:11:14] <kmc> it's orthogonal to linear vs. affine, isn't it?

[04:14:36] <kmc> in a more strict linear type system you can't get anything done ;)
[04:14:38] <GBGamer> it's the latest git repo
[04:14:52] <GBGamer> x86_64-unkown-linux-gnu
[04:15:02] <kmc> I don't think Rust's exact combo of linearity + borrowing (inherently non-linear) has been studied adequately in the literature
[04:15:11] <kmc> but maybe I missed it
[04:15:12] <Gankro> Ok that's the premiere target plaform so that *should* definitely work :)
[04:15:15] <zwarich> kmc: Rust's borrowing is not that different than Cyclone's borrowing
[04:15:30] <GBGamer> Gankro: I agree :P
[04:15:53] <Gankro> GBGamer: Have you tried a make clean or even deleting the git repo and recloning? Sometimes stuff gets in a bad state, particularly with accidentally commiting a change to a submodule
[04:15:55] <aatch> Eh, a stricter linear type system would be a bit more cumbersome. I don't think it'd prevent you from doing much though.
[04:16:51] <GBGamer> I actually just recloned
[04:17:01] <GBGamer> although I can try again
[04:17:06] <Gankro> GBGamer: Shoot
[04:17:09] <zwarich> and there has been a lot of study of mechanisms that allow you to temporarily treat values of linear type as unrestricted
[04:17:24] <kmc> yeah
[04:17:29] <kmc> I've read about adoption and focus, for example
[04:17:39] <kmc> still, what Rust does is a bit different
[04:17:49] <GBGamer> actually, I remember; it was working earlier, but a dropbox error made me have to reclone
[04:17:59] <GBGamer> perhaps another fucked it up again?
[04:18:18] <GBGamer> (another dropbox error)
[04:18:50] <zwarich> kmc: I'm also not sure I like automatic destructors
[04:19:19] <zwarich> kmc: with true linear types you could just have them be regular functions
[04:19:29] <zwarich> kmc: and avoid the complexity of destructors in your language
[04:19:48] <aatch> Since the compiler would complain if you didn't call the "destructor".
[04:19:51] <kmc> yeah but then you have to call them :P
[04:19:58] <kmc> I think that's valuable sometimes but not a sensible default

[04:20:56] <Gankro> oh wait lol those instructions are 3 years old
[04:21:06] <kmc> you could have  trait Drop { fn drop(self); }  as a run of the mill trait
[04:21:08] <GBGamer> it's still got mozilla git repo :P
[04:21:12] <kmc> and make it derivable for structs
[04:21:30] <kmc> that might make explicit drops tolerable
[04:21:51] <zwarich> the most irreplaceable thing with static drops might be some pattern matching
[04:21:59] <zwarich> where the match compilation inserts the right drops
[04:22:37] <zwarich> explicit, not static
[04:22:44] <zwarich> that's another debate from the past :P
[04:23:33] <Gankro> zwarich: One nice thing about implicit drop is avoiding most needs for `goto cleanup` logic. Though again a kernel might want exactly that regardless. Kernels be crazy.
[04:24:09] <garming> nrc: what is the easiest way to relate the spans back to the AST? 
[04:24:22] <zwarich> Gankro: 'goto cleanup' doesn't seem that bad if it's statically checked
[04:24:33] <zwarich> Gankro: the control flow is still there, just hidden from you
[04:24:42] <nrc> garming: I don't think you can, I think you need to start with the ast and get the span for a  node
[04:24:43] <zwarich> Gankro: so if you're trying to audit your code you need to understand it anyways
[04:24:52] <Gankro> zwarich: You can't forget to goto cleanup with dtors, at least
[04:25:33] <zwarich> IIRC C++'s rules for initialization and destructors vs. goto are annoying
[04:26:34] <Gankro> GBGamer: Sorry I'm out of ideas. Seems like a corrupted repo but I can't say for sure (I know officially git+dropbox is supposed to be trouble, but I've never seen it happen to me)
[04:27:12] <GBGamer> Gankro: I decided to just keep my gits outside the thing
[04:27:21] <GBGamer> Dropbox directory
[04:27:32] <GBGamer> It seems to be working so far?
[04:27:55] <garming> nrc: that was the first sort of guess. so i would have to implement my own walker like Resolver but ignoring everything else i don't care about? 
[04:28:53] <Gankro> zwarich: I mean that's just an instantion of C++'s rules for X and Y are annoying ;)
[04:29:17] <nrc> garming: I would hope you could skip the visitor part altogether. If you know the name you want to resolve and where you want to resolve it, you shouldn't need to walk the AST

[09:41:00] <bstrie> nrc: I have foo.bar().baz().qux(), and if you wrap this line at 80 and try to line up the dots as per visual indentation then you'll be shoving the code as far to the right of the monitor as it goes
[09:41:11] <bstrie> it becomes a right-justified source file
[09:41:16] <Manishearth> haha
[09:41:55] <Manishearth> yeah, foo.bar().baz().qux() should wrap at the first dot
[09:42:14] <Manishearth> or hanging indent works too
[09:42:31] <nrc> I would wrap at the second dot and wrap the rest of the path to the same indent, ideally
[09:42:46] <nrc> then fallback to hanging if that didn't work
