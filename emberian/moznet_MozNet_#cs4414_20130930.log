[01:07:55] <dbaupp> hi
[01:08:08] <dbaupp> (I don't think anyone in here other than you is a cs4414 student btw :P )
[01:14:10] <zws3mb> ...well then, kind people looking to deal with stupidity and novices....
[01:36:48] <zws3mb> Anyone run into cannot borrow immutable dereference of & pointer as mutable?
[01:37:16] <zws3mb> seems like a straightforward error, but tracing my &pointer back, every declaration has been mutable
[01:37:33] <cmr> you're trying to do something like &mut *foo, where foo is a &T
[01:37:44] <cmr> What's your code?
[01:38:22] <zws3mb> let me clean it up, it's pretty horrible right now.
[01:52:16] <zws3mb> http://pastebin.com/WaeD5hXr
[01:52:31] <zws3mb> pastebin has syntax support for whitespace and brainfuck, but not for rust!?
[01:53:42] <zws3mb> I thoroughly apologize for the awful coding. Let me know what I can do to clarify here
[01:55:23] <dbaupp> Rust is pretty new :P
[01:55:35] <dbaupp> (gist.github.com supports Rust highlighting)
[01:56:12] <dbaupp> where's the error message pointing at?
[01:58:15] <zws3mb> line 5:14 match program.remove(0) error: cannot borrow immutable dereference of & pointer as mutable
[01:58:30] <zws3mb> among many others
[01:58:51] <dbaupp> ah, you're taking `line: &~[~str]`
[01:59:01] <dbaupp> which is a borrowed pointer to immutable/frozen data
[01:59:07] <dbaupp> so you need &mut ~[~str]
[02:03:54] <zws3mb> hmm, okay, thank you--will continue to think about this
