[05:53:06] <acrichto> brson: apparently sha1 was barely used in workcache, and it was only really used by rustpkg anyway
[05:53:21] <acrichto> brson: also rustc uses siphash (never used sha1), so there were no worries there

[05:54:00] <acrichto> we had been seeing segfaults in the runtime before and this is probably just a reslic of using the runtime a lot more

[06:06:12] <acrichto> brson: hm so I just got it to deadlock locally running stdtest
[06:06:25] <acrichto> and this is weird, there are no tests running, but there are 4 schedulers blocked in epoll
[06:06:34] <acrichto> none of the backtraces have a test in them
[06:08:27] <brson> acrichto: this must be related to the homing optimization

[06:11:28] <brson> acrichto: how can you tell that?
[06:11:57] <acrichto> brson: I'm looking at the uv loop watchers array and there's only two watchers in there (the two created when the uv loop starts up)
[06:12:14] <acrichto> brson: so linked failure wreaks havoc with I/O
[06:12:20] <acrichto> and there are tests which invoke linked failure
[06:12:29] <acrichto> and uv I/O is in a lot more places now
[06:12:47] <jld> PROTIP: `/list #rust` is not `/list #rust*`.

[06:15:11] <McPherrin> Well barely more than a month then :)
[06:15:31] <jld> (This may also be one of those times when I should read rust-dev more often.)
[06:15:59] <dbaupp> jld: I imagine that raising the rustc stack limit for https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9613#issuecomment-27163633 might be an acceptable solution
[06:16:04] <dbaupp> acrichto, brson: ^
[06:16:29] <acrichto> rustc already does that from one of its entry points
[06:16:35] <jld> dbaupp: The stack limit in libstd/rt/env.rs, or the stack limits in librustc/rustc.rs?
[06:16:44] <acrichto> jld: rustc.rs
[06:16:48] <dbaupp> jld: the rustc specific one
[06:16:52] <jld> Because the limit I set, where it works, is *lower* than the ones in rustc.rs.
[06:17:20] <brson> acrichto: can we fix the code that is supposed to supress failure during io? just wrap `do unkillable { }` around the I/O code
[06:18:13] <acrichto> brson: sadly no, if linked failure is invoked from when structs are being destroyed, it won't destroy the fields of the struct (the sched handle instances)
[06:18:18] <dbaupp> jld: oh, is rustc::monitor the place that sets the rustc stack limit?
[06:18:48] <jld> dbaupp: It's the place with the `static STACK_SIZE` and the `task_builder.opts.stack_size =`.
[06:18:54] <acrichto> brson: this is the codegen thing where drop glue uses call instead of invoke instructions
[06:19:17] <dbaupp> jld: ah, it does seem like rustpkg should invoke rustc via that (or at least set its own stack limit to be high.)
[06:21:24] <jld> dbaupp: But I assume this isn't broken on master... so I have to wonder why I'm taking *more* stack space with smaller enums.
[06:22:56] <eddyb> maybe there's a bad codegen instance where they're not actually smaller?
[06:23:05] <dbaupp> jld: can you get a backtrace from where it crashes? maybe trans has a deeper stack because your changes add a few extra function calls at the "leaves" of the call tree?
[06:23:39] <eddyb> (oh dear I'm guessing context again. I should stop :P)
[06:27:39] <acrichto> brson: hm it may be these signal tests
[06:27:52] <acrichto> brson: it deadlocks after about 5 runs running just the rt::io::signal tests
[06:28:07] * acrichto sighs about signals
[06:32:13] <acrichto> brson: https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/10097
[06:33:36] <acrichto> oh haha brson don't approve that 
[06:35:52] <acrichto> brson: https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/10098/files there we go, found the bug
[06:36:01] <acrichto> confirming now that it fixes running signal tests continuously
[06:36:14] <cmr> ....hahah
[06:36:16] <pcmattman> ouch.
[06:36:33] <acrichto> turns out there are two tests which generate a sigint
[06:36:40] <acrichto> which when run in parallel will make this tests pass
[06:36:45] <acrichto> but when run in not parallel...
[06:39:01] <dbaupp> it seems dangerous to be running two sigint generating tests in parallel?
[06:39:26] <dbaupp> maybe those one should be serialised (i.e. not #[test]'s themselves, but called in a single #[test])
[06:39:29] <dbaupp> *two
[06:40:29] <acrichto> dbaupp: those tests should always be able to pass regardless of whether they're run serially or in parallel
[06:40:52] <acrichto> you're guranteed at least one handler is installed whenever a sigint is generated
[06:41:01] <acrichto> and you're guaranteed to always generate a sigint once a handler is installed
