[00:36:31] <aatch> bob, so doing `fn foo` creates a new "item" called `foo`, and `struct Bar` creates a new item called `Bar`.

[01:18:22] <jimb> aatch: You know, that's a good point. I knew about try!, but of course it doesn't apply in this particular case because I'm in main, which returns ().
[01:18:24] <bob> mbrubeck: any idea?
[01:18:52] <jimb> aatch: But honestly, how often is one in main? or in some context where one doesn't want to propagate the error? That's a pretty rare case.
[01:19:38] <jimb> aatch: We discourage people from using unwrap; I assume the same arguments apply to expect, because the only difference is a slightly nicer message.

[05:01:32] <borromakot> geofft: interesting.  So if I write a handler for the SIGINT function in the parent process, then all the rest will just also receive SIGINT and deal with it how they please?
[05:01:46] <borromakot> geofft: because if that is the case, then I'm just done.
[05:01:57] <geofft> yeah.

[07:11:09] <slimsag> but it seems like a common problem: I have one struct type that has a bunch of methods declared; I want another type that is it's own, unique data type, which just a few new methods added on to it (literally inheritance)

[07:56:04] <ChrisMorgan> It’d be `impl<T, U: A<T>> Deref for U`, which also, incidentally, doesn’t work because T “is not constrained by impl trait, self type, or predicates

[08:24:09] <mindtree> indeed, it definitely gets easier
[08:24:18] <WindowsBunny> In order to Rust you have to train your brain to think in terms of lifetimes
[08:24:23] <WindowsBunny> and ownership
[08:24:39] <aji> yeah, ownership, lifetimes, and borrowing

[08:25:10] <RCIX> mostly after i understand how to actually tell rust about them
[08:25:13] <mindtree> lifetimes and borring come under ownership I think
[08:25:15] <RCIX> is there a guide somewhere?
[08:25:38] <WindowsBunny> mindtree: lifetimes and borrowing are what happens when you lack ownership
[08:25:41] <aji> you don't tell rust about them directly, it figures them out based on your code
[08:25:51] <RCIX> right but i mean when it tells me it can't
[08:26:01] <mindtree> WindowsBunny: if something's borrowed, it's still owned ;)
[08:26:08] <aji> the functions you call have lifetime annotations that say how the lifetime of the inputs relates to that of the output
[08:26:58] <RCIX> like... if there were simple examples without all the lifetimes elided
[08:27:08] <RCIX> i should go look at the docs and see if thats there

[08:28:06] <aji> you really only need to tell rust about lifetimes if you're writing functions with references as input and output

[08:28:38] <WindowsBunny> or other types which have lifetimes
[08:28:44] <RCIX> yeah, to be fair
[08:28:59] <Sgeo> WHat does Vec<&'a T> count as? It's not a struct with a borrow?
[08:29:00] <RCIX> whenever rustc told me it needed lifetime info, i usually was doing something weird and wrong
[08:29:06] <WindowsBunny> lifetimes have a habit of infecting everything
[08:29:10] <mindtree> Sgeo: Vec is a struct

[08:51:21] <genbattle> I'm looking at the iterator API and i'm sure there's something there, but I can't figure out how to get exactly 3, and have them be at least pseudo-random

[08:51:50] <genbattle> meh, ok, extern crate it is I guess

[09:00:45] <huon> (although `unsafe` should be fine for munch2)
[09:01:34] <huon> the change ensures that the compiler understands the ownership transfer of the &mut correctly
[09:01:36] <frankmcsherry> huon: munch2 was just meant to be a different way to try and get the same behavior as munch (passing a mutable ref to a mutable ref, rather than taking and returning a ref).

So while I can call Vec::from_raw_parts, the location that I'm assigning to already exists. It exists as &mut [u8] data, and I'd *like* to be able to transmute it first so that I can get the right dispatch succintly, but I guess that part is negotiable. 
[09:32:15] <frankmcs_> bstrie: the docs seem unclear (the I can guess) on whether a &Vec<T> with invalid fields is UB, or if it is just a Vec<T> that causes the problem.
[09:32:22] <frankmcs_> s/the/though
[09:32:23] <Ms2ger> So you've got an &mut [u8] that you want to fill with Vecs?
[09:33:11] <frankmcs_> Ms2ger: right. I want to take every 24 bytes, each of the form (0, len, len), and populate the first field with pointers that I happen to have.

[09:35:05] <frankmcs_> Ms2ger: the code is a bit cleaner if I can cast first (so that the clean-up code takes a &mut T, rather than a &mut [u8]), but it would be possible for each type to take &mut [u8] and have the parent compute the size of each element and step appropriately.

[10:32:03] <FBIHANDSUP> ok I understand lifetimes and passing through parameters. just imagine I only know python therefore I don't know anything about memory, pointers, etc... What happens when you: let hello: str = "hello"; THEN you let HELLO2 = &hello; ?

[10:32:35] <WindowsBunny> you cannot work with str directly, because it is an unsized type
[10:32:41] <WindowsBunny> you always have to work with it behind a pointer
[10:33:40] <FBIHANDSUP> so like this: let hello: &str = "hello"; ???

[10:37:06] <FBIHANDSUP> yeah but what does the FOO mean?
[10:37:07] <kimundi> the ' is part of it, and used to tell it apart from regular identifiers

[13:18:05] <filsmick> ehiggs: well, I can't elaborate too much since this is closed-source, but the idea is this: you have a list of accounts which each have a list of items to register in a third-party API
[13:18:33] <filsmick> ehiggs: the idea is to check when an item has been registered (by one of those accounts or by someone else's), and if it has been registered, remove it from the list of items
[13:18:45] <filsmick> ehiggs: once an account's list of items is empty, remove that account from the list of accounts

[13:19:59] <filsmick> ehiggs: kind of
[13:20:34] <ehiggs> so someone comes along and makes a queue of work (accounts needing registration) then some worker threads pick up an item and do the work and remove the item.
[13:20:41] <filsmick> I got it to compile by locking the whole collection, but releasing it before blocking operations

[13:21:05] <filsmick> ehiggs: I think it's just that
[13:21:11] <ehiggs> so one producer emits accounts to a channel

[13:23:25] <filsmick> ehiggs: the workers should try and try again until the item is registered

[13:24:17] <filsmick> core functionality that should never crash

[17:29:37] <bluss> frankmcsherry: sounds interesting, just will have some exception safety issues

[18:26:12] <frankmcsherry> filsmick: if the main thread wanted the ability to send at each of the threads, for each thread you can create a channel and move the receiver into the thread. the main thread keeps all the senders (say in a Vec) whereas each thread has a receiver.
[18:26:33] <filsmick> frankmcsherry: I'm starting to get it
[18:26:58] <filsmick> so basically: - call channel() - use the receiver in the thread - append the sender to a vec - use the vec in the outer scope
[18:27:03] <frankmcsherry> filsmick: the main thread can do whatever it wants with the senders (i think?) for example, cloning the vector of senders and handing them to multiple work-producers.
[18:27:16] <brandonson> speaking of channels, how does rust do with thousands of tasks/channels going at once?

[18:37:40] <Hannibal_Smith> brandonson, with the right use of the api that the OS offer to you, context switch can be very fast. Like starting to use raw futex, pin threads group to cpu based on what is better for your kind of application

[23:08:58] <bob> i am confused about sync::Arc
[23:09:26] <bob> the example says 'When you clone an Arc<T>, it will create another pointer to the data and increase the reference counter.'
[23:09:39] <bob> but the Clone method says 'This is also referred to as a copy-on-write operation because the inner data is cloned if the reference count is greater than one.'
[23:09:39] <oceanwhit> bluss, im not sure how do it in one line of flashy code. I don't want to create another Vec<&str> and then iterate over it to convert everything to ints and then put those into Vec<i32>. There has to be a nicer way

[23:36:50] <xrl> hitting an issue with "the immutable borrow prevents subsequent moves or mutable borrows of `*self` until the borrow ends". How can I 'end' a borrow? I have the borrowing statement inside of a block to try and make it clear when it stops

[23:37:41] <bluss> insaneinside: I mean, it's not necessarily heavy
[23:38:07] <bluss> xrl: right, using scopes should be the way to do that

[23:38:48] <bob> is it possible to override how slice/array assignment operators works

[23:40:46] <xrl> bluss: I am doing immutable borrows on data which I guess are following the values. how should I structure my code so I can do a immutable borrow (one attribute is read-only) but then the structure also has a mutable file handle I need to manipulate
[23:41:58] <insaneinside> I've got a C++ source that uses C++14 features not supported by my system's version of GCC -- however, the installed Clang works just fine.  Is there a way to override the compiler executable called by the `gcc` crate?

[23:44:28] <bluss> xrl: it's a pretty big question for Rust, maybe others can add their thoughts. Big structs certainly feel this pain. You might even use associated functions or plain functions to be able to pass just the fields you need to borrow
[23:44:56] *** Joins: BitPuffin (BitPuffin@moz-vunbu1.dyn.plus.net)
[23:45:05] <xrl> I feel like I need to track the File independently from the read-only data?
[23:45:08] <RC9> that was my thought
[23:45:36] <RC9> bluss's idea, that is
[23:45:38] <xrl> but then I have to thread a File handle through a lot of these functions... kinda of nice to have the property handy
[23:45:49] <xrl> *the file attribute handy
[23:46:06] <bluss> xrl: a heavy handed approach is to put the file inside a RefCell
[23:46:18] <bluss> so that you can modify it through a &self (shared borrow)
[23:46:29] <BitPuffin> Hey, what am I doing wrong here, why does it say that Add is not part of my trait? https://gist.github.com/BitPuffin/38d5bc963f1ff158a583

[23:47:05] <bluss> xrl: that borrow lasts until the pair variable goes out of scope
