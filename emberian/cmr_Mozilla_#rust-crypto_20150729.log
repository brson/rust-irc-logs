[17:10:44] <Tiffany> 5 hours for an EV cert? that's kind of short isn't it?
[17:49:50] <bascule> haha
[17:50:14] <bascule> I'm sure they spend all 5 of those hours being very thorough and diligent about verifying your identity
[17:52:46] <Ilari> Also, I saw some fairly "cheap" EV certs. One programmer's comment was that their firm doesn't do business for so little money, because overheads (such as checking the customer) would be larger.

[19:45:03] <Elainemo> Are there no EC certs?
[19:45:20] <Elainemo> I looked at Tiffany's cert and it's 2048-bit RSA
[19:45:30] * Elainemo assuming Tiffany knows what they're doing
[19:46:03] <Tiffany> eh
[19:46:46] <Tiffany> there are probably no all-EC chains?
[19:47:07] <Tiffany> I'm not sure if CAs support EC certs
[19:47:21] <Tiffany> I just went the path of least resistance
[19:47:24] <Tiffany> which is RSA
[19:47:46] <Elainemo> looks like that's what I'll be doing woo
[19:47:54] <Elainemo> I just noticed gandi comes with free SSL certs for a year
[19:48:13] <Tiffany> I got mine with wosign, and let's encrypt is coming out in like under 2 months
[19:48:21] <Elainemo> yeah
[19:48:32] <Elainemo> good point
[19:48:34] * Elainemo doesn't bother
[19:48:51] <Tiffany> heh
[19:49:05] <Tiffany> the number of new sites supporting TLS is probably going to drop until let's encrypt comes out
[19:49:20] <Ilari> Well, at least currently Let's Encrypt only does RSA. Dunno if that will change in time for launch.
[19:49:49] <Elainemo> Somehow Gandi is fucking up my DNS, it's not serving any records except SOA
[19:50:14] <Ilari> RSA isn't that bad as signature algorithm.
[19:50:27] <Ilari> (Except that the signatures are pretty large)
[19:53:41] <Ilari> Also, it is not like you need ECC cert to do ECDHE.
[19:53:49] <Elainemo> right
[19:53:55] <Elainemo> but they're so big
[19:54:10] <Elainemo> how much mobile bandwidth is wasted downloading huge cert chains?
[19:56:38] <Tiffany> is there a way to measure how big a cert chain is?
[19:58:04] <c74d> Tiffany: <https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/> shows that
[19:58:38] <c74d> I'm not sure whether it includes the website's own certificate though
[19:58:39] <Tiffany> oh
[19:58:54] <Tiffany> mine is a bit over 4 kilobytes
[19:59:00] *** Joins: brson (brson@moz-u3dg2t.sfo1.mozilla.com)
[19:59:01] <Tiffany> that's not so bad
[19:59:14] <Tiffany> I mean, it's kind of a bug anyway if you're rapidfire reconnecting to a server with TLS, since the handshake is slow
[20:00:14] <Tiffany> a typical website is a couple megabytes, so it's not a lot of wasted bandwidth for web browsing
[20:01:48] <Tiffany> 4 kilobytes seems to be a pretty typical size
[20:01:54] <Ilari> Bad thing about RSA is that it is more vulernable to DOS attacks on serverside.
[20:02:15] <Tiffany> yeah
[20:03:52] <Ilari> Also, ECDSA certs are useful with IIS to get the handshake to behave properly.
[20:16:42] <Ilari> Also, there is session resumption (but in TLS 1.2 it destroys forward security).

[20:30:58] <Ilari> Also, PHP P-256 polyfills? Who in the right mind uses those? Nevermind the timing leaks secrets like a sieve, but are those even near mathematically correct?
[20:32:43] <Ilari> Also, needs AES-GCM... Are there also going to be PHP polyfills for that (should be easy pickings for timing attack).

[21:54:54] <Tiffany> it's only one way, since I don't know how to read and write at the same time in rust
[21:54:56] <Tiffany> or, well
[21:55:03] <Tiffany> read from both stdin and a TcpStream
[21:55:17] <Elainemo> with mio :P

[21:56:40] <Tiffany> I'm using a 4-byte little-endian length value to frame noise messages, other than that it's noise-as-specced sent over tcp
[22:04:39] <Tiffany> it's a little bit messy too
