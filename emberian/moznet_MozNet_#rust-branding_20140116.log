[03:00:35] <TheHydroImpulse> Another option would be to have another link within the code banner (small header ontop of the code snippet) called "show example(s)", which would show the examples below it.

[03:01:00] <bjz> TheHydroImpulse: you might want to talk to ChrisMorgan about what kinds of things will be included in the new docs
[03:01:08] <bjz> ChrisMorgan: o/
[03:01:19] <ChrisMorgan> \o
[03:01:41] <bjz> TheHydroImpulse: I'm not sure there will be prescibed sub-sections
[03:01:46] <TheHydroImpulse> ChrisMorgan are you working on a new doc system?
[03:02:06] <bjz> TheHydroImpulse: one thing to consider is also things like notices about deprecation
[03:02:13] <ChrisMorgan> What precisely do you mean by that? (Do you mean the tech, the content, something else?)
[03:02:36] <TheHydroImpulse> ChrisMorgan more the tech/format
[03:02:56] <bjz> ChrisMorgan: I think more like what kind of semantic structure will the doc comments follow, if any
[03:03:26] <ChrisMorgan> I haven't started working on it in earnest yet; I've been quite busy just recently.
[03:03:41] <bjz> TheHydroImpulse: you might want to look at examples of sphinx docs: http://sphinx-doc.org/
[03:04:02] <bjz> TheHydroImpulse: seeing as that is the system we will probably be using
[03:04:27] <ChrisMorgan> Sphinx is the tool that I'm urging that we use and, barring a couple of entirely reasonable reservations on brson's part it seems most likely to be what we will use.
[03:04:27] <TheHydroImpulse> bjz Will Rust drop rustdoc then?
[03:04:44] <ChrisMorgan> No, it'll most likely be tied in with rustdoc.
[03:04:56] <bjz> TheHydroImpulse: they have versions for different languages, so you can see how they differ, and imagine how they might be adapted for rust
[03:05:05] <TheHydroImpulse> ChrisMorgan is Sphinx fairly customizable?
[03:05:08] <ChrisMorgan> TheHydroImpulse: have you looked through my presentation on the topic? http://chrismorgan.info/blog/rust-docs-vision-presentation.html
[03:05:48] <TheHydroImpulse> ChrisMorgan No I didn't. I say Steve's presentation on docs, but haven't had time to watch yours.
[03:05:57] <bjz> TheHydroImpulse: one thing, that might be less of your area, is to be able to show inherited methods from supertaits
[03:06:12] <bjz> like in the scala docs
[03:06:31] <ChrisMorgan> TheHydroImpulse: I dealt more with the tech stack; towards the end I covered how Sphinx and rustdoc as it is now might interact.
[03:07:05] <TheHydroImpulse> bjz Yeah, that would be very useful.
[03:07:15] <bjz> TheHydroImpulse: there will be cool possibilities, like being able to display latex math
[03:07:32] <bjz> <3 <3
[03:08:10] <ChrisMorgan> bjz: I think that's just about the only thing I've heard you comment on on Sphinx!
[03:08:20] <bjz> ChrisMorgan: yes!
[03:08:33] <TheHydroImpulse> bjz hehe. I think having examples and context will be most important. Right now, especially with generics, it's fairly hard to understand and make sense of the APIs.
[03:08:36] <bjz> ChrisMorgan: because the other stuff is awesome and well known
[03:09:01] <bjz> TheHydroImpulse: we will be able to have links to symbols in the doc comments
[03:09:19] <bjz> TheHydroImpulse: which will make it much easier to traverse
[03:09:44] <ChrisMorgan> Something I miss on the present Rust website is reference to Mozilla.
[03:09:56] <bjz> ChrisMorgan: yes
[03:10:33] <bjz> ChrisMorgan: Rust is very driven by the community, but the Mozilla backing is a huge plus for the lang
[03:10:52] <ChrisMorgan> Indeed.
[03:10:53] <TheHydroImpulse> ChrisMorgan oh yeah. Does brson and the rest of the core team want to promote Mozilla's backing a lot? Or just effective references where appropriate
[03:11:10] <bjz> TheHydroImpulse: a logo would be nice at least
[03:11:19] <bjz> TheHydroImpulse: maybe further down the page
[03:11:44] <TheHydroImpulse> Sounds good
[03:12:06] <bjz> TheHydroImpulse: liked "Supported by Mozilla Research" or something - would have to ask brson about the wording
[03:12:21] <TheHydroImpulse> bjz Yeah, sounds good.
[03:12:50] <TheHydroImpulse> I'm sure the Mozilla backing will make it more appealing to some people.
[03:13:26] <bjz> TheHydroImpulse: it would be nice to maybe use the signatures of items more in the docs - it's hard to travel through the docs based on identifiers alone
[03:13:43] <bjz> TheHydroImpulse: but that could make the docs noisier - I dunno
[03:14:29] <bjz> TheHydroImpulse: the fuzzy search functionality is awesome, but it would be good if the text box war much more noticable
[03:14:40] <bjz> I think some folks don't even know its there
[03:15:28] <bjz> TheHydroImpulse: and don't feel locked into the current format or stucture of the pages. I think rust doc is pretty flexible
[03:16:02] <bjz> TheHydroImpulse: not saying the current form is bad - it's pretty good, but you might have some better ideas - I dunno
[03:16:31] <TheHydroImpulse> Yeah. Right now I'm just gonna worry about getting something solid design wise, then I'll hammer out how to get it merged with rustdoc. Might not be the easiest, but we'll see.
[03:16:54] <bjz> yeah, it's good to see wireframes
[03:17:28] <bjz> ChrisMorgan: can you categorise items with sphinx?
[03:17:38] * ChrisMorgan is not sure what bjz means by that
[03:17:46] <TheHydroImpulse> bjz Even simple things like adding colours and better font types would be so much better. It's not very aesthetically pleasing right now.
[03:18:07] <bjz> ChrisMorgan: like I have section comments in the code here: https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/10387
[03:18:21] <bjz> ChrisMorgan: but they are not reflected in the docs
[03:18:52] <ChrisMorgan> bjz: sure; that's the manual curation part that I spoke of.
[03:18:59] <bjz> awesome
[03:19:22] <bjz> TheHydroImpulse: yeah, you might want to think of how manual curation would work
[03:19:37] <bjz> TheHydroImpulse: in terms of the final generated output
[03:19:54] <ChrisMorgan> There are various parts of the Python standard library documentation that are good to look at in that regards.
[03:20:03] <bjz> ChrisMorgan: oh cool
[03:20:19] <bjz> ChrisMorgan: any links you can post?
[03:21:05] <ChrisMorgan> I've got some further down the page at http://chrismorgan.info/blog/rust-docs-vision-presentation.html
[03:22:55] <TheHydroImpulse> lol, gotta love the Java docs.
[03:23:41] <bjz> Java docs can actually be reasonably good
[03:23:54] <bjz> even if they are butt ugly and use frames :P
[03:25:07] <bjz> ChrisMorgan: nice write up
[03:25:23] <bjz> ChrisMorgan: I'll skim and look in greater datail later
[03:25:26] <TheHydroImpulse> I think the worst thing is a lack of context and examples within documentation. 
[03:25:40] <ChrisMorgan> They do have their high spots, but over all they're not as good as they should have been—but they did help popularise the concept, which was very important.
[03:26:05] <bjz> ChrisMorgan: what do you *not* like about python's docs?
[03:26:18] <bjz> ChrisMorgan: what do you think could be improved?
[03:27:41] <ChrisMorgan> bjz: https://joepie91.wordpress.com/2013/02/19/the-python-documentation-is-bad-and-you-should-feel-bad/ is an interesting article on the topic
[03:28:07] <bjz> hah!
[03:28:11] <bjz> awesome title
[03:28:13] <ChrisMorgan> I don't agree with everything in that article, but it has certain very good points.
[03:29:22] <ChrisMorgan> Some of its observations such as the types things should be not being shown are automatically and implicitly avoided for Rust because of its typing discipline.
[03:30:18] <ChrisMorgan> Python's documentation on its built-in types is curiously disconnected from its standard library documentation, a point that that author picks up on a little. I know that I have had a little trouble finding the documentation that I know is there to show to someone else at times.
[03:30:38] <bjz> \o/ for static typing
[03:30:48] <ChrisMorgan> The problem there is actually, I think, that the indexes are not emphasised enough.
[03:31:04] <bjz> static types gets us lots of documentation for free, thankfully
[03:31:57] <bjz> googlability is an important design consideration he mentioned
[03:32:46] <bjz> ChrisMorgan: what do you mean about the "indexes"?
[03:34:20] <TheHydroImpulse> bjz Should it be Mozilla backing, or Mozilla Research?
[03:34:34] <ChrisMorgan> bjz: complete Table of Contents: http://docs.python.org/3/contents.html. A good index: http://docs.python.org/3/genindex.html. And a module index: http://docs.python.org/3/py-modindex.html.
[03:35:12] <ChrisMorgan> (The module index is the least useful of these because the documentation is already pretty much arranged in that way.)
[03:35:15] <bjz> TheHydroImpulse: you'd have to talk to brson about what would be best
[03:35:22] <bjz> TheHydroImpulse: but yeah: https://github.com/TheHydroImpulse/rust-website/issues/7
[03:35:45] <TheHydroImpulse> Sounds good.
[03:36:43] <ChrisMorgan> bjz: indexes like those are perfectly natural and work really well in a physical book, but online—people tend to forget about them.
[03:36:51] <bjz> TheHydroImpulse: but in my opinion at least, it would be good if the language had its own identity
[03:37:39] <TheHydroImpulse> bjz Definitely.
[03:37:56] <bjz> TheHydroImpulse: so instead of "A project by Mozilla" it would be "Backed by Mozilla" if that makes sense. But I'm not sure of the politics surrounding that
[03:38:09] <bjz> ChrisMorgan: yeah
[03:38:30] <bjz> ChrisMorgan: we have an awesome search thing anyway :)
[03:38:39] <ChrisMorgan> bjz: another thing that people forget with Python is that you have the pydoc command line tool
[03:38:45] <bjz> :)
[03:39:27] <TheHydroImpulse> bjz How about "Supported by Mozilla?"
[03:39:39] <bjz> TheHydroImpulse: yeah, better
[03:40:07] <bjz> TheHydroImpulse: but the specifics could probably be debated later
[03:40:27] <TheHydroImpulse> kk cool
[03:51:16] <TheHydroImpulse> bjz Added the Mozilla reference
[03:52:28] <bjz> nice
