[00:13:48] <Ilari> Hypothethical TLS 1.4 and TLS 1.5? Fail.
[00:29:08] <Ilari> If TLS 1.3 is so crap that one needs TLS 1.4, why would it be any better?
[00:45:47] <Ilari> Of course, even if TLS 1.3 happens to be good, will there be good implementations?
[01:19:01] <bascule> Ilari: have you at least been pleasantly surprised by the CFRG?
[01:20:03] <Ilari> Well, despite taking way too long, at least the ECC stuff isn't seemingly producing wild crap.
[01:20:12] <bascule> heh
[01:20:50] <bascule> they seem to be standardizing what I would've picked (which I think is what anyone who knows what's up would've picked)
[01:24:21] <Ilari> "DH-based" key exchange was sold as "unified" and easy to bolt 0-RTT to. Of course, it turns out that 0-RTT is anything but unified and has all sorts of surprises in store if one thinks abou tit.
[01:24:25] <Ilari> *about it
[01:25:22] <Ilari> Like the security problems 0-RTT has if used with (DHE-)PSK or resumption.
[01:28:06] <Ilari> Or the special issues with 0-RTT with resumption.

[06:29:41] <taryn> ouch
[06:34:35] <Ilari> taryn: Well, it is the recently published one. Where's PCI auditing?
[06:40:28] <bascule> Ilari: PCI auditors are now telling people to shut off RC4
[06:40:38] <bascule> as of a few days ago
[06:42:04] <taryn> bascule: finally
[06:42:49] <bascule> lol
[06:43:08] <Ilari> And that presumably also means shutting off TLS 1.0...
[06:43:09] <bascule> Ilari: I liked draft-ietf-tls-sslv3-diediedie-02
[06:43:12] <bascule> no
[06:43:15] <bascule> next year
[06:43:18] <bascule> for 1.0
[06:43:33] <Ilari> CBC modes then (even with BEAST)?
[06:44:58] <Ilari> (Yes, I know that browsers mitigate the exploit)
[06:45:16] <bascule> there's a lot of ways to mitigate BEAST but, yeah
[06:45:23] <bascule> shutting off TLS 1.0 would be a good idea
[06:45:28] <bascule> we might be able to do it now
[07:03:08] <Ilari> Wonder how many sites have (not many) extra warning banner for TLS 1.0...
[07:05:46] *** Joins: BigE (BigE@moz-4gk6rj.torservers.net)
[07:08:40] <bascule> Ilari: it was hard enough to convince people to shut off RC4
[07:08:43] <bascule> I did that
[07:08:46] <bascule> we're going to do it
[07:08:48] <bascule> next week
[07:09:29] <Ilari> Of course, site with such banner would support TLS 1.2, so anything that isn't crapola won't get the banner.
[07:09:46] <bascule> yeah, that's pretty much the thing right
[07:09:59] <bascule> most modern apps are going to get the good crypto
[07:10:37] <Ilari> Which is actually more secure, AES-128-GCM or AES-256-CBC? Why?
[07:10:47] <bascule> lol
[07:11:09] <bascule> I would pick AES-128-GCM for speed
[07:12:23] <Ilari> (Of course assuming AES-256-CBC has some reasonable HMAC for authentication, like it has in TLS)
[07:15:50] <Ilari> I think AES-256-CBC as in TLS is more secure than AES-128-GCM, unless AES has some surprising weaknesses.
[07:17:33] <Ilari> Of course, such weaknesses would call security of AES seriously into question.
[07:20:22] <Ilari> FIPS-compliant franking machines? :->
[07:21:50] <Ilari> Also Well, if some crap is any indication (it probably isn't), AES-128-GCM might be the the stronger one.
[07:23:26] <Ilari> ... AES-GCM is allegedly hideously vulernable to timing attacks.
[07:38:10] <bascule> good thing there's CLMUL lol
[07:39:06] <bascule> if the patent issues around OCB mode can get sorted out, that sounds cool

[11:01:11] <eternaleye> bascule: AEZ excites me more than OCB in general, especially because of the arbitrary-length tag and complete nondisclosure unless all-of (Nonce, AD, Message) repeat in full
[11:02:20] <eternaleye> bascule: As a side benefit, AEZ seems to have a clearer patent landscape than OCB - it seems to sidestep the Gligor & Donescu / Jutla patents (though, you'd want a lawyer to make sure), and Rogaway's historically been good on patents
[11:04:14] <eternaleye> bascule: Plus, the strategy used to construct AEZ would work on future block ciphers as well (It's not _quite_ a mode, but the same design technique should be pretty damn general)

[22:24:21] <eternaleye> Ilari: The thing is that with AEZ, nonce repetion does no harm unless the full content of the AD and the message was also identical
[22:24:59] <eternaleye> Ilari: That's the (very strong) definition of misuse-resistant AE that Rogaway is working under (and pushing)
[22:25:25] <eternaleye> *repetition
[22:25:49] <eternaleye> Ilari: In a sense, with AEZ, the full message and AD is also part of the nonce

[22:33:21] <eternaleye> bascule: And the complete lack of nonce-misuse resistance is why I'm not a fan of NORX
[22:33:49] <eternaleye> bascule: With strong MRAE, you can just put any "extra" nonce you want in the AD, for the same guarantees
[22:33:59] <eternaleye> bascule: And arbitrary size
[22:35:20] <eternaleye> bascule: AEZ isn't online because that's incompatible with the definition of strong MRAE (Rogaway has a paper with the proofs), but since you're packetizing things _anyway_...
[22:35:42] <eternaleye> bascule: And that's where Rogaway's CHAIN construction (same paper) comes in if you have ordered semantics
[22:37:46] <eternaleye> bascule: IIRC, CHAIN takes a misuse-resistant AE, and chains its _output_ from one (arbitrary-size) packet as the AD for the next packet
[22:38:18] <eternaleye> bascule: And since AEZ has arbitrary-length tags, you can set the birthday bound wherever you want.
[22:41:03] <eternaleye> bascule: Which for sequential data would basicallly free protocols from having to worry about all this nonce-ense at all :P
[23:02:19] <Dcoder> sounds a lot like the 'session' sponge modes
[23:03:04] <eternaleye> CHAIN is also really nice for multi-stream stuff, since you can just start a new CHAIN for each stream with the same key but a different nonce/AE that includes the stream identity - no need for either expensive keying on each stream (TLS over SCTP) or giving up security in order to avoid it and support datagram boundaries (DTLS over SCTP)
[23:47:10] <Ilari> Fortunately TLS has TLS-Extractor, in case you need to grab some keying material off the connection...
