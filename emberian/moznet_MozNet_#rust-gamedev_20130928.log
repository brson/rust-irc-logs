[00:12:07] <sastraxi> hey everyone! apologies in advance for the broad question.
[00:13:01] <sastraxi> i'm coming from a java-based 3d game programming background. I'm wondering what rust would give me that I don't have? I know that I'd get closer-to-native performance and get rid of stop-the-world pauses
[00:13:25] <sastraxi> but i've tried to program in C++ and always get discouraged because i'm writing so much memory management.
[00:13:56] <cmr> sastraxi: Rust offers automatic memory management without a GC
[00:13:56] *** Joins: captaincommunism (Mibbit@moz-A8DB787A.hsd1.il.comcast.net)
[00:14:03] <cmr> With an opt-in GC
[00:14:10] <cmr> That is task-local, so no stop-the-world
[00:14:19] <sastraxi> cmr: that sounds great. so you pick which objects are managed by a collector?
[00:14:36] <cmr> sastraxi: yup: we call them managed pointers, the syntax for which is @Foo
[00:15:06] <sastraxi> great! I'll look those up
[00:15:24] <sastraxi> cmr: when you say task-local...
[00:15:36] <sastraxi> task vs. thread?
[00:16:01] <cmr> tasks are scheduled onto threads in an N:M manner, more or less.
[00:16:24] <dbaupp> Rust has green threads (called tasks) that are multiplexed onto OS threads via the runtime-scheduler
[00:16:32] <cmr> Yeah, that
[00:17:12] <sastraxi> ah ok. so like greenlets in python maybe?
[00:17:18] <Amaranth> More or less
[00:17:31] <cmr> Like goroutines, too, aiui
[00:17:49] <Amaranth> Except not as good yet ;)
[00:18:00] <steveklabnik> i don't know who would be in here that wouldn't be in #rust, but I'd love thoughts on the new pointers tutorial I wrote: https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9579/files#L2L-1
[00:18:05] <steveklabnik> especially if you're shaky on the details
[00:18:09] <sastraxi> what would you say the disadvantages are?
[00:18:19] <cmr> Disadvantages of?
[00:18:30] <Amaranth> sastraxi: Lifetime management is still something you have to think about
[00:18:40] <Amaranth> And it can be even more complicated in Rust than C++
[00:18:44] <sastraxi> cmr: Rust tasks vs. goroutines
[00:18:46] <cmr> ah
[00:18:53] <Amaranth> Oh, I thought you meant in general :P
[00:18:55] <cmr> I know almost nothing about go
[00:19:13] <cmr> I wrote a tiny bit of code in it a year or so ago :p
[00:19:16] <steveklabnik> the disadvantages are complexity
[00:19:23] <sastraxi> I've used threading mostly in java and through intel threading building blocks
[00:19:27] <tiffany> I've found that dealing with lifetimes is harder than in C which is odd
[00:19:28] <steveklabnik> go doesn't enforce no shared mutable state
[00:19:34] <Amaranth> Rust tasks need to be manually rescheduled more often and I've been told the scheduler isn't very good yet
[00:19:37] <sastraxi> i found lifetime management not to be too hard there--what makes it harder with tasks?
[00:19:41] <tiffany> I tend to default to ~ even though I should default to &
[00:19:46] <dbaupp> go is much more flexible about what you do with goroutines, and the Rust compiler will complain about/reject a lot programs that you'd write in Python/Go
[00:20:08] <sastraxi> Amaranth: ah ok.
[00:20:17] <dbaupp> e.g. no shared memory except via extra::arc::{Arc,MutexArc,RWArc}
[00:20:26] <tiffany> yeah, type safety costs edge cases
[00:21:31] <sastraxi> when you manually reschedule tasks, we're talking about something akin to manually solving a deadlock, correct?
[00:21:36] <sastraxi> (... or maybe I'm way off...)
[00:21:41] <cmr> sastraxi: no, calling yield
[00:21:59] <cmr> (well, deschedule() now, since yield is a reserved keyword)
[00:22:29] <sastraxi> so saying "I'm not doing anything for the foreseeable future; let someone else re-activate me"
[00:22:35] <cmr> yes
[00:22:46] <cmr> We implicitly yield on anything using io in the new runtime.
[00:23:08] <sastraxi> that seems like it makes sense
[00:23:20] <Amaranth> cmr: That is the plan but I thought it didn't do it everywhere yet
[00:23:24] <sastraxi> so are the tasks quite cooperative (In a sense) right now because of deficiencies of the scheduler?
[00:23:44] <cmr> sastraxi: not so much deficiencies, tasks are meant to be cooperative.
[00:23:57] <cmr> But the scheduler won't always steal work when it could.
[00:23:59] <sastraxi> ah awesome!!
[00:24:13] *** Joins: Lurk_ (chatzilla@moz-F088D030.hsd1.in.comcast.net)
[00:24:27] <sastraxi> so basically the scheduler decides what tasks are running on which machine threads...
[00:24:36] <sastraxi> and it could do a better job of saying "this one can wait for a while"
[00:24:51] <cmr> So, how it works is we have a Sched, which represents an OS thread
[00:24:57] <cmr> And a Task, which is... a task
[00:25:00] <cmr> You spawn a task in a sched
[00:25:19] <cmr> If none of a sched's tasks are executing (are blocked in io), the sched will try and run another sched's task
[00:25:23] <cmr> As I understand it
[00:26:08] <cmr> brson might be able to elaborate more.
[00:26:18] <sastraxi> cmr: thanks for the help! 
[00:26:29] <sastraxi> i think i'll do some more research myself, and come back if I have more questions
[00:26:36] <sastraxi> (When, really!)
[00:26:58] <cmr> sastraxi: just keep in mind Rust is pre-alpha, the language and the libraries are constantly evolving. it's not stable it.
[00:27:10] <sastraxi> yep, I understand.
[00:27:20] <cmr> ok
[00:27:33] <sastraxi> kind of exciting though to see a language develop!
[00:27:37] <sastraxi> im not going to miss the opportunity...
[00:27:55] <steveklabnik> :)
[00:27:58] <steveklabnik> awesome!
[00:28:44] <sastraxi> i think the main thing i'm excited about are the cooperative threads. could be a really cool thing to mess with wrt gamedev

[00:53:24] <bjz> Amaranth: cool, will fix
[00:53:37] <Amaranth> Sounds fine to me
[00:53:42] <Amaranth> Also I can't wait for that :)
[00:53:57] <cmr> bjz: whoa whoa whoa, what updates to rustpkg would those be?
[00:54:19] <bjz> well we can do custon pkg.rs things atm
[00:54:24] <Amaranth> I suspect updates that let you define more than the 'install' keyword
[00:54:37] <cmr> sure, but once gl-rs is built, it's built.
[00:54:37] <Amaranth> The pkg.rs seems useless right now
[00:54:40] <bjz> but you can't pass cmd line options to them in the extern mod thing
[00:55:22] <cmr> I was unaware anything like that was planned, but if it is, awesome
[00:55:30] <Amaranth> Unless I missed something you basically have to do all the compiling and installing yourself if you give a pkg.rs and it all happens under the 'install' keyword

[01:07:01] <ryeguy> has anyone began making a component/entity system yet?
[01:07:24] <jeaye> There's been talk of it.
[01:07:31] <jeaye> Not sure of anyone specific yet though.
[01:07:38] <Amaranth> I still can't figure out how it'd work
[01:09:00] <ryeguy> i really don't know if i like the 'hashmap of components' approach
[01:09:37] <ryeguy> i still think its beneficial to create actual entity classes then have them implement some kind of 'HealthComponentOwner' trait
[01:09:51] <ryeguy> because a lot of implementations an entity is just an integer
[01:10:11] <ryeguy> then you fetch the components at runtime, which may or may not even be applicable for that entity type..feels too loose for my liking
[01:10:16] <Amaranth> Sure you can have a struct and implement a bunch of traits
[01:10:36] <Amaranth> But how do you check if struct Foo implements the traits you need?
[01:11:07] <ryeguy> what do you mean? I was suggesting doing it to prevent Foo from getting component Bar, which doesn't make sense for a Foo

[01:12:33] <Amaranth> bjz: Nice
[01:13:05] <Amaranth> ryeguy: In your system how do you deal with a function that requires your entity have the position component and the movement component
[01:13:23] <Amaranth> How do you write that function in a way that enforces the restriction at compile time?
[01:13:30] <cmr> fn foo<T: Position+Movement>(x: T)
[01:13:43] <Amaranth> I thought that wasn't implemented yet
[01:13:52] <cmr> that has been implemented since at least 0.6
[01:14:20] <Amaranth> Well then, the only problem left is how does a trait store data
[01:14:20] <cmr> (that's the earliest rust I've used)
[01:14:27] <cmr> That is the real problem :)
[01:14:43] <cmr> Currently you need setters and getters for everything :\
[01:15:17] <Amaranth> cmr: Worse than that, you need to actually have the data in your main struct
[01:15:28] <ryeguy> Amaranth: You of course can't statically guarantee they actually *have* those components, but you can at least now guarantee they could possibly have them. 
[01:15:44] <cmr> ryeguy: eh?
[01:15:47] <Amaranth> So you can't have random components added by a third party because they can't add fields to your entity
[01:16:10] <ryeguy> thats true, that assumes you want that ability though
[01:16:25] <Amaranth> And your entity has to pay the memory cost of every component even if it doesn't implement any of them
[01:16:36] <cmr> Amaranth: to accomplish such, every entity would need an id, and each component would put its storage per entity somewhere, associated with that id
[01:16:50] <Amaranth> cmr: So we're back to hashmaps of components :D
[01:16:53] <cmr> probably in TLS
[01:16:57] <cmr> Basically! :P
[01:17:08] <cmr> How do existing component entity systems handle it?
[01:17:18] <ryeguy> hashmaps of components OR arrays 
[01:17:27] <Amaranth> Or lots of template magic
[01:17:38] <ryeguy> the downside is they allocate arrays of size N, where N is the number of component types in your system

[01:19:18] <Amaranth> ryeguy: I don't want to bloat my structs with RTTI
[01:19:26] <ryeguy> it doenst have to be at runtime
[01:19:30] <ryeguy> see how scala implements TypeTags
[01:19:51] <ryeguy> but that is another bag of worms, because that depends on a feature rust doesnt have (implicit params)

[13:56:39] <bjz> yeah, the name was confusing
[13:56:45] <kvark> ok, cool
[13:56:54] <kvark> and numeric-rs is now a part of the language?
[13:56:57] <bjz> people thought it was a general linear algebra lib

[13:58:52] <bjz> yeah it was a big effort getting the numeric stuff done
[13:59:07] <bjz> still not wholly happy, but its better than it was
[13:59:26] <kvark> cool, will see how it works now, porint my thing to 0.8
[14:00:39] <kvark> btw, I don't understand rustpkg stuff in full. Your libs are now using it as a primary build tool. Does it require any kind of global register?
[14:01:04] <kvark> would I benefit from moving my build method to rustpkg? and how would I do it?
[14:02:19] <bjz> its still kinda broken
[14:02:43] <bjz> rustpkg build gl, for example
[14:02:49] <bjz> that works
[14:03:12] <bjz> but if you change something it doesn't register it
[14:03:30] <bjz> so you have to rm -rf .rust
[14:04:01] <kvark> wow
[14:04:22] <bjz> .rust being the directory in the workspace
[14:04:43] <maik> one question regarding ffi
[14:04:44] <bjz> that holds the compile status of the source files
[14:04:44] <maik> https://github.com/h3r2tic/assimp-rs/blob/master/ffi.rs#L383
[14:05:02] <maik> doesn't there need to be #[link_args ?
[14:05:18] <bjz> kvark: also, installing from remotes is broken
[14:05:31] <bjz> kvark: but it should be fixed soon
[14:05:34] * bjz hopes
[14:05:43] <kvark> ah, remotes are not actual for me ATM
[14:05:56] <kvark> bjz: can/should I move to rustpkg locally?
[14:06:38] <bjz> up to you. it's pretty nice bar those issues
[14:07:17] <kvark> ok, will try then
[14:07:55] <bjz> kvark: https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/9177
[14:08:08] <bjz> kvark: https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/9482

[14:09:17] <kvark> bjz: nice links, thanks!
[14:09:33] <kvark> bjz: did you update cgmath to rust-0.8?
[14:09:44] <bjz> kvark: sorry, not yet
[14:09:49] <kvark> ok
[14:10:02] <bjz> kvark: it shouldn't be far behind
[14:10:06] <kvark> are you planning to? I can make a pulll request if you are not
[14:10:56] <bjz> sure, go ahead
[14:11:09] <bjz> I'll rebuild my rust
[14:13:42] <kvark> bam
[14:13:59] <kvark> why isn't my cgmath-rs any longer "forked from bjz/cgmath-rs"???
[14:14:41] <bjz> oh, because the current cgmath is decended from the lmath repo
[14:15:01] <kvark> doh
[14:15:07] <kvark> so I need to re-fork then...
[14:15:27] <bjz> sorry
[14:15:52] <kvark> np, just trying to figure out what's going on... after so many changes since 0.6 :))
[14:16:02] <bjz> wow, that long?
[14:16:13] <bjz> wooo, new snapshot
[14:16:30] <bjz> (llvm re-compile)

[14:17:36] <kvark> good to see you guys so active, thanks for all the great work!

[14:18:11] <kvark> sort of?! oh
[14:18:16] <bjz> haha jk
[14:18:31] * kvark expects everything to be broken now
[14:19:13] <bjz> things are always breaking, but not as much as they were :P
[14:20:04] * bjz remembers the 0.4 -> 0.5 cycle... ugh generics breaking everywhere!
[14:20:29] <kvark> haha
[14:20:41] <bjz> or was it 0.5 -> 0.6
