[00:02:41] <nrc> acrichto: pong
[00:02:52] <acrichto> nrc: out of curiosity, is there an update on the benchmarking stuff for rustc itself?
[00:02:58] <acrichto> (just assembling the weekly status report)
[00:03:41] <nrc> acrichto: its underway - we're collecting data from the server. There's a few bugs in the front end, so I don't want to share the url for that widely yet
[00:04:14] <nrc> I was going to give you this: http://www.ncameron.org/perf-rustc/index.html
[00:04:22] <nrc> but it looks like the backend has crashed :-s
[00:04:25] <nrc> ho hum
[00:04:27] <acrichto> lol
[00:04:38] <acrichto> maybe I can grab a screenshot
[00:05:08] <nrc> look at all this glorious data! https://github.com/nrc/rustc-timing/commits/master
[00:05:25] <nrc> acrichto: sure give me a few minutes, need to poke the server....
[00:05:43] <acrichto> oh wow!
[00:05:58] <acrichto> oh wow those are massive commits
[00:06:19] <nrc> yeah, I worry its going to break GitHub rules sooner than I expected
[00:08:27] <Tobba> "than expected"
[00:08:31] <Tobba> that's not really a good sign is it
[00:11:00] <nrc> well, I thought it would work for a year or so, which seems fine. Now it looks like maybe weeks or months
[00:15:14] <nrc> acrichto: sorry, no screen shot. I can't even draw a graph today. Something has regressed... :-(
[00:15:25] <acrichto> nrc: ah well, no worries!
[00:15:30] <acrichto> stuff for next week's report :)
[00:16:08] <acrichto> nrc: https://github.com/rust-lang/subteams/blob/master/tools/reports/2015-06-02.md#highlights 
[00:16:12] <acrichto> (will go out later tonight)
[00:17:23] <nrc> looks good

[02:40:45] <nrc> acrichto: do you ahve thoughts on moving Servo's cross compilation extras into mainline rustc? I don't really know what the situation is here, but it seems weird to me that Servo needs a forked rustc and perhaps we can benefit from the cross compilation stuff?
[02:49:06] <wca> nrc: what kind of changes does that include?  GH/servo/rust looks like a rather old fork, is there another one?
[02:51:13] <nrc> wca: not sure off the top of my head, nor am I sure where they keep their fork. I do now they are almost up to date though. I'm wondering whether this is worth investigating further. I don't want to waste time on something others have probably thought about before.
[02:52:56] <wca> right.  I was just curious; my attempts at cross compilation have been abject failures.  I assume it's because I'm missing something, but if someone else has found issues I'd prefer not to duplicate effort.
[03:01:18] <nrc> Yeah, it seems the cross compiling is hard at the moment, I'd like to make that easier, especially if there is work done already towards that

[04:42:33] <aturon> nrc: you should talk to brson and edunham about this - definitely one of the infra goals
[04:43:31] <nrc> it is? great, I didn't realise it was on anyone's radar
[04:44:14] <aturon> acrichto: I wonder if having a preliminary tools team meeting including edunham might be good - broadly looking at priorities in tools and infra and coordinating work?
[04:47:13] <edunham> aturon: that's a good idea -- my current level of knowledge on the tooling is that I've looked at tickets regarding some of it and skimmed rustup.sh, but I could be (and probably am) missing knowledge that some important things even exist
[04:47:56] <cmr> I would loooooooove if I could download libraries for other targets for cross-compiling <3
[04:48:20] <edunham> even having an idea of how much Rust I'll need to know to make useful conributions to the more specialized tools will be super useful for figuring out how to juggle and prioritize it :)
[04:49:01] <nrc> edunham, aturon: have you seen the tools team etherpad? https://etherpad.mozilla.org/rust-tooling
[04:49:14] <aturon> edunham: yeah, quite a number of the tools are being written in rust
[04:49:26] <edunham> nrc: nope, hadn't seen that yet -- thank you for the link!
[04:49:54] <edunham> aturon: if they *weren't* in Rust, I'd be a bit worried :)
[04:50:19] <aturon> nrc: thanks for the pointer! I have to run but will look tomorrow
[04:50:22] <cmr> it's all rust, bash, and make.
[04:50:38] <aturon> edunham: ha :) rust is a surprisingly nice scripting language, it turns out
[04:51:21] <cmr> A syntax extension for converting a shell-looking language to Command invocations would be so cool
[04:54:28] <edunham> from what I know of Rust, it starts out miles ahead of many scripting languages in terms of security, parallelizability, and other such nice little details that nobody thinks too hard about until everything's broken
[04:54:43] <edunham> s/many/pretty much all/?
[04:57:35] <acrichto> aturon: I agree that would be a good idea! (an initial meeting to get the lay of the land)
[04:57:57] <acrichto> nrc: to the best of my knowledge the only thing servo does specially for rustc is configure with `--target=arm-linux-androideabi`
[04:58:11] <acrichto> nrc: in which case cmr is right in that we definitely want a better story for downloading the target libs
[04:58:16] <acrichto> and perhaps even a better story for linking
[04:58:48] <acrichto> "first go download the huge android toolchain" is not a great first step
[04:58:58] <nrc> acrichto: aiui, they apply some patches - I've no idea what they do. We should find out.
[04:59:13] <acrichto> nrc: agreed!
[04:59:23] <cmr> I've been using https://gist.github.com/cmr/fecb47d2894212d21e13
[05:00:03] <cmr> acrichto: unfortunately with having to have Android libraries available for all the different versions, and with changing system library versions, it can become quite difficult to do something sane for the NDK.
[05:00:28] <acrichto> cmr: I'd believe it yeah
[05:01:22] <cmr> My hope for lld in the past was that I could set up a single Linux buildhost and have it cross compile to All The Things but it seems the dream of lld is dead, and it will be a much lamer project.
[05:04:42] <acrichto> cmr: unfortunately lld is only half the story, even with a linker that can target everything you still need the target libraries
[05:04:46] <acrichto> e.g. libc, librt, libpthread, etc
[05:17:44] <nrc> acrichto: just asked over on #servo They no longer have extra patches, just build their snapshot with different flags
[05:17:53] <nrc> so, nothing to do :-)

[20:25:57] <edunham> brson: what's the process for getting perms on rust-lang/rust? I have no need to push or review code right now but I would really like to be able to modify tags on issues, and gh's permissions model is kind of all-or-nothing about such things 
[20:29:00] <brson> edunham: i added you to the rust-push group, which lets you tag
[20:30:09] <edunham> brson: thanks! 
[21:24:24] <Gankro> edunham: I'm assigning all my PRs to you, kthx
[21:24:58] <edunham> Gankro: I'll proceed to redirect you onto someone with the expertise to make educated decisions regarding what's good and bad for the language
[21:25:22] <edunham> but if it makes you feel better to delay yourself by going through me then, uhh, go right ahead i guess?
[21:26:51] <Gankro> edunham: I don't understand. You didn't take this job to review implementation details of hashmaps?
[21:27:23] <edunham> Gankro: I may level up into reviewing hashmaps at some point, but now is not that time
[21:27:44] <Gankro> shoot
[21:27:52] <edunham> liike... imagine random noob wanders into rust, fixes some typos in the docs, and for $REASONS happens to have a commit bit. would you ask *them* to review your PRs? :P
[21:28:08] <Gankro> ...maybe
[21:28:30] <Gankro> I would probably backdoor them into the libs team first
[21:28:56] <edunham> I mean, I'll totally look at your PRs and ask questions about them and things, if you want, but design decisions of what code gets in are out of scope for me right now.
[21:30:51] <Gankro> I was mostly joking :P
[21:31:57] <Gankro> Although now that you're slamdunking infra all day, obviously brson and acrichto *obviously* have *nothing* to do anymore... I can probably harass them more...
[21:37:09] <edunham> heh, that'll be a lot truer in a couple months
[21:37:25] <edunham> right now they have more than usual to do, because they have to field my barrage of questions as well as putting out obscure fires
