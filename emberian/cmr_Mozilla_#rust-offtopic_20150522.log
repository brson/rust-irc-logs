[00:18:41] <Sho> why is my Rust 1.0 t-shirt un-ordered hmm
[00:22:29] <ChrisMorgan> Why do such shirt runs never use hi-vis shirts?
[00:24:52] <Sho> ChrisMorgan: I'm that MIME type guy btw
[00:25:33] * ChrisMorgan wishes the distinctions between application/ and text/ were clearer for programming languages
[00:26:07] <ChrisMorgan> text/html, application/xhtml, application/anything+xml, text/javascript, application/javascript, &c.
[00:26:34] <Tiffany> I would probably throw it all under text/ and reserve application/ for binary formats
[00:27:05] <ChrisMorgan> I would too.
[00:27:10] <Sho> Most recent-ish source file formats have been added as subtype of text, and since Rust isn't really execute-with-shebang or anything I think that makes the most sense in any case
[00:27:31] <Tiffany> I don't suppose rustc has a special case for if a file starts with #!
[00:28:22] <huon> Tiffany: I think it doe
[00:28:23] <huon> s
[00:28:47] <huon> https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/test/run-pass/shebang.rs
[00:28:59] <huon> no idea where 'rustx' comes from...
[00:29:21] <huon> (oh, I suppose that tests aren't executed as scripts)
[00:29:41] <ChrisMorgan> Yeah, it treats a shebang specially so that it isn’t a compilation error, but there isn’t a special switch in rustc to make it take action on it or anything.
[00:29:58] <Tiffany> something from the old days that never caused failures?
[00:30:01] <ChrisMorgan> It just treats /^#![^[]/ on the first line as not a syntax error.
[00:30:29] <Tiffany> or maybe just something made up for the test
[00:30:30] <ChrisMorgan> The media type registry is rather devoid of programming language things. You get things like text/python which are generally accepted but which aren’t registered or anything.
[00:30:37] <ChrisMorgan> That’s my expectation.
[00:30:51] * ChrisMorgan should add it to the Rust syntax file
[00:30:53] <ChrisMorgan> for Vim
[00:30:59] <Sho> text/markdown is in, though
[00:31:03] <Sho> Although it's a provisional reg
[00:31:04] <ChrisMorgan> Well, kinda.
[00:31:07] <ChrisMorgan> Yeah.
[00:31:18] <ChrisMorgan> But it’s not a programming language.
[00:31:27] <ChrisMorgan> Well, I wish it wasn’t.
[00:32:28] <Sho> When I did some research prior to picking text/rust to find out if there's a consensus in the community yet, I found references to text/x-rust and text/x-rustsrc, but the latter was very tenuous and the former was mostly just in the editor config files in rust-lang (which I filed PRs against once the shared-mine-info patch was in)
[00:32:38] <Sho> since the whole x- thing has fallen out of fashion ... text/rust
[00:32:52] <Tiffany> fallen out of fashion?
[00:33:04] <Tiffany> I thought the spec said that unofficial types should start with x-
[00:33:23] <Sho> Tiffany: no, there was RFC 6648 to stop doing that
[00:33:27] <Tiffany> oh
[00:34:08] <ChrisMorgan> Sho: text/x-rustsrc was just the pygments lexer, right?
[00:34:51] <Sho> ChrisMorgan: yep
[00:35:03] <Sho> rustsrc *does* make some sense vis-a-vis csrc and cppsrc
[00:35:13] <ChrisMorgan> Oh, haven’t come across them?
[00:35:52] <Sho> they're in shared-mime-info
[00:36:05] <Sho> but most source code types are text/x-foo in there (x-python, x-ruby, ...), and without x- that leaves foo, so in the end I went with that
[00:36:27] <Sho> should an IANA registration effort come up with something else I'll happily go around doing the work to fix this up, though
[00:37:40] * ChrisMorgan didn’t have shared-mime-info installed
[00:38:51] <Sho> it's a dependency of both the KDE/Qt and Gnome/GTK+ stacks, and I think the Enlightenment guys use it these days as well
[00:38:52] <ChrisMorgan> Actually, he did.
[00:39:04] * ChrisMorgan doesn’t use any such stack
[00:39:22] * Sho does :-)

[00:55:58] <ChrisMorgan> Ick, in Pygments lexers, a shebang is by convention Comment.Preproc, and in the Rust lexer attributes are already Comment.Preproc. Ah well.
[00:56:22] <ChrisMorgan> I’d prefer them to be distinct, but it’s not the end of the world if they’re not.
[01:02:32] <lahwran> ?
[01:02:53] <lahwran> shebangs?
[01:02:59] <lahwran> in rust code?
[01:03:10] <ChrisMorgan> Sure, the compiler goes out of its way to ignore them.
[01:03:19] <ChrisMorgan> Without which they’d be a syntax error.
[01:03:34] <lahwran> it does?
[01:03:35] <lahwran> why?
[01:03:40] <ChrisMorgan> Why not?
[01:03:51] <lahwran> because you can't run rust code with a shebang
[01:04:02] <ChrisMorgan> Whyever not?
[01:04:21] <lahwran> because it requires a build and then a run
[01:04:31] <ChrisMorgan> Maybe.
[01:04:42] <ChrisMorgan> But even so, why should that stop you?
[01:06:05] <ChrisMorgan> `cargo run` might need to build things before it can run your code. That doesn’t stop it from existing.
[01:06:22] <Sho> c has bellard's tiny c compiler (tcc) that can be used in a shebang
[01:13:15] <fmtq> yuck

[03:07:53] <XMPPwocky> i have 1.5m of logs from my client
[03:07:58] <XMPPwocky> what're you trying to do
[03:08:40] <Diggsey> saw an interesting article on machine learning, and thought I'd try training their example RNN on IRC logs and get it to make up messages as though it was a particular person :P
[03:09:04] <ChrisMorgan> Markov chains! Woo!

[03:10:05] <cmr> Let's see here.

[03:10:55] <ChrisMorgan> I have 11936.

[03:11:52] <Diggsey> problem is it's normally used with MB of data, so I'm not sure if it will be enough :/
[03:12:24] <cmr> (it's still counting, my VM's disk is slow)
[03:12:40] <Diggsey> that's why I wanted the whole channel, so I could use everyone together to train it on basic sentence structure, and then refine from there
[03:13:13] <cmr> I'd fork over my logs, I have 2 years worth of them from the rust channels.
[03:13:33] <cmr> Does anyone have more?

[03:20:24] <Diggsey> cmr: well maybe with this as a bot you can take some time off from #rust :P
[03:20:27] <ChrisMorgan> Bah, -T0 isn’t working.

[03:38:58] <Mutabah> Or official support (i.e. don't go complaining)
[03:39:25] <Mutabah> I understanding saying "We ensure that this works on ubuntu (becuase we need libs x,y,z at versions a,b,c)
[03:39:35] <Diggsey> well I've tried installing it on arch and it fails, and I haven't even bothered trying it on windows based on stackoverflow answers...

[03:40:44] <c74d> Diggsey: I have over a gigabyte of IRC logs — compressed, and I'd not be surprised if it's easily over five gigabytes uncompressed.
[03:40:47] <Diggsey> they actively check and bail out if it's not on the list
[03:40:51] * ChrisMorgan feels lonely without his ornamentation in /r/rust
[03:42:02] <Diggsey> c74d: I think cmr's will be enough for now, but if I actually get this working decently it may be useful :P

[03:44:48] * ChrisMorgan got this laptop just over a year ago now, and switched from Pidgin to WeeChat at that time
[03:46:17] <Diggsey> well managed to bypass torch's distro check, so we'll see how this goes...
[03:46:27] * ChrisMorgan is glad he finally got round to sending his laptop back to get a screen repair when he did and not a month later when the company went into receivership
[03:46:49] <cmr> yikes

[03:50:46] <ChrisMorgan> And if you go for a mainstream manufacturer, the closest will be in the vicinity of $1,400.
[03:50:54] <Diggsey> is a dedicated card bad?
[03:51:29] <ChrisMorgan> It adds weight, thickness and heat, and I simply don’t do things that warrant it enough.
[03:51:41] <ChrisMorgan> So it’s not the end of the world, but if I can, I will avoid it.
[03:52:35] <whipsch> i specifically got a laptop with a dedicated gpu... but i never use it

[03:52:58] <whipsch> purposefully i should say

[03:53:28] <whipsch> yep, that's exactly my case
[03:53:37] <whipsch> i think i attempted, but had some issue i didnt care to dig into at the time

[03:57:27] <Diggsey> didn't have drivers for the wifi - couldn't download drivers without wifi :P (using a physical medium wasn't an option at the time)
[03:58:05] <ChrisMorgan> A wpa_supplicant upgrade a few weeks ago broke my wifi, so I had to use ethernet to download the old version again.
[03:58:23] <Diggsey> amusingly OpenSUSE installed straight off
[03:59:00] <Diggsey> and it had ALL the drivers for my laptop
[03:59:43] <ChrisMorgan> When I got my first laptop, I installed Ubuntu 9.10 (the most recent at the time) alongside Vista six months later (when I no longer had any pressing need for the laptop, so if things got broken I had time to fix them). Six months later again, I scrubbed Vista from it, never having booted into it again (though I had expected to). Then a year ago when I got this laptop I decided it was

[16:39:51] <lahwran> it isn't very secure?
[16:39:58] <lahwran> it seems plenty secure to me
[16:40:00] <lahwran> just not at all private
[16:40:10] <lahwran> you can't alter things without authorization
[16:40:18] <XMPPwocky> the idea is, a "textbook" tree isn't very good on many real-world datasets, because the nodes are spread out everywhere and not contiguous
[16:40:22] <lahwran> but you can see whatever you want with any authorization
[16:40:23] <XMPPwocky> so you get lots of cache misses
[16:40:39] <Tiffany> lahwran: the main problem is that 51% attacks are trivial to anyone with a couple million dollars
[16:40:47] <Tiffany> like, there have already been entities which hit 51%
[16:40:49] <XMPPwocky> with a btree, B nodes (b being a constant)
[16:40:54] <XMPPwocky> are stored in one allocation
[16:41:12] <Tiffany> I don't think you even need to have 51% of the nodes in order to perform attacks against bitcoin either
[16:41:14] <Havvy> Tiffany:  That's more a size issue right now.
[16:41:15] <Tiffany> you just have to segregate the network
[16:41:28] <Tiffany> havvy: is it?
[16:41:43] <dfockler> lahwran: and you can't exchange it for other currency easily without having trust, otherwise you end up with things like Mt.Gox
[16:41:45] <Tiffany> if bitcoin scales up, the number of nodes will be going down
[16:41:46] <Tiffany> not up

[16:43:32] <Tiffany> and yeah, that problem applies to all currencies dfockler
[16:43:48] <Tiffany> in order to get another currency, you have to trade with someone who has it
[16:43:52] <XMPPwocky> Havvy: iirc, the limit is something like 3 transactions per second
[16:43:59] <Tiffany> mtgox was shitty, but that's not a fundamental problem with bitcoin
[16:44:01] <XMPPwocky> any more than that, and the blocks become too big for the protocol
[16:44:11] <Tiffany> xmppwocky: that doesn't make sense
[16:44:18] <XMPPwocky> Tiffany: there's a 1mb block limit
[16:44:26] <Tiffany> transactions aren't very big
[16:44:42] <Tiffany> I think the current throughput limit is more like 10
[16:44:53] <XMPPwocky> it's 7, apparently
[16:44:54] <Tiffany> and the protocol can be adjusted to have blocks occur more often
[16:45:19] <Tiffany> of course, then the problem becomes that the blockchain will grow even faster than it is already
[16:45:27] <XMPPwocky> right
[16:45:38] <Tiffany> it's already stupidly large, and bitcoin isn't even that big
[16:45:44] <XMPPwocky> if bitcoin ever catches on, i see it as a method of settlement between large banks
[16:45:51] <Tiffany> I don't
[16:46:09] <Tiffany> I see bitcoin staying where it is now indefinitely
[16:46:12] <XMPPwocky> a distributed trustless ledger has a decent bit of value there
[16:46:15] <Tiffany> stellar might be used for settlements between banks
[16:46:15] <XMPPwocky> note the if :P
[16:46:18] <Tiffany> but not the stellar currency
[16:46:23] <Tiffany> the stellar currency is kind of crap
[16:46:28] <Tiffany> the protocol though, it's nice
[16:46:54] <Tiffany> I don't think banks would like bitcoin's mode of operation xmppwocky
[16:47:08] <Tiffany> like for one thing, you can only exchange bitcoins, not USD or euros
[16:47:25] <Tiffany> and for two, control of the network is determined based on proof of work, so whoever has the most computing resources controls the network
[16:47:39] <Tiffany> stellar is based on trust
[16:47:54] <XMPPwocky> right, i don't think it'll happen
[16:48:44] <XMPPwocky> i'm just saying that's one use case where the block issues aren't that dominant
[16:49:00] <XMPPwocky> for some reason people keep going on about bitcoin micropayments, when that's actually the *worst* case
[16:49:20] <XMPPwocky> sites that claim to offer it, like ChangeTip, don't actually use bitcoin internally

[16:50:29] <Tiffany> lol that's awful
[16:50:49] <Tiffany> stellar would be better for microtransactions, since the ledger doesn't need to be on every client
[16:51:07] <XMPPwocky> i also want to see a "quantum escape hatch" in some cryptocurrency
[16:51:08] <Tiffany> they'd also settle faster
[16:51:16] <Tiffany> waiting an hour for your microtransaction to settle is a pretty huge downside
[16:51:47] <Tiffany> iirc it takes a single digit number of seconds for transactions to settle on the stellar network
[16:51:48] <dfockler> Yeah, that would be unusable for in-person transactions
[16:51:59] <Astrum|Lap> do we have cryptocurrencies 2.0 yet? we need to make up a silly term so it'll catch on faster!
[16:51:59] <XMPPwocky> i.e. pubkeys also have, besides an ECDSA public key, a merkle public key, or something similar
[16:52:25] <Tiffany> you can always change up the protocol once quantum computers are a thing, xmppwocky
[16:52:35] <Tiffany> the problem is that none of the existing quantum-safe public key crypto is particularly enticing

[16:53:00] <Tiffany> uh
[16:53:00] <lahwran> instead of cryptocurrencies
[16:53:04] <Tiffany> you would have some time to transition
[16:53:13] <Tiffany> it's not like a quantum computer is going to instantly factor everyone's keys
[16:53:18] <lahwran> statistical currencies are just "this user probably has this much money, confidence=0.95"
[16:53:22] <Tiffany> it still takes time
[16:53:36] <Tiffany> it will just take less time than waiting for the heat death of the universe
[16:53:46] <Tiffany> there will also be a fair bit of warning
[16:54:01] <Tiffany> the first generation of quantum computers won't have enough bits to run shor's algorithm for most keys
[16:54:18] <XMPPwocky> lahwran: bitcoin does that very well! i had 20 cents in my wallet a few weeks ago, now i have 17
[16:54:21] <XMPPwocky> it's so exciting
[16:54:23] <Tiffany> I think there are already some quantum computers actually
[16:54:27] <Tiffany> they just really don't have many bits
[16:54:53] <Astrum|Lap> XMPPwocky: give it a bit, you'll have $1,000
[16:54:58] <Astrum|Lap> then $0.01
[16:55:02] <Astrum|Lap> =P
[16:55:09] <Tiffany> lahwran, that's pretty much how currencies work now
[16:55:10] <dfockler> Then back up to $1,000
[16:55:16] <Tiffany> it's not like the network agrees how much money you have all at once
[16:55:22] <Tiffany> especially with bitconi
[16:55:23] <lahwran> Tiffany: err
[16:55:28] <lahwran> it is?
[16:55:31] <lahwran> I don't think it is
[16:55:35] <Tiffany> there's a reason why you need to wait half a dozen blocks before you can be sure a transaction has settled
[16:55:40] <Tiffany> and it's because sometimes blocks get rolled back
[16:55:56] <Tiffany> I mean, it's not formalised or anything
[16:56:09] <Tiffany> but the general logic is that the more you want to make sure the transaction was legit, the more blocks you wait

[20:03:02] <Astrum|Lap> I'm older
[20:03:10] <Tiffany> irc itself is about 23, so you'd have to probably be at least 33 in order to say irc is newfangled

[20:03:29] <Astrum|Lap> can't be right
[20:03:44] <Sho> it's from '88 or '89
[20:04:12] <dfockler> so 23 would be from 92 or 93
[20:04:20] <Sho> I started using it in '96
[20:04:29] <Astrum|Lap> "Over the past decade IRC usage has been declining: since 2003 it has lost 60% of its users (from 1 million to about 400,000 in 2014) and half of its channels (from half a million in 2003)."
[20:04:31] <Astrum|Lap> how sad
[20:04:36] <Sho> I used to be 10 years younger than everyone on IRC, and suddenly there's younger people around

[20:04:49] <Astrum|Lap> I started using it in... 2001-2002 or so
[20:04:50] <Tiffany> rfc 1459 is from 1993
[20:05:03] <Astrum|Lap> though I suppose IRC was popular in various games in the late 90s
[20:05:04] <Tiffany> I don't really think about when irc was created, but rather when it was standardised
[20:05:08] <Astrum|Lap> but I was a HPB

[20:07:50] <Astrum|Lap> well 20 sucked, couldn't legally drink =P
[20:09:02] <Tiffany> I recently turned 20
[20:09:07] <Sho> Mostly it's a strange thing that if you stay young and continue to do young-people things, inevitably everyone around you is going to be younger

[20:21:48] <mrmonday> used to be that it'd work with everything
[20:21:58] <mrmonday> now it only works with dying protocols, it seems :L
[20:22:11] <Astrum|Lap> mrmonday: yeah, I have adium installed
[20:22:12] <Tiffany> I never really used pidgin
[20:22:16] <Astrum|Lap> though I haven't used it in forever
[20:22:18] <Tiffany> it was bad at irc, and that was all I ever used it for
[20:22:30] <Astrum|Lap> AOL instant messenger, MSN messenger...
[20:22:31] <Sho> mrmonday: Yeah, we spent a ton of effort implementing a really nice accounts system and well-integrated IM components over at KDE, and now it's basically useless for real users 
[20:23:41] <mrmonday> there has been some work at getting an open source implementation of facebook's messaging service (since they scrapped XMPP), I dunno how well it works though
[20:23:47] <Sho> Because they use WhatsApp/Viber/KaTalk/Line/YakYak/Whatever, and none of them have APIs or federate
[20:24:02] <Sho> Ironically Facebook Messenger is actually *less* evil than that
[20:24:10] <Tiffany> yikyak is horrifying
[20:24:17] <mrmonday> it's the only one I care about so much
[20:24:20] <Astrum|Lap> how did all of these messaging services come to be?
[20:24:35] <Sho> well, Korea is special for a number of reasons ...
[20:24:36] <Astrum|Lap> I seriously don't understand how the market even exists
[20:24:39] <lahwran> I haven't used any of those
[20:24:42] <Tiffany> one killer feature and you have millions of users within days, astrum
[20:24:57] <Tiffany> the definition of a killer feature is, of course, that which the current app doesn't have
[20:25:02] <Tiffany> such as a dislike button
[20:25:02] <fkaa> my friend convinced me to get viber
[20:25:15] <Astrum|Lap> well yeah, it seems like most of these things are one trick ponies

[20:25:36] <mrmonday> Sho: such a shame really :( I'm really hoping someone gets motivated to reverse engineer them all and get them working
[20:25:53] <Tiffany> I'm really hoping they'll all die off and people will go back to standard protocols
[20:26:02] <mrmonday> wishful thinking
[20:26:04] <mrmonday> but I agree
[20:26:06] <Sho> - Korea has great infra but lousy international peering and its internet companies are in bed with carriers and what not, making it hard for the Western companies to gain a foothold there - Google has a minority search engine market share for example, and most of its sites are slow and inferior to local alternatives
[20:26:13] <Astrum|Lap> yeah, I kind of doubt that'll happen, Tiffany

[20:26:57] <Sho> - Korea's very anti-internet-anonymity, and it's a hurdle for non-local companies to integrate with the gov-run auth systems and stuff, you can't really do it without setting up shop there
[20:27:11] <Sho> - Korea wasn't happy with the 40+ bit crypto export embargo the US had going, so they developed their own block cipher and made it mandatory for ecommerce, ... more integration hurdles
[20:27:21] <Tiffany> oh yeah, I remember about that
[20:27:23] <Sho> so the local companies run the show, and they simply made their messenger dominatew
[20:27:38] <Tiffany> there's mmorpg's which never bothered to build in any kind of protection against malicious players, since your real-life identity is tied to the game
[20:27:42] <dfockler> It's interesting that Chinese companies don't open source more software

[20:28:41] <Tiffany> it's really shitty, isn't it
[20:29:02] <Sho> Tiffany: It's called SEED
[20:29:13] <Sho> afaik it's unbroken
[20:29:34] <Sho> But the hilarious part is where the only sanctioned implementation is an ActiveX control, keeping most of the country on old versions of MSIE for ecommerce
[20:29:37] <Astrum|Lap> also, what is gitter's protocol? it seems to be trying to take over the IRC segment that caters to developers
[20:29:46] <Tiffany> good god
[20:29:58] <Tiffany> there's also slack, astrum
[20:29:59] <Sho> Most actively deployed Korean websites are still written for MSIE6 compatibility
[20:30:43] <Tiffany> do they mandate the use of a particular cipher mode of operation?
[20:30:50] <Tiffany> because lol ECB
[20:31:14] <Astrum|Lap> oh well, I'm clearly too old to care about all these fads =D
[20:31:36] <Sho> Tiffany: dunno, I never looked at the details much
[20:31:38] <Tiffany> "NSS software security library in Mozilla's Gecko platform has implemented support for SEED,[2] and Mozilla Firefox as of 3.5.4 supports SEED as a TLS cipher;[3] however, Mozilla decided to drop the support of SEED by default in Firefox 27 and above because support for SEED has not had any practical positive effect in terms of helping South Korea migrate away from ActiveX-based e-commerce, and other browsers are not offering any 
[20:31:39] <Tiffany> SEED-based cipher suites.[4][5] NSS still supports SEED-based cipher suites."
[20:32:09] <Tiffany> this is really awful
[20:32:23] <Tiffany> so you can't buy anything online in south korea unless you run windows and IE?
[20:32:51] <dfockler> Is that because of their ISPs?
[20:33:16] <Sho> Tiffany: More or less. There's some indirection schemes like using a Win+IE system to put funds on your $account with $big_corp, and then you can use your Samsung phone to buy stuff with the charge on your account
[20:33:53] <Tiffany> why don't browsers bother to implement it?
[20:34:38] <Tiffany> I mean, sure, there are other hurdles to being able to access sites which for the past 17 years have only worked in IE
[20:34:42] <Manishearth> Astrum|Lap: Portland was *very* good. plus eddyb turned up in a suit. so it was like prom for him :p
[20:35:42] <Sho> Tiffany: It doesn't work because there's a bunch of cert stuff coming with the official ActiveX control that's needed for both ends to work together
[20:35:50] <Sho> Tiffany: That's why the NSS impl didn't help
[20:36:03] <Tiffany> ugh
[20:36:24] <killercup> Astrum|Lap: https://irc.gitter.im/ ;)
[20:36:41] <Sho> Tiffany: It's because it's not just about the cipher, it's tied into the non-anonymity idea where every citizen has a national ID number and an "i(nternet) PIN"
[20:37:08] <Sho> It's all pretty horrifying tbh

[20:45:43] <Astrum|Lap> why must you be so irritating
[20:45:46] <Sho> Tiffany: Which is an issue because South Korea has one of the lowest birth rates in the world and is increasingly reliant on immigration to keep its economy going, so they're accumulating a foreign resident class with no political representation
[20:46:06] <Tiffany> welp
[20:46:38] <Sho> Tiffany: Basically - South Korea is a democracy, and it's the only case of a SEA country that got there by itself, but it *was* a military dictatorship until the 80s, and there's still plenty of banana republic legislation from those days on the books - it's a very immature state in many ways
[20:46:57] <Sho> It also has a completely incompetent political left, unfortunately

[21:10:43] <Sho> Tiffany: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHu39FEFIks&t=50s <- to go deep .. here's a recent-ish pop song sung by a girl your age that acts like a nostalgia piece about the Sogyeokdong district in Seoul, except at the time the flashbacks are set it's where the dictatorship's Defense Security Command had its HQ, which would e.g. arrest students involved with the democratication movement and interrogate them (killing some in the process) and/
[21:10:44] <Sho> or turn them into spies - the siren in the video is the curfew signal, the radio thing is about this "school greening project", and the "do you remember sogyeokdong? it hasn't changed at all ..." lyrics get recast into bitter cynicism in context

[23:21:21] <Tiffany> a lot of them weren't even optimising compilers, and if they were, they were typically doing things like register allocation and instruction scheduling, not higher level stuff like inlining, const folding, and changing around expression evaluation
[23:21:33] <Tiffany> I'll poke around, I guess
[23:21:50] <Tiffany> probably borland C++

[23:35:31] <niconii> ...well that's a new one
[23:35:44] <niconii> chromium has decided it doesn't want to listen to my keyboard
[23:36:03] <niconii> i can paste text in the address bar, but typing does nothing
[23:36:37] <niconii> and (as you might be able to tell by the fact i can tell you this) i can type in other programs

[23:46:38] <niconii> well, at least it fixed itself when i restarted chromium but
[23:46:45] <niconii> still strange...
[23:49:11] <c74d> niconii: did you accidentally activate an IME?

[23:54:37] <Tobba> hm
[23:54:49] <Tobba> I wish KDE5 wasn't so uselessly buggy :(
[23:55:19] <Tobba> (still better than GNOME 3)
[23:56:33] <Tobba> actually not really buggy, just poorly thought out
[23:56:59] <Tiffany> it was pretty damn buggy last time I used it tobba
[23:57:10] <Tiffany> mainly, every time someone highlighted me in hexchat, the KDE panel would crash
[23:57:29] <Tiffany> er, that was back when I was using xchat, not hexchat
[23:57:29] <Tobba> I've had it crash a few times and half of the menu thingy dissapears a lot
[23:57:43] <Tiffany> I stopped using lxde because of its tendency for lxpanel to crash
[23:57:52] <Tobba> but I'm mainly annoyed by the fact that it's 2015 and context menus are still getting blocked by tooltips
[23:57:54] <whipsch> its been workinng fairly well for me, even with vmware making things broken at first
[23:58:41] <Tobba> and I can't give two panels the same height, or even align them to the screen edges, because you have to pixel-perfectly drag things around to accomplish that
