[02:58:18] <huon> very cool

[02:58:36] <swgillespie> I dunno why I put it here, haha
[02:58:43] <huon> JITs are awesome
[02:59:08] <huon> I used jit.rs to write a super optimised implmementaiton of FRACTRAN, that was fun
[02:59:17] <swgillespie> yeah! and libgccjit.so is really, really cool
[02:59:22] <swgillespie> oh nice!
[02:59:38] <swgillespie> I looked to jit.rs a lot for API inspiration, haha
[03:01:22] <huon> swgillespie: hm, I'm confused by the docs
[03:01:36] <swgillespie> huon: in what way?
[03:01:49] <huon> how does one say, add `a = b + c` to a block
[03:02:01] <huon> oh, add_assignment_op?
[03:02:08] <huon> what about say `a = f()`?
[03:02:18] <eddyb> 400MB to compile r3... and I'm just getting started :(

[03:03:03] <swgillespie> huon: gccjit seems to delegate the creation of RValues to the Context object
[03:03:17] <huon> ah, I see
[03:03:22] <huon> `new_call`
[03:03:31] <huon> things make more sense now
[03:03:47] <swgillespie> huon: so you can use the context object to make rvalues, and then blocks to bind them to "statements", sorta
[03:03:54] <swgillespie> i should rewrite the docs now
[03:04:15] <swgillespie> i also need to read more of gccjit's docs, haha... the API is a little confusing
[03:04:49] <huon> I wonder if one could use a "thin" API like that to build a higher level API with more conveniences
[03:05:33] <swgillespie> that would be nice. I think the C++ interface to gccjit does that, the high-level APIs make heavy use of operator overloads and such
[03:05:43] <swgillespie> that would be very cool
[03:06:28] <huon> and one could maybe get some more typesafety with phantom types in the values and so on
[03:06:55] <huon> RValue<u8> etc.
[03:07:29] <huon> (although the nature of dynamic compilation makes me wonder if this wouldn't work so well)
[03:08:51] <swgillespie> that would be really interesting
[03:08:56] <swgillespie> hmm

[07:34:03] <bstrie> The way NetHack keeps track of which items are artifacts is through their names; this saves memory and allows a flexible artifact set (i.e. multiple artifacts can be of the same item type).
[07:34:08] <bstrie> As a consequence of this mechanic, naming e.g. a long sword "Excalibur" would turn it into Excalibur. So if you try to name a non-artifact with the name of an artifact of the same base type, the game will prevent you and you will mis-engrave. ("Your hand slips...")

[18:41:58] <Gankro> bstrie: So all the interns are sitting together?
[18:45:32] <bstrie> Gankro: mozilla has several floors and I only have access to the most awesome one, so I can't say for sure. they kicked me out of the loungey area and set up several rows of desks in a line for the interns
[18:46:28] <Gankro> Is it near anyone else?
[18:47:28] <bstrie> the floor layout is like this: long rectangular kitchen area, where one side is food prep/bar seating and the other side is tables and couches and chairs
[18:48:10] <Gankro> So all the rust people are in the same place?
[18:48:16] <bstrie> on the food side are the doors that lead into the employee desk area, on the table side is the door leading to the skydeck
[18:48:53] <bstrie> on the far end of the rectangle is the loungey area, which has big windows with views of the skydeck and also whiteboards and a projector
[18:49:19] <bstrie> all the rust folk are on this floor, at least as far as I know
[18:49:40] <bstrie> I see them here all the time, though it's possible their desks are elsewhere and they're only here because this is the best floor
[18:49:53] <bstrie> because of the aforementioned skydeck
[18:51:41] <bstrie> counting them now, there are definitely going to be more interns at mozilla than there are desks here. so no clue if this is where they actually want you

[18:52:02] <bstrie> but w/e you'll have a badge, you can go where you please :P
[18:52:23] <Gankro> I can camp in the kitchen
[18:52:34] <Gankro> Become some kind of bridge troll for juice
[18:54:14] <bstrie> there are other areas of the floor that might house interns, but I haven't explored them much because I don't think I'm actually supposed to creeping around there so I'm laying as low as I can given the fact that I am a 6'3" rainbow man

[20:10:15] <XMPPwocky> hm
[20:10:47] <XMPPwocky> suppose you have, say, a gb of binary data, and one byte is 0xFF, and you want to find it. supposing you have, say, 4 cores
[20:11:16] <XMPPwocky> should core 1 check 0..1GB/N, 2 check 1GB/N..2*1GB/N... and so on, or
[20:11:58] <XMPPwocky> should core 1 start at 0 and check every Nth byte, core 2 start at 1 and check every Nth byte after that... 
[20:12:13] <XMPPwocky> in practice it's larger than a byte
[20:14:53] <FreeFull> XMPPwocky: I bet the search will be very fast with just a linear scan and a single core
[20:15:00] <FreeFull> Unless the search criterion itself is really complicated
[20:15:08] <XMPPwocky> it's just a comparison
[20:15:19] <XMPPwocky> the pattern is actually, maybe no more than 16 bytes

[21:51:39] <WindowsBunny> XMPPwocky: Each core should have its own contiguous block of memory to scan
[21:51:55] <WindowsBunny> XMPPwocky: If you alternate bytes between cores, you're going to have a VERY bad time
[22:04:36] <proc> WindowsBunny: wouldn't that also decrease performance ?
[22:06:25] <WindowsBunny> proc: that's why I said you'd have a very bad time
[22:06:32] <WindowsBunny> because performance would be awful
[22:07:25] <proc> WindowsBunny: ah, thought only at concurrency & comm. problems
[22:07:35] <proc> (who knows when which is his own.. etc )
[22:08:04] <Astrum|Lap> cache coherency, yay
[22:09:20] <WindowsBunny> cache is a critical factor in any operation that works with large amounts of data
[22:09:42] <Astrum|Lap> WindowsBunny: better question, how large should these contiguous blocks be =)
[22:10:10] <WindowsBunny> Astrum|Lap: I'd think just dividing the file into equal parts for each core
[22:10:17] <WindowsBunny> and make sure the divisions are aligned to cache lines
[22:14:24] <Astrum|Lap> yeah
[22:14:58] <Astrum|Lap> though... I'd benchmark to see in either case
[22:15:08] <Astrum|Lap> CPUs do weird things
