[14:08:40] <Ilari> Still that piece of snake oil?
[14:08:50] <Tiffany> yeah
[14:11:21] <Tiffany> he's basically saying that, because they're pointing out obvious flaws instead of actually spending the time to do a proper cryptanalysis and develop a key extraction, that his cipher is secure
[14:11:31] <Tiffany> and that they're just rejecting it for being different

[16:31:28] <bascule> cool story bro
[16:31:44] <bascule> https://twitter.com/bascule/status/601266439912206336
[16:55:52] <Tiffany> oh, RC4 is biased?
[16:56:03] <Tiffany> I wonder what something else like AES looks like in 3D frequency analysis
[17:03:40] <bascule> oh snap
[17:03:59] <bascule> cystalline cramk dude just went after KP
[17:04:04] <bascule> crank...
[17:04:30] <bascule> lol this is so ironic considering Kenny broke RC4 lol
[17:04:53] <bascule> "Further, I would like to gain an insight as to your personal opinion in regards to some of the fud that has been posted to this group in regards to what is, or is not, a break in a cipher."
[17:04:59] <bascule> hahahaha
[17:24:24] <klutzy> "A break is not the lack of plausible deniability" oh no who teached the word "deniability" to them
[17:28:50] <Tiffany> I think the only reason he's actually given so far for why anyone would use his cipher is that the NSA doesn't vouch for it?
[17:31:45] <Tiffany> how many ciphers has the NSA even had any involvement in?
[17:35:22] <Ilari> You mean symmetric ciphers?
[17:35:55] <Tiffany> any kind, I suppose
[17:36:41] <Tiffany> alright, here we go
[17:37:36] <Tiffany> NSA ran the competitions to select the algorithms for DES, AES, SHA, and they're responsible for a few algorithms themselves, none of which I've heard of
[17:37:45] <Ilari> At least SIMON and SPECK...
[17:38:40] <Ilari> Dunno if those are any good... At least those aren't horribly broken according to academic cryptoanalysis.
[17:39:08] <Ilari> Certainly more trustworthy than Crystalline. :->
[17:39:24] <Tiffany> but it looks like they didn't actually have any involvement in rijndael, they just selected it
[17:40:47] <Tiffany> I'm not sure if this guy has no idea there are ciphers other than AES, or if he believes there's a conspiracy to inject backdoors into every other cipher
[17:42:08] <Tiffany> I wonder if the NSA actually bothers to try adding backdoors into their crypto
[17:42:14] <Tiffany> it seems like they would just get found eventually anyway
[17:43:59] <Ilari> Also, I very much doubt they would do anything advanced with crypto backdoors.
[17:45:31] <Tiffany> heh
[17:45:37] <Tiffany> suite A is protected by security by obscurity
[17:46:13] <Tiffany> I suppose the idea is to make it so that if you do manage to get some data encrypted with it, men with guns will break down your door before you've managed to work out a cryptanalysis
[17:46:47] <Ilari> I suppose those algorithms aren't a joke either...
[17:48:55] <Tiffany> it looks like they endorse ECC, and you could certainly build a conspiracy theory that they endorse ECC because it can be broken with shor's algorithm
[17:49:07] <Ilari> Also, there have been some backdoored symmetric ciphers. The way those usually worked is that most of the keys are weak (and some are very weak) in some non-obvious way.
[17:49:22] <Tiffany> like skipjack?
[17:50:00] <Ilari> Nope, AFAIK, Skipjack doesn't have lots of weak keys.
[17:50:10] <Tiffany> oh
[17:50:55] <Ilari> Skipjack was used in clipper chip, which operated in way that tried to enforce encrypting to backdoor key too (but that mechanism had some security problems).
[17:51:49] <Ilari> Also, fun fact about Skipjack. It has 32 rounds. Even one round less and it can be successfully cryptoanalyzed...
[17:52:35] <Tiffany> yeah, the wikipedia page said the best public cryptanalysis breaks 31 of 32 rounds, although only slightly faster than exhaustive search
[17:53:00] <Tiffany> oh, "impossible differential cryptanalysis"
[17:53:18] <Ilari> Yeah, "broken" doesn't mean it can be in practice be broken.
[17:54:06] <Ilari> E.g. 256-bit cipher that can be broken with 2^224 effort (little memory and little ciphertext) is quite broken, but it isn't even near practically breakable.
[17:54:19] <Tiffany> oh
[17:54:30] <Tiffany> impossible differential cryptanalysis doesn't mean what I thought it meant
[17:55:02] <Tiffany> what does broken mean in that context?
[17:55:10] <Tiffany> it seems to me that the cipher just has a lower WF than perfect
[17:56:03] <Ilari> I think preimage resistance of MD5 has been broken too, but computing preimages for MD5 is far out of reach.
[17:58:14] <cmr> Tiffany: broken ~ "known better than brute force attack"
[17:58:33] <Tiffany> is there any cipher which isn't "broken" under that definition though?
[17:59:25] <Tiffany> I mean even salsa20 has a cryptanalysis that recovers a 256-bit key in 2^251 operations
[18:03:01] <Ilari> Full cipher or reduced-round (8 rounds I think)? And the 8-round one has seemingly been improved to 2^250.
[18:03:31] <Tiffany> oh
[18:03:37] <Tiffany> I think it's 8
[18:03:42] <Tiffany> "2008 cryptanalysis breaks 8 out of 20 rounds to recover the 256-bit secret key in 2251 operations, using 231 keystream pairs.[2]"
[18:03:43] <Ilari> Also, even if some cipher is secure if keyed the usual way, doesn't mean it is secure if keyed in unusual ways (e.g. block cipher to hash conversion).
[18:04:09] <Tiffany> ah
[18:04:30] <Ilari> AFAIK, Chacha8 is not known to be broken (but probably a bad idea to use it).
[18:04:34] <Tiffany> so a cryptanalysis might be significantly stronger depending on usecase
[18:07:51] <Ilari> Apparently Skylake-based Xeons and Knight's Landing have AVX-512F. Wonder what kind of performance will Chacha20-Poly1305 get on that...
[18:07:58] <Ilari> *will have
[18:13:09] <Ilari> Basically Chacha20-Poly1305 vectorizes very well.
[18:15:48] <eternaleye> Doesn't chacha operate on 512-bit units?
[18:15:55] <Ilari> Yes, it does.
[18:22:10] <Tiffany> nice
[18:23:36] <Ilari> I heard that they don't want to release AVX-512F Chacha20-Poly1305 code before CPUs using that are in retail.
[18:23:51] <Ilari> Or at least in tapeout or something like that...
[18:36:07] <Ilari> Okay, it looks like computing tables to break DHE instances with given p faster is about the same effort as solving one DHE instance with the same p (or slower, in case one wants to get faster per-key calculations).

[22:09:33] <Ilari> Also, Knuth shuffle with bitflipping seems like a bad way to scramble and flip bits, even if the underlying RNG is good.
[22:11:19] <Tiffany> yeah, if you really did want to use a shuffling-based approach, you could do a lot better than this
[22:11:27] <Tiffany> the number of biases is too large to bother counting
[22:12:25] <Ilari> I actually tried implementing it. The output looks very biased, even with RNG that isn't total garbage.
[22:12:58] <Tiffany> oh, did you look at his code?
[22:13:13] <Ilari> OTOH, remove the bitflips and have n 1s and n 0s: The output looks random.
[22:14:47] <Tiffany> the whole thing is so non-constant-time that it's almost like he's trying to make timing attacks impractical through the sheer chaotic nature of the system
[22:16:07] <Ilari> I did that half-ones-half-zeros-and-shuffle test as sanity check.
[22:20:39] <Ilari> Basically, if one has a good PRNG stream, one of the best way to make an cipher out of it is to use bitwise XOR.
[22:21:41] <Tiffany> I was wondering about that
[22:22:03] <Tiffany> you could massively reduce the key size using a PRNG, since it only requires long keys, not very random keys
[22:24:58] <Tiffany> the amount of fixes you need to make to make this practical though.. you might as well just use a proper stream cipher
