[02:20:14] <larsberg> Ugh. I am seriously about one more day of hacking away from just throwing away all of the glX code and switching the linux backend over to egl 
[02:38:42] <cmr> why not?
[02:39:44] <cmr> (use egl on linux, that is)
[02:40:49] <larsberg> cmr: We're planning to eventually, since it will also unify our android and linux backends more
[02:41:45] <cmr> oh, it's just a matter of doing it?
[02:41:51] <larsberg> We just use it now because we have a whole bunch of code and libraries already that support it :-) But it means that there are, e.g., three different places where we determine what X visual to use with strange different sets of constants that behave slightly differently on each hardware config

[02:46:53] <cmr> oh, I have a PR waiting, but it breaks things more than it fixes them, but I think it might be a runtime bug, so waiting for a rust upgrade
[02:52:01] <larsberg> glad to hear that!
[02:52:24] <larsberg> We're probably going to get onto a Rust upgrade soon, but I strongly suspect it's going to be at least a week to land it.
[02:52:48] <cmr> At one point I went to look at the submodules to update themb ut I got sidetracked... is there a list somewhere?
[02:52:56] <larsberg> We've been a while since our last one, and they usually take 3-4 days for even small ones with all the submodule updates, etc. and this one has some pretty major changes.
[02:53:14] <cmr> Also are the submodules under rust-ci?
[02:53:53] <larsberg> 'git submodule status' from the root
[02:54:52] <larsberg> Depends on the submodule. I know bjz's are.
[02:55:55] <larsberg> I think the ones that we own (in the github.com/mozilla-servo account/organization thingie) are not under rust-ci yet
[02:55:58] <cmr> Any opposition to me adding the rest? :)
[02:56:12] <larsberg> We should chat with jack
[02:56:26] <larsberg> We have problems sometimes when the submodules get on a rust that's too far ahead of servo
[02:56:36] <larsberg> Then we can't land changes that touch those modules without forcing a rust upgrade
[02:56:48] <larsberg> Which takes between a couple of days and a week
[02:57:07] <cmr> well, couldn't it just be on a branch?
[02:57:26] <larsberg> Totally could be, and that's why I'd want to talk with jack about how he'd like that laid out
[02:57:43] <larsberg> I know he had some plans for how he wanted it all to change, but i don't think they're written up anywhere
[02:57:46] <cmr> cool
[02:58:13] <larsberg> Thanks for volunteering to add them, btw :-)

[16:29:19] <larsberg> dhedlund: no problem - happy to help with any OSX stuff you need
[16:29:51] <larsberg> Are you on linux right now? And if, what graphics chipset are you using? (I'm working on nvidia stuff and trying to get a sense of what's working for people - the core team seems to be intel-only)
[16:30:52] <dhedlund> larsberg: I'm running ATI w/ xf86-video-ati driver
[16:31:24] <dhedlund> larsberg: 01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. [AMD/ATI] Turks PRO [Radeon HD 7570]
[16:31:55] <larsberg> dhedlund: thanks! So it is, indeed, only nvidia that gives us headaches...
[16:33:04] <dhedlund> larsberg: My servo window corrupts when I switch between virtual desktops or out of X and back in.
[16:33:51] <dhedlund> larsberg: goes black
[16:34:32] <larsberg> dhedlund: That's not good! Does it do the same if you cover it with another window and then move that window off?
[16:35:21] <dhedlund> larsberg: I also get a lot of "*** Error in `./servo': corrupted double-linked list: 0x0000000001e699b0 ***" errors and the app hangs when I run some tests or hit <ESC> in the browser window
[16:36:30] <dhedlund> larsberg: yes, covering it with another window also causes blanking that doesn't repaint.  Resizing the window itself does repaint it though.
[16:37:40] <dhedlund> larsberg: I thought it might've been a general problem since I don't have another platform for contex, but if it's not then I might be able to dig in and take a look.
[16:37:47] <larsberg> dhedlund: Thanks for the info! I'll open some issues on those.
[16:38:07] <larsberg> dhedlund: I'm digging into some of our Linux graphics woes right now.
[16:38:35] <larsberg> One thing I might end up doing soon-ish is just dumping our dependency on glX and moving to EGL (which we need for Android support anyway)
[16:39:18] <larsberg> We have a bunch of duplicated code in rust-layers and skia that does stuff like choosing the X visual we use that gets slightly different and incompatible results depending on where we call it all from that I suspect is leading to some of our problems.
[16:41:11] <dhedlund> larsberg: makes sense.  While digging into a font metrics bug, I noticed the src/components/gfx/platform/{linux,android}/font.rs files were almost identical, except for some f64 vs float variations.  Are those variations just because of rust version drift, or is that a significant platform difference?
[16:42:10] <larsberg> dhedlund: I suspect it's rust version drift. They were probably the same originally, but we stopped compiling for Android a few rust upgrades ago and I would imagine that code has atrophied and will need to be re-examined when we get servo running on Android again.
[16:42:28] <eddyb> myeah, float => f64
[16:43:11] <dhedlund> eddyb: on 64-bit arch yes.  doesn't 'float' just alias back to a C/C++ float which is arch dependent?
[16:43:34] <eddyb> well, it might have, but I can't remember the precise rules
[16:43:56] <eddyb> well, no, float is never f64 AFAIK in C, while the old Rust float was f64 on most platforms
[16:44:27] <eddyb> just like int/uint are proper intptr_t/uintptr_t instead of having a ton of silly rules

[16:47:15] <dhedlund> eddyb: thanks
[16:48:22] <eddyb> IMO android should just use linux where possible
[16:50:20] <larsberg> eddyb: agreed, but we have to go the other way and make the linux path android-compatible
[16:50:29] <larsberg> We currently use a bunch of stuff like glX that isn't available there
[16:50:40] <larsberg> Fortunately we just use opengl es, which should just port over fine
[16:50:58] <larsberg> And moving to EGL should let us share some of the code for e.g. creating the pixmaps
[16:51:06] <eddyb> wayland, maybe?
[16:52:14] <larsberg> eddyb: I don't know enough about it. I hear it mentioned in stuff like the gfx discussions as a potential longer-term target, but I don't know what its stability is like today.
[16:54:11] <eddyb> if I'm not completely misinformed, it's a thin API based on EGL. I guess whoever gets a working desktop on top of wayland first can experiment with it alongside X
[16:54:25] <eddyb> KF5 hopes to be X-free
[16:58:14] <larsberg> eddyb: Yeah, I've heard about some of that as well. I'd like to get servo relatively stable on Linux/X and Android, or at least as stable as it is on OSX, before going too crazy. Right now, Linux is definitely the not-as-good platform, which has annoyed several contributors (and is a pain for Samsung, as e.g. only their non-Nvidia server is really useful)
[16:59:21] <eddyb> which reminds me I should dist-upgrade. maybe the kf5 packages are usable for more than tests now
[17:00:38] * eddyb is getting distracted. right, zlib. bloody APIs
