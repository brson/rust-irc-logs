[00:58:32] <acrichto> reem: sure
[00:58:38] <reem> I confess to really not knowing anything about this
[00:58:52] <reem> (the mechanism by which panic operates)
[00:59:06] <acrichto> you can think of it as basically throwing an exception
[00:59:16] <acrichto> e.g. calling out to a C++ piece of code that's just `throw foo`
[00:59:34] <reem> I see
[00:59:41] <acrichto> the problem is that to abort on panic in a destructor we have to know if we're in a destructor when panicking
[00:59:52] <acrichto> so we're in a particular code path in libstd and we need to know if we originated from a dtor or not
[01:00:10] <reem> the naive solution I can think of is just a thread local flag
[01:00:11] <acrichto> that sort of detection could be implemented as a global flag that's frobbed in/out of all dtors, but that's probably way too big of a perf hit to count
[01:00:30] <acrichto> I'd be surprised if LLVM could optimize many of those away
[01:00:34] <acrichto> (if any)

[01:01:57] <acrichto> reem: I haven't measure this sort of impact, but this also forces our hand in that rust as a language requires thread-local variables
[01:02:00] <acrichto> which... is a little odd
[01:02:38] <reem> could we emit specialized landing pads for destructors that abort instead of panicking?
[01:02:48] * reem doesn’t really know what he’s talking about re: landing pads
[01:03:01] <acrichto> ?
[01:03:15] <acrichto> well let me put it this way:
[01:03:17] <reem> haha, never mind, clearly that’s nonsense
[01:03:28] <acrichto> we do exception handling with the `invoke` instruction in LLVM
[01:03:34] <acrichto> which has one entry point (the previous instruction)
[01:03:36] <acrichto> and it has two exit points
[01:03:44] <acrichto> one exit point is for a normal return, the other is for an exception being thrown
[01:03:53] <acrichto> the one which is hit when an exception is thrown is what we call a landing pad
[01:04:02] <acrichto> that landing pad will run all cleanup and then resume the exception
[01:05:11] <aatch> In theory that might actually be possible, although it'd require splitting the cleanup block for normal execution from the cleanup block for unwinding.
[01:05:33] <bstrie> acrichto: in scenarios without thread-local variables it could just suffice to say a panic is always an abort
[01:05:49] <bstrie> (does XP count as such an environment? what are condvars for?)
[01:05:58] <acrichto> bstrie: all envs have thread-local variables right now
[01:06:03] <acrichto> except for things like kernels perhaps
[01:06:16] <acrichto> but it's a runtime burden imposed by the entire language
[01:06:17] <huon> how does noexcept work in C++?
[01:06:20] <acrichto> which is not seen anywhere else
[01:06:39] <acrichto> huon: the LLVM interpretation at least I believe just means "it's undefined behavior to throw from this function"
[01:06:39] <blaenk> huon: I think it just doesn't generate the unwinding code for that scope
[01:06:59] <acrichto> huon: so if you use an invoke instruction in LLVM to call a function that's nothrow, then it will optimize that to a `call` instruction, throwing away the langind pad
[01:07:01] <huon> blaenk: throwing an exception is replaced by calling std::terminate
[01:07:07] <blaenk> so I think when you throw it crashes the program
[01:07:10] <acrichto> huon: interesting!
[01:07:15] <blaenk> huon: ?
[01:07:29] <aatch> Basically, the invoke for running a destructor during "normal" cleanup jumps to an abort.
[01:07:33] <huon> well, specifically, an exception passing through the frame of a noexcept function calls std::terminate
[01:07:36] <huon> http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/noexcept_spec
[01:07:43] <huon> "If a search for a matching exception handler leaves ..."
[01:07:53] <huon> "... a function marked noexcept or noexcept(true), std::terminate is called immediately. "
[01:08:03] <huon> (why truncate such a short quote, huon??)
[01:08:16] <blaenk> you were asking what happens when you throw in a noexcept function?
[01:08:21] <acrichto> that sounds like precisely what we would want
[01:08:21] <blaenk> nvm then
[01:08:42] <huon> blaenk: it's not even just inside the function
[01:08:43] <aatch> It actually seems pretty feasible, thinking about it.
[01:08:54] <aatch> Without global flags or anything.
[01:08:57] <huon> blaenk: (i.e. inside the syntactic scope)
[01:09:05] <reem> note that aborting on panics in destructors could be backwards compatibly extended to use some sort of std::terminate-style thing that defaults to abort
[01:09:14] <reem> if we end up wanting that
[01:09:58] <aatch> It just means that the abort would have to happen at the destructor call site, rather than the site of the panic
[01:10:35] <aatch> Basically we just `invoke` a destructor, then the landing pad for an exception is to an abort.
[01:11:12] <aatch> since "no panics in destructors" is equivalent to "no unwinding out of destructors".
[01:11:13] <acrichto> huon: looks like a function call in a noexcept function is a try/catch where the catch calls std::terminate

[01:11:40] <acrichto> huon: specifically https://gist.github.com/anonymous/8ae62a23eb505fbc0082#file-foo-ll-L23-L36
[01:12:08] <huon> cool
[01:12:29] <blaenk> haha that's weird, when I learned about noexcept, the main reason for using it that I read was that it would cause the compiler to not generate unwinding code for that function

[01:16:21] <acrichto> aatch: right
[01:16:36] <acrichto> but we rely pretty heavily on inlining dtors

[01:17:14] <acrichto> right, but it can hinder it

[01:19:14] <acrichto> reem: true, but this needs to be taken in context with the other drawbacks: we don't know what the impact of this is, we don't know that this accounts for all leakage, this has an annotation burden on using Rc/Arc/channels now, etc

[05:49:08] <erickt> acrichto / Manishearth: with https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/24715, libsyntax would only require `#[feature(collections, libc, rustc_private, staged_api)]`
[05:49:34] <erickt> getting quite close to it compiling with the beta :)
[05:50:17] <erickt> unfortunately it's resulting in some unfortunate copy-pasting of various libraries into libsyntax :(
[05:52:37] <acrichto> erickt: hm how so? (in terms of copying), I figured that most of it could be dealt with #[cfg(feature = "cargo-build")] or something like that
[05:53:30] <erickt> acrichto: I'd love to be broven wrong :)

[05:54:33] <erickt> acrichto: the biggest copy-pasting is happening in https://github.com/erickt/rust/blob/syntax/src/libsyntax/str.rs and https://github.com/erickt/rust/tree/syntax/src/libsyntax/unicode
[05:55:22] <erickt> acrichto: I'm not thrilled with what I was doing there
[05:55:23] <acrichto> erickt: hm so escape_default is totally fine (I find it weird we have that in std)

[05:55:39] <acrichto> erickt: char_at/slice_shift_char seem like ok utility functions
[05:55:46] <acrichto> although I probably would have inlined all the impls into the usages
[05:56:05] <Manishearth> erickt: cool!
[05:56:08] <acrichto> erickt: the unicode stuff... that's a little sketchy
[05:56:15] <acrichto> but.. plausible
[05:56:37] <Manishearth> I don't like the copying either
[05:56:53] <erickt> acrichto: would it make sense to merge the unicode tables into libsyntax?
[05:57:13] <acrichto> erickt: hm, probably not all of them, but I  guess at least some may make sense?
[05:57:21] <acrichto> erickt: in that the xid stuff I'm not sure we'd want to stabilize
[05:57:50] <erickt> or we could pull the xid stuff into an external crate

[16:13:45] <erickt> acrichto: like it seems a bit odd that libsyntax::diagnostic has baked in ways to color the output of error messages. it feels like that really should be in rustc somewhere
[16:13:56] <erickt> but it'd be challenging to extract that out
[16:14:47] <acrichto> erickt: yeah I suspect most of libsyntax is kinda along the lines of "we may design this differently from the ground up now"
[16:15:03] <erickt> indeed
[16:15:42] <erickt> I think we could at least start by teasing it apart like librustc. If I recall correctly, that whole process really started by pulling out whatever could be pulled out

[20:09:47] <erickt> aturon: wow, that's an interesting trick. I wonder where else we could use that...
[20:10:17] *** Joins: tamird (textual@moz-5v5pe2.ca.comcast.net)
[20:10:53] <aturon> erickt: in std, probably not many other places -- we have very few traits parameterized by lifetimes
[20:11:43] <erickt> aturon: I know I've experimented with that a few times in serde, but I'm not sure if it's actually stuck anywhere
[20:12:02] <bstrie> pcwalton: I saw that beta is getting built without llvm asserts, presumably for compiler speed. is the speedup worth being perceived as having buggy codegen at 1.0?
[20:12:32] <pcwalton> excuse me? why would the lack of asserts result in buggy codegen?
[20:12:34] <pcwalton> that's ridiculous
[20:12:46] <erickt> heh
[20:13:02] <bstrie> pcwalton: I'm just curious why we had them on all this time if the lack of them has no importance
[20:13:14] <pcwalton> I think we should have turned them off much earlier
[20:13:22] <pcwalton> they're useful for development to catch mistakes
[20:13:29] <pcwalton> if you're not developing rustc they have zero value for you
[20:13:38] <bstrie> alrighty then :)
[20:14:08] <larsberg> I assume it's because LLVM asserts turn into an ICE when they're on, but when turned off silently continue? We turned them off in Servo partially because it's been months since we saw one, but mainly because of the large perf benefit in turning them off.
[20:15:03] <erickt> we need to convince John Regehr to start targetting rust codegen with his fuzzing
[20:15:03] * larsberg is a little worried that we should possibly do an assert-enabled run on servo once we finally upgrade past beta 1 :-)

[20:55:40] <bluss> I'm reading the reference.
[20:55:46] <bluss> I don't think this is true anymore "Releasing a reference typically has no effect on the value it points to, with the exception of temporary values, which are released when the last reference to them is released."
[20:56:14] <rkruppe> Context? Does reference mean &-pointer here?
[20:56:19] <XMPPwocky> bluss: that seems true
[20:56:29] <XMPPwocky> you can, for example, let meow = &42;
[20:56:34] <bluss> rkruppe: yeah, sorry, yes it does
[20:56:40] <XMPPwocky> which is roughly "let foo = 42; let meow = &foo; "
[20:56:51] <rkruppe> Then that's wrong, I'd say.
[20:57:12] <bluss> XMPPwocky: if it would be exactly that, then when meow is dropped has no impact
[20:57:19] <rkruppe> In XMPPwocky's example, there is a temporary and it happens to be released when the reference goes out of scope, but that's just a coincidence
[20:57:33] <XMPPwocky> rkruppe: well, the point is, when meow is dropped, so is the temporary it points to
[20:57:36] <rkruppe> The act of dropping the reference does nothing, it can't even know if it's the only one
[20:57:41] <XMPPwocky> yeah it's weirdly worded
[20:57:51] <rkruppe> More importantly, it's misleading.
[20:57:58] <rkruppe> it implies some sort of reference counting
[20:58:08] <WindowsBunny> The truth is actually more like this
[20:58:31] <WindowsBunny> if you have a literal, it doesn't impl Drop anyway, and can be &'static
[20:59:08] <scott> temporaries created by & aren't necessarily literals
[20:59:31] <WindowsBunny> If it isn't a literal
[20:59:49] <WindowsBunny> then borrowing the temporary extends its lifetime from that statement to the rest of that scope
[20:59:56] <rkruppe> And even temporaries that are literals aren't 'static: http://is.gd/J7T46Z
[21:00:18] <scott> rkruppe: not yet, but they could be. they're already being placed in static memory

[21:00:37] <scott> the type system doesn't know that, though
[21:00:45] <rkruppe> Of course they could be, but they aren't, and we're auditing for 1.0 :P
[21:00:53] <WindowsBunny> Well anyway
[21:01:15] <WindowsBunny> If a temporary is not borrowed, it is dropped at the end of that statement, otherwise its dropped at the end of the scope?
[21:01:25] *** Joins: pnkfelix (pnkfelix@moz-eljppb.fbx.proxad.net)
[21:01:25] *** ChanServ sets mode: +o pnkfelix
[21:01:48] <rkruppe> Sounds right
[21:01:51] <scott> if it's borrowed then it's dropped just after the borrow ends, I would say
[21:02:06] <scott> which could also be at the end of the statement
[21:02:18] <scott> ie. foo(&Box::new(42));
[21:03:22] <bluss> WindowsBunny: ok so that's the point we should try to make I guess
[21:04:01] <WindowsBunny> If it is borrowed to a variable
[21:04:07] <WindowsBunny> then the borrow ends with the scope
[21:04:16] <scott> I think the shortest explanation is that borrowing a temporary extends the lifetime of the temporary to that of the reference, and that's it. anything wrong with that?
[21:04:21] <WindowsBunny> If the borrow doesn't outlive the statement then it dies with the statement

[21:05:57] <scott> WindowsBunny: your explanation could also be generally about rvalues/temporaries instead of borrows

[21:06:20] <rkruppe> Speaking of docs, I just looked at my local build's rustdoc output for the first time and it messed up the backticks everywhere.
[21:06:35] <scott> an rvalue assigned to a variable lives until end of scope. otherwise it lives to the end of the statement it's in.
[21:06:51] <rkruppe> I don't have pandoc and I'm on windows. What does it use for markdown rendering and why is it so broken?
[21:07:09] <scott> a borrow itself is just another rvalue, following the same rules, but it has the effect of extending its borrowed value's lifetime to its own
[21:07:23] <WindowsBunny> rkruppe: So is it creating html docs? or something else?
[21:07:27] <bluss> what about using this instead:  "Releasing a reference has no effect on the value it points to,                but a reference of a temporary value will keep it alive during the scope      of the reference itself.
[21:07:31] <bluss> "
[21:07:37] <rkruppe> WindowsBunny: Yes, it creates html docs, no EPUB, no PDF
[21:07:52] <WindowsBunny> rkruppe: Can you show me an example of the weird backticks you're seeing?
[21:07:56] <scott> bluss: sounds better than the original
[21:08:04] <WindowsBunny> oh

[22:21:28] <nrc> yeah, I don't think we need to have a meeting or anything, just don't want brson to have to bare the burden if he doesn't want to
[22:21:57] <nrc> (and don't want to wait for free time in a triage meeting)
[22:22:44] <brson> hm, i don't know that i can make the right call on them all personally, but i would be happy to retriage them myself and nominate the ones i'm unsure of, or also happy for anybody else to do the same
[22:23:06] <brson> i guess i'd rather somebody look at them then mass reasigning

[22:25:33] <acrichto> brson: nrc: steveklabnik: I'm gonna remove beta-{accepted,nominated} from the merged PRs, now, that ok?
[22:25:43] <acrichto> e.g. those that were just pushed to the beta branch
[22:25:44] <nrc> acrichto: no!
[22:25:52] <nrc> acrichto: leave accepted, remove nominated
[22:25:56] <nrc> once merged
[22:26:00] <acrichto> uh ok
[22:26:03] <acrichto> sure!
[22:26:11] <nrc> we have this awesome new scheme :-p
[22:26:31] <nrc> we want to track PRs which were merged to beta
[22:26:36] <nrc> so we leave accepted on
[22:26:44] <nrc> nominated + accepted => ready to cherry-pick

[22:35:32] <brson> ok. I changed that issue to P-medium
