[19:54:55] <pnkfelix> nmatsakis: so there's a potentially interesting procedural question w.r.t the final comment periods
[19:55:08] <nmatsakis> carry on
[19:55:13] <nmatsakis> er, continue :)
[19:55:14] <pnkfelix> nmatsakis: given that the process is not democratic (in the sense that it is not based on the community "voting")
[19:55:50] <pnkfelix> nmatsakis: that means that on-lookers cannot necessarily tell which way the wind is blowing with respect to the people who will make the final decisions
[19:56:23] <pnkfelix> nmatsakis: and thus someone might misinterpret a flood of responses in one direction as meaning "ah, okay, I don't need to fight for this feature; its clearly going to be accepted"
[19:56:42] <pnkfelix> ("somone" meaning some community member with an interest in the outcome of the process
[19:57:15] <pnkfelix> this then leads to the *potential* scenario that, even in the final comment period, some useful arguments may not be explcitly written down
[19:57:53] <pnkfelix> and then the team makes a decision that conflicts with the way that things seemed to be going
[19:58:05] <pnkfelix> nmatsakis: Now, I'm not actually sure whether this is really a problem
[19:58:32] <pnkfelix> nmatsakis: In particular, I was briefly wondering whether we should actually try to indicate "which way the wind is blowing" when an RFC enters the FCP
[19:58:44] <pnkfelix> nmatsakis: but I'm more inclined to not do that at this point
[19:58:57] <pnkfelix> nmatsakis: and instead let the arguments just come along and speak for themselves.
[19:59:13] <nmatsakis> pnkfelix: right, so I think that the best way to address this is:
[19:59:24] <nmatsakis> if the decision seems to be going one way, but the comments have gone another,
[19:59:30] <nmatsakis> we should not "make" the decision unless
[19:59:34] <nmatsakis> there has been a lot of back-and-forth
[19:59:39] <nmatsakis> and we feel that both sides have been represented 
[19:59:52] <nmatsakis> in other words, this is sort of a special case of "don't make a decision and present new arguments at the same timne"
[20:00:02] <cmr> Presumably by the FCP, all the decision-makers have already left comments indicating their position (and counter-arguments to arguments that may have been raised).
[20:00:04] <nmatsakis> in particular,
[20:00:07] <cmr> Right
[20:00:27] <nmatsakis> cmr: well, maybe in an ideal world, but in practice the FCP can also serve as a kick in the pants for everyone :)
[20:00:33] <nmatsakis> but I think that if you are a subteam member,
[20:00:46] <nmatsakis> and you have an opinion that seems to run counter to what's being said,
[20:00:52] <nmatsakis> you have an obligation to make your case :)
[20:00:52] <pnkfelix> cmr: so this may have indeed been implcit in the process, the idea that subteam members should leave notes as to their thinking
[20:01:12] <pnkfelix> cmr: but I'm inclined to not want to leave "me too" comments.  Okay, nmatsakis 's protocol seems to fix that problem.
[20:01:38] <cmr> pnkfelix: My idea of the FCP was "we believe everything has been said that needs to be said, let's give this a bit longer for people to look at"
[20:03:11] <nmatsakis> I do agree that if significant new arguments arise during FCP, it may mean we should postpone making a dewcision 
[20:03:24] <nmatsakis> (and we should not declare FCP during active conversation)
[20:03:34] <nmatsakis> ther just seem to be these RFCs that don't attract a lot of attention
[20:03:36] <nmatsakis> which is a tricky case
[20:03:40] <nmatsakis> since it's hard to interpret silence :0
[20:03:51] <pnkfelix> nmatsakis: should we also try to state, when an RFC enters the FCP, what we interpret to be the direction of the wind?
[20:04:01] <pnkfelix> nmatsakis: (even if that direction is "there is no wind blowing...")
[20:04:27] <nmatsakis> hmm, maybe?
[20:05:02] <nmatsakis> I guess if we know what it is, maybe. I'm not sure how big a problem this represents
[20:26:50] <pnkfelix> yeah, I guess that's the viewpoint I started out with
[20:27:35] <pnkfelix> nmatsakis: I guess its not a big deal.  People who care seem happy to throw new details / ramifications into the comment thread.
[20:38:43] *** Tuba is now known as Tobba
[21:39:25] <nrc> nmatsakis: ping
[21:44:43] <nmatsakis> nrc: poing
[21:45:07] <nrc> did you see my message from yesterday evening about gh25743
[21:45:09] <nrc> ?
[21:46:29] <nmatsakis> nrc: no
[21:46:37] <nrc> So
[21:47:11] <nrc> its about ranges, in particular integer ranges where one end is under-specified
[21:47:24] <nrc> e..g, 2..5u32 will currently not type check
[21:47:32] <nrc> because 2 will get type i32
[21:47:44] <nrc> 25743 changes to use inference
[21:47:50] <nrc> so we infere u32 for 2
[21:48:12] <nrc> nmatsakis: does that seem reasonable? Just double checking I'm not missing something subtle
[21:49:53] <nmatsakis> nrc: it seems reasonable, the code itself seems a bit ... odd
[21:50:01] <nmatsakis> not wrong per se
[21:50:19] <nmatsakis> once the types are unified,
[21:50:28] <nmatsakis> calling common_supertype isn't really necessary,
[21:50:32] <nmatsakis> since both types are the same
[21:50:46] <nmatsakis> I suspect just calling resolve_type_vars_if_possible or something would have same effect
[21:50:58] <nmatsakis> it seems like a bit of a bug (perhaps) that any such action is needed
[21:51:12] <nmatsakis> well, but I guess const_eval doesn't know the inference state
[21:52:13] <nmatsakis> (just added a comment on the PR)
[21:52:18] <nrc> thanks

[23:22:16] <nrc> nmatsakis: looks like that was the problem :-)
[23:23:07] <nrc> I've hacked a lot of code while investigating so not 100% sure, but it looks like it
[23:23:20] <nrc> now to do the flags trick...
[23:41:26] <nrc> confirmed test case now builds
[23:42:26] <nrc> And it seems to fix my most reduced test case for the main bug :-)
[23:46:06] <nmatsakis> nrc: I wonder if it will make the real thing build :)
[23:46:25] <nrc> trying that right now
[23:47:32] <nmatsakis> nrc: regarding https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/982 is there a pre-existing tracking issue?
[23:47:56] <nrc> nmatsakis: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/18469
[23:48:41] <nmatsakis> nrc: ok I didn't merge it, in case you wanted to make those edits
[23:48:53] <nrc> cool, I should do that today
[23:55:06] <nrc> curses, doesn't make it through the bootstrap
[23:55:28] <nrc> more linkage errors
