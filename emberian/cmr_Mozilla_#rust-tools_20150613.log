[00:50:29] <edunham> acrichto: what handles crates.io DNS?
[01:13:38] <acrichto> edunham: zerigo
[01:13:44] <acrichto> edunham: we signed up for it through heroku
[01:14:02] <acrichto> it primarily needs some special record called an ALIAS record which apparently lets you do a cname-style record at the top level
[01:14:12] <acrichto> we actually registered crates.io elsewhere
[01:14:15] <acrichto> I forget where though
[01:14:23] <acrichto> someone's got access to it, but I don't think it's me
[01:16:44] <edunham> whois.net says david herman; does that ring any bells?
[01:18:13] <edunham> it expires 1/22/2016, so I definitely ought to sort this out in the next few months...
[01:43:02] <acrichto> ah yeah that's dherman
[01:43:16] <acrichto> we definitely still have access to the registrar
[01:43:20] <acrichto> I just don't personally have access
