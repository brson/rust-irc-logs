[00:37:47] *** Joins: Tiffany (tiffany@moz-6q5ofr.lyrical.lymia.moe)
[00:44:09] <eternaleye> And honestly, I think leap seconds may be worse than DST
[00:44:14] <bascule> hahaha
[00:44:23] <bascule> just stop ntpd, problem solved
[00:44:27] <Yurume> honestly, they are equally borked up
[00:44:28] <eternaleye> At least DST happens often enough the bugs get caught more than a month in advance -_-
[00:44:49] <eternaleye> https://lwn.net/Articles/648313/
[00:44:58] <Yurume> each deviation from a linear scale means a whole lot of code that is only activated sparingly
[00:45:08] <eternaleye> ...for the second time in a row, leap seconds caused timers to expire 1s early!
[00:45:17] <Ilari> Kinda surprised that leap second didn't crash one app I wrote (just caused it to freeze for a second).
[00:45:30] <bascule> Yurume: those apps should be using monotonic time!
[00:45:44] <bascule> clock_gettime with CLOCK_MONOTONIC or GTFO!
[00:45:47] <Yurume> bascule: ;_;
[00:45:53] <eternaleye> bascule: CLOCK_MONOTONIC, CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW, or CLOCK_TAI?
[00:45:59] <bascule> eternaleye: the former?
[00:46:14] <eternaleye> bascule: BEEEEP, wrong, you still get adjtime drift! :D
[00:46:36] <bascule> the manpage I'm looking at doesn't even define the other two
[00:46:53] <eternaleye> CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW doesn't respect adjtime's rate adjustments
[00:47:00] <eternaleye> CLOCK_TAI is... TAI.
[00:47:17] <bascule> CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW (since Linux 2.6.28; Linux-specific)
[00:47:18] <eternaleye> Neither of the MONOTONIC clocks are comparable between machines, though
[00:47:20] <bascule> I see...
[00:47:40] <eternaleye> And TAI can jump due to corrections, and slew due to adjtime, but at least it doesn't have leap seconds
[00:47:48] <eternaleye> tl;dr: No matter what, you're fucked
[00:48:08] <Tobba> https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5925
[00:48:09] <Tobba> what

[00:50:18] <bascule> lolololol
[00:51:05] <bascule> if you're on Intel, I guess you could just use RDTSC
[00:51:11] <bascule> modern Intel
[00:51:49] <Elaine> Power management?
[00:51:52] <bascule> just detect the microarchitecture and whitelist the ones where RDTSC is realtime
[00:52:02] <eternaleye> bascule: What do you think MONOTONIC_RAW is on stuff without an HPET?
[00:52:15] <eternaleye> er, RTC
[00:52:21] <bascule> I... don't know?
[00:52:42] <eternaleye> bascule: Basically, MONOTONIC_RAW is straight from the RTC or TSC (if TSC is stable)
[00:52:48] <eternaleye> bascule: MONOTONIC is corrected for slew
[00:52:58] <eternaleye> bascule: TAI is jumped for accuracy
[00:53:05] <eternaleye> bascule: REALTIME has leapseconds
[00:53:18] <eternaleye> bascule: In ascending order of "fucked-with-ness"
[00:54:08] <Ilari> Apparently at least CLOCK_MONOTONIC never jumps back.
[00:55:13] <eternaleye> Ilari: Neither RAW nor MONOTONIC ever jump.
[00:55:18] <eternaleye> Ilari: RAW never slews
[00:55:39] <eternaleye> TAI, MONOTONIC, and RAW never leap seconds
[00:56:14] <eternaleye> However, RAW and MONOTONIC cannot be compared across machines
[00:56:27] <eternaleye> RAW cannot be presumed to match any real-world timescale
[00:56:29] <Ilari> Apparently if system is never suspended nor clock ever jumps (but may be adjusted or slew) and realtime clock is kept on time, then MONOTONIC ticks at correct rate.
[00:56:39] <eternaleye> Correct
[00:57:33] <eternaleye> Basically, if you're doing comparative benchmarks of *code*, do it on one machine and use RAW
[00:57:55] <eternaleye> If you're doing comparative benchmarks of *machines*, use MONOTONIC deltas

[00:59:27] <eternaleye> (Note: TAI is exactly 10s off from GPS time. This is convenient.)
[00:59:49] <eternaleye> Wait, no, 19s
[00:59:58] <eternaleye> I got elastic mixed up with the GPS/TAI difference
[01:00:18] <Elaine> Why is that convenient?
[01:00:28] * Elaine knows next to nothing about electronic timekeeping
[01:00:49] <eternaleye> Elaine: Because GPS works by basically broadcasting the time continuously
[01:01:11] <eternaleye> Elaine: So with a GPS receiver and some very basic math that doesn't require a leapsecond table, you have TAI
[01:01:30] <Elaine> Oh, it's that it is an exact offset that is convenient, not that it is offset?
[01:01:37] <eternaleye> Elaine: Because GPS time, like TAI, is absent leap seconds
[01:01:39] <eternaleye> Elaine: Yep
[01:01:50] <Elaine> *not that the offset is 19s
[01:02:01] <Elaine> Makes sense.

[14:50:26] <Tiffany> the counter has gone down again
[14:50:49] <Tiffany> I wonder if the reason it spent so long being stalled was a rush of applications for larger blocks which had to be rejected
[15:04:18] <Ilari> Well, ARIN only allocates from Monday to Friday. No allocations on Saturday and Sunday.
[15:04:48] <Tiffany> oh
[15:05:14] <Ilari> And the stats are only updated once a day.
[15:05:21] <Tiffany> I'm kind of amazed at how un-automated this process is
[15:05:56] <Ilari> Looks like the /23s might go in a few weeks.
[15:06:09] <Ilari> The /24s will take quite a bit longer.
[15:06:25] <Tiffany> yeah
[15:06:50] <Ilari> "Alert! ARIN #IPv4 Unmet Requests Policy activated. Smaller than qualified blocks being issued & waiting list started "
[15:19:54] <Ilari> There has been 3 days of allocations since all blocks larger than /23 were exhausted, and the inventory count for /23s is already down from IIRC high 80s to 59.
[15:22:14] <Ilari> So maybe the rate is something like 10 per day or so... That would exhaust the /23s next week (of course, extrapolations from such little data tend to be inaccurate).
[15:23:02] <Ilari> And then /24s might go in 1-2 months or so?
[15:24:56] <Ilari> Looks like we may very well get official depletion this year.
[15:40:53] <Ilari> Also, qualified signature crazyness as usual: one piece of "qualified digital signatures" software requires OCSP. But there is none for FINEID, so keeping OCSP has been contracted to estonians. The is signup in estonian (have fun).

[17:00:57] <Tiffany> is it possible to make RSA keys large enough to be safe against quantum computers?
[17:04:22] <Tiffany> it apparently takes O((log N)2(log log N)(log log log N)) time and gates
[17:04:27] <Tiffany> that 2 is an exponent
[17:04:39] <Tiffany> why say (log N)^2? it's equivalent to N, isn't it?
[17:05:30] <Tiffany> bascule: I hate how leap seconds are a thing
[17:05:41] <Tiffany> why are we correcting our time system to line up with one which is *less accurate*?
[17:06:34] <mcpherrin> eugh leap seconds :(
[17:06:48] <mcpherrin> If we insist on having leap seconds, I want at least 25 years warning
[17:08:59] <Tiffany> honestly the drift happens so slowly that most people won't notice the seasons shifting to different parts of the year
[17:09:38] <Tiffany> seeing how it's only 1 second every couple years
[17:10:22] <huon> it's fuzzing of the internet, to check that it's a resilient distributed system
[17:10:26] <huon> (maybe... :P )
[17:10:34] <Tiffany> apparently it's a "legal requirement" for UTC to line up with solar time
[17:10:53] <Tiffany> in several countries
[17:12:10] <Tiffany> I wonder how much stuff broke because of the leap second
[17:12:37] <bascule> http://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Dallas/events/223591250/
[17:12:38] <bascule> heh
[17:12:47] <Tiffany> apparently the ITU is planning on making a decision on whether or not to abolish leap seconds in november
[17:14:12] <Tiffany> apparently without the leap seconds, time drifts by 1 minute every 60-200 years
[17:27:23] <mcpherrin> Leap seconds are going to be hilarious for historical stuff
[17:27:54] <mcpherrin> in 15 years we'll have forgotten about them as abolished, and some poor sap is going to get a date-time bug because some historical log file will reference a leap second
[17:28:55] <Tiffany> I really hope they are abolished
[17:43:20] <bascule> hahaha mcpherrin 
[17:43:42] <bascule> mcpherrin: hit a bug in code that's expecting there to be a leap second, but there isn't one!
[17:46:27] <Tiffany> there's an example of that listed on the wikipedia page for leap seconds, bascule
[17:46:46] <Tiffany> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second#Examples_of_problems_associated_with_the_leap_second
[17:46:57] <Tiffany> "Older versions of Motorola Oncore VP, UT, GT, and M12 GPS receivers had a software bug that would cause a single timestamp to be off by a day if no leap second was scheduled for 256 weeks."
[17:48:01] <mcpherrin> computer :(
[17:49:33] <Tiffany> "On January 21, 2015, several models of GPS receivers implemented the leap second as soon as the announcement was broadcast by GPS, instead of waiting until the implementation date of June 30.[57]"
[17:49:41] <Tiffany> I wonder why this is such a widespread problem haha
[17:49:50] <Tiffany> the wikipedia page mentions this same bug like 3 times
[17:52:39] <kmc> probably because nobody tests it
[18:27:59] <Tiffany> ah, the usage guide of s2n says it supports non-blocking IO
[18:28:34] <Tiffany> too bad it supports garbage ciphersuites unconditionally
[18:53:07] <Ilari> Hmm... I don't like the looks of result of doing RSA public-key operation on this signature I got (the private keys are on smartcard)...
[18:56:10] <Ilari> Okay, looks like I managed to make the smartcard do raw RSA private key operation...
[19:00:00] <Ilari> Well, certainly more useful if one wants to use non-broken hashes (e.g. SHA-256 or Blake2b-256) or non-broken signatures (e.g. RSA-PSS).
[19:14:25] <eternaleye> Tiffany: UTC is a holdover from how historically, astronomers controlled timekeeping
[19:14:35] <eternaleye> Tiffany: And thus, modern time standards are heavily weighted to their needs
[19:15:55] <eternaleye> Tiffany: And the fact is that code which is rarely exercised bitrots.
[19:16:12] <eternaleye> Tiffany: "Once per ~3 years" is pretty damn bad for that.
[19:16:40] <Tiffany> it can be pretty hard to setup tests for those kind of conditions too
[19:17:08] <eternaleye> Tiffany: Hell, both this time *and* last time, the Linux kernel had a bug where timers on the leap second would expire 1s early, potentially leading to busy-spinning a full core on zero-length sleeps
[19:17:27] <Tiffany> ouch
[19:17:29] <eternaleye> Tiffany: This time, at least, they discovered it before the actual deadline... by less than 30 days.
[19:17:41] <eternaleye> Tiffany: Last time, they found it face-first.
[19:51:45] <Ilari> eternaleye: Well, at least the raw RSA support is useful if one wants to use RSA-PSS? :->
[19:53:39] <eternaleye> Ilari: Or extract keys, yeah :P
[19:54:29] <Tiffany> Pretty Stupid Security?
[19:55:26] <Ilari> Tiffany: Well, RSA-PSS is certainly better than PKCS#1 v1.5 signatures.
[19:56:15] <Tiffany> I still need to read about RSA padding
[20:00:12] <Ilari> eternaleye: Key extraction via timing attacks?
[20:02:23] <eternaleye> Ilari: Or via choosing weak values for everything but the key
[20:02:31] <eternaleye> >> In May 2014, David Willetts, the ex-UK Minister State for Universities and Science, described[by whom?] as a non-scientist with a degree from the London School of Economics and Political Science, expressed opposition to the abolition of leap seconds. He indicated that as a layman, he wanted to keep "the link between time and people's everyday experience of day and night." He also wanted to keep Greenwich Mean Time in Britain, and "
[20:02:33] <eternaleye> warned" that it would drift towards the United States.[42] An article in the Times science section suggested that the abolition of leap seconds would mean the demise of Britain's role in timekeeping.[43]
[20:02:34] <eternaleye> Oh wtf
[20:03:01] <eternaleye> "Gotta keep those uppity colonials in their place; can't let them control time!"
[20:10:38] <sfackler> don't leap seconds correct like ~seconds/century?
[20:11:43] <eternaleye> sfackler: About 1min/60-90y using pre-2000 rates, about 1min/200y using 21st century rates.
[20:12:02] <eternaleye> sfackler: Rates may vary; certain charges may apply :P
[20:12:58] <eternaleye> sfackler: However, for observatories and such (the reason leap seconds exist in the first place), even seconds make a notable difference

[23:58:57] <Ilari> The SMW Pong/Snake polled 8 controllers 3 times per frame (~180 times per second). Pokemon thingy polled 4 controllers 8 times per frame (~480 times per second). SMW Super Mario Bros polled 4 controllers 48 times per frame (~2884 times per second).
