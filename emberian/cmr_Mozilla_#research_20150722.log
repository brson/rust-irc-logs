[21:31:24] <brson> pnkfelix: huh. can you show me your crater-cli-config.json?
[21:31:26] <pnkfelix> brson: and on linux, the cli test fails in a different way, where `stdio_req` just gets EOF back as its response from the server (and thus tries to parse an empty string as a json input)

[21:39:34] <brson> pnkfelix: it's probably not a typo in the creds since crater is carefully designed not to crash on bad creds :)
[21:39:39] <pnkfelix> brson: same result, maybe I really do have my credential screwed up
[21:40:18] <pnkfelix> brson: oh really?  I mean, this all depends on what we mean by "crash".  but i take it you mean that you don't think I'm even getting to the stage where my credentials are being verified
[21:41:32] <brson> pnkfelix: yeah, that hyper error is unexpected. a credentials failure would be a slightly different error
[21:41:51] <brson> though, uh, still not a good error
[21:41:57] <brson> pnkfelix: credential failure looks like `thread '<main>' panicked at 'called `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: StdError(ParseError(SyntaxError("EOF While parsing value", 1, 1)))'`
[21:42:09] <pnkfelix> brson: okay well maybe I'll now try dialing into a mozilla machine in the USA
[21:43:33] <brson> pnkfelix: which compiler are you using?
[21:43:38] <brson> probably doesn't matter...
[21:46:46] <brson> pnkfelix: does `curl https://crater.rust-lang.org` work from there or give you some kind of redirect?
[21:47:10] <pnkfelix> SSL connect error
[21:47:15] <pnkfelix> brson: ^
[21:47:54] <SimonSapin> IETF sounds fun:
[21:47:55] <pnkfelix> oh wait

[21:48:08] <pnkfelix> brson: (that was wrong, that was from people.mozilla.com )
[21:48:25] <pnkfelix> brson: from my own machine, curl works

[21:53:58] <pnkfelix> (though the fact that people.mozilla.com cannot curl that url leads me to think i shouldn't bother wasting the cycles on that machine to try the test there)
[21:59:59] <brson> pnkfelix: i get your error running on a mac
[22:00:17] <pnkfelix> brson: hmm okay
[22:00:26] <brson> i'll do some debugging
[22:00:34] <pnkfelix> brson: there's still the linux issue, but unfortunatelly that machine is not at home with me
[22:01:14] <brson> pnkfelix: the eof response could be the credentials failure...
[22:01:47] <pnkfelix> brson: hmm so I probably should get back to figuring out how to encrypt my json file to send to you to double check I guess 
[22:02:01] <pnkfelix> brson: (I tried to find your public key but didn't immediately succeed)
[22:02:17] <pnkfelix> brson: (i'll check my email history)
