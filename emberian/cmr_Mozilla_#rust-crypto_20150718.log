[00:10:14] <bascule> https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~shmat/shmat_ccs12.pdf
[00:11:53] <Ilari> Well, browsers just get to blame the user there.
[00:13:24] <Ilari> What I said about false positive rates? The warnings from browsers are WAY past that threshold.
[00:13:41] <bascule> heh
[00:13:57] <bascule> Ilari: I'm just saying, I have personally been party to certificate verification failures ;)
[00:13:59] <Tiffany> well you know how it is
[00:14:07] <Tiffany> you can't really crank it back or else you get false negatives, which are very bad
[00:14:26] <bascule> Ilari: at least I got a CVE, did a security fix release, got it into the Rubby bug databases, then rewrote all the Ruby certificate verification code myself
[00:14:40] <Tiffany> I find the biggest problem is sites using self-signed certs
[00:14:42] <bascule> I just need to finish doing that for Rust now
[00:14:42] <bascule> heh
[00:14:50] <Tiffany> although with all the TLS vulns in the wild, connection errors are on the rise..
[00:20:32] <Ilari> bascule: In my view, the browser non-HSTS cert error handling is nothing but trying to pass blame to the user.

[02:06:27] <bascule> these two words I guess sometimes people use them together
[02:06:38] <bascule> what does it mean? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[02:08:44] <Ilari> E.g. Encryption won't do much good if you encrypt to Eve. :-)
[02:11:06] <bascule> just give eve your private keys, no biggie

[02:20:37] <Ilari> (Key exchange, signatures/auth, AEAD and hash are the main components).
[02:21:18] <bascule> 1TCS always works out well
[02:21:25] <bascule> especially on embedded devices
[02:21:30] <bascule> just look at WEP! that worked out great
[02:23:36] <Ilari> RC4? Known bad algorithm (and the design is clearly incompetent).
[02:24:15] <bascule> broken in practice! in WPA!
[02:28:24] *** Joins: dpc (dpc@moz-t6gr4b.ca.comcast.net)
[02:30:41] <Ilari> WEP was in old bad days (1997), but WPA was in 2003, which isn't in old bad days anymore (the dividing line for me is 2001).
[02:31:44] <bascule> http://www.rc4nomore.com/vanhoef-usenix2015.pdf
[02:32:20] <bascule> To break WPA-TKIP we introduce a method to generate
[02:32:20] <bascule> a large number of identical packets. This packet is
[02:32:20] <bascule> decrypted by generating its plaintext candidate list, and
[02:32:20] <bascule> using redundant packet structure to prune bad candidates.
[02:32:20] <bascule> From the decrypted packet we derive the TKIP MIC key,
[02:32:23] <bascule> which can be used to inject and decrypt packets. In practice
[02:32:24] <bascule> the attack can be executed within an hour.
[02:34:25] <Ilari> If WPA was competently designed that attack just plain would not work.
[02:37:23] <Ilari> It seems like competently designed encryption protocols are fairly rare.
[02:47:35] <bascule> yeah, perhaps "cipher agility" matters less than "protocol agility" heh
[02:47:56] <bascule> I think it's possible to do versioning in a sane way
[02:48:55] <bascule> monotonic version numbers and a small suite of "profiles"

[03:51:00] <Ilari> And well, even if one could manufacture some very fast semiconductors easily, one probably wouldn't want to push it to hundreds of millions or billions of logic elements all the time...
[03:59:34] <Ilari> Well, having very cheap very powerful SoCs probably wouldn't do good things to security...
[04:00:02] <bascule> ECC seems good

[05:20:32] <bascule> there's also the incredibly valid "how deep can you go until a group has cycles" question

[05:24:16] <bascule> but also
[05:24:27] <bascule> I'd like to try to do operational transformations
[05:24:36] <eternaleye> bascule: But why do you want to get rid of MPDH? The requirement on exchanges, or what?
[05:24:50] <bascule> it's unnecessary if you have a leader
[05:24:55] <eternaleye> bascule: This one is non-interactive multiparty, rather than multiparty of noninteractive
[05:25:03] <bascule> or as I'd call it, a scribe
[05:25:04] <eternaleye> bascule: unneccessary != not beneficial
[05:25:24] <bascule> ok read everything else I just said :P
[05:26:11] <bascule> OT can be applied to a peer-to-peer system but it's way easier to do if you have one party/principal/peer in charge of what actully gets committed
[05:26:21] *** Joins: tomlikestorock (tomlikestor@moz-i312q9.ca.comcast.net)
[05:26:42] <bascule> wonder if anyone has formalized OT in terms of CRDTs
[05:27:13] <bascule> it's the same idea... append-only/"functional" transformations to a document that are fully linerizable
[05:28:33] <bascule> or solvable in an associative manner but that requires participation of other peers to make the operations associative
[05:29:00] <bascule> way easier to do if you just want a linear history that happens in a well-specified order
[05:29:40] <bascule> I am completely unfamiliar with the model where there isn't a master/leader
[05:29:46] <bascule> but I guess it's possible?
[05:30:52] <bascule> you can draw it like this, which I think can be described as a lattice: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_transformation#/media/File:Basicot.png
[05:31:35] <bascule> and these latties can be expanded to an arbitrary number of peers, but it's way easier to reason about as a linear history as controlled by a master
[05:33:16] <eternaleye> bascule: CRDTs, specifically are all about bounded-join lattices... and are _not_ necessarily linearizable
[05:33:26] <bascule> well yeah
[05:33:38] <bascule> so if you look at it as a lattice, the order of operations isn't important
[05:33:45] <bascule> that's the whole point
[05:33:48] <bascule> it's associative
[05:33:51] <eternaleye> bascule: They are eventually consistent, they monotonically progress towards agreement, but they're not linearizable
[05:34:17] <eternaleye> bascule: And honestly, the "easier to reason about" systems have fundamental scaling limits.
[05:34:25] <bascule> but if you actually *implement* OT, the easiest way to reason about it is a set of clients committing to a master
[05:34:34] <bascule> kind of like git
[05:34:39] <eternaleye> bascule: At some point, pedagogical simplicity takes a back seat to functionality
[05:34:40] <bascule> and they'll either be up to date or not
[05:34:43] <bascule> and if they aren't
[05:34:48] <bascule> they have to sort of "rebase"
[05:35:07] <eternaleye> bascule: Ew, no, rebase is an entirely different operation
[05:35:16] <bascule> if they've diverged, take in the upstream changes, reapply the transformation, attempt to recommit
[05:35:19] <bascule> rinse, repeat
[05:35:26] <bascule> it's an analogy :P
[05:35:44] <eternaleye> bascule: Sure, but flawed analogies lead to flawed understandings
[05:36:11] <bascule> OT has flaws *shrug*
[05:36:20] <eternaleye> bascule: The entire point of a CRDT is it constrains the allowed operations to ones that commute, associate, *and* are idempotent
[05:36:30] <bascule> your changes may not be applicable to the current state of the document
[05:36:34] <bascule> you may have a merge failure
[05:36:44] <eternaleye> bascule: Thus, once arranged in the appropriate structure, eventual consistency "falls out"
[05:36:53] <eternaleye> bascule: And merge failures are *statically impossible*
[05:37:17] <bascule> OT is trying to model much more complicated structures than can be expressed with CDRTs
[05:37:36] <bascule> and, at the same time, lacks similar levels of rigor
[05:38:13] <eternaleye> bascule: And I think that the structures that can be expressed with CRDT is a larger set than you seem to believe
[05:38:38] <bascule> it's not that I don't "believe", it's just that I haven't seen it done
[05:38:47] <eternaleye> bascule: Matrix :P
[05:38:52] <bascule> lol
[05:38:57] <bascule> can Matrix Google Wave?

[05:39:51] <eternaleye> bascule: "Google Wave" is not a verb, unless synonymous with "flop" :P
[05:39:58] <bascule> OT
[05:40:47] <eternaleye> bascule: Considering the original use-case CRDT's were developed for was collaborative editing...
[05:41:10] <bascule> OT has this really cool property that it can be CP in a CAP sense
[05:41:16] <bascule> and works really well with that
[05:41:27] <bascule> and gives you something that's basically CAS
[05:42:10] <bascule> CAS but if you fail you grab the upstream changes, reapply your transformations, and try again
[05:44:15] <eternaleye> Yes, and that's a model that's inapplicable to CRDTs
[05:44:21] <eternaleye> Because "if you fail" is a nonsense phrase
[05:44:39] <eternaleye> CRDT's are all predicated on phrasing the activity such that it _cannot_ fail
[05:44:50] <bascule> the failure case is the remote ref has diverged from your local one
[05:44:57] <eternaleye> Yes, exactly
[05:45:03] <bascule> you're just arguing semantics, heh
[05:45:16] <eternaleye> Note the requirement of ALL THREE of commutes/associates/idempotent
[05:45:25] <eternaleye> It doesn't "rollback" or 'reapply' on divergence
[05:45:32] <eternaleye> It succeeds _even with_ divergence
[05:45:54] <bascule> do you have any experience with OT?
[05:46:08] <bascule> you can diagram it on a whiteboard in a way that's practically mindblowling, heh
[05:46:26] <bascule> basically as a bunch of diamonds/parallelograms that look a lot like, well, a lattice
[05:47:19] <eternaleye> bascule: The models are fundamentally different in a way you are not getting, and that underlies why OT is CP, while CRDT is AP
[05:47:21] *** Quits: Tobba (Tobba@moz-o13d22.bredband.telia.com) (Connection closed)
[05:47:25] <bascule> I get it
[05:47:38] <bascule> FWIW I went to Ricon the first and second year
[05:48:05] <bascule> and had Basho koalas crap CRDT rainbows into my brain
[05:48:16] <bascule> I'm just not sure you get OT
[05:48:45] <bascule> you have to be Tom Cruise to get to OT III though
[05:49:12] <eternaleye> bascule: OT is about fixing up the operation after it is no longer valid. CRDT is about choosing a language such that operations *are incapable of being invalidated*
[05:49:29] <bascule> aware, duly noted, etc
[05:50:01] <bascule> some might call it MVCC
[05:50:14] <eternaleye> No, that's another different thing
[05:50:16] <bascule> it's like a persistent data structure
[05:50:28] <bascule> oh no I tried to make an analogy and now you think I'm confused
[05:50:43] <bascule> should I back up to
[05:50:44] <bascule> let's see
[05:50:49] * eternaleye has been knee-deep in SQL lately, so MVCC is a thing
[05:51:14] <bascule> approximately 20 minutes ago
[05:51:21] <bascule> when I namedropped the associative property
[05:51:33] <bascule> is that cool with you?
[05:51:37] <bascule> does that get the idea across?
[05:51:59] <eternaleye> bascule: It got one point across; my point was that it's incomplete.
[05:52:08] <eternaleye> bascule: Associative alone is insufficient
[05:54:03] <bascule> oh I assume you want it to be commutative
[05:54:12] <eternaleye> Yes, but idempotent is also crucial
[05:54:19] <bascule> I want it to be linearizable
[05:55:49] <eternaleye> bascule: And my objection is that linearizable is fundamentally hostile to scaling and resilience
[05:57:05] <eternaleye> bascule: I suspect half of why IRC survives to this day is it punted on linearizablity a bit in favor of scaling
[05:58:03] <bascule> all I can say is I think we have different objectives, heh
[06:05:01] <dcb> bascule: what does OT stand for?
[06:05:30] <eternaleye> dcb: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_transformation
[06:06:52] <bascule> the thing about OT is you might wind up with a transformation that transforms a part of the document that no longer exists
[06:07:23] <bascule> I think OT can be sufficiently restricted to where that isn't a problem
[06:07:49] <bascule> it just needs a model that respects the ownership of data in a collaboratively edited document
[06:09:25] <bascule> perhaps if that were done correctly, you could have OT that actually has the same properties as CRDTs
[06:09:58] <bascule> I guess eternaleye thinks that's unpossible, heh
[06:10:45] <eternaleye> bascule: More that once you've constrained that stuff out of OT, you arrive at associative/commutative/idempotent, and it _is_ a CRDT
[06:11:15] <bascule> sure
[06:11:22] <bascule> I'm just saying that's... possible, heh
[06:11:36] <eternaleye> bascule: At which point it's... not (necessarily) linearizable
[06:11:51] <bascule> depends on the protocol you use
[06:12:10] <bascule> so like, here's a funny thing
[06:12:17] <eternaleye> bascule: If you make a CRDT linearizable, you're basically artificially constraining A for the sake of C-timestamps

[17:23:21] * bascule reads CFRG email he sent last night
[17:23:22] <bascule> derp
[17:23:29] <bascule> I don't think what I posted makes sense, lol
[17:23:48] <Ilari> Sent a bit too late? :-)
[17:23:53] <bascule> might've been a wee bit drunk
[17:23:54] <bascule> lol
[17:24:15] *** Quits: dcb (textual@moz-v6l3du.ca.comcast.net) (Quit: My Mac has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[17:24:48] <bascule> mpD-H would be more like
[17:24:54] <bascule> given c, A, and B
[17:25:07] <bascule> c*A+c*B
[17:25:09] <bascule> right?
[17:29:21] <Ilari> Well, at least you didn't pull landing gear up from landing plane due to confusion from lack of sleep. :->
[17:29:30] <bascule> lol
[17:29:56] <bascule> all that said I still have no idea what PHB is talking about
[17:30:03] <Ilari> Allegedly that kind of thing actually happened (and it took some quick reflexes from pilot to avoid crash).
[17:34:35] <Ilari> (Also, very tired car drivers tend to be accident-prone... As well as drivers that operate a cellphone in any way).

[17:53:07] <bascule> oh god
[17:53:24] <Ilari> Haha, seemingly among the few LHC systems that have working reliably lately are Beam Interlock System and Beam Dump System. :->
[17:53:28] <bascule> that Ryan Carboni guy is designing his own cipher? o_O
[17:54:07] <Tiffany> I had heard that sleep deprivation and intoxication have similar side effects
[17:54:13] <bascule> yeah
[17:54:24] <bascule> also it's possible to be both at once, heh
[17:54:25] <bascule> ;)
[17:54:56] <Ilari> Tiffany: Well, I know that once I get enough sleep deprivation, I can't even stand straight...
[17:55:27] <Ilari> Tiffany: Can't comment on effects of EtOH or similar substances.
[17:59:43] <Ilari> However, if someone is driving erratically, there are other causes besides being drunk or much too tired, including: Talking on cellphone (even with "hands-free"), texting on cellphone, putting makeup or eating breakfast. :->
[18:02:17] <Ilari> Probably the cause of that recent accident involving one of Google's self-driving car prototypes: The driver who rear-ended one didn't even slow down before the collision.

[18:05:05] <Tiffany> I can't wait for cars which automatically take the wheel if you take out your phone or reach for your breakfast
[18:05:40] <Tiffany> there was some car which has automatic traffic mode
[18:06:01] <Tiffany> where it automatically drives forward when the person in front does, and it detects road signals and notifies the driver to take the wheel
[18:08:36] <Ilari> Watched some US govt training presentation about setting up HTTPS. Hilighted TLS 1.3 as upcoming technology. And also mentioned HPKP.

[18:21:21] <Ilari> To secure a website, one needs to deploy HSTS+HPKP (no matter what kind of footguns those are, especially HPKP).

[19:51:04] <bascule> was it streamed over Flash? :D
[20:01:25] <Ilari> bascule: Actually, youtube recording.
[20:01:47] <Ilari> bascule: Dunno what it was live.
[20:22:21] <Ilari> Oh, that presentation also brought up Let's Encrypt.

[23:43:59] <Ilari> bascule: Or maybe one could have some alternatives in embedded security protocol, if the client is not embedded. Too bad there doesn't seem to be any real alternatives for key exchange. Also authentication alternatives are a bit iffy.
[23:50:00] <Ilari> Seems like with key exchange even in best case one gets to pick: Not PQ, Large keys or Slow.
