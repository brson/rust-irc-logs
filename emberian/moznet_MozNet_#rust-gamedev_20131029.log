[01:18:20] <Amaranth> Howdy
[01:18:24] <bjz> https://github.com/bjz/gfx-rs/
[01:18:33] <bjz> I added a specification of the problem
[01:21:48] <bjz> Amaranth: anything you would like to add?
[01:23:37] <Amaranth> bjz: "libaray"
[01:23:44] <bjz> oopsie
[01:24:21] <Amaranth> "management model managment"
[01:25:10] <Amaranth> Also you still talk about handles but changed HandleManager to ResourceManager, dunno what to do there
[01:25:42] <Amaranth> Otherwise it seems alright although if you aren't doing anything beyond what is in that document this is a library that should be "done" in no time
[01:26:47] <bjz> oh yeah, I'm more looking at whether you think my problem specification and design goals seem reasonable
[01:26:58] <bjz> before I get too deep into code
[01:27:38] <Amaranth> Since this is the thing making the draw calls it seems like the ideal place to put the draw call bucketing
[01:28:10] <bjz> I could put that in the solutions section
[01:28:53] <bjz> could you expand on a statement like "Make use of 'draw call bucketing'"?
[01:29:13] <bjz> seeing as you seem to know more about it than me?

[01:30:20] <Amaranth> http://realtimecollisiondetection.net/blog/?p=86 is a pretty succinct post about it
[01:30:58] <Amaranth> I haven't messed with it really myself but it was the reason I wanted to make a little graphics library
[01:31:23] <Amaranth> btw I'm flying home tomorrow so hopefully I can actually help after that
[01:32:10] <bjz> cool
[01:32:33] <bjz> do the goals make it seem like something you would be interested in collaborating on?
[01:34:48] <Amaranth> bjz: Well like I said what you've got there now sounds like a weekend project followed by bug fixing and optimization as needed
[01:34:51] <Amaranth> But sure
[01:35:08] <bjz> cool
[01:35:18] <bjz> yeah it wouldn't be a weekend project for me :)
[01:35:31] * bjz has lots to learn
[01:37:26] <bjz> I need it for my own projects, so I'd be interested in maintianing it and improving it
[01:38:37] <bjz> getting started is difficult though, also the knowledge of more experienced folk would be invaluable
[01:41:27] <bjz> maik: I fleshed out the README some more: https://github.com/bjz/gfx-rs/
[01:42:04] <bjz> maik: I was partly inspired by your query last night
[01:42:33] <bjz> maik: but also wanted to have a more defined problem before I got too deep

[02:24:27] <bjz> maik: coolies!
[02:25:12] <maik> bjz, can we even have handles in rust?
[02:25:39] <maik> bjz, ah okay yeah
[02:25:44] <bjz> yep
[02:25:47] <bjz> :)
[02:25:55] <bjz> you just have to roll your own
[02:26:04] <bjz> I have more work done locally
[02:26:12] <bjz> haven't pushed itr yet though
[02:26:45] <bjz> part way through I was like 'hey I'm getting pretty deep without fully specifying my problem'
[02:26:56] <maik> :)
[02:27:49] <maik> but I don't think handles are necessary in rust

[02:33:07] <maik> okay the advantage would probably be nice interop with other languages
[02:33:20] <bjz> maik: the idea is to keep the data packed together
[02:33:32] <maik> yeah but the handle is just a pointer
[02:33:42] <maik> isn't it exactly the same?
[02:33:45] <maik> ah
[02:33:53] <maik> you mean you pack the data in one big array
[02:33:55] <bjz> to optimise for batch operations as opposed to direct lookups
[02:34:40] <bjz> so lookups would be behind a layer of inderiction, but the packed array would be trivial to iterate over
[02:35:05] <bjz> without having to traverse or recurse through nested trees of data
[02:38:46] <bjz> maik: one of the issues though is that the lifetime of the handles is difficult to determine statically.
[02:39:39] <bjz> one idea is you have a field in the handle that keeps track of the 'generation' of the handle
[02:40:02] <bjz> so you know if the handle is older than the data that is now stored in that 'slot'
[02:42:07] <bjz> but that's a runtime check and kind of negates some of Rust's safety guarantees
[02:43:06] <bjz> also you would eventually run out of space in a handle's 'generation' field and overflow
[02:43:41] <bjz> a u16 should have plenty of room though, but it still makes me uneasy
[02:44:44] <bjz> these were the kinds of rabbitholes I was finding myself heading into yesterday

[03:11:00] <bjz> brson: yeah I'm trying to think of a good way to work with large amounts of homgeneous data, particuarly for use in game engines
[03:11:02] <bjz> http://bitsquid.blogspot.co.at/2011/09/managing-decoupling-part-4-id-lookup.html
[03:11:10] *** kimundi is now known as zz_kimundi
[03:11:21] <bjz> more stuff here: https://github.com/bjz/gfx-rs/blob/master/research.md
[03:13:04] <bjz> brson: basically the by storing the data in pre-allocated arrays you can optimise batch processing, but I'm not sure how that fits well with Rust, seeing as you need to work with handles
[03:14:31] <cmr> bjz: your lists of links are the bestest
[03:14:53] <bjz> at the moment I'm thinking in terms of my rendering abstraction layer, but I'm not sure: https://github.com/bjz/gfx-rs
[03:14:59] <bjz> cmr: which one?
[03:15:22] <bjz> cmr: the 'world generation miscellany' one?
[03:15:28] <cmr> bjz: your one that has the proceduralworldgeneration is pretty awesome, and the gfx-rs one is nice too
[03:15:33] <cmr> guh this keyboard
[03:15:35] <bjz> https://gist.github.com/bjz/3792143
[03:15:48] <brson> bjz: so your handles are indexes into these arrays and they can become invalidated?
[03:15:56] <bjz> brson: yeah
[03:16:17] <bjz> brson: I could always do the erlang thing of just ignoring calls to dead stuff
[03:16:55] <bjz> (I think that's what erlang does?)
[03:17:47] <brson> failure seems appropriate. it would be a logic error to destroy the value while there are outstanding handles. you could also atomically reference count the handles and use the dtor to destroy the value in the array
[03:17:50] *** zz_kimundi is now known as kimundi
[03:17:57] <brson> though that's a lot of overhead for a game to maintain your invariants
[03:18:05] <bjz> mm
[03:18:07] <brson> a runtime failure may be more palletable
[03:18:14] <bjz> yeah
[03:18:14] <brson> your generation marker idea sounds fine
[03:18:27] <bjz> I just worry about overflow
[03:18:43] <brson> the chances of wrapping and still having a live object from 2^16 generations ago seems small
[03:18:48] <bjz> heh
[03:18:50] <brson> *live handle
[03:19:31] <bjz> I guess I can worry about things that run for months on end later :P
[03:20:07] <bjz> brson: thankyou!
[03:22:38] <bjz> ohh, so in the element indicies I could increment the number of handles I've given out. And to decrement the handle count you return the handles back
[03:23:09] <brson> if you wanted to deal with all that communication overhead, sure
[03:23:24] <bjz> yeah
[03:24:21] <bjz> that could be an issue
[03:24:28] <bjz> anyway, I probably will hack away at it for now and step back later

[11:32:07] <rsaarelm> It's neat how the lack of antialiasing actually pops out from that. Everything else is so nicely lighted the perfectly crisp pixel boundaries between the polygons look all wrong.
[11:36:41] <dbaupp> <3 people doing cool things with Rust
[11:36:59] <Amaranth> Ah, right, I'm not viewing it full sized so I sort of have antialiasing :P

[13:02:24] <maik> for visual fx
[13:02:51] <maik> only for windows though ;_;

[19:30:44] <h3r3tic> rsaarelm: hah, the lighting is actually not there at all! it uses a single directional non-shadowcasting light. the rest is done via SSAO. I'm hoping to get proper lighting and global illumination into it at some point.

[19:49:46] <h3r3tic> yup!
[19:50:08] <jeffdb> is your project on the rust gamedev wiki?
[19:50:43] <h3r3tic> mmm I don't think so. unfortunately the project cannot be open source, as my job contract doesn't allow it. but I do share useful snippets with folks here :)

[19:51:30] <jeffdb> mmmmk. so it's a professional project using rust for game dev? I didn't know there were any yet
[19:51:55] <h3r3tic> oh, it's not professional. it's just that my employer basically owns my soul
[19:52:01] <h3r3tic> my contract even says that they own my /ideas/
[19:52:02] <jeffdb> hehe. got it
[19:59:18] <h3r3tic> I did prototype a tool in Rust; a tool which we now use at work, if that counts :)
[19:59:42] <h3r3tic> would have just used the Rust version directly, but at the time, I couldn't get OpenGL with extensions to work on windows
[20:02:33] <jeffdb> sure, I say that counts.
[20:03:40] <rsaarelm> Any thoughts on how implausible it is for actual pro 3D programming to start using Rust at some point?

[20:04:20] <rsaarelm> D never caught on despite being around for years and years, and it was also going for the C++ niche. Rust has the whole no-gc by default thing going for it though.
[20:05:03] <rsaarelm> On the other hand, there's pretty big inertia with the existing library ecosystem.

[20:08:04] <rsaarelm> And of course we're still waiting for Rust to actually get to a 1.0 where there's going to be any guarantee of being able to write code that still compiles next week.
[20:08:14] <jeffdb> It seems more likely that a brand new application would be written in Rust than for an existing 3D program to switch over their entire codebase.
