[00:01:42] <Ilari> Oh, THS fix is only there three times.
[00:06:57] <Ilari> Also, I think that it is bad idea to require any specific crypto algorithm anywhere (since I think TLS 1.3 needs to have extremely long useful lifetime as protocol).
[00:13:30] <Ilari> There may need to be some crypto maintenance work, but no security fix extensions should ever be needed.
[00:16:28] <bascule> seems like SHA-1 is getting addressed
[00:16:34] <bascule> yeah, I was curious if DSA was still there
[00:16:38] <bascule> weren't they going to get rid of it?
[00:18:40] <Ilari> Haha, if they add split cipher negotiation, wonder if there will be extension to backport it to TLS 1.2? :->
[00:19:45] <bascule> lololol
[00:20:57] <Ilari> Heck, there was extension proposal to backport 1RTT key exchange to TLS 1.2.
[00:25:25] <Ilari> Haha, this PR proposes deprecating ffdh2k in TLS 1.3.
[00:28:54] <Ilari> Also, DH1k vs Curve25519 and DH2k vs Curve448. Wonder which is faster.
[00:29:22] <Ilari> Security levels are known to be wildly different tho.
[00:41:39] <Ilari> bascule: In that cartoon about flash, the guy smacking flash is Steve Jobs, right?
[00:43:05] *** Quits: dcb (dcb@moz-4hh.6p3.217.74.IP) (Quit: My Mac has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[01:03:05] <Ilari> One of the worst kinds of warnings: One that is suppressed when things have really gone to hell, but comes back as things improve.
[01:05:58] <Ilari> One rule about warnings: False positive rate needs to be less than rate of true incidents. Otherwise warnings are mostly false, and get tuned out quickly.
[01:06:50] <bascule> yeah
[01:07:23] <bascule> it's a big problem with our internal IDS
[01:07:35] <bascule> we originally built it with the idea that it would only surface high-signal alerts
[01:07:46] <bascule> that went out the window and now it's all false positives
[01:08:46] <mcpherrin> I worked for an IDS-as-a-service company, and since humans had to investigate each alert, it was very much financially motivated to avoid false anythings
[01:09:55] <bascule> haha
[01:10:05] <bascule> we have humans investigate alerts too... like me, because I'm oncall right now
[01:11:17] <Ilari> Then there are places where false negative would be catastrophic and false positives are just annoying, so safety systems are tuned to hair-trigger.
[01:13:34] <Ilari> E.g. LHC magnet quenches. If one happens with powerful beams and the beams haven't been dumped in about a millisecond, the LHC will be down for repairs for a LONG time.
[01:15:09] <Ilari> Whereas false positive is just few hours of downtime.
[01:16:17] <Ilari> bascule: I think IDS don't work very well if there are lots of protocols in use.
[01:17:41] <bascule> Ilari: our thing is more of a SIEM than a real "IDS" although we do process events from Snort and such
[01:17:58] <bascule> we really only do that for PCI. Also since our infrastructure is mostly MTLS everywhere Snort doesn't find practically anything
[01:18:18] <bascule> kinda silly
[01:18:26] <bascule> Snort's just like "oh, encrypted traffic. IGNORE!"
[01:19:46] <Ilari> Finding unexpected traffic flows (flows that shouldn't be there) would likely be useful (if you happen to have well enough controlled enviroment to possibly have flows that aren't expected).
[01:20:21] <bascule> yeah we do have a pretty awesome flow analysis system
[01:20:43] <Ilari> And also with TLS 1.2, if a flow should be MTLS, one might check that it is actually MTLS.
[01:20:55] <bascule> unfortunately actually digesting that data and deciding which flows are actually suspicious is... rather difficult
[01:21:10] <bascule> hahaha
[01:21:11] <bascule> yeah like
[01:21:25] <bascule> the most we do with DPI right now is try to classify which flows are TLS or not
[01:22:46] <Ilari> The flows are so chaotic one can't form picture of expected flows?
[01:24:38] <Ilari> Also, the network should be IPv6-capable and various internal systems should be IPv6-only. :->
[01:27:07] <Ilari> Examples of unexpected flows: Flows opened in unexpected direction (e.g. DB server to webserver) or opened to unexpected destination (e.g. outside network or to unexpected service).
[01:32:08] <Ilari> Of course, it takes pretty good control of network to be able to automatically scan for unexpected flows, since otherwise false positive and/or false negative rates will be way too high.
[01:33:58] <Ilari> Oh and flows that should use MTLS not using MTLS.
[01:36:56] <Ilari> Then there is insecure shit like "lights-out management".
[01:37:21] <Ilari> Sometimes such insecure shit can't even be reliably turned off.
[01:42:06] <Ilari> If server had such features I would want those on physically separate interface (not just VLAN, actual separate connector) that isn't used for anything else. And then really IDS the shit out of those segments.
[01:45:29] <Ilari> Also useful stuff: Actual BIOS write protect jumper.
[01:57:58] <Ilari> Oh, and also pay attention what the HVAC system is doing. :->

[02:48:12] <bascule> hahaha
[02:49:01] <bascule> seems paypal.com at least isn't negotiating RC4 anymore, lol
[02:49:09] <bascule> I had to fight really hard to shut RC4 off

[02:49:35] <bascule> it was like "oh shit we have to shut RC4 off because of PCI" "no worries, already did"
[02:52:14] <Ilari> The reason any those four are so bad is that merely being able to connect to such website causes security go down the drain.
[02:54:18] <bascule> yeah

[21:13:19] <Ilari> bascule: Would it even be possible to roll out a new certificate system in Web environment (the transition period would be heckuva long, but would it be even in theory feasible)?

[21:26:35] <Tiffany> what do you even need in a certificate format?
[21:26:44] <Tiffany> a digital signature of a newline-separated list of URIs?

[21:41:55] <bascule> Tiffany: here's my not-really-well-specified certificate format: https://github.com/cryptosphere/ordo
[21:42:13] <bascule> before making that I liked pkt-lines, then decided against them for something simple and regular
[21:42:19] <bascule> and now I think I like pkt-lines again, heh
[21:42:22] <bascule> Macaroons convinced me
[21:42:28] <bascule> also pkt-lines are binary-safe
[21:42:40] <bascule> so you don't need to encode keys in some sort of ASCII armor
[21:42:50] <bascule> you can just dump the blobs straight in and it's great

[21:43:20] <Tiffany> pkt-line?
[21:44:10] <bascule> https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/technical/protocol-common.txt
[21:44:13] <bascule> it's a thing from git
[21:44:29] <bascule> it's sort of like djb's Netstrings, only simpler
[21:44:43] <Tiffany> I thought netstrings were already stupidly simple
[21:44:54] <bascule> they have weird variable-length length prefixes
[21:45:20] <bascule> A pkt-line length prefix is [a-f0-9]{4}
[21:45:27] <bascule> even simpler!
[21:45:42] <Tiffany> oh

[22:50:45] <Ilari> Except netstrings and pkt-lines turn somewhat annoying if one needs any sort of recursion.
[22:55:55] <Ilari> Okay, current list of "shooting offense" HTTPS badness: 1) SSL only, no TLS. 2) No secure ciphers (e.g. RC4-only). 3) DH <1024 bits (in normal handshake). 4) TLS 1.2 intolerant and no higher TLS version. 5) Sends MD5 cert. 6) <2048-bit (RSA equivalent) key in certificate chain (including root).

[22:58:08] <Ilari> Well, thinking about it, <2048-bit RSA is considered too weak because somebody that could crack the key could do lots of damage. Meanwhile, cracking common 1024-bit DH key (yes, they can be cracked) would do loads of damage.
[22:58:32] <Ilari> The effort to crack 1024-bit DH key is comparable to effort to crack 1024-bit RSA key.
[23:01:20] <Ilari> ECDH: Effort to "crack" 1024-bit "equivalent" curve (160 bits or so) is WAY above 1024-bit RSA, and even the "cracked" curve is no joke to compute dlogs on.

[23:14:56] <Ilari> Hmm... can one always linearize langsec-compliant (DCFG) input?
[23:17:49] <Ilari> Apparently yes if grammar is known. Sadly looks like no if grammar is only partially known.
[23:24:47] <Ilari> ... Extensible structure representation is a lot less trivial than it initially seems. :-/

[23:36:22] <Ilari> bascule: Also, it seems that some "cloud" provoders have atrocious TLS (or for some SSL) setups.
[23:39:41] <bascule> :(
[23:40:34] <Ilari> And also DRAC setups (what I said about embedded TLS?) tend to be atrocious too.
[23:50:10] <Ilari> bascule: So bad that latest browsers can't connect to those. And since browsers don't tend to be bastions of TLS security, that tells something.
