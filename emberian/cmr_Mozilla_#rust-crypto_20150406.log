[00:52:39] <tiffany> do any of you know good suggestions for drawing state machine diagrams?
[00:55:34] <eternaleye> tiffany: Do you want a GUI program, a commandline tool from a DSL, or something to take annotated source code and make a diagram?
[00:55:48] <tiffany> any of those would be acceptable if they aren't terrible
[00:56:18] <tiffany> I need to be able to annotate object lifetimes, thread communications, and internal state changes
[00:56:31] <eternaleye> tiffany: for the first, Dia is decent, as is Calligra Flow. For the second, graphviz (dot/neato/etc). For the third, I'd have to look.
[00:56:44] <tiffany> I have had bad times with graphviz
[00:57:07] <eternaleye> tiffany: Sadly, there's  little (if anything) better than graphviz in its space
[00:57:15] <Ilari> Well, it is decent for simple stuff. But when you get to more complicated diagrams, ouch.
[00:57:22] <eternaleye> Yup

[00:57:56] <eternaleye> tiffany: One thing I would suggest, though: Treat each thread as a state machine
[00:58:02] <tiffany> yeah
[00:58:12] <Ilari> Basically, the layout goes crazy with larger graphs (I have drawn some that had IIRC a few hundred vertices).
[00:58:24] <eternaleye> tiffany: Also, not sure lifetimes are especially relevant to the state machine issue
[00:58:25] *** Quits: c74d (c74d3a4ebb6@moz-0ersgu.oc.cox.net) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[00:58:30] <tiffany> I'm currently dealing with 4 threads, and each one is its own state machine doing things
[00:58:40] <tiffany> eh, I guess I could model lifetimes as part of state machine interactions
[00:58:47] <tiffany> it's not of huge importance
[00:58:56] <tiffany> trying calligra
[00:59:25] <eternaleye> tiffany: For instance, a streaming iterator has lifetime relevant behavior, but I'd _model_ that with a "bound" state, that can be exited when it the lifetime of the value it leant out expires
[01:00:05] <eternaleye> tiffany: So Ready.next -> Bound, Bound.expired-lease -> Ready
[01:02:02] <Ilari> Then I recently drew a graph having about dozen vertices using graphviz. Not great layout but pretty decent.
[01:06:10] <eternaleye> One thing I wonder is how efficient doing state machines with by-value self and newtypes is
[01:10:56] <tiffany> I can't figure out how to place nodes in calligra... off to a great start
[01:11:59] <tiffany> does this have zero documentation?
[01:13:30] <tiffany> this is getting frustrating
[01:14:50] <tiffany> oh
[01:14:54] <tiffany> you drag and drop
[01:14:55] <tiffany> okay
[01:15:02] <tiffany> I forgot drag and drop was a thing
[01:18:54] <tiffany> this is approximately as useful as google's drawing thing is
[01:19:02] <tiffany> this is kind of saddening

[01:44:08] <Ilari> Also, what was the original I-D to use "diediedie"? IIRC, it was related to use of DES in some protocol?
[01:45:38] <eternaleye> Ilari:    draft-lha-des-die-die-die
[01:46:37] <eternaleye> Ilari: Which became draft-ietf-krb-wg-des-die-die-die

[02:31:33] <eternaleye> Ilari: Anyway, LISP's insistence on map-and-encapsulate in the network tells me it's a losing proposition
[02:31:42] <eternaleye> Ilari: The intelligence needs to live on the edge.
[02:31:58] <eternaleye> Ilari: And on LISP, the intelligence is all designed to live in the network
[02:32:27] <eternaleye> Ilari: HIP gets that right, at least
[02:32:52] <eternaleye> Ilari: ORCHID explicitly forbids routers handling ORCHIDs specially, for example
[02:33:19] <eternaleye> Ilari: The end-host resolves the HI to a locator, and then uses plain IP routing.

[09:51:56] <eternaleye> bascule: And my primary thought is "That is the _least_ rustic API I have yet seen in a crate."
[09:52:56] <eternaleye> bascule: Like how PamItem has a free function of item_type(_: Option<Self>) -> PamItemType, which is doc'd as always taking "None" because it's just there to make it pick the right monomorphization
[09:53:02] <eternaleye> bascule: I mean, what the actual fuck?
[09:54:04] <eternaleye> I mean... I don't even know.
[09:54:38] <eternaleye> bascule: And then there's pub unsafe fn get_data<'a, T>(pamh: &'a PamHandleT, key: &str) -> PamResult<&'a T>
[09:55:07] <eternaleye> bascule: Which is a free function (like all of the others), rather than an inherent method on PamHandleT
[09:55:31] <eternaleye> bascule: Which is defined as an empty enum, and has no inherent methods.
