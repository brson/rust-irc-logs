[03:15:46] <jeaye> Almost all of q3 (by file) touched by these changes.

[03:16:13] <jeaye> Completely revamped the configure/build. 
[03:16:30] <jeaye> q3 builds in modules now, which should help compile times as it grows.
[03:16:47] <jeaye> It also has a much sturdier configuration step.
[03:18:46] <jeaye> And it's all formatted nicely. :D http://dpaste.com/1397620/
[03:19:11] <cmr> ohhh fancy indeed
[03:20:19] <jeaye> Also means, if I change anything in the 'state' module, for example, I don't need to compile any of the other modules again.

[12:00:32] <rsaarelm> Hi.
[12:01:27] <olafurw> I like the idea of developing a game with rust, something I might take up
[12:02:14] <rsaarelm> There seems to be a nice bit of momentum going for Rust right now.
[12:02:21] <rsaarelm> Interesting to see where it goes.
[12:02:56] <olafurw> yea
[12:04:17] *** Quits: maik (maik@moz-82B7232D.dip0.t-ipconnect.de) (Ping timeout)
[12:05:08] <rsaarelm> Also interesting to see what trouble people run into when they start using Rust for less trivial stuff.
[12:05:51] *** Joins: maik (maik@moz-82B7232D.dip0.t-ipconnect.de)
[12:05:53] <rsaarelm> I think someone already talked about having running into all sorts of trickiness with the lifecycle and borrowing stuff in the language when trying to make game engine stylee stuff work.
[12:07:30] <olafurw> hmm, how so?
[12:09:22] <rsaarelm> When you're not using the garbage collector, the language is really picky about whether it can prove that the thing whose pointer you're passing around is going to stay allocated for however long the pointer is being used.
[12:09:28] *** Quits: maik (maik@moz-82B7232D.dip0.t-ipconnect.de) (Ping timeout)
[12:09:36] <olafurw> ahh in that way, yea
[12:09:54] <olafurw> that was also something people ran into with game development in D iirc
[12:14:54] <rsaarelm> D is GC by default though. I didn't really follow the gamedev for it that closely, it did have some non-gc options but I never looked into how they worked.
[12:15:15] <rsaarelm> I did notice a lot of people seeming to get disillusioned with using D for games for whatever reasons.
[12:19:18] <olafurw> yea, I think the change from 1 to 2 ruined the momentum a lot as well
[12:20:49] <rsaarelm> Rust is neat in that it's going for a more ML vibe than D's "like C++, but fix the stupid bits", that can pull in the OCaml and F# crowd, and that the idiom for handling explicit memory management with automatic checking seems to actually be pretty solid, even though it does make the language noticeably trickier to pick up.
[12:22:22] <olafurw> I like ocaml and SML/NJ and the pattern matching and was happy to see that in rust
[12:22:39] <olafurw> been trying GO for a bit, but there are some parts i dont like
[12:23:00] <olafurw> like not knowing what you have in your hands and what you can do with it
[12:23:07] <rsaarelm> I messed with Go for a bunch, but there are pain points which Rust seems to address nicely.
[12:23:42] <rsaarelm> On the other hand, I can just hammer out stuff in Go without thinkng, since the language is so small and straightforward, while Rust still requires a lot more thought.
[12:24:49] <rsaarelm> Then again, Rust lets me actually make generic reusable components, while Go has more of the feel of classic Java where you can do large-scale generics, but in small-scale you might want to set up some macros in your text editor for for loops that you're going to be writing again and again.
[12:26:03] *** Joins: tiffany (kawaii@moz-EB8B0C08.dhcp.embarqhsd.net)
[12:28:00] <olafurw> what do you think are the "gotchas" of rust?
[12:28:11] <rsaarelm> Hm.
[12:28:46] <tiffany> it has the conciseness of an FP language, but the symbols of C
[12:28:51] <tiffany> so you get lots of symbols everywhere
[12:29:22] <rsaarelm> Well, one thing I was wondering about the other day is that the type enums don't really support the open-closed principle. That's basically the same thing you get in the ML languages though.
[12:30:18] <rsaarelm> So if you have your game engine defining a set of game objects as an enum sum, like "Monster, Item, Player", it's tricky to make a mod plugin that adds "LightSource" to the set or something. With OO, you could just inherit a new class.
[12:30:41] <tiffany> you can use traits for that though
[12:30:48] <tiffany> rust has dynamic dispatch on traits
[12:31:05] <tiffany> enums have to be closed because otherwise you break pattern matching
[12:32:00] <rsaarelm> Yeah, related to that. With games you tend to have containers typed on the base type of every world object. In OO, you'd use downcasting to go from BaseWorldObject to LightSourceWorldObject to see if your random game object can be a light source, but Rust doesn't have downcasting.
[12:32:14] <tiffany> it makes more sense to have something like enum Thing {MonsterType(Monster), ItemType(Item), PlayerType(Player), Other(ThingHandler)}
[12:32:24] <tiffany> where each is a typeclass
[12:32:48] <rsaarelm> Yeah, there are ways to get this done, but you need to plan for them.
[12:33:08] <tiffany> only kind of
[12:33:25] <tiffany> I can't imagine it's that hard to push your logic into a trait rather than a gigantic pattern match statement of doom
[12:37:53] <rsaarelm> Yeah, traits would be great. Finding the trait for the object is the tricky part. Though if you go for a straight-up component engine where the different aspects of the game objects are basically handled by different subsystems entirely, and the "actual objects" are basically just shared IDs, it'll get easier again.
[12:38:56] <rsaarelm> I understand that's pretty much what a lot of big C++ game engines have ended up doing, after they crashed and burned trying to use the OO system to actually model objects.
[12:40:13] <rsaarelm> It's also nicer for the cache to eg. have your physics data in a packed vector of homogeneous parameter structs, instead of buried inside big blobby monolithic objects spread all around the heap.

[15:04:58] * sp3d misreads man pages a few more times, for fun
[15:05:19] <cmr> Quarry: mostly on par with C, a few niggling inefficiencies here and there, but they're getting stamped out.
[15:05:23] <bjz> Quarry: if it isn't, it should be on par with it in the future
[15:05:31] <cmr> Mostly it's our stdlib that's slow now, rather than the language.
[15:05:36] <Quarry> That sounds amazing
[15:05:39] <dbaupp> Quarry: e.g. servo (the web engine written in Rust) is apparently faster than webkit & gecko for some taks
[15:05:41] <dbaupp> *tasks
[15:05:46] <rsaarelm> I don't know if there are that many people doing Rust on Windows, particularly gamedev with the big and possibly work-in-progres library bindings you need for it.

[15:06:00] <Quarry> For OpenGL + GLFW, do I need a C compiler?
[15:06:03] <bjz> Quarry: there is also the theoretical possibility of it being faster, because the compiler has more info on lifetimes and mutability
[15:06:05] <dbaupp> (webkit == chrome/safari, gecko = firefox, fwiw. both C++.)
[15:06:13] <cmr> Quarry: no, but you do need a dll for glfw

[15:07:42] <bjz> Quarry: and openal-rs. if you have any annoyances or gripes with how I've designed things, I'm the person to annoy :P
[15:08:01] <Quarry> You shouldn't have told me that!
[15:08:19] <cmr> Quarry: Unfortunately our Windows support, particularly around the build system, is still subpar, but we actually have windows people working on it now :)
[15:08:38] <cmr> so it might be a pita to setup
[15:08:54] <bjz> Quarry: yeah, most here don't have a problem with Go - Rust is just in a different domain
[15:09:07] <rsaarelm> Yeah, my guess would be that you'll run into significantly more annoyances and need to figure out more stuff yourself unless you move to Linux. Most people set up the mostly just working setups on Linux first.
[15:09:07] <Quarry> I never touched C or C++ actually

[20:46:39] <jeaye> o/
[20:47:14] <maik> any resources that you can recommend me? Couldn't find very much :/
[20:48:02] <jeaye> hmm, not really.
[20:48:50] <bjz_> maik: its probably a case of reading code
[20:48:59] <bjz_> maik: to get inspiration
[20:49:04] <jeaye> And trial/error.
[20:49:10] <jeaye> What're you trying to do?
[20:49:50] <cmr> What is shader management / material systems?
[20:50:48] <jeaye> cmr: A way of setting up a shader system to work with materials (ambient, diffuse, specularity, illumination, textures, etc).
[20:50:49] <maik> just doing research for my "small" game engine. I was thinking managing my shaders with small xml snippets so that I could swap them out
[20:50:53] *** Joins: canhtak (jeremy@moz-3FFB5CDA.wl.t.ulaval.ca)
[20:51:08] <cmr> jeaye: Ah, so what I do in blender, but with shaders
[20:51:18] <cmr> bjz_: r? https://github.com/bjz/gl-rs/pull/4
[20:51:24] <jeaye> cmr: Well, you use shaders in Blender too. :P
[20:51:33] <cmr> jeaye: /I/ don't :P
[20:51:41] <jeaye> heh
[20:52:05] <jeaye> maik: You can take a look at MTL files for a starting point.
[20:52:55] <jeaye> Once you can support all (or as much as you want) of MTL's capabilities in your shaders, you can start exporting your assets in a manner that references those materials/shaders.
[20:53:50] <jeaye> OBJs do this (basically) out of the box. It'll be a bit more difficult for other formats. Next easiest for embedding arbitrary data would likely be Collada.
[20:54:04] <jeaye> And you're using Assimp, right? It should support both.
[20:54:08] <maik> okay thanks
[20:54:16] <maik> btw do I need other formats then .obj?
[20:54:21] <maik> than*
[20:54:24] <jeaye> Depends what you're trying to do.
[20:54:33] <jeaye> OBJ doesn't support, for example, skeletal animations.
[20:54:35] <maik> has .obj limitations?
[20:54:37] <maik> ah
[20:54:44] <jeaye> If you're just using static meshes, OBJ is great.
[20:54:45] <maik> does collade support those?
[20:54:52] <maik> collada*
[20:54:59] <jeaye> Collada does support skeletal animations.
[20:55:06] <jeaye> It's not a very optimal format though.
[20:55:12] <jeaye> Since it's stored in XML
[20:55:42] <jeaye> It works nicely as an intermediate format for your engine to convert to its own, more optimized, layout
[20:56:37] <maik> yeah that's what I am doing atm, not sure if this makes sense though. Load .obj -> create my mesh object -> serialize the mesh object -> now I can load the mesh object
[20:57:01] <maik> is this how I would do it?
[20:57:06] <jeaye> If you're converting to your own data, you should save that data out.
[20:57:17] <jeaye> Such that you only do it once per mesh/model.
[20:57:27] <maik> yes
[20:57:33] <jeaye> (You can check timestamps on your Collada files to see if you need to do it again)
[20:57:47] <maik> ah cool
[20:57:59] <maik> maybe I'll go with collada then 
[20:58:12] <jeaye> This would ideally be broken into a separate tool so it's not taking up CPU at runtime (in your engine) but it just part of your content flow.
[20:58:16] <maik> I don't suppose collada has a c api? :(
[20:58:24] <cmr> it's a format, not a library
[20:58:31] <maik> ah we have a xml reader
[20:58:37] <maik> thanks to bjz <3
[20:58:37] <cmr> sax-rs, by our very own bjz
[20:58:49] <jeaye> It doesn't provide you one, no. There are a number of tuts for Collada reading though.
[20:58:54] <maik> cmr, yeah completely forgot about the sax loader 
[20:59:06] <jeaye> If you want an API to wrap, I know of X and FBX files.
[20:59:29] <jeaye> Both of which will likely be C++, not C though.
[20:59:49] <jeaye> For q3, I wrote an MD5 importer so I'd have access to skeletal animations. Consider your needs before getting too invested in a format.
[21:00:09] <jeaye> (Though I guess Assimp makes that easier)
[21:00:19] <jeaye> Anyway, back to work.
[21:00:42] <maik> okay thank you very much <3

[21:35:01] <h3r3tic> onoz you haven't fixed up cgmath yet! :P
[21:35:07] <bjz_> haha
[21:35:08] <h3r3tic> what do I pay you for?
[21:35:12] <bjz_> fail
[21:35:13] <h3r3tic> :P
[21:35:23] <bjz_> h3r3tic: you pay me nothing!
[21:35:28] <bjz_> ><
[21:35:35] <bjz_> *grumbles*
[21:35:55] <h3r3tic> sorry, financial problems. will pay you in company shares instead, kay?
[21:36:07] <bjz_> heh, know the feeling
[21:36:12] <h3r3tic> :P
[21:36:26] <bjz_> at least you actually have an employer
[21:36:38] <cmr> bjz_: updated
[21:36:41] <bjz_> what seems like an exploitative employer though :(
[21:36:53] <h3r3tic> lul
[21:37:46] <cmr> 13 additions and 19,260 deletions. 
[21:37:48] <cmr> O_O
[21:37:54] <cmr> I didn't realize how big the gl legacy was.
[21:37:55] <bjz_> cmr: see now that's how you boost your line counts
[21:38:04] <bjz_> cmr: yes!!! <3<3
[21:38:19] <bjz_> cmr: well, not really legacy, just the added extensions
[21:38:32] <cmr> ah, extensions too
[21:38:35] <cmr> yeah
[21:38:46] <cmr> Wait, so were you generating all the gles stuff too?

[21:39:12] <h3r3tic> you nuked legacy gl? oh no, how will we ever render anything without glBegin? D:
[21:39:29] <cmr> h3r3tic: --profile compatability
[21:39:30] <Amaranth> hehe
[21:39:35] <jeaye> Please don't tell me you're using immediate mode, h3r3tic.
[21:39:39] <cmr> hah
[21:39:50] <Amaranth> I was thinking more 2.1 but trying to use it like it was the core profile
[21:39:53] <h3r3tic> there's no other way! immediate mode and register combiners all the way.
[21:40:10] <bjz_> merged!
[21:40:12] <cmr> \o/
[21:40:17] * cmr ticks it off his todo list
[21:40:36] <bjz_> we need a way you hook this up to a github irc bot :P
[21:40:37] <h3r3tic> you need to keep using legacy GL so that the driver implementors have to maintain it. that's how you get revenge for buggy/slow drivers.
[21:40:37] <cmr> poop I forgot to turn in my physics homework
[21:40:51] <bjz_> D:
[21:40:57] <cmr> bjz_: SEE WHAT YOU DO TO ME!
[21:41:04] <jeaye> Who needs school? :P
[21:41:05] <cmr> Amusingly it was *after* gl-rs on my todo list
[21:41:11] <cmr> even though it had a deadline :p
[21:41:16] <Amaranth> Actually I suppose that's a good point, you probably get a more efficient GL implementation when you request core profile
[21:41:52] <h3r3tic> that's partially the idea behind the core profile. but then e.g. nvidia said it changes absolutely nothing from their perspective
[21:42:03] <h3r3tic> and no, I was kidding about immediate mode :P
[21:42:10] <h3r3tic> can't wait to get Mantle though :)
[21:42:19] <Amaranth> But OS X is 2.1 or 3.2 core profile only, some drivers on linux are 2.1 only, and mesa plans on only supporting the core profile as well
[21:43:05] <h3r3tic> you guys heard of the DICE & AMD collaboration on the new API?
[21:43:20] <bjz_> cmr: errrr... https://github.com/bjz/gl-rs/blob/master/src/gl/lib.rs
[21:43:25] <bjz_> cmr: hah
[21:43:52] <jeaye> hah
[21:44:03] <bjz_> new rust syntax?
[21:44:06] <jeaye> Looks like proper Rust to me.
[21:44:09] <jeaye> bjz_: that's 0.8
[21:44:23] <bjz_> wow things change fast
[21:44:27] <jeaye> :P
[21:45:37] * bjz_ is proud that our generator is actually semi-readable
[21:47:16] <h3r3tic> bjz_: about the generated stuff, though. you use macros in the generated modules. any idea how much of an overhead their processing is forthe compiler? the binding was taking ages to compile, last time I tried it
[21:48:11] <bjz_> h3r3tic: no idea. the flipside is that the file would be even huger
[21:48:32] <h3r3tic> yeah, certainly

[21:57:31] <cmr> bjz_: rustpkg is currently broken for fetching things
[21:57:39] <cmr> but it'd be rustpkg github.com/bjz/sax-rs
[21:57:42] <bjz_> I know
[21:57:44] <cmr> oh, ok
[21:57:45] <bjz_> :(
[21:57:55] <bjz_> just calling rustc manually
[21:57:58] <cmr> https://github.com/bjz/gl-rs/blob/master/src/gl/lib.rs
[21:58:00] <cmr> Erm
[21:58:02] <cmr> How did that happen
[21:58:08] <jeaye> heh
[21:58:48] <cmr> bjz_: I give it -L /usr/local/lib, I've been installing things manually until rustpkg is fixed
[22:00:19] <cmr> that explains that -19k delta though
[22:01:15] <cmr> -15k with a proper lib.rs :p
[22:03:07] <bjz_> cmr: I'm trying to fix it
[22:03:18] <cmr> bjz_: rustpkg?
[22:03:27] <bjz_> cmr: generator
[22:03:30] <cmr> https://github.com/bjz/gl-rs/pull/5
[22:03:44] <bjz_> I've made it fail
[22:04:10] <bjz_> cmr: what was the error?
[22:04:24] <cmr> bjz_: me invoking it wrong and piping it into lib.rs without checking
[22:06:50] <bjz_> cmr: it says it requires 'type', but you say in the usage ptr is the default
[22:07:06] <cmr> ...ops
[22:07:15] <bjz_> I've made some changes, so if you can give me the fix
[22:07:25] <bjz_> would be easier than merging
[22:07:27] <cmr> bjz_: reqopt -> optopt in opts

[22:19:27] <cmr> ./generator --type ptr --version 4.3 --profile core
[22:20:04] <cmr> bjz_: is it wrong?
[22:20:20] <bjz_> it isn't doing 4.3 as default
[22:20:43] <bjz_> I thought I could just do ./generator
[22:20:55] <cmr> hm, it should be
[22:21:12] <bjz_> could you look into it
[22:21:28] <cmr> version: args.opt_str("version").unwrap_or(~"4.3")
[22:21:31] <bjz_> just call ./generator > lib.rs ?
[22:21:35] <bjz_> yeah
[22:21:38] <bjz_> wierd
[22:22:05] <bjz_> as in, I get lots more function entries
[22:22:56] <cmr> Hm, it worked when I tested it..
[22:23:21] <cmr> Oh!
[22:23:25] <cmr> bjz_: it defaults to compatabiility
[22:23:26] <cmr> oops

[22:34:00] <bjz_> I also fixed a bug that void fns were returning -> c_void
[22:34:20] <bjz_> I also made it so non-const ptrs use *mut
