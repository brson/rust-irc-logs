[00:33:39] <huon> argh, LLVM seems to really prefer pointer offsets over pointer arithmetic... :/
[00:33:52] <bstrie> that sounds like exactly the same thing
[00:34:06] <huon> with pointer arithmetic it "optimised" a loop `while cond { ... } x = 1;` to `while cond { ... x = 1; }`
[00:34:40] <bstrie> that's called code-invariant loop motion
[00:35:00] <huon> bstrie: I mean `while index < len { do_it(start_of_array.offset(index)) index += 1 }` vs. `while pointer < end { do_it(pointer); pointer = pointer.offset(1) }`
[00:35:12] <huon> bstrie: no, that moves code that *out* of loops
[00:35:30] <huon> (NB. x wasn't read inside the loop at all, so it is purely a wasted instruction)
[00:36:28] <huon> LLVM seems to prefer the former, even when I try to tell it not too
[00:37:38] <c74d> If I do decide to write my package manager in Rust, where should I start?
[00:37:46] <bstrie> c74d: git clone cargo
[00:37:59] <c74d> Hm… how long does learning Rust take?
[00:38:24] <bstrie> c74d: if you know C++, then it takes like an afternoon
[00:38:35] <c74d> (Well, learning enough of it to write a working package manager.)
[00:38:41] <c74d> Oh, okay. That sounds good.

[00:40:26] <c74d> I've used C++ up to C++11, though I wouldn't say I ever fully learned it.
[00:41:43] <c74d> How difficult is it to write an idiomatic Rust library that can be easily used from other languages (e.g. C++)?

[00:42:33] <c74d> …Nah, I don't need that, never mind.
[00:43:09] <bstrie> c74d: learning rust is one thing, but it will probably take a bit before you're writing it idiomatically. that's pretty much the same as any language though
[00:43:45] <c74d> bstrie: how requisite is Cargo?
[00:43:51] <bstrie> one could also argue that "idiomatic rust" isn't well-defined yet
[00:44:04] <bstrie> c74d: if you're doing a project with no dependencies, not at all required
[00:44:15] <bstrie> c74d: if you're doing a project with dependencies, still not required but heavily suggested
[00:44:15] <c74d> Can I replace it by packaging Rust packages for another package manager, or does it provide other necessary features?
[00:44:34] <c74d> hm
[00:44:47] <bstrie> c74d: cargo relegates all the heavy lifting to rustc, but there's still a lot of useful things that it does
[00:45:05] <c74d> for my package manager, I'd want…
[00:45:13] <bstrie> in particular you can have cargo tell you all the rustc invocations that it's using and then run those directly yourself
[00:45:51] <c74d> PGP verification… I doubt that's implemented in Rust?
[00:45:59] <bstrie> but cargo will also be doing other things like setting up environment variables related to where it stores your dependencies and such
[00:46:23] <c74d> TLS, for which I'd use PolarSSL. Rust's C FFI is… decent?
[00:46:24] <bstrie> c74d: in the package manager itself, for signing dependencies? not sure
[00:46:39] <bstrie> c74d: rust's C FFI is about as good as it gets without being source-compatible with C
[00:46:47] <c74d> for verifying signatures of packages
[00:48:47] <bstrie> c74d: there are already openssl bindings via nacl for rust: https://crates.io/crates/openssl
[00:49:27] <c74d> Thanks, but I'd really rather avoid OpenSSL in favor of PolarSSL.

[12:41:35] <Quxxy> I'm a little unsure if this is a good idea, or a stupid idea: https://gist.github.com/DanielKeep/99574f59a782cf24b010 (new cargo script feature)
[12:44:19] <bluss> Quxxy: I'm going to update the iterator sheet with .join(sep). Just no idea best way to represent concatenation (maybe ||)
[12:44:32] <bluss> and how to represent using the Display impl for string representation
[12:45:24] <Quxxy> bluss: Maybe the same way flat_map does?
[12:45:53] <Quxxy> I wanted to avoid introducing a sequence concatenation symbol, though only because I want to keep the amount of notation to a minimum
[12:46:15] <Quxxy> As for using Display... hmm... lemme think
[12:46:34] <Quxxy> I think that's the same basic issue as `cloned`; having it call `.clone()` on every element would just make it huge and ugly
[12:46:34] <bluss> hm ok it's a good idea although strings are not represented well by splitting into elements
[12:46:53] <Quxxy> Ah
[12:46:55] <Quxxy> Yes
[12:46:56] <Quxxy> Good point
[12:46:58] * Quxxy goes off to ponder
[12:47:57] <bluss> mathematically, the trait impls are just more implicitly supplied functions
[12:48:24] *** Joins: Tobba (Tobba@moz-o13d22.bredband.telia.com)
[12:50:15] <Quxxy> bluss: It might be best with `cloned` down in the "this is too difficult, I give up" section :P
[12:51:22] <Quxxy> I mean, if *all* it did was join strings, you could do it like fold
[12:51:41] <Quxxy> But the added "it also runs each element through Display" part is *probably* pushing it
[12:52:27] <Quxxy> If you want to try doing a proper summary, though, maybe try something like
[12:53:03] <bluss> I'm trying this now and it looks ok   d(a_0) || sep || d(a_1) || ... || sep || d(a_{n-1})  where d = Display::fmt
[12:53:54] <Quxxy> (((d(a_0) @ sep @ d(a_1)) @ sep @ d(a_2)) @ sep @ ...), where d is Display::fmt, @ is String::push_str
[12:54:20] <Quxxy> You might *also* want to put the two where clauses in an array to keep the line from getting too long
[12:54:30] <Quxxy> My rule of thumb thus far has been: if it doesn't fit in my browser window, it's too damn wide
[12:54:47] <bluss> can I skip the ()'s ?
[12:55:14] <Quxxy> I feel like I don't want you to on the basis that it makes the evaluation order explicit
[12:55:41] <Quxxy> However, since string concatenation is *definitely* associative *anyway*... alright

[13:02:15] <eddyb> does it have to :P?
[13:02:32] <eddyb> anyways, I'm almost certain it writes to the String. or I hope it does
[13:02:36] <eddyb> otherwise it's pretty wasteful
[13:02:41] <bluss> push_str does yeah

[13:04:04] <Quxxy> bluss: I think I'd probably move the "where" to the previous line, use \\~~ as the line break to give it a bit of an indentation, and replace the "and" with ", "

[13:26:39] <Tiffany> who was the one who was wondering why lua bytecode is dangerous? was it tobba?
[13:26:40] <Quxxy> (Just, if you've still got an editor actively open)
[13:27:08] <Tiffany> malicious lua 5.1 bytecode can perform arbitrary memory read/write, although I don't know if it's been fixed in later releases
[13:27:39] <bluss> Quxxy: I can fix it
[13:27:52] <Tiffany> one of the developers thought that it would be okay to eschew type checks in one of the for loop instructions, since it's always preceeded (in non-malicious code) by a different instruction which does  type check
[13:27:59] <Quxxy> You said RepeatCall is in Std

V8 wins the remaining benchmark because it has a better GC. [Of course the LuaJIT JIT compiler beats V8 by a wide margin, except for the GC-bound benchmark.]"

[13:45:43] <Tobba> interpreter beating the JIT compiler?
[13:45:44] <Tiffany> "None of the benchmarks make use of JavaScript's weird corners. And all of them can (or could) be reduced to simple constructs. So I wouldn't blame it on the language differences alone (maybe on the implementation)."

[13:48:54] <Quxxy> bluss: Nope
[13:48:59] <Tiffany> javascript pages need to start running almost instantaneously, and don't run for very long
[13:49:08] <Tiffany> that might be why V8 is so much slower
[13:49:17] <fkaa> interesting observation

[13:49:46] <Tiffany> not really
[13:49:49] <bluss> Quxxy: what's the .ps1 thing?
[13:49:55] <Quxxy> OH THAT
[13:50:04] <eddyb> Tiffany: does it interpret some kind of optimized bytecode?
[13:50:04] <Tiffany> timing luajit -e 'print "hello world"' takes 0.00 user/sys and 0.04 real
[13:50:06] <Quxxy> That's unrelated; it's for building rustdoc markdown articles
[13:50:11] <eddyb> Tiffany: like, does it interpret specialized code?
[13:50:12] <Tiffany> but that probably didn't even start the JIT at all

[13:50:35] <bluss> Quxxy: didn't see that though. But I concluded .ps1 was evil
[13:50:36] <Tiffany> I don't know eddyb
[13:50:36] <Quxxy> .ps1 = PowerShell Script
[13:50:39] <bluss> see
[13:50:45] <eddyb> you could use qemu and a JIT to execute dynamic code where you can't MAP_EXEC
[13:50:46] <Quxxy> Which I only used because I hadn't used it before and was bored
[13:50:58] <bluss> yeah why not try it out
[13:51:38] <Tiffany> I expect the only way to really measure this is to first time a benchmark from 'cold', and once it finishes, run it again now that it's 'hot', and see the delta
[13:51:40] <fkaa> always wondered, what's the difference between user/sys/real
[13:51:44] <bluss> “Startup time for running the executable of the VM itself is included in all measurements, but is negligible (< 100µs). Likewise, warm-up and compile-time for the JIT compilers is included. But, again, this has no measurable effect, since LuaJIT's compiler warms up very quickly (LJ1: 1st call of method, LJ2: 57th loop iteration) and is exceptionally fast (compile times in the microsecond to millise
[13:51:50] <bluss> cond range). ”

[13:52:12] <Tiffany> fkaa: real is the amount of time on the clock it took from start to finish, real is the amount of CPU time that was allocated (which can be much higher than real if it's multithreaded), sys is the amount of time spent faffing around in the kernel doing syscalls

[13:53:36] <fkaa> i even missed that, i'm horrible!
[13:54:17] <fkaa> so a program splitting a task into two threads should have approx half the real time and double the user time?
[13:54:39] <Tiffany> well, not both at once, since that would be a 400% difference, but yes
[13:54:56] <Tiffany> assuming you have two cores with which to execute the threads in parallel
[13:55:13] <Tiffany> you don't accumulate user when you get preempted
[13:56:06] <fkaa> computers are cool stuff
[13:57:24] <Tiffany> fkaa: this applies to load average too btw
[13:57:57] <Tiffany> a load average of 1 means that there is one program either executing or waiting to be executed at all times
[13:58:04] <Tiffany> on one core
[13:58:20] <Tiffany> so to saturate four cores, you have four programs, and thus a load average of four
[13:58:36] <Tiffany> so presumably the linux system running on a xeon phi, when you run something intensive, will have a load average of 224 or higher
[13:58:52] <Tiffany> (224 hardware threads, 4 per core with 56 cores)
[13:58:53] <fkaa> 224 cores?

[14:01:40] <fkaa> it is a cpu we're talking about, right?
[14:01:44] <Tiffany> sort of
[14:01:54] <Tiffany> it's like a middle ground between CPU and GPU
[14:02:07] <Tiffany> on GPUs, you can only ever run SIMD code
[14:02:15] <Tiffany> on phi, the SIMD is there, but it's optional
[14:03:00] <Tiffany> there's a 512-bit wide vector unit on the phi, which when using 32bit floats gives you a total 3584 stream processors
[14:03:11] <Tiffany> which is comparable to GPUs for sure
[14:03:31] <Tiffany> each core runs at 1 GHz
[14:03:45] <Tiffany> in order to squeeze the maximum FLOP/s out of the phi, you have to use it like a GPU
[14:04:08] <Tiffany> however, the phi's advantage is not in competing with GPUs, but rather in supporting rather branchy but still embarrassingly parallel applications
[14:04:26] <Tiffany> it runs regular old x86 code
[14:04:53] <Tiffany> the board has a ROM with linux flashed onto it, and acts like a PCIe ethernet connector which lets you ssh into it to upload binaries and such

[14:05:56] <fkaa> not even 10 of them taped together?
[14:06:20] <Tiffany> 10 of them hooked up to a host board would be a small scale supercomputer
[14:06:45] <Tiffany> that's pretty close to a hundred teraflops

[14:07:00] <fkaa> don't most super computer cost upwards of billions?
[14:07:15] <Tiffany> the largest ones have millions of nodes, not 10
[14:07:30] <Tiffany> I think they also use interconnects faster than dinky old PCIe

[14:08:08] <Tiffany> apparently tianhe-2 uses a bunch of ivybridge CPUs and xeon phis
[14:08:20] <Tiffany> (the fastest supercomputer in the world at the moment)
[14:08:34] <Tiffany> ah
[14:08:38] <Tiffany> apparently phi is only 1 teraflops
[14:08:46] <Tiffany> so that'd be 10 teraflops of supercomputer
[14:08:57] <Tiffany> I mainly say supercomputer since you'd have to program such a cluster like a supercomputer
[14:09:53] <Tiffany> in order to use it effectively, anyway
[14:10:26] <Tiffany> I wonder if anyone has tried implementing a graphics engine on phi
[14:10:43] <Tiffany> the ability to branch freely lets you cut corners compared to typical GPU-based rendering methods
