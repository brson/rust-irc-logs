[00:55:41] <Nashenas88> I’m not sure what to do here. I’ve never seen this before (the llvm portion) https://gist.github.com/Nashenas88/c59bf4d62a1048d22986
[00:56:17] <Nashenas88> This is after fixing a merge conflict on suggest.rs after a rebase. I didn’t make the modifications to llvm. Should I add it?
[00:58:58] <geofft> Nashenas88: probably `git submodule update` 
[00:59:16] *** Joins: ConnorDoyle (ConnorDoyle@moz-70n.7f4.118.12.IP)
[00:59:22] <geofft> git submodules are only updated when you run that command (or when the Makefile does) 
[00:59:28] <Nashenas88> geofft: As in that’s what happened, or that’s what I should run
[00:59:31] <Nashenas88> ok
[00:59:32] <geofft> that's what you should run 
[00:59:57] <geofft> the reason git doesn't do this automatically is you might have made changes to the submodule, and it doesn't want to mess with things 
[01:00:20] <geofft> at the git level, a submodule is like a file that contains a hash, but in reality it's an actual git repo 
[01:00:38] <geofft> so there's some weirdness where those interact -- git can't reliably automatically update it 
[01:00:57] <Nashenas88> geofft: That fixed it :), and that makes sense.
[01:00:59] <geofft> probably what happened is you merged or rebased across a commit in rust-lang/master that changes src/llvm (there was one recently)

[03:59:51] <eddyb_> wait, can't you just copy the reference?
[04:01:00] <jroesch> so I have a real chunk of code where I tired to do this, just been trying to whittle it down to figure out what I'm misunderstanding 
[04:01:05] <jroesch> tried*
[04:01:44] <jroesch> it seems like map should work, but when you parametrize the self by another lifetime it seems to fail, and I've tried bounding, etc to no avail 
[04:01:59] <eddyb_> oh, right
[04:02:24] <eddyb_> or not
[04:02:33] <aatch> I think it's a problem with the map function.
[04:02:51] <eddyb_> jroesch: you have an immovable type btw
[04:03:26] <aatch> I think the closure should take a &'a T, not &T
[04:03:30] <eddyb_> self is &'a Foo<'a> in that method
[04:03:49] <eddyb_> aatch: isn't it using elision?
[04:04:14] <aatch> eddyb_, no, higher-ranked lifetimes.
[04:04:21] <eddyb_> for<'a> Fn(&'a T) -> &'a U
[04:04:36] <aatch> eddyb_, when using the closure traits, the `for<'a>` etc. is implied.
[04:04:49] <eddyb_> aatch: HRLs are subject to elision
[04:04:55] <eddyb_> or rather
[04:05:25] <eddyb_> the Fn traits allow elision to HRLs
[04:05:38] <eddyb_> in the paren form
[04:06:22] <eddyb_> with the same rules as free functions
[04:07:47] <jroesch> which piece are you referring to? (immovable that is)
[04:08:15] <aatch> eddyb_, sure, but it's only eliding *inside* the closure type. So there's no link between the lifetime of the value passed to the closure and the lifetime of the reference that Ref is holding.
[04:09:31] <jroesch> aatch: you are making the argument that the closure type should be FnOnce(&'l U) -> &'l T?
[04:09:40] <aatch> jroesch, I *think* so.
[04:09:42] <jroesch> or w/e the lifetime is

[05:20:47] <eddyb_> jroesch: I don't know
[05:23:40] <jroesch> I'll bring it up with Mozilla people next week and see if anyone has any opinions 
[05:25:06] <eddyb_> aturon, nmatsakis: Rust (almost) guarantees no type errors during/after monomorphization. but overflow and division by 0 are not type errors, right? so *technically*, it's not an issue if associated constants trigger those errors only in trans
[05:27:36] <eddyb_> I kinda want to rip out some of trans::consts and extend middle::const_eval instead. lots of work though
[05:28:21] <huon> Rust tries to guarantee that generic instantiations won't cause code to not compile
[05:28:36] <huon> I don't think we try to distinguish types of errors
[05:29:02] <huon> (we may have to make a distinct for generic integers to work, of course)
[05:29:21] <eddyb_> some of these constant evaluation errors could be runtime errors if not folded
[05:29:46] <huon> right, but in general they have to be compile time
[05:29:51] <huon> (i.e. appear in types)
[05:30:49] <eddyb_> or end up in .rodata, yes
[05:31:39] <eddyb_> (though in the latter case you could emit an unconditional panic when accessing such value at runtime)
[05:31:51] <huon> o_O
[05:31:54] <eddyb_> which is what I said before :P
[05:33:10] <eddyb_> you could bubble up obligations and emit errors as early as typeck... they would still be about generic code failing to instantiate
[05:34:11] <huon> the exact time errors are emitted usually isn't important if they're going to be emitted (i.e. it's still bad that generic code fails to instantiate)
[05:34:47] <eddyb_> the perf benefit in rustc is not running typeck after monomorphization, which would still hold, but it's just half the story
[05:35:14] <eddyb_> huon: I think we already do this, by getting values back from LLVM
[05:35:52] <eddyb_> and checking for overflows and div/rem sanity
[05:37:05] <eddyb_> maybe emit a runtime panic and a compile-time warning?
[05:37:42] <eddyb_> "this code will actually fail to run"
[05:38:06] *** Joins: swgillespie (swgillespie@moz-rn1.vmq.232.104.IP)
[05:38:16] <eddyb_> and yes, you can do this even if the issue happens in a type, though that is harder to catch and handle
[05:40:59] <eddyb_> are the LLVM arithmetic ops on constants ever preserved, or do they always produce determined constant values?
[05:42:44] <eddyb_> ptrtoint comes to mind, though that is not exactly supported

[06:14:00] <aatch> Havvy, agreed.
[06:14:32] <eddyb_> mostly curious about the impact
[06:14:57] <aatch> Anyway, the only reason I didn't put this in my initial RFC is because I didn't know that we supported attributes on match arms until late in the RFC process.
[06:14:59] <eddyb_> than actually wanting it except for rarer cases
