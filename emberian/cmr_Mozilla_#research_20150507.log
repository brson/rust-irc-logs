[18:25:42] <cmr> well, it's *awesome*, I love it.
[18:26:15] <brson> hopefully they'll be available to order in the next week or two

[18:27:34] <brson> we still need to decide the crucial matter of how to distribute them in sf

[22:50:29] <khuey> roc: ping?
[22:51:40] <khuey> roc: https://github.com/mozilla/rr/blob/master/src/ReplaySession.cc#L1407
[22:51:47] <khuey> roc: why doesn't that use AutoRemoteSyscalls?
[22:57:34] <roc> because exit() never returns
[22:57:43] <roc> or hmm
[22:58:31] <roc> maybe it could, using DONT_WAIT
[22:59:35] <roc> oh
[22:59:59] <roc> if we used AutoRemoteSyscalls, then advance_syscall would fail at ASSERT(t, t->ptrace_event() == 0)
[23:00:18] <roc> because we'd get PTRACE_EVENT_EXIT there
[23:03:27] *** Joins: tadh (quassel@moz-88tk3f.res.rr.com)
[23:05:30] <khuey> mmm, ok
[23:07:45] <roc> we could share more code there if it helps, but it's not much code
[23:08:22] <khuey> roc: yeah, it's just mildly annoying
[23:08:38] <khuey> roc: I need to think some more about how to deal with the ARM/Thumb thing w.r.t. syscall injection
[23:08:44] <khuey> before I just wrote in the appropriate instruction
[23:08:45] <roc> because we're destroying the task, we don't need to save and restore registers like AutoRemoteSyscalls does
[23:08:50] <khuey> but now we move to the rr page
[23:09:05] <roc> you know which mode you're in, right?
[23:09:07] <khuey> so for the moment the rr page has an ARM syscall insn and I mask off the thumb bits in AutoRemoteSyscalls
[23:09:23] <roc> alternatively you could just have one instruction per mode
[23:09:26] <khuey> yeah
[23:09:27] <roc> in the rr page
[23:09:46] <khuey> the other idea I had was to have a single instruction sequence that works as ARM and Thumb
[23:09:53] <roc> this mode stuff makes me sad. They exchanged all the x86 insanity for something possibly worse :-)
[23:09:59] <khuey> obviously it would be more than one instruction ;)
[23:10:19] <khuey> I actually had a working plan before I remembered IT state :(
[23:10:38] <roc> "IT"?
[23:10:49] <khuey> Thumb has a way of doing conditional execution
[23:10:54] <khuey> IT = if then
[23:11:22] <khuey> so we might skip the first instructions in my sequence
[23:11:33] <roc> ow
[23:11:36] <khuey> because the previous instruction set up some if then bits
[23:11:41] <khuey> and the condition check fails
[23:12:01] <khuey> in the absence of that though I did come up with a single byte sequence that results in an ARM syscall when interpreted as ARM or Thumb code
[23:12:04] <khuey> kinda neat ;)
[23:13:17] <roc> maybe we should have a CPUMode enum and a Registers::mode() getter and add a CPUMode parameter to traced_syscall_ip()
[23:13:37] <khuey> I've been contemplating that
[23:13:54] <khuey> I've been mostly able to avoid that now that I'm using the convention of ip with low bit set = thumb, without = arm
[23:14:04] <khuey> since that information is transmitted almost everywhere relevant that way
[23:14:36] <roc> You could have both
[23:14:45] <khuey> anyways I've almost completed rebasing over the last 6 months of stuff
[23:14:52] <roc> great
