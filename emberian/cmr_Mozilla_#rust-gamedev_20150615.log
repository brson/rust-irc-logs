[06:03:41] <cmr> in that one you just need to create the VertexBuffer *before* you initialize the struct.
[06:03:59] <cmr> maybe
[06:04:07] <cmr> it looks like you're trying to derive some traits that can't be derived, though.
[06:05:54] <Kingsquee> cmr: initializing them both to temporary variables and applying them to the new struct's fields causes the same issues

[06:19:35] <tomaka> I really wonder why there are spikes in the downloads of https://crates.io/crates/winapi for example
[06:19:47] <cmr> crater, I bet.

[06:21:48] <tomaka> may 11th, 3232 downloads
[06:21:51] <tomaka> the next day, 42 downloads
[06:21:59] <tomaka> are there really 3190 crates that depend on winapi?
[06:22:26] <tomaka> or 3189 if crater tests winapi itself

[06:22:27] <cmr> no, only 444: https://crates.io/crates/winapi/reverse_dependencies
[06:23:01] <cmr> I'm not sure if reverse_dependencies is only direct deps.
[06:23:29] <cmr> judging by how few crates depend on libc (only 325), I'm going to say yes, only direct deps.

[06:26:20] <jpernst> it'd be interesting to know the average frequency of cargo update
[06:26:33] *** Joins: nodweber (nodweber@moz-knt.fgq.178.5.IP)
[06:26:35] <jpernst> if most people do it daily, that could explain some of the massive initial spike
[06:26:56] <cmr> I know I only do a cargo update when I need a new feature from a dep.
[06:28:12] <jpernst> i think crates makes it pretty safe to do it often, since if it breaks you can just bump the version back down again
[06:29:01] <cmr> it's mostly out of laziness on my part
[06:29:06] <cmr> and forgetfulness
[06:29:22] <jpernst> yeah, for me it's mostly habit from using the nightlies for so long
[06:29:35] <jpernst> and i'm still on nightly, so not much has changed, except that things almost never break now, which is great

[17:27:54] <tomaka> meh: ideally it would be something like `impl<T> AsUniformValue for T where T: CanBeRepresentedAs<[f32; 3])`
[17:28:24] <tomaka> except that "CanBeRepresentedAs" doesn't exist (there's AsRef but it doesn't work well with tuples/arrays)

[22:54:07] <Layl> and it's still by comparison better than the C++ code that apparently was good enough to get me into a game development study
[22:54:27] <cmr> it's only 700 lines of code but it's absolute spaghetti and the algorithms it uses are naive.
