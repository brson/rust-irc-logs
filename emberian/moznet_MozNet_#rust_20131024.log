[01:52:28] <kmc> I think "list of Unicode codepoints" is a pretty good middle ground which supports a lot of use cases
[01:52:43] <kmc> list of graphemes is not what you want for editing or parsing, just for display
[01:52:46] <kmc> and only for some kinds of display
[01:53:40] <kmc> (but maybe I'm really thinking "glyph" and not "grapheme" because I spent some of today working on Servo's text shaping code)
[01:53:45] <benh> I figured for tasks like "lexing rust code", str is kinda appropriate in that operations on our line noise characters are trivial and skipping past things that can be multibyte characters was simple enough, and we wouldn't gain much by having a fully-featured unicode string there
[01:54:11] <kmc> I'm not saying "str" should be a "fully-featured" Unicode string, I'm just saying it should be a Unicode string and not a UTF-8 string ;P
[01:54:35] <kmc> i.e. the UTF-8-ness is as irrelevant as the fact that uint is big or little endian
[01:54:49] <strcat> the UTF-8 part is relevant, because otherwise you would just use ~[char]
[01:54:50] <benh> kmc: I don't really know the difference, I just said grapheme because it's more scary sounding than character. I'm just always afraid of doing the "your 'about' text can only be 100 characters long, so i'm gonna chop off half your combining-character'd characters"
[01:55:06] <strcat> input/output is almost always UTF-8

[01:56:36] <strcat> not that indexing strings is ever useful ;p

[01:56:51] <kmc> cmr: not relevant to my point
[01:57:15] <kmc> strcat: the Servo code I was working on today does a lot of string indexing and it's uglier for being byte-based for sure

[03:47:35] <eevee> i can see why but ehh

[03:47:57] <pcwalton> SiegeLord: oh, you pass things only by pointer
[03:48:03] <pcwalton> we will need to define the rules at some point
[03:48:27] <SiegeLord> Constructors typically don't, though... it's very unidiomatic to write new() -> ~T
[03:48:49] <eevee> hm
[03:49:10] <pcwalton> SiegeLord: that's true
[03:49:19] <eevee> is it possible to unwrap a ~T (permanently, obviously)
[03:49:30] <pcwalton> yeah, just use *
[03:49:39] <pcwalton> SiegeLord: if you want to make your code dynamically linkable and reserve the right to change the values you have to break idioms
[03:49:43] <pcwalton> that's true in C as well
[03:50:00] <pcwalton> where "idiom" means "the most efficient thing"
[03:50:13] <sfackler> you could also do what std::io does (did?) and do something like MyStruct { priv inner: ~MyPrivateStruct }

[10:14:24] <nmatsakis> bjz_: the semantics of ABI strings *today* are that we pick the most specific one for the current platform; so "C stdcall" would be stdcall on windows but C elsewhere, but I am beginning to think the scheme is goofy, and we should just have single ABI constants, and have some ad-hoc "meta constants" (like "system" in D) for things that vary by platform

[10:30:38] <kimundi> macros are syntax extensions

[13:54:32] <maikeru> I'm honestly not sure, I haven't tried relative paths, but I'd imagine it would work.
[13:54:51] <maikeru> rustpkg, to my understanding, is supposed to handle dependencies and what not, but I haven't even started looking at it.

[16:04:58] <bstrie> would be nifty to start seeing standalone libraries that can be used outside of a rust context, for benchmarking against existing solutions... but I understand if that's out of scope
[16:05:18] <SimonSapin> bstrie: https://github.com/mozilla-servo/rust-cssparser is a stand-alone library
[16:05:32] <bstrie> super nifty
[16:05:35] <bstrie> is it also runtimeless?

[16:05:55] <bstrie> nmatsakis: pong
[16:06:12] <nmatsakis> bstrie: how well do you know the iterators, and in particular the DoubleEndedIterator trait?
[16:06:30] <SimonSapin> I haven’t tried. What are the constraints of runtimeless?
[16:06:54] <bstrie> nmatsakis: I know of it, I know that you invoke it via .reverse() on a supported iterator, and I know that strcat wrote it, and therefore it must be pretty efficient :)
[16:07:09] <kimundi> not reverse
[16:07:10] <SimonSapin> It’s only the "low-level" of CSS parsing, as the rest I think does not make sense outside of servo
[16:07:11] <kimundi> invert
[16:07:12] <nmatsakis> bstrie: in particular, iiuc, DoubleEndedIterator still preserves the invariant that every item is yielded only once, but it just allows them to be taken from the front *or* the back
[16:07:13] <bstrie> ah right
[16:07:19] <nmatsakis> kimundi: does that sound right?

[16:07:32] <SimonSapin> for example the data structure for parsed selectors will change when we optimize selector matching

[16:08:37] <SimonSapin> bstrie: I’m told that the performance is better, but I don’t have numbers. Also there is a lot of low-hanging optimization fruit
[16:08:45] <bstrie> ok

[16:09:59] <nmatsakis> kimundi: what do you mean by "go in cycles"?

[17:11:55] <kimundi> nmatsakis: I'm not sure about both options. using unsafe code to provide a safe interface seems to be standard procedure in such situations at the moment, But in general though I think the best bet would be to get HKT
[17:12:12] *** Joins: Kruppe (user@moz-253119B0.esg.uwaterloo.ca)
[17:12:30] <eddyb> kimundi: HKT looks so useful, in more cases than this one :D
[17:12:38] <kimundi> indeed
[17:12:43] <nmatsakis> kimundi: that would argue for MutIterator, I suppose.
[17:12:59] <kimundi> Apparently, yeah :)
[17:13:12] <nejucomo> What does HKT stand for?
[17:13:24] <eddyb> with numeric type parametrization, you can have Foobar<A, [B<A>, ..N]> :D
[17:13:47] <bstrie> nejucomo: higher-kinded types
[17:13:54] <nejucomo> Ah.
[17:14:09] <eddyb> (that "A, " is actually superfluos there, I think)
[17:15:00] <eddyb> but you can have Foobar<A : FixedSizeVec<T, N>>, I guess
[17:15:43] <eddyb> (I know, I could prolly come up with better examples :/)
[17:16:13] <kimundi> nmatsakis: On the other had though, our vector iterators are actually implemented as unsafe pointers at the moment
[17:16:34] <cmr> For our current iterators, having MutIterator doesn't make sense.
[17:16:51] <kimundi> nmatsakis: So the 'can access inner slice' point is kinda moot :)
[17:17:24] <cmr> But for wanting to implement something like MutIterator yourself, I can see its utility.

[17:19:33] <kimundi> Or that
[17:19:34] <nmatsakis> kimundi: well, yeah, but the relevant point is more that there is no equivalent, but less efficient, "safe rust" version I guess

[20:17:35] <pcwalton> how is it 2013 and arc::clone is not marked inline
[20:18:07] * pcwalton fixes
[20:18:51] <strcat> pcwalton: oh and destructors can't be xcrate-inlined, really hurts for Rc ;\
[20:19:00] <strcat> since it just has a branch, -= 1 and free
[20:19:02] <pcwalton> strcat: hmm, why not?
[20:19:15] <strcat> pcwalton: the dtor code path is horribly broken, I'm looking into fixing it now
[20:19:19] <pcwalton> ok
[20:19:34] <strcat> pcwalton: and atm you can't use trait bounds in dtors... :(
[20:19:48] <pcwalton> nmatsakis has ideas on how to fix that... maybe
[20:19:55] <pcwalton> that may be hard to fix though
[20:19:59] <strcat> it's a trans issue
[20:20:11] <strcat> I don't mean the #[unsafe_destructor] requirement
[20:20:13] <jstevans1> Alright, so I make uninstall'd, added the PPA, and apt-get install'd rust-0.8
[20:20:24] <jstevans1> I still can't rustc
[20:20:27] <pcwalton> yeah, I know
[20:20:31] <strcat> jstevans1: make uninstall won't remove everything
[20:20:34] <pcwalton> trait bounds in dtors... how would you do it?
[20:20:39] <pcwalton> I guess maybe it just works
[20:20:43] <strcat> pcwalton: just like methods?
[20:20:52] <strcat> the problem is that atm it calls monomorphic_fn directly
[20:21:02] <strcat> I'm going to just see if making it call the method trans stuff magically works
[20:21:20] <kimundi> Isn't there a nightly rust build for ubuntu? Seems like that would be a better pick

[22:43:07] <tjc> I suppose really, "a name", since the guard doesn't check ID :-)
[22:43:17] <erickt> :)
[22:43:49] <strcat> tjc: sounds more like a greeter than a guard then ;P
[22:43:50] <pnkfelix> Guest_: I believe building from the current master is supposed to work right now, but I have not yet tried to install Mavericks so I don't have a testbed for it yet
[22:44:15] <tjc> strcat: well, when I did the BAHaskell meetup last week, the guard kept calling me so I could come let people in, which was definitely helpful, but...

[22:50:01] <erickt> tjc: fixed :)
[22:50:26] <tjc> jsingh: I haven't used DList much myself, but it looks (from the interface that's documented) that it's meant to be used either by accessing the first or last element, or through an iterator

[23:18:25] <tjc> I also figured if I'd said that, someone would have piped up to point out the one exception that I'm sure exists ;-)

[23:18:44] <tjc> future_horizons: Yeah, that part is a little hairy, but fortunately you should be able to look at tests in std::str (if nothing else) to see how it's done
