[00:00:07] <larsberg> nrc: It worked pretty well, but IIRC figuring out the full lifecycle with storing project settings, etc. got really complicated (e.g., if the enterprise policy C indentation settings differ from the ones in the file, which win?)
[00:00:09] <shu> kmc: differs from crash to crash, sometimes the instruction is valid but the other saved regs don't make sense
[00:00:28] <larsberg> roc: now, the value of CS journals is that you get to actually finish the work and write up a version that other people could reproduce :-)
[00:00:40] <shu> kmc: see https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1139386#c13
[00:00:43] <larsberg> In all seriousness, I love journal versions of papers.
[00:03:42] <shu> this bug is insane arghh
[00:07:30] <shu> am i correct in understanding signals that, if the signal handler is an empty function, raising signals should never cause the interrupt program to crash?

[00:14:26] <roc> no
[00:14:34] <roc> various conditions can still cause a crash
[00:14:51] <roc> for example if there's no room in the stack area to push the signal handler frame
[00:14:59] <roc> or you specified a sigaltstack pointing to invalid memory
[00:15:27] *** Joins: yury (yury@moz-9flvv8.ok.cox.net)
[00:15:41] <shu> roc: definitely no to the latter
[00:15:41] <roc> if you're running 32-bit code on a 64-bit CPU, there's some extra bizarre conditions that you'd rather not know about :-)
[00:15:54] <shu> roc: this crash is ONLY reproducible on our linux32 EC2 test instances
[00:16:03] <roc> mmmmmmmm
[00:16:13] <roc> ok
[00:16:21] <shu> roc: in my own VMs, in physical 32 bit machines with matching kernel and glibc versions, i have never been able to get it to crash
[00:16:54] <shu> roc: no room in the stack area seems unlikely, as the bt is also reasonable
[00:17:09] <roc> an extra-bizarre condition is that it's possible to use ptrace to set the upper 32-bits of RSP to something nonzero
[00:17:44] <roc> everything continues to work normally until a signal is delivered, then the kernel looks at the full RSP when deciding whether it's safe to push a stackframe, and decides it's not
[00:17:58] <shu> roc: well, these are 32bit EC2 instances are virtualized on 64bit cpus i suppose?
[00:18:11] *** Joins: pnkfelix (pnkfelix@moz-eljppb.fbx.proxad.net)
[00:18:31] <roc> I don't know if our Linux32 EC2 instances are running 64bkit kernels or not
[00:18:34] <roc> that's the key
[00:18:40] <shu> roc: they are definitely running 32bit kernels
[00:18:47] <roc> ok, that's not it then
[00:19:41] <roc> BTW
[00:19:52] <shu> roc: 64bit kernels don't crash
[00:20:38] <roc> when you see the saved IP at an illegal instruction, is it still in an executable page, or not? if EIP landed in a non-executable page, I'd expect SIGSEGV to fire before SIGILL
[00:22:07] <shu> roc: hm, i assumed it was. it's always between 2 legal instructions in the .text section of libjemalloc
[00:24:41] <roc> ok, that sounds ok
[00:25:47] <shu> hm! if i don't use SA_RESTART, it now asserts in jemalloc instead
[00:26:07] <shu> but strace showed no syscalls between the SIGPROF storm...

[02:44:30] <kmc> VM bugs are great fun, although this sounds more like something you'd get from dynamic recompilation VMs rather than HVM or Xen paravirt

[02:53:14] <kmc> yeah
[02:53:32] <shu> kmc: let me lean your expertise a bit more. do you happen know what rt_sigreturn returning EINTR would mean? i thought rt_sigreturn was a continuation that jumped back to the interrupted code
[02:53:49] <shu> kmc: strace, however, sometimes shows rt_sigreturn returning -1 and having errno = EINTR
[02:58:02] <roc> er
[02:58:36] <roc> I wonder if that's strace getting confused
[03:00:11] <roc> after sigreturn, all registers include EAX are set to the values they had before signal entry
[03:00:41] <shu> roc: right, that's my understanding
[03:00:52] <roc> perhaps if EAX is -INTR strace thinks it's an errno return
[03:01:14] <roc> but it's not
[03:01:35] <roc> certainly in rr I've never seen sigreturn actually return an error
[03:02:28] <shu> roc: it's probably strace getting confused, most of the time it prints a garbage number as the rval
[03:02:50] <shu> roc: though the strange corruption always happens after strace reports an EINTR
[03:04:08] <roc> have you tried inspecting the saved register state while you're in the handler?
[03:04:50] <shu> roc: yep
[03:05:01] <shu> roc: the IP is corrupted on entry
[03:05:23] <shu> roc: i'm looking in ucontext->uc_mcontext.gregs[REG_EIP]

[04:54:22] <shu> kmc: registers
[04:58:37] <kmc> if it's in a syscall, you can get that from /proc
[05:01:55] <shu> if what's in a syscall?
[05:02:00] <kmc> the thread whose state you want to inspect
[05:03:11] * kmc thinks about methods for reading registers of a thread currently running on another core
[05:03:36] <shu> kmc: well, chances are it's not in a syscall
[05:05:04] <kmc> with OOE, registers are fictional and merely asking for the contents of a register would affect the pipeline
[05:06:06] <shu> well, i'd like to see what the kernel sees
[05:06:23] <kmc> the kernel is only running during a syscall :)
[05:07:34] <shu> yeah... :(
[05:07:35] <kmc> to query registers on another core would require an interprocessor interrupt
[05:07:38] <kmc> so it's asynchronous
[05:07:49] <shu> the problem is that by the time the signal handler is invoked, the state is already corrupted somehow
[05:08:22] <kmc> you need an async mechanism to ask the kernel to stop the target process and get a coherent snapshot of its registers... and that starts to look like signal delivery
[05:08:33] <kmc> hmm
[05:09:12] <shu> for example
[05:10:09] <shu> sometimes the instruction immediately preceding the saved EIP is a mov (%eax) -0x10(%ebp) or something like that
[05:10:36] <shu> if i examined the saved $eax and $ebp-0x10, the values are different
[05:10:58] <shu> err
[05:10:59] <shu> mov %eax
