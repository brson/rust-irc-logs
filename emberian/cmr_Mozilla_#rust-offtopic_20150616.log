[00:00:07] <c74d> $20/user/month for Phabricator Phacility seems to me like it would prevent that from ever becoming the sort of general OSS development hub that GitHub and SourceForge are/were.

[00:01:35] <cmr> I suspect GitLab is better for most open-source projects, as they don't need or care about the nicer features phabricator has.

[00:49:50] <eddyb> now the hard part: I have a Ty and a tcx with disjoint lifetimes. they could be in different arenas

[00:50:26] <eddyb> there's a few ways to do this

[04:23:04] <bstrie> not to mention that "publishing" here means "post it to #rust-internals" and "phone number" mean "the number of their temporary US sim card that they bought that morning"

[04:37:23] <niconii> the code of conduct exists to keep the community friendly, safe, and welcoming
[04:38:29] <niconii> i don't think bstrie posting Gankro's temporary phone number at his own request really goes against that
[04:39:40] <niconii> also, you've gotta keep in mind these are rules interpreted by human moderators, not a computer, y'know?
[04:40:40] <niconii> i think the moderation team has enough common sense to interpret the code of conduct in a reasonable way

[05:10:22] <bstrie> niconii: what's the problem?
[05:11:03] <niconii> bstrie: are you asking about the spammer issue in general?
[05:11:26] <niconii> bstrie: or why +R on #rust isn't very effective
[05:11:43] <niconii> bstrie: the latter's simply because the spammer started registering nicks
[05:12:36] <niconii> so their bots were able to enter #rust and spam a few times before getting g-lined
[05:14:09] <niconii> well, just to clear things up about what's going on, for the past few days, someone's had a botnet mass-private-message tons of people on mozilla's network
[05:14:36] <niconii> they've also spammed #rust and i believe a few other channels as well
[05:14:52] <niconii> oddly, the messages have mostly been advertisements for some irc server
[05:16:26] <niconii> by the way, by "mass-private-message" i mean most people were getting messages from 600 different nicks at once
[05:16:46] <niconii> anyway, first they were just a bunch of unregistered nicks, so i suggested people start using `/mode your_nick +R` to block private messages from unregistered nicks
[05:17:09] <XMPPwocky> hmm, exceptions as important DoS exploit mitigation
[05:17:17] <niconii> that knowledge circulated a bit, but then the spammer caught on and started registering nicks
[05:17:40] <XMPPwocky> specifically: there's this code that's buried inside image loading code, that checks for null with an assert
[05:17:49] <niconii> so then `/mode your_nick +c` was suggested instead by a few people including me
[05:17:53] <XMPPwocky> the issue is, this "should" never fail unless allocation does (the image is too big)
[05:18:17] <niconii> and then while i was asleep i guess someone also set +R on #rust as well
[05:18:17] <XMPPwocky> with Rust's error handling, or with C-style error handling, you'd need to thread Results or Options through the entire call stack to be able to just cause image decoding to fail
[05:18:43] <XMPPwocky> with exceptions, you just need a catch block that catches everything
[05:19:02] <XMPPwocky> then you can have asserts that don't bring the whole process down (or thread, as panic! would)
[05:19:04] <WindowsBunny> catch (NuclearExplosion) {
[05:19:52] <niconii> bstrie: anyway, to be clear, the ircops are aware of the issue, it's just been a pretty long battle since the spammer's routing everything through tor and changing up their messages
[05:19:54] <XMPPwocky> it's also not at any runtime cost, besides the actual test for null or whatever, assuming it never gets hit
[05:20:09] <XMPPwocky> while Result would embiggen stack frames
[05:20:17] <XMPPwocky> and add *loads* of branches
[05:20:25] <XMPPwocky> for .and_then or .map
[05:21:29] <XMPPwocky> i bet rust-image will panic if fed an image header that hints at a giant image
[05:30:36] <Gankro> niconii: It is my permanent number, and it was at my request
[05:31:21] <niconii> Gankro: okay, i was just going off of what bstrie said

[05:31:54] * Gankro doesn't acknowledge security as a valid practice
[05:32:23] <bstrie> Gankro: what, why is it that *I* have to get a new number in canada but you get to use your own number here
[05:32:43] <Gankro> bstrie: Winning smile
[05:33:15] <bstrie> you won't be smiling for long when I post your phone number to #rust-internals at your own request
[05:33:45] <bstrie> thereby subjecting you to friendly conversations with intelligent compiler developers, entirely against your will

[06:57:52] <c74d> It leaves my terminal in some kind of partial password-entry mode, where *every other character* I enter gets asterisk'd out and doesn't reach my shell. And if I run `reset`, the password-entry thing comes back up, seeming not even having exited!

[09:16:45] <niconii> though i'm not really a web dev, i wanted to play around with nickel a little for fun
[09:17:11] <niconii> the documentation's not really there though
[09:18:47] <Quxxy> niconii: I'm feeling rather accomplished; I've managed to get Iron to build from *outside* an MSYS2 shell!
[09:19:31] <Quxxy> Now I just have to remember what it was I was going to *do* with Iron when I started...
[09:19:38] <Quxxy> That was so very long ago...
[09:19:46] <niconii> really my main issue is just the assumed knowledge
[09:19:53] <niconii> the most glaring thing is
[09:20:18] <niconii> on its site, on the main page of its docs, even in its readme on github
[09:20:40] <niconii> nickel doesn't even *mention* that it's built on hyper
[09:20:58] <niconii> i've barely even *heard* of hyper
[09:21:12] <niconii> yet to understand nickel, you need to understand hyper to some extent
[09:22:27] * blue_deref looks up nickel
[09:23:00] * blue_deref closes tab.
[09:23:04] <blue_deref> niconii: Flask.
[09:23:30] <Quxxy> Iron's also fun; it's full of traits all over the place, so knowing what you can pass to any given method is a pain
[09:23:41] <niconii> i like the look of its api if nothing else, the problem is the difficulty in understanding it without the knowledge that having worked with web programming in rust before would give you
[09:24:26] <niconii> http://nickel.rs/ has a hello world example
[09:24:52] <niconii> i ran it, it works fine, but the first thing i wondered was: "what are those _req and _res things?"
[09:25:29] <niconii> so i looked in the api docs, i checked the router! docs
[09:25:54] <niconii> there's no docs for it, but it showed that the macro used _router_inner!
[09:26:47] <niconii> so now i had to check the source for _router_inner!
[09:27:02] <niconii> (oh, and to digress, i did look through the docs for the router module and all that too without luck)
[09:27:35] <niconii> anyway, turns out _router_inner! uses middleware!
[09:27:49] <niconii> so i had to check there, and middleware! uses _middleware_inner!
[09:28:03] <niconii> somehow i'm already four levels deep
[09:28:29] <niconii> so i finally check the code for that, and oh! they're Request and Response
[09:28:48] <benh> wait is oh! a macro in nickel too or is that some genuine excitement mixed into the macro chat
[09:28:58] <niconii> that's excitement, thankfully
[09:29:28] <niconii> anyway, i look in the structs and slap myself because Request and Response are the only structs that even start with req and res
[09:29:31] <Quxxy> niconii: It could be worse; it could be written in Hodor!
[09:30:16] <niconii> anyway, so i look at Request
[09:30:36] <benh> (i got scared off rust web dev when everything was talking about middleware and i had no idea what that is :P)
[09:30:46] <niconii> it says "A container for all the request data"
[09:31:01] <niconii> which uh
[09:31:19] <niconii> doesn't tell me much more than i could already tell with Request, but
[09:31:21] <niconii> okay
[09:31:55] <niconii> and it also lists the fields, including origin, which says it's "the original hyper::server::Request"
[09:32:20] <niconii> and now
[09:32:35] <niconii> only now do i figure out that i have to learn hyper too, apparently
[09:33:56] <niconii> which apparently means i need to bother with all the details of HTTP as well? maybe? who knows?

[09:41:22] <Manishearth> python decorators run at runtime though, so there's a lot more power for making things like flask. in Rust it's a bit harder
[09:42:38] <niconii> anyway, i hope i didn't get too ranty, but i think that information like that from a layperson like me would be helpful for understanding the shortcomings of docs, since when you're making something you typically have all the domain knowledge and don't know what knowledge you may be assuming

[10:07:28] <niconii> anyway, i just bought it, since i love zachtronics' games, and this is especially a niche i'm interested in
[10:08:26] <Quxxy> niconii: Because of SpaceChem, that steam engineers one, and the silicon circuit one :P
[10:08:32] <niconii> hopefully i can run it properly with the rickety, jury-rigged contraption that is the linux version of steam
[10:09:38] <niconii> Quxxy: yeah, those were all pretty great games
[10:09:59] <niconii> the circuit one was a little beyond me though, haha

[18:45:55] <Oflor> Wraithan: Not-native-English-speaker-problems
[18:46:37] <tilpner> Nah, lots of native speakers do that too, though I usually don't try to correct them.
[18:47:16] <tilpner> I've been linked to a 4chan discussion about Rust. Yes, it was as awful as you'd expect.
[18:47:32] <Astrum|Lap> our language is pretty imprecise
[18:47:33] <WindowsBunny> tilpner: not 8ch?
[18:47:43] <tilpner> The most mentioned problem they had with Rust was our "SJW" gender-neutral documentation.
[18:48:01] <Oflor> I learned very recently that 'they' may be used as an indefinite pronoun
[18:48:12] <Astrum|Lap> wait... the docs aren't gender neutral
[18:48:22] <tilpner> They aren't? They should be.
[18:48:25] <Astrum|Lap> could have sworn I've seen examples that specify gender
[18:48:39] <tilpner> There's even a users.rust-lang.org thread about this policy...
[18:48:43] <Astrum|Lap> but, I could be wrong
[18:48:59] <Wraithan> Oflor: much like german with Sie
[18:49:28] <Astrum|Lap> in either case, being gender neutral is okay I suppose
[18:49:35] <tilpner> I don't really mind its omission, but I try to use exclusively use it when the gender is not specified.
[18:49:39] <WindowsBunny> tilpner: I'm fine with gender neutral docs, its when people start raising a ruckus just because we used `he` somewhere that annoys me
[18:49:53] <Astrum|Lap> though our language really is a mess and getting offended by it seems counter-productive
[18:49:58] <Wraithan> No reason to limit who could be being an asshole to you to just one gender :)
[18:50:09] <Wraithan> speaking of the irc spammer 
[18:50:13] <WindowsBunny> Or even worse, if they demand changing it to `she` for a few decades as some sort of revenge against men
[18:50:31] <tilpner> WindowsBunny - Well, consistency is a nice thing to have. If it wasn't consistent, what's the point specifying any guideline at all?
[18:50:31] <Astrum|Lap> I've never seen that, WindowsBunny 
[18:51:16] <Astrum|Lap> I'm actually surprised our natural language is useful at all
[18:51:20] <tilpner> users.rust-lang.org is down, or I'd link it.
[18:51:23] <WindowsBunny> Astrum|Lap: You don't remember https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/25640 ?
[18:51:24] <Sho> Korean used to only have a gender-neutral third person pronoun (그/geu) until they invented a female version (그녀/geunyeo) specifically to deal with translating from English
[18:51:29] <Wraithan> WindowsBunny: opposite default is a tactic. Some try to do the alternating thing, this is popular in journalism where they will give multiple examples start with one such as he, then give the next example in she, etc. 
[18:51:50] <WindowsBunny> Wraithan: I'm fine with having examples using alternating genders
[18:51:53] <Astrum|Lap> there's connotation and denotation, but let's not forget that the person hearing it can come up with their own semantics that the speaker didn't intend
[18:51:55] <Wraithan> meh
[18:52:07] <WindowsBunny> It's just the way that PR handled the situation
[18:52:10] <Sho> Meanwhile Swedish is trying the whole "hen" thing
[18:52:37] <Sho> As a neutral alternative to han/hon
[18:53:01] <Astrum|Lap> WindowsBunny: didn't see that
[18:53:27] <WindowsBunny> Astrum|Lap: Wait, wrong PR, it was actually https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/25585
[18:53:39] <WindowsBunny> >However, because this mistake has stood since 1985, I have changed all  of the pronouns to be female, to make up for lost time. If someone  would like to revert this patch or switch to neutral pronouns after 30  years, feel free to set your alarm clock for 2045.
[18:54:03] <Oflor> because this mistake has stood since 1985, I have changed all of the pronouns to be female

[20:11:33] <Tiffany> it's written in C#

[20:11:50] <XMPPwocky> keepassx is much more reasonable ime

[20:39:03] <Tiffany> they use both

[20:43:36] <XMPPwocky> Tiffany: i meant my own password manager (that nobody should use in production)
[20:43:54] <Tiffany> the best I can think of is using a regular password manager (or a flat file), making sure it has decent crypto, and plopping it into your sync program of choice (dropbox, btsync, etc)
[20:44:30] <XMPPwocky> Tiffany: i just emailed myself a new KeePassX database every time i changed mine at all
[20:44:31] <Tiffany> xmppwocky: you'll be fine as long as you use a decent PKDF and authenticated encryption
[20:44:50] <fmtq> I am in Belgium. I have beer.
[20:45:00] <XMPPwocky> Tiffany: yeah i'm planning scrypt + sodiumoxide's secretbox
[20:45:17] <XMPPwocky> which is Salsa20+Poly1305
[20:45:50] <XMPPwocky> anyways, the reason for the email stuff was just so i don't have to worry about dropbox's sync agent screwing up if I use it across two computers at the same time
[20:46:11] <Tiffany> it's amazing how awful most sync programs are at resolving conflicts or dealing with FAT filesystems

[20:46:54] <Tiffany> when I installed btsync on my phone, I found out the hard way that android formats SD cards as FAT, that btsync handles that poorly, and that I at the time had several hundred files with banned characters like :
[20:47:12] <XMPPwocky> : isn't allowed in FAT filenames? fun
[20:47:12] <zofrex> Tiffany: how many passwords would not fit into a single AES block... maybe the CBC/ECB stuff is for secure notes?
[20:47:15] <XMPPwocky> how does linux handle that
[20:47:16] <Tiffany> what happened was it took every file, and replaced the :s with _s
[20:47:29] <XMPPwocky> zofrex: well, at least with CBC, you'd presumably have an IV
[20:47:29] <Tiffany> and then there was a huge amount of conflicts as a result
[20:47:33] <XMPPwocky> which might even be somewhat random!
[20:47:55] <zofrex> I wonder where on earth their javascript gets its randomness
[20:47:57] <Tiffany> what do you mean a single block zofrex?
[20:48:05] <Tiffany> the whole point is to make a single-block cipher into a stream cipher
[20:48:09] <XMPPwocky> while with ECB, depending on what they're actually encrypting (just the password?), you could potentially tell what users use duplicate passwords
[20:48:14] <Tiffany> ECB just breaks the stream into chunks and encrypts each one individually
[20:48:27] <Tiffany> whereas CBC xors the last encrypted block with the input to the next one
[20:48:33] <Tiffany> ECB is horribly broken in multiple ways
[20:48:34] <XMPPwocky> Tiffany: i think their point is, ECB would be CBC if you  hav a very short input
[20:48:37] <XMPPwocky> except that's not true
[20:48:38] <zofrex> Tiffany: well you only need a block mode to turn a block cipher into a stream cipher, which you only need to do if the data exceeds block size... right?
[20:48:38] <XMPPwocky> because IV
[20:48:43] <Tiffany> oh
[20:49:04] <Tiffany> well, presumably lastpass encrypts the entire database
[20:49:08] <Tiffany> rather than just individual entries
[20:49:10] <zofrex> bear in mind that if you map my crypto knowledge on the Y-axis and calendar time on the X-axis it peaks somewhere around 3DES
[20:49:10] <Tiffany> at least, I hope so
[20:49:35] <zofrex> oh, that would make sense.

[20:50:39] <zofrex> I know what this is without clicking ;)
[20:51:02] <XMPPwocky> I assume they get entropy from mouse movements and keyboard inputs, plus some of the rare APIs that expose semi-random things
[20:51:06] <Tiffany> the matasano crypto challenge actually has a section where you decrypt ECB-encrypted data using an oracle
[20:51:37] <Tiffany> secure entropy in browser is pretty much a crapshoot unless you have access to the browser APIs
[20:51:45] <Tiffany> the only sane solution there is to abort() if you don't have it
[20:52:05] <XMPPwocky> there was one site that said "cover your webcam with your finger", used WebRTC or Flash to grab screams from the camera, and analysed the thermal noise for entropy
[20:52:09] <XMPPwocky> ... frames, not screams
[20:52:11] <XMPPwocky> that got dark

[20:56:31] <zofrex> urandom or die!
[20:57:00] <Tiffany> yeah
[20:57:12] <Astrum|Lap> for most of what I like to do in programming I prefer QRNG anyway
[20:57:44] <Tiffany> I trust the OS itself to have much better access to entropy than a sandboxed application

[20:59:04] <Tiffany> the funny thing about that xmppwocky
[20:59:10] <Tiffany> is that's basically how ECC curve selection happens
[21:00:07] <zofrex> ECC selection contains my favourite term of all time
[21:00:08] <Astrum|Lap> maybe I should begin work on a QRNG lib for rust again...
[21:00:11] <Astrum|Lap> they're pretty simple
[21:00:13] <zofrex> "nothing-up-my-sleeve numbers"
[21:00:19] <Astrum|Lap> I'm sure someone has a use for it
[21:00:46] <fmtq> Encryption sucks

[21:08:15] <Dr-Emann> A lavalamp would seem to be decidedly un-random. Given the state at time t, the chance that the state at time t+1 is similar seems very high.

[21:12:55] <Tiffany> I imagine the thermal noise in the CMOS sensors would be more efficient than the lava lamp being recorded with it
[21:14:43] <niconii> so, i dunno who was here last time i mentioned it is here now, but
[21:15:10] <niconii> yesterday i found this game called TIS-100, which is a game by zachtronics about asm programming
[21:15:21] <dfockler> niconii: Astrum|Lap and I were talking about it
[21:15:28] <niconii> it's pretty neat
[21:15:33] <dfockler> Yeah I thought so
[21:15:43] <WindowsBunny> Dr-Emann: I heard lava lamp https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obdLhRTfDFo
[21:15:51] <niconii> anyway, you can optimize for things like instructions, cores used, and cycles
[21:15:59] <niconii> but i noticed that on the first level
[21:16:14] <niconii> which optimally takes something like 86 cycles
[21:16:16] *** Joins: Zr40 (zr40@moz-92llkv.adsl.xs4all.nl)
[21:16:31] <niconii> the graph showed a significant amount of people with like
[21:16:36] <niconii> 100k cycles
[21:16:51] <niconii> i dunno if the graph was just broken or what, but
[21:17:02] <niconii> it did give me the idea of, instead of optimizing for the fastest program
[21:17:10] <niconii> trying to make the slowest program i possibly could
[21:17:39] <dfockler> just sleep for infinity
[21:17:59] <Tiffany> write a brainfuck interpreter, and then implement a nock interpreter in brainfuck, and then write the solution in hoon
[21:18:04] <Tiffany> it will then take a hundred thousand cycles
[21:18:15] <niconii> the slowest program that finishes the job, i should say
[21:18:24] <dfockler> or just write some javascript to load a flash banner ad
[21:18:25] <niconii> so it has to terminate, or else it won't be counted by the game
[21:18:31] <niconii> unfortunately i came with something so slow that it'd take 1,000,000,000,000,000 cycles
[21:19:18] <dfockler> I was thinking of producing every 50x50 image but it would be 41453437500 images
[21:19:19] <niconii> per input
[21:19:29] <niconii> and there's about 100 inputs
[21:19:58] <niconii> anyway, i don't want to wait one hundred quadrillion cycles, so i'm settling for 10,000 per input instead, so about 1,000,000 cycles

[21:25:02] <niconii> (also you can step through)
[21:25:11] <niconii> "RUN" runs it slow enough for you to see what's going on, so that's a set speed

[21:25:25] <niconii> "FAST" is a lot faster... but it doesn't seem to be CPU-bound?
[21:25:34] <niconii> as in, it's not maxing out my CPU by doing this
[21:25:36] <Tobba> ... it's not called TURBO?
[21:25:43] <cmr> right?
[21:25:44] <niconii> so that might also be a set speed

[21:27:41] <niconii> that's a very rough estimate though

[22:13:29] <Astrum|Lap> too many interesting games, not enough time
[22:14:18] <niconii> WindowsBunny: sounds like a pretty dangerous party, if only killer bunnies are invited...
[22:15:05] <WindowsBunny> niconii: Oh no, we invite others, it's just only killer bunnies are left by the time the party ends
[22:15:13] <brandonson> Astrum|Lap: I feel ya, like half of my steam games are things I want to play but can't find time to
[22:15:23] <brandonson> Astrum|Lap: though most of them are probably from bundles
[22:16:17] <Astrum|Lap> yeah, a lot are from bundles
[22:16:28] <Astrum|Lap> I haven't even had a computer capable of playing a lot of my steam games in 2 years
[22:16:33] <Astrum|Lap> slowly building a new one
[22:20:31] <zofrex> I'm basically planning to play all my games when I retire
[22:21:13] <Layl> zofrex, I hope to one of these days finally get to half life 2
[22:21:36] <Layl> behold the most useful diagram ever http://athena-org.github.io/
[22:21:39] <brandonson> zofrex: heh.  my plan is to spend the week after I finish my co-op + the first couple weeks of school going nuts with games
[22:22:24] <Astrum|Lap> with fallout 4 announced I may have to quit my job and play games in my parents basement
[22:22:28] <Astrum|Lap> which neight of them have... crap!
[22:22:46] <zofrex> Layl: may as well jump straight to Half-Life 2: Update when you do
[22:23:12] <Layl> I'm waiting for the 50 years anniversary release
[22:23:16] <zofrex> it's frustrating when I was a kid I could not afford a good enough PC to play most games. Now I can, but I don't have the time. Adulthood sucks.
[22:23:20] <brandonson> Layl: don't underestimate the power of diagrams :p  Also, what did you use to make that?  My diagramming tools suck :/
[22:23:39] <Layl> brandonson, the tool costs 10000$ and I wouldn't advice you to ever really use it
[22:23:52] <Layl> (it's visual studio)
[22:24:19] <Layl> all my microsoft licenses got canceled last week as well so I can't even update it
[22:24:25] <brandonson> Layl: heh, VS is free for me at the moment IIRC.  Yay DreamSpark!
[22:24:36] <Layl> because something went wrong with my school's dreamspark

[22:25:07] <Layl> oh hey it works again
[22:25:15] <Layl> but they're a bit out of date on some software
[22:25:46] <Layl> it still lists xna game studio 2
[22:26:13] <Layl> not the framework, the visual studio derivative
[22:28:02] <Astrum|Lap> alright, lead based solder smells like clove cigarettes
[22:28:06] <Astrum|Lap> which is weird
[22:28:48] <Layl> behold, me trying to squeeze out an ER diagram out of my code base: http://athena-org.github.io/img/ZeusProject.png
[22:28:54] <Layl> this is an ER diagram of a folder structure
[22:29:03] <Layl> I still can not believe I had to make this
