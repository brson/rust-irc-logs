[02:13:57] <Eridius> jroweboy: if your data is utf-8 you can use str::from_utf8_owned(bytes).map(|s| s.chars().to_owned_vec())
[02:14:01] <Eridius> jroweboy: that will give you an Option<~[char]>
[02:14:04] <Eridius> where None means the data wasn't utf-8
[02:14:12] <Twisol> Thanks Eridius. I'm playing with writing a Twitch bot in Rust.
[02:14:18] <jroweboy> Eridius: I think I may end up just changing the function to take in a ~str
[02:14:38] <Eridius> jroweboy: ~str is the correct way to represent string data, although you still need to know the encoding to go from ~[u8] -> ~str
[02:14:55] <Eridius> Twisol: I'm also writing a bot around my IRC library, with the intention of writing plugins in Lua: https://github.com/kballard/rust-ircbot
[02:15:01] <Eridius> it's also still rather unfinished at the moment
[02:15:07] <jroweboy> Twisol: is there a specific reason for using rust or are you just trying to learn rust?
[02:15:11] <andor> what can i do if a type isn't clone()able but i want to clone it into a task?
[02:15:17] <Twisol> jroweboy: Just trying to learn Rust.

[02:15:25] <Eridius> andor: depends. Do you need to clone it, you can't move it into the task?
[02:15:48] <andor> Eridius: i can, yes
[02:15:53] <Eridius> andor: also, do you just need to be able to access it from two tasks, immutably, or does it need to be mutable?
[02:16:09] <andor> Eridius: former, access from N tasks, immutably
[02:16:17] <Eridius> andor: check out sync::Arc
[02:16:24] <Eridius> that allows for shared immutable state among several tasks

[02:16:53] <Twisol> Does Rust have a package manager?

[02:17:15] <Eridius> cmr has something called cargo-lite as a stopgap, but I haven't looked to see what it actually provides
[02:17:19] <andor> Eridius: erm, i mean i'd prefer it to be cloned
[02:17:27] <andor> i don't want all that additional complexity
[02:17:30] <Eridius> andor: implement Clone for it?
[02:17:49] *** Quits: gfarfl (david@61CAEA53.EC1EE148.D1416617.IP) (Ping timeout)
[02:18:09] <andor> Eridius: it's not my struct, which means that yet again i'd need to wrap it in a newtype... :\
[02:18:19] <Eridius> or write a freestanding function
[02:18:24] <Eridius> (which assumes that its fields are public)
[02:18:33] <andor> what do you mean?
[02:18:54] <Eridius> you could write clone_foo(s: &TheirStruct) -> TheirStruct {} if you have enough visibility into it to be able to implement such a thing
[02:19:09] <Eridius> although honestly, if you just need shared immutable state, sync::Arc works fine
[02:19:10] <andor> well it's also just a newtype
[02:19:13] <Eridius> and avoids the overhead of actually copying data
[02:20:00] <andor> the thing is, i just generate a keypair at startup and i would like every client connection task to be able to access it
[02:20:04] <andor> i might just go with Arc
[02:20:08] <Eridius> Arc is pretty simple
[02:20:33] <Twisol> Eridius: Have you picked a license for your ircbot code? I might play with your code instead of writing my own from scratch, but I need to know the license first.
[02:20:39] <andor> i know, it's just that you know, the data in question is only generated once at program startup and is never going to change
[02:21:06] <andor> i'd just prefer if it was cloned 
[02:21:12] <Eridius> Twisol: heh, I typically don't think about licenses this early in a project, but I can add one now if you want

[02:21:24] <jroweboy> andor: maybe it could be static? I dunno if that would actually help you or not
[02:21:25] <Eridius> Twisol: MIT is what I usually go with, and since Rust appears to be dual-licensed under Apache/MIT that works well
[02:21:37] <Twisol> Eridius: I'm a fan of MIT as well
[02:21:37] <Eridius> jroweboy, andor: you could use a mut static, and wrap it in a function that abstracts away the unsafe access
[02:21:40] <andor> jroweboy: it's generated so it cannot be static i guess
[02:21:42] <aatch> andor, you could also go the slightly-unsafe route
[02:21:53] <aatch> like Eridius said, you can use a static
[02:21:58] <andor> oh? statics aren't compile-time statics?
[02:22:03] <Eridius> andor: mut static isn't
[02:22:04] <jroweboy> generated things can be static I'm pretty ure
[02:22:05] <aatch> andor, well `mut static`
[02:22:10] <Eridius> andor: a mut static is a funny beast that requires unsafe {} to touch
[02:22:24] <Eridius> andor: you can create a mut static, initialize it at startup, and have a safe function that just reads from it
[02:22:36] <Eridius> fn keypair() -> Keypair { unsafe { GLOBAL_KEYPAIR } }
[02:22:43] <aatch> however, if you are sure it will only be written once, you can have function that returns an immutable reference to it.
[02:22:46] <Eridius> well, I suppose &Keypair or what have you
[02:22:52] <Eridius> to ensure immutable access
[02:22:56] <aatch> &'static Keypair
[02:23:22] <andor> sigh, i guess Arc is the least messy of all
[02:24:03] <Eridius> Twisol: ok, LICENSE added to rust-irclib
[02:24:06] <andor> the "you can't impl foreign (tuple) structs for foreign traits" really is a pain in the ass for me right now
[02:24:48] <Twisol> thanks Eridius
[02:26:13] <Eridius> Twisol: let me know if you have any feedback on rust-irclib. It's kind of half-baked right now

[07:06:21] <ercxx> eddyb: That didn't go well with whiskey. I'll read it in the morning :)
[07:06:49] <eddyb> there's some new thoughts I haven't expressed there... a few days ago I've found it's trivial (in theory) to restrict a variadic tuple to have only one type, i.e. (T, T) or (T, T, T, T, T) and use it as a slice. also, you could have a .get_ref::<T>(n) -> Option<&T> method on tuples that would use the same mechanism as Any (but with no virtual dispatch, though LLVM can devirtualize Any pretty well)
[07:07:09] <eddyb> (you'd think that message would exceed some IRC character limit)
[07:07:38] <cmr> eddyb: indeed, it seems moznet has really long message length limits.
[07:07:51] <cmr> which is good, considering most of the discussion here is going to be technical...
[07:08:02] <ercxx> good for pasting a whole file
[07:08:21] <eddyb> cmr: as long as we don't start using TeX regularly...

[10:46:06] <zw01> heh

[10:47:54] <kimundi> zw01: I mean, if you have the problem that you need to explicitly force a iterator chain to run by something like a for _ in iter {} or a .last(), it usually means you went a step to far in chaining everything :)
[10:48:28] <kimundi> for e in iter { println!("{}", e); } would work just as well for example

First problem is, you are trying to return a mutable reference that is stored in self. however, mutable references are moving types - that is if you want to return them you need to either invalidate the source, or create a new temporary reference based on them and return that

[11:10:40] <kimundi> cmr: I meant that returning a mutable reference stored inside self would mean moving that reference. &mut T is a liner type just like ~T

[12:13:59] <andor> well yes but i'd imagine master was close enough to 0.9 at some point to be compatible, no?

[12:31:37] <huon> "45 (-17) successful and 63 (+10)" I'm surprised that there are 45 libraries that don't have a single `extern mod` or have already been updated

[16:23:17] <flan3002> What I need is (kinda) permanent access to both, the borrowed reference and the original. I understand this is working against the concept of ownership. :(
[16:23:28] <kimundi> So, you want to store the tweening object and the object that is being tweened in seperate locations, and have both be alive at the same time? That is something where you need shared ownership for then

[19:50:57] <Ms2ger> For explicitness, I guess
[19:51:20] <sfackler> it's not anymore, but the autocasting doesn't work sometimes
[19:51:23] <kud1ing> Ms2ger: i had expected that the compiler would infer it cirrectly
[19:51:28] <trinary> blargh my error for a while was due to old dylibs lurking around after a make install.
[19:52:03] <Ms2ger> I think it actually has to do work there, like setting up a vtable?
[19:52:04] <csherratt> well if you are returning a pure it gets implemented with a vtable. Where if you return a structure that implements the trait the parent function looks up the correct trait functions at compile time.

[20:24:05] <Eridius> there is no higher-order function that does exactly what you want, and it's a bit complicated because of mutable borrows, but the simple for loop should work

[20:26:32] <leonvv> Eridius: it's a pity because now you loop through the vector twice
[20:26:57] <eddyb> "twice"?
[20:27:04] <Eridius> leonvv: no you don't
[20:27:10] <Eridius> v[i] is constant-time access
[20:27:19] <eddyb> vectors are not linked lists
[20:27:28] <leonvv> Eridius: dosen't v.len() loop through the vector?
[20:27:37] <Eridius> no, length is also constant-time
[20:27:37] <eddyb> why would it have to?
[20:27:38] <Ms2ger> No
[20:27:44] <Ms2ger> And it's also only called once
[20:28:12] <eddyb> yay bad languages confusing programmers :P
[20:28:37] <SiegeLord> Where does len() loop through the vector?
[20:28:42] <leonvv> Didn't now that, thought it would just iterate over it
[20:28:47] <leonvv> know*
[20:29:06] <Eridius> leonvv: length typically only takes O(n) for linked lists, and perhaps trees if you try to define a length operation on trees
[20:29:13] <eddyb> SiegeLord: either a linked list pretending to be a vector/array or one of those C vectors with a NULL at the end
[20:29:14] <Eridius> (length of a tree doesn't make a lot of sense)
[20:29:27] <Eridius> oh sure, C-strings also use O(n), but those aren't really a data structure

[20:30:39] <eddyb> I've heard weird and even contradicting theories about DOM "children" arrays
[20:31:14] <Eridius> eddyb: technically, DOM "children" would be a linked list, but I would hope it's optimized into array-like access on any real web engine
[20:31:17] * Eridius has never checked
[20:31:19] <eddyb> something like "it's a list and forward iteration with a for(i=0;i<len;i++) is cheap, but you have to save the length"
[20:31:29] <leonvv> Eridius: does 'constant-time access' mean that the compiler knows the length at compile time?
[20:31:37] <eddyb> leonvv: no, at runtime

[20:36:26] <eddyb> leonvv: &[T] is not a struct
[20:36:42] <eddyb> you can add methods on any types, even primitives, tuples, etc.
[20:36:53] <eddyb> you can't add fields to something that's not a struct
[20:37:02] <eddyb> we could have accessors, but we don't
[20:37:18] <AutomatedTester> hi, I am going to be on a plane for ~11hrs soon and wanted to port a C++ library to rust. Do I need to do anything special to get rust to compile on a raspberry pi?
[20:37:42] <cmr> AutomatedTester: shouldn't have to, no.
[20:37:43] <Eridius> leonvv: not only what eddyb said, but also if it were a struct field, you'd be able to modify it
[20:37:46] <Eridius> and that's bad

[23:47:07] <acrichto> arrrrrrrrr: remember that FILE* has an internal buffer so it's essentially a BufferedWriter
[23:47:48] <acrichto> the only speed factor in these I/O benchmarks is the size of the buffer
[23:47:51] <arrrrrrrrr> acrichto: Yes, rusts stdio should use a buffer if possible
[23:47:57] <brson> chromatic: this line still converts reference to an allocation to &'static https://github.com/chromatic/rust/commit/38007ce18a6243cd4ec023c62490c6389b7945c1#diff-b12608d176a89ee2bdc98365dac9095bR395
[23:47:58] <acrichto> it does, it's line-buffered by default
[23:48:12] <arrrrrrrrr> of course, I mean something like 4k, not by line
[23:48:32] <acrichto> arrrrrrrrr: the problem with not line buffering is that when your program segfaults you don't see the output
[23:48:35] <brson> chromatic: if that gets thrown and used by another task it'll end up a use after free
[23:48:59] <arrrrrrrrr> acrichto: I can always use flush
[23:49:01] <sfackler> acrichto: I think the idea is to switch on isatty to use either a LineBufferedWriter or a normal BufferedWriter
[23:49:16] <acrichto> sfackler: we did that, but we had the same problem in that if you fault you don't get the output
[23:49:17] * ChrisMorgan thought that line buffering was what *everyone* did
[23:49:31] <acrichto> libc uses a 4k buffer if it's not a tty, but I think they flush it on a signal

[23:50:05] <chromatic> brson, that's what I thought. Seems like a real fix will have to change the signature of begin_unwind.

[23:53:43] <brson> begin_unwind_raw could probably be folded into fail_
[23:54:06] <acrichto> arrrrrrrrr: perhaps, but segfaults is a pretty big reasons because if a program segfaults that's when you most want the output
