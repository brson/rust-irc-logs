[04:54:17] <Gankro> nrc: yeah I'm pretty sure that's standard
[04:56:55] <Gankro> aturon: Thinking about it more, does it actually make sense to be able to use block labels as lifetimes? In particular lifetimes have mutability attached to them, but blocks... don't.
[04:57:21] <Gankro> Not for the examples in turpl, but as an actual language construct
[04:57:31] <aturon> Gankro: lifetimes do not -- it's a relation between lifetimes and various loan paths
[04:57:54] <aturon> the lifetime itself is literally just a region
[04:58:15] <Gankro> aturon: Hmm, having mutability attached is how I understood the "weird lifetimes" situation
[04:58:20] <aturon> re: aliasing rules, i'm looking forward to the analysis :)
[04:58:39] <aturon> Gankro: that's not exactly what's happening there --
[04:59:05] <aturon> what's happening is that, the fact that you return a piece of data that mentions the lifetime of the argument means that the corresponding region must be enlarged,
[04:59:11] <aturon> so as to contain the entire scope of the binding
[04:59:31] <aturon> OTOH, that *same* region is required to have a particular loan path as mutably borrowed

[05:00:52] <aturon> Gankro: basically there are two separate mechanisms in play when doing borrow analysis. on the one hand, you have various constraints on lifetime variables, which largely derive from data flow of various kinds
[05:01:18] <aturon> on the other hand, you have borrowing itself, which tracks the "borrowed status" of various paths in the context of different lifetimes
[05:02:08] <Gankro> Hmm

[05:10:23] <Gankro> I'm actually really happy with this definition. It seems very clean and intuitive. However that suggests to me it's flawed.
[05:10:38] <aturon> lol
[05:10:45] <aturon> so, the subpath definition is counterintuitive to me
[05:10:59] <aturon> in particular, x.y is a subpath of x according to this definition, yes?
[05:11:16] <Gankro> aturon: Whoops I think I reversed it
[05:11:50] <Gankro> I knew that seemed off!
[05:12:03] <aturon> it's probably simpler to define in terms of syntactic paths,
[05:12:08] <aturon> like components separated by .
[05:12:16] <aturon> and then just observe what this means about ownership
[05:12:40] <Gankro> Possibly... Although tagged unions and arrays make this a *bit* wonky
[05:13:11] <aturon> true, ok
[05:13:22] <aturon> but best if the terminology is at least compatible with that reading
[05:14:05] <aturon> "Unfortunately, data on the heap is not always uniquely owned." <- so, implicitly, stack slots are always ownership roots
[05:14:42] <aturon> hmmm i'm not sure i 100% agree with the way you introduce the heap here
[05:14:57] *** Joins: ChrisMorgan (ChrisMorgan@moz-g6osuq.tpgi.com.au)
[05:15:25] <aturon> (trying to figure out how to articulate my concern)
[05:16:21] <aturon> Gankro: well, so one point of confusion in this paragraph is "This limits what can be done with such values." It's not clear which values you mean, precisely
[05:17:22] <Gankro> I mean the shared values
[05:17:34] <Gankro> But yes the paragraph needs massaging
[05:19:48] <aturon> ok, so going back to the beginning: "If all Rust had were values" is in opposition to pointers,
[05:20:09] <aturon> when you transition to the heap, you could do a similar pivot --
[05:20:23] <aturon> if all we had was unique ownerhsip on the heap (e.g. Box, Vec, ...) we'd retain the unique path property
[05:20:32] <aturon> but things like Rc etc break that down
[05:21:04] <Gankro> good idea
[05:21:04] <aturon> "may establish One True Owner temporarily, establishing a path to that value" <- do you want to say "a unique path"?
[05:21:33] <aturon> (BTW: I *really* like the angle you're taking here, modulo precise framing)
[05:21:43] <aturon> s/framing/phrasing/
[05:22:22] <aturon> "Roughly, a reference is live if it can be dereferenced" <- i would add: "live at a point in the program if it can be dereferenced at that point"
[05:22:55] <aturon> "Mutable references can be reachable but not live through the process of reborrowing." <- might want to phrase this as "freezing" to unify it with the same phenomenon on owned values
[05:23:45] <aturon> (i wonder if "child path" is better than "subpath")
[05:24:44] <aturon> i'm not sure that the paragraph beginning "To simplify things..." succeeds in its mission ;-)
[05:24:54] <aturon> but i see that you're sidestepping the freezing issue that way
[05:25:02] <Gankro> aturon: I unify with owned values via "owned references"
[05:25:06] <Gankro> yeah
[05:25:12] <huon> is 'x' a child path/subpath of 'x.y'?
[05:25:22] <Gankro> x is a subpath of x.y
[05:25:48] <aturon> hm. want something as intuitive as "subdirectory" :)
[05:26:08] <aturon> Gankro: i'm not 100% sold on this unification of all things into references
[05:26:10] <huon> that naming seems... backwards
[05:26:16] <huon> (esp. child)
[05:26:33] <aturon> i wanted to say `x.y` is a child path of `x`
[05:26:43] <aturon> not sure that terminology is much of an improvement
[05:26:53] <huon> seems better to me
[05:26:54] <Gankro> *shrug*. a sed-able problem
[05:26:55] * huon shrugs

[05:28:38] <aturon> like i said above, we'll want to iterate on precise phrasing etc but the basic framework seems solid
[05:28:39] <aturon> yeah :)
[05:29:24] <aturon> interestingly, you've ended up splitting exactly the two mechanisms we were talking about previously on IRC -- lifetimes as names for scopes, and paths as ways of talking about what is borrowed (and with what kind of borrow) in any given lifetime

[05:59:47] <sfackler> this is sound, right? http://is.gd/RVMHcw
[06:01:26] <Gankro> sfackler: Isn't that just an infinite loop?
[06:01:43] <Gankro> oh whoops, got the impl backwards
[06:02:11] <sfackler> the compiler can't seem to prove that the lifetimes are okay, but I think they're okay, right?
[06:03:20] <Gankro> I... think... so...
[06:03:38] <Gankro> Generally the lifetimes you yield have to outlive your iterator, right?

[10:13:46] <kimundi> Gankro: Reading your lifetime turpl stuff. When you explain that going &'a u32 -> &'a str might be kinda hard to actually do, all I could think about is that you could make it work by having the u32 encode a 4-ascii-char string :D Maybe add that as a funny note or so :P
