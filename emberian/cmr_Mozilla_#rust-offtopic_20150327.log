[05:30:28] <c74d> there is some documentation that might help but I use DHCP for IPv6 but not for IPv4, and I don't know what following these examples will do with that

[05:31:42] <scott> yeah, I guess as routers and ISPs upgrade, most people will seamlessly move to IPv6 when it's available

[05:39:08] <c74d> I'm thinking that my solution to this is going to be installing a different operating system on this desktop (which I've been intending to do anyway for a while).

[15:04:38] <io2> sure
[15:04:39] <eddyb> and they account for some of Rust's popularity (and as an example, I personally have learnt of Rust's existence in the context of such a kernel project - rustboot or whatever it was called, not to be confused with the OCaml compiler)
[15:04:58] <io2> I'd like to see eventually a successful OS not based on C
[15:05:06] <eddyb> or C++
[15:05:50] <io2> C++ (with which I am acquainted pretty well), is a complete waste of time over C if you go into kernel mode
[15:05:54] <eddyb> Pedigree got pretty far, it just didn't have the workforce to make something with a definite shape
[15:06:25] <io2> wasn't there somebody giving courses with rust as the OS impl language
[15:06:34] <io2> there was a uni I remember doing that
[15:06:35] <eddyb> and there was no niche appeal like Rust
[15:06:41] <Tuba> I used C++ for a kernel
[15:06:45] <Tuba> it was pretty nice
[15:06:50] <eddyb> io2: not OS impl language, but OS course
[15:06:58] <scott> I took my C++ OS project as an opportunity to use C++11 without the awful stdlibs
[15:07:02] <io2> oh right
[15:07:03] <Zoxc> hi #rust-osdev =P
[15:07:12] <Tuba> of course I didn't use a lot of C++ features but C++11 stuff is really nice
[15:07:12] <scott> it's fun to design everything yourself
[15:07:12] <io2> scott: awefull stdlibs +1
[15:07:15] <Tuba> lambdas etc
[15:07:27] *** Tuba is now known as Tobba
[15:07:29] <eddyb> io2: I've got the USB virtual inheritance diamond to show that C++ can do pretty useful things in kernel-space :P
[15:07:51] <io2> eddyb: I am only saying that it is a waste of time to do a kernel in C++ since you have successful kernels in C already
[15:07:56] <eddyb> ah
[15:08:00] <eddyb> io2: but Rust wasn't a thing at the time
[15:08:06] <io2> you don't have any benefit over changing with the ++ over C
[15:08:13] <io2> of course
[15:08:31] <eddyb> I'll take C++ over C any day tyvm
[15:08:39] <io2> Rust would present the opportunity to have a full functional system core that would interface better with today's programming advances
[15:08:49] <io2> well, I am not disputing that
[15:09:01] <Tobba> I think my OS is becoming pretty nice
[15:09:03] <io2> I am saying that if you have linux as a successful C based kernel
[15:09:03] <Tobba> it just needs a lot more work
[15:09:06] <eddyb> but maybe that's because I'm the kind of person to abuse a language to get something nice out of it
[15:09:23] <io2> why should you redo a linux like kernel in C++? do it in another, different language from C/C++
[15:09:25] <eddyb> Tobba: doesn't everything?
[15:09:48] <Tobba> well, it's hideously incomplete and kinda hacked together atm
[15:09:55] <Tobba> I'm trying to remove a lot of the hackiness so I can get on with functionality

[15:11:10] <eddyb> Rust isn't *a* FP though
[15:11:33] <eddyb> it has functional elements, but not definitory characteristics
[15:11:34] <scott> the part I find hard to imagine is a new general purpose Linux-competitor kernel arising at all
[15:11:45] <scott> I mean, it has to happen eventually, presumably
[15:11:53] <lahwran> I can only imagine it happening incrementally
[15:11:57] <eddyb> scott: Linux is a general-purpose UNIX competitor :P
[15:12:04] <scott> but the trend right now is having _less_ competitors
[15:12:11] <scott> non-Linux Unixes are dying
[15:12:27] <eddyb> well, was
[15:12:28] <scott> Windows is shrinking under Microsoft's incompetence
[15:12:32] <eddyb> in the early 90's
[15:12:56] <Tobba> linux has taken over a lot of the service space
[15:13:04] <Tobba> but windows still reigns in desktops
[15:13:06] <lahwran> the main two ways I can imagine it happening are A: slowly turn linux into something else; and B: do one thing better than linux, be only useful to those people who need that specific thing done well; then do two things better than linux...
[15:13:38] <scott> Tobba: yeah, it's just showing signs of beginning to lose on the desktop (slowly), and on top of that, desktops in general are losing popularity
[15:13:50] <Tobba> though that might change now that someone realized "year of the linux desktop" isnt happening until people figure out UI design and UX
[15:14:04] <scott> lahwran: yeah, I think you need to capture some niche really well, and then expand from there
[15:14:06] *** Quits: sugaku (sugaku@moz-9b0g1c.dsl.bell.ca) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[15:14:18] <lahwran> yeah that seems like a viable way to beat it
[15:14:22] <lahwran> it's what linux did in the first place, after all
[15:14:33] <scott> UX is definitely a sore point for open source projects
[15:14:45] <lahwran> and it's hilarious how bad open source people are at UX
[15:14:59] <lahwran> they seem to be *actively opposed* to the idea, and can't even recognize compromises in their favor
[15:15:12] <lahwran> but then there are the few
[15:15:14] <lahwran> the ones who want good ux
[15:15:23] <lahwran> but have no idea how to do it, so they just oversimplify unintelligently
[15:15:59] <lahwran> meanwhile, almost everyone good at ux is working on commercial software
[15:16:26] <Tobba> I guess you do kinda get what you pay for
[15:16:28] <lahwran> that said, ubuntu 14.x really impressed me
[15:16:33] <lahwran> Tobba: seriously
[15:17:58] <scott> I could get my parents set up happily on Ubuntu, I bet
[15:18:09] <lahwran> though apparently canonical is deep in the red
[15:18:14] <Tobba> yeah ubuntu is looking pretty good now
[15:18:17] <scott> my dad is reasonably tech savvy and, well, everyone does everything in the browser these days anyway
[15:18:27] <scott> most people would be happy with a chromebook
[15:18:31] <Tobba> I thought canonical was doing good due to support agreements / vendors using it

[15:20:53] <lahwran> oh huh seems they're doing okay
[15:21:16] <scott> I'm waiting to see if ubuntu mobile stuff will amount to anything
[15:21:23] <lahwran> my bet is on no
[15:21:46] <Tobba> currently it drains battery like a madman iirc
[15:21:59] <lahwran> same with firefox - it was wildly amazing that google managed to pull off android
[15:22:10] <scott> I'd like to see some mobile platform where native code is the standard interface (as opposed to requiring Java or Obj-C or whatever the fuck)
[15:22:11] <lahwran> I don't really see anyone pulling that off in the consumer market again
[15:22:28] <lahwran> scott: there's a reason it isn't though
[15:22:31] <scott> there are some people doing Linux-based phones that aren't Android but no one is paying attention to them though
[15:22:33] <lahwran> arm cpus vary like mad
[15:22:51] <Tobba> there are MIPS phones etc as well
[15:22:51] <scott> people still use native code on android, though
[15:22:54] <scott> for games and such
[15:23:00] <Tobba> and I think intel want to make x86 phones (which is a horrible idea but whatever)
[15:23:03] <lahwran> and as a result are meaningfully less compatible
[15:23:07] <scott> but they still have to have an ugly Java glue thing
[15:23:13] <lahwran> not much
[15:23:22] <lahwran> in fact I think you can even do it without the java glue
[15:23:31] <lahwran> the rust opengl thing hinted at it

[15:24:12] <scott> the thing is, if you start with a good native code base, you can have the ART VM there, too
[15:24:20] <scott> it can be built on top of the same thing
[15:25:03] <scott> they need that stuff there regardless, for their own abstractions, they just make it harder for the third party developers to deal with it
[15:26:32] <Tobba> I wish they took PNaCl code
[15:26:53] <scott> I wonder if that might actually come to be
[15:27:01] <scott> Google seems inclined to merge Android and ChromeOS
[15:27:06] <scott> if they can
[15:27:15] <GaryOak_> iOS style
[15:27:18] <lahwran> to be honest it seems kind of odd that they were separate
[15:27:20] <scott> I think there's already some support for running Android stuff on ChromeOS
[15:27:27] <scott> it's probably all planned out
[15:27:35] <lahwran> oh wait I actually know why it was separate
[15:27:43] <lahwran> it's because android has absolutely awful support for actual pointers
[15:28:02] <scott> to the extent that Google actually plans anything
[15:28:02] <lahwran> technically android has support for it but since basically no device has supported it in ages, apps don't try to make it work
[15:32:07] <scott> and then ChromeOS had awful touchscreen support in the beginning (not sure if it's better now)
