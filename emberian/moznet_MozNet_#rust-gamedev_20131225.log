[00:19:40] <darthdeus> hey guys, what library do you recommend i start with? or to be specific, which one is the most stable and compiles the easiest? i've just tried checking out rust-sdl but it doesn't compile on master on my machine
[00:19:50] <darthdeus> i don't really have any preferences
[00:21:25] <cmr> darthdeus: for what?
[00:21:37] <darthdeus> for 2d game dev :)
[00:22:28] <cmr> looks like rust-sdl2 is building
[00:22:36] <cmr> the travis badge says no but the travis log says yes
[00:25:36] <darthdeus> hm interesting, this page says it's failing https://github.com/mozilla/rust/wiki/Computer-Graphics-and-Game-Development but travis shows it passed
[00:25:46] <cmr> I did just say that :P
[00:28:12] <darthdeus> my bad :P
[00:28:31] <speckle> so sdl2 is recommended?
[00:35:56] *** Quits: FrozenCow (FrozenCow@moz-B2DF4929.chello.nl) (Client exited)
[00:38:08] <darthdeus> https://github.com/AngryLawyer/rust-sdl2/pull/28 seems to fail for me here
[00:41:04] <darthdeus> even though it passes better than master
[00:41:09] <darthdeus> on rust-sdl2
[00:43:56] <darthdeus> but i did manage to compile glfw-rs :)
[00:45:44] <cmr> darthdeus: https://github.com/AngryLawyer/rust-sdl2/pull/29
[00:45:48] <cmr> glfw won't help you with 2d
[00:46:17] <speckle> really? I thought that you could use OpenGL for 2D
[00:46:22] <cmr> sure
[00:46:27] <cmr> but you need to write the renderer yourself.
[00:46:43] <speckle> it helps since it abstracts away platform differences, gives you a window, and gives you vsync
[00:46:56] <darthdeus> cmr: ha it builds now, thanks :)
[00:47:05] <cmr> I don't recommend it to start with, though.
[00:47:07] <speckle> but you need to implement the whole 2D engine on top, yeah
[00:47:08] <rsaarelm> Doing 2d on OpenGL is pretty much the way to go these days. You can get smoothly rotating elements for one thing.
[00:47:09] <cmr> Certainly not the easiest
[00:47:22] <rsaarelm> It's not like SDL will help you along any more.
[00:47:30] <speckle> rsaarelm, not sure that's useful if you just want sprite graphics
[00:47:42] <speckle> but I do like the vsync
[00:47:47] <rsaarelm> (I dropped SDL2 when I noticed it's not doing audio yet, going to try to do stuff with GLFW + PortAudio)
[00:50:35] <darthdeus> i guess i'll go with sdl for now, since i'm really really noob at this and just want to get some basic things moving/drawing :]
[00:52:27] <speckle> tbh, maybe it's easier to do it in a more mature language first
[00:52:44] <speckle> I love the idea of Rust, but I can't imagine using it if I were just starting to program
[00:53:24] <cmr> it's neither designed for nor suitable for beginners.
[00:53:58] <rsaarelm> C# might be better to start with if you're really a beginner, don't have to worry about the moving target language, immature libraries or the memory handling arcana.
[00:54:25] <speckle> C# == platform lockin so I'd go with Python or Java maybe
[00:54:36] <cmr> No, it doesn't == platform lock in.
[00:54:42] <cmr> Mono is a thing and it works quite well.
[00:55:35] <rsaarelm> Java is about equally good, but I find it a bit clumsier language. Maybe it's simpler too though.
[00:55:51] <rsaarelm> Python is a bit easy to run into performance difficulties with if you try to do anything more ambitious with it.
[00:56:05] <rsaarelm> But also good for beginners otherwise.
[00:56:06] <cmr> (and pygame has a garbage API and docs)
[00:56:26] <rsaarelm> Also, might have a longer way to go from Python to Rust than from C#/Java to Rust.
[00:57:27] <darthdeus> speckle: i'm not starting to program, i've been doing mobile/web apps for 6 years professionally :D i just never done anything in c/c++/rust and anything in game dev or graphics :)
[00:57:28] <speckle> C# works on non-MS-blessed platforms, but the toolchain doesn't feel as mature as for languages that are cross-platform from the start.  Maybe I just haven't found a good C# IDE for Linux, dunno.
[00:57:48] <speckle> Java has IntelliJ which is nice and free
[00:58:11] <speckle> Well, the free version is enough for me at least.
[00:58:30] <rsaarelm> I just use a text editor for everything.
[00:58:42] <speckle> which one? :)
[00:58:51] <rsaarelm> Been stuck too much with weird languages that don't have any IDEs to begin with.
[00:58:58] <rsaarelm> Vim.
[00:59:16] <rsaarelm> Used to use Emacs for years because of org-mode, but then something snapped in my head and I was back using Vim.
[00:59:18] <speckle> vim and emacs pretty much *are* the best IDE for some languages, with a bit of setup work
[00:59:59] <speckle> But I can't see them measuring up to Visual Studio for C#, maybe hardcore Linux users will disagree though.
[01:00:43] <rsaarelm> Can't really beat intellisense when you're working with other people's code, no.
[01:00:58] <rsaarelm> But the text editor approach works fine when I do my own projects.
[01:01:27] <speckle> yeah, I guess.
[01:02:11] <speckle> darthdeus, maybe you could try working with C a little bit.  Then come back to Rust when you learn pointers and memory management (and get bitten by their problems :))
[01:02:38] <speckle> C's libraries are very mature, at the least.
[01:02:59] <cmr> I think that's a good idea but only because C is simple (by some metrics) and has more learning material out there
[01:03:18] <speckle> Yeah.  Rust might be more newbie friendly than C in the future, when it gets more mature.
[01:03:28] <speckle> But not yet, when you have to debug all the bindings as you use them.
[01:03:34] <darthdeus> hmmm
[01:03:49] <darthdeus> i guess i should just use javascript and canvas
[01:03:58] <darthdeus> even though that's kinda lame, but zero setup
[01:04:00] <cmr> or any of its game libs
[01:05:02] <speckle> That *really* abstracts away low level programming issues, but I guess you'll at least get graphics experience
[01:06:04] <speckle> I think it's about as far from Rust as you could get :/
[01:06:23] <cmr> nah, could be using smalltalk or a lisp :p
[01:06:38] <darthdeus> or haskell ... that would be fun
[01:07:11] <rsaarelm> I've picked up lots and lots of programming languages for some random tinkering around, and I can say that Rust has been one of the more tricky ones to get a handle on. Figuring out what an idiomatic way to do stuff is supposed to be isn't easy.
[01:07:38] <rsaarelm> Figuring out how to actually think in monads in Haskell probably has Rust beat though.
[01:08:06] <rsaarelm> But compared to Rust, Go, for example, was basically pretty close to just pick up and run with it.
[01:08:25] <cmr> That's also one of Go's design considerations though
[01:08:31] <rsaarelm> Yep.
[01:08:51] <darthdeus> yeah i've used Go to write a small web service and it was really trivial to get going in a couple of hours ... but after a day digging in rust i'm really struggling
[01:08:59] <darthdeus> monads are easy compared to it imho :D
[01:09:05] <darthdeus> but maybe i'm not just used to the low level stuff
[01:09:17] <rsaarelm> Yeah, I did come in knowing C and C++.
[01:09:53] <speckle> darthdeus, are you struggling to use Rust period, or are you struggling to use alpha-quality graphics library bindings that fail half the time?
[01:10:17] <darthdeus> speckle: maybe a bit of both :P
[01:10:23] <rsaarelm> Also seconding on the idea to maybe try to learn some C. The learning materials are hugely better, and other systems languages are mostly just C with stuff on top.
[01:11:00] <rsaarelm> As in, you can make sense of the stuff without magic going on if you know your C and figure out how the thing in the higher level language reduces back to C.
[01:11:31] <speckle> the idiomatic stuff gives me a hard time too - I figure out how to do something in Python for instance, then spend 10 times more time figuring out how to make it "Pythonic"
[01:11:51] <speckle> for Rust I'm still learning the basics though :p
[01:13:16] <speckle> I think the best solution is to stop worrying so much about idiomatic code, and just be ready to fix it later when it bites you
[01:13:42] <speckle> premature refactoring can make a mess of one's code
[01:13:58] <rsaarelm> 1) Write shit that does stuff 2) Figure out it was all wrong and rewrite everything now that you know how stuff can get done.
[01:14:59] <speckle> Yeah, there's not always much point in trying to rewrite it before it even works.  If it doesn't seem obvious, you can just leave it alone for now.
