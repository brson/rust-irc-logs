[00:31:12] <ktt3ja> is this issue https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/10039 in middle::borrowck?
[00:32:19] <cmr> maybe, in infer?
[00:34:37] <Luqman> it'd be an addition to adjustments no?
[00:36:27] <ktt3ja> so infer refers to `middle::typeck::infer`, but where's "adjustments"?
[00:36:57] <Luqman> the auto slice/[de]ref/borrowing stuff we already do
[00:37:04] <cmr> ahh
[00:40:12] <Luqman> here is the old patch pcwalton had https://github.com/pcwalton/rust/commit/e7073edaa72edf747f20f6d06daea21b3848ef06
[00:40:29] <Luqman> seems like he added a new adjustment kind, AutoObject

[00:55:05] <klutzy> cmr: pong
[00:55:25] <cmr> klutzy: why does the .lines() iterator on Buffer keep the newlines?
[00:56:27] *** Quits: bytewise (bytewise@moz-6F896CFA.adsl.alicedsl.de) (Quit: Leaving)
[00:56:49] <klutzy> cmr: no big intention. I just tought it would be confusing not to behave like .read_line()
[00:57:02] <cmr> why does read_line keep the newline too? :P
[00:57:09] <cmr> I find this very unexpected.
[00:57:12] <klutzy> then I have no idea :p
[00:58:04] <klutzy> yep, python works in a similar way (iter(string.splitlines()) / iter(file)) and it is confusing
[00:58:44] <ChrisMorgan> cmr: it's consistent with things like Python's file iteration, which yields lines including the line break.
[00:59:00] <cmr> .split('\n') doesn't give me the separator, I wouldn't expect anything to give me the line endings.
[00:59:35] <cmr> the only way I can see it making sense is if you want it to be valid to join all of the returned strings to get the original contents of the file back
[00:59:37] <carter> acrichto: should I repush wiht a cleaned up commit message?
[01:00:27] <ChrisMorgan> Of course, one must remember that "line breaks" does not necessarily mean \n. On Windows, it means \r\n, and on old Macs, it means \r.
[01:00:42] <ChrisMorgan> There's also the fun of whether a file has a trailing EOL or not.
[01:03:35] <acrichto> carter: if you want, sure, but I'm also ok with it as-is
[01:03:44] <carter> oh, i already repushed :)

[05:15:27] <klutzy> acrichto: if llvmdeps.rs has \r\n it fails to find license :p
[05:15:44] <acrichto> strcat: hm, maybe it can't be optimized to a memcpy then?
[05:15:48] <acrichto> klutzy: :(
[05:16:00] <strcat> acrichto: well it can be if the vector representation wasn't like it is atm
[05:16:31] <carter> wooo, first patch
[05:16:44] <dbaupp> carter: \o/
[05:17:03] <carter> strcat: what vector rep?
[05:17:20] <carter> dbaupp: thankee
[05:17:21] <strcat> rust currently has a very bad representation for unique vectors
[05:17:32] <carter> edumacate me?
[05:17:36] <strcat> ptr -> { len_in_bytes, capacity_in_bytes, data[] }
[05:17:51] <strcat> rather than a sane { len, cap, *data }
[05:17:54] <carter> cap?
[05:18:02] <strcat> capacity
[05:18:11] <strcat> measured in elements though
[05:18:16] <dbaupp> carter: https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/8981 re vector representation
[05:18:20] <carter> how are len and cap are dedifferent?
[05:18:44] <strcat> carter: because pushing is an amortized O(1) operation
[05:18:55] <carter> pushing?
[05:18:55] <strcat> when the capacity is full and you push, it doubles the capacity
[05:18:59] <carter> ohh
[05:19:15] <carter> so its c++ style vectors
[05:19:27] <strcat> ring buffers extend it to O(1) push_front/pop_front and O(1) push_back/pop_back
[05:19:45] <carter> also the latter plays nicer with slicing right?
[05:20:01] <strcat> carter: yes, atm conversion to a slice does a division
[05:20:07] <carter> a division?
[05:20:10] <carter> oh
[05:20:16] <carter> umm, explain?
[05:20:25] <strcat> carter: because ~[T] stores length in bytes
[05:20:50] <strcat> and slices are (ptr, length_in_elements) (as they should be!)
[05:21:06] <strcat> to do a bounds check, you need to compare the length against the index and do a ptr offset
[05:21:23] <carter> yuck
[05:21:29] <strcat> if you had length in bytes, you'd have to divide it by the element length and then compare
[05:21:36] <carter> noooooooooo
[05:22:33] <strcat> the division is by a constant so it'll probably optimize down to something saner at least
[05:22:40] <carter> you'd hope
[05:22:56] <strcat> carter: anyway, for an idea of how slow ~[T] is, a dead simple/naive vector implementation from scratch has 7x faster push
[05:23:02] <strcat> and you can do better.
[05:23:06] <Yurume> strcat: wait a min, but the successful indexing should do the constant multiplication anyway, shouldn't it?
[05:23:25] <strcat> Yurume: you always have to do a ptr offset
[05:23:51] <strcat> the ptr offset could go past the end and overflow if it was out of bounds
[05:24:24] <klutzy> acrichto: my msys automatically converts \n into \r\n for `python -c "print 1; print 2" > tmp`
[05:24:25] <Yurume> yeah, one should calculate (ptr + index * element_size), so there is no obstacle to store length_in_bytes instead of length_in_elements in a slice
[05:24:40] <klutzy> acrichto: maybe buildbot uses other msys (from msysgit?) with no such issue
[05:24:43] <Yurume> am I missing something here?
[05:24:56] <strcat> Yurume: bounds checking, and other comparisons against length
[05:25:02] <strcat> the bounds check needs to compare in element length
[05:25:51] <Yurume> doesn't delayed bounds check (after the calculation above) work?
[05:26:02] <strcat> it can overflow
[05:26:05] <Yurume> ah
[05:26:27] <strcat> rust used to do it that way, and if you passed a very large index it could overflow and end up in bounds
[05:26:39] <strcat> so it wasn't unsafe, but it was semantically wrong
[05:27:01] <acrichto> klutzy: perhaps? it could also just write the file directly
[05:27:26] <strcat> Yurume: since if you pass 'index', it'd need to multiply that index by the element length, and that may overflow to a number that's in-bounds
[05:27:35] <Yurume> right
[05:27:49] <Yurume> it now makes sense
[05:27:55] <strcat> anyway afaict element length is the based way to store it
[05:28:08] <strcat> byte length gives you two things
[05:28:20] <strcat> 1) cheaper calculation when you need to call malloc (useless)
[05:28:32] <strcat> 2) no-op transmutes between slices of different kinds
[05:28:34] <strcat> like
[05:28:39] <strcat> a u32 slice to a u8 slice
[05:28:43] <strcat> without a division of the length
[05:28:48] <strcat> but.... it moves that cost elsewhere
[05:29:05] <strcat> C aliasing rules don't allow stuff like that except for casts to char * anyway
[05:29:06] <Yurume> right, having two sets of conventions for ~[T] and &[T] hurts but makes sense in that way.
[05:29:20] <strcat> Yurume: well ~[T] should really store in element length too
[05:29:25] <strcat> and it shouldn't do the weird header mess 
[05:29:29] <Yurume> ;)
[05:29:54] <strcat> Yurume: https://github.com/thestinger/rust-core/blob/master/core/vec.rs this is pretty close to as good as it'll get
[05:29:55] <acrichto> <3 ulimit -c unlimited
[05:30:00] <strcat> cooperating with the allocator helps too
[05:30:51] <strcat> anyway sadly you can't represent allocators at all in rust atm
[05:30:55] <strcat> need generic dtors to work
[05:31:07] <strcat> and you need default type parameters to avoid it being a PITA
[05:32:05] <strcat> acrichto: http://news.php.net/php.internals/70691 lets just be glad rust isn't designed like this
[05:32:37] <acrichto> welp
[05:33:50] <acrichto> maybe I should open an issue about specifying inline weights based on the length of the name of the function
[05:33:58] <strcat> :D
[05:34:18] <strcat> functions with woody names should be inlined
[05:34:22] <ChrisMorgan> Oh, PHP, PHP… when hope is dead, why linger on? Why tarry thou a while?

[05:41:00] <jack> acrichto: did you snapshot land?
[05:41:32] <jack> it looked like it did since the link metadata seemed to have disappeared from master, but the pkgid-with-name PR failed not being able to find libstd
[05:41:35] <acrichto> jack: it did indeed, although it got out of date a little bit
[05:41:39] <acrichto> jdm: thanks!
[05:42:35] <strcat> oh and if someone ever asks why rust uses traits
[05:42:41] <strcat> give them http://ix.io/9o8 and tell them to compile with g++ ;p
[05:42:45] <strcat> 8.5MiB of output!

[05:43:02] <jack> hah!
[05:43:19] <strcat> although clang handles it pretty well ;p
[05:43:20] <jack> it's trying to name it rust. of course i'll switch it back.
[05:43:27] <jack> maybe that's what you meant in your review comment

[12:23:47] <cmr> dbaupp: hrm, how did that happen.
[12:23:59] <dbaupp> cmr: magic!
[12:27:06] <dbaupp> cmr: I had a correct build from a master about 24hours old, iirc.
[12:28:37] <dbaupp> it broke with https://github.com/mozilla/rust/commit/47c9a35747e9a15830e35924429050b820825f5d
[12:28:49] <dbaupp> based on http://buildbot.rust-lang.org/builders/doc
[12:29:47] <cmr> that's truly unfortunate.
[12:32:01] <dbaupp> yup :(
[12:34:26] <cmr> that's pretty hilarious actually.
[12:34:35] <dbaupp> in what way?

[12:36:59] <dbaupp> I guess so
[12:55:41] <mrmonday> how do you guys compile when you make quick one-line changes to libstd/librustuv/etc? I'm currently just using `make` and it takes forever with it doing a full bootstrap etc
[12:56:03] <dbaupp> mrmonday: `make check-stage1-std NO_REBUILD=1`
[12:56:18] <dbaupp> or `rustc libstd/lib.rs`
[12:57:23] <mrmonday> the former still takes several minutes it would seem; and I can't seem to get the latter to work (for rustuv anyway, needs a -L in there which I can't figure out)
[12:58:01] <dbaupp> oh
[12:58:17] <dbaupp> you could also run `make VERBOSE=1` and copy the invocation for libstd
[13:00:28] <mrmonday> that sounds like an idea

[20:14:16] <Eridius> regarding `use crate`: this does involve reserving yet another keyword. and FWIW, it's a keyword that's already being used as the name of a mod (rustpkg::crate)

[20:20:29] <Eridius> acrichto, brson: ^
[20:20:53] <acrichto> Eridius: I feel like that doesn't convey "crate" enough
[20:21:19] <Eridius> acrichto: I'm not sure why "crate" needs to be emphasized
[20:21:22] <acrichto> it's also still conflating the idea where use is purely used to bring things in scope and linking to a crate is a declaration of a name
[20:21:35] <Eridius> that's the same problem `use crate` has
[20:21:59] <acrichto> that's why we decided against use crate
[20:22:00] <Eridius> I don't think `extern use` is perfect, but I think it's better than `use crate`, and not just because it doesn't use any new keywords
[20:22:07] <acrichto> the current populare opinion is 'extern crate foo'
[20:22:11] <Eridius> oh? the meeting notes made it sound like `use crate` was likely to win
[20:22:23] <acrichto> hm those may need to be updated then
[20:22:31] <Eridius> e.g.
[20:22:31] <Eridius> acrichto: of crate, extern crate and use crate i like use crate the best.
[20:22:59] <acrichto> we decided against that though because it's conflating too much with the purpose of use

[20:23:08] <acrichto> use brings things into scope, that is not what use crate is doing
[20:23:29] <Eridius> `extern crate foo` is certainly better than `use crate foo`. My only real objection to `extern crate foo` is the reservation of a new limited-scope keyword
[20:23:59] <acrichto> it's one of those things which is unfortunate, but we currently don't have a good replacement suggestion
[20:24:18] <Eridius> on the upside, this usage of "crate" has the possibility of being made contextual (which I still want for "in")

[20:31:30] <cmr> I really think crate shouldn't be a reserved word, if it's used like that.
[20:31:43] <cmr> That's just a waste for no reason.
[20:32:11] <Eridius> cmr: that's my thought
[20:32:29] <Eridius> if we want to do this we really should just introduce contextual keywords
[20:34:16] <cmr> well I don'tthink we need to do it in general, and I'm fine with leaving in as-is.
[20:34:24] <cmr> but for `extern crate` it's just silly.

[22:14:58] <jld> acrichto: pong
[22:15:26] <acrichto> jld: I've noticed that the type declarations of an enum include padding, but the constant values of enums do not include padding, is there a reason for this/
[22:16:50] <jld> acrichto: ...maybe.  Trying to swap in that part of my brain....
[22:16:59] <acrichto> hehe, no worries
[22:17:51] <jld> There was something weird about consts...
[22:18:17] <jld> Oh, right.  Enum consts have to be padded up to the full enum size when the actual variant is smaller, because they can be embedded in something else.
[22:18:44] <jld> *And* the enum const layout code has to insert padding to use the type's alignment, not the value's.
[22:19:11] <acrichto> hm
[22:19:20] <acrichto> %enum.A = type { i8, [7 x i8], [1 x i64] }
[22:19:22] <jld> I *think* I commented that.  Or at least mentioned it in a commit message.
[22:19:28] <acrichto> @foo = constant { i8, i64, [0 x i8] } { i8 0, i64 3, [0 x i8] undef }
[22:19:35] <acrichto> why does @foo not have padding?
[22:19:44] <acrichto> the [7 x i8]
[22:19:52] <acrichto> maybe I should read comments
[22:20:00] <jld> So, the other part of that are the new no-holes enum types.
[22:20:18] <jld> And I know there's a comment about that.

[22:23:50] <jld> Also, when I said "the enum const layout code has to insert padding", I mean enums and structs and tuples and pretty much anything that puts data of different arbitrary types in sequence.
[22:24:07] <jld> Which, now that I think of it, was one of the reasons for breaking out adt.rs.
