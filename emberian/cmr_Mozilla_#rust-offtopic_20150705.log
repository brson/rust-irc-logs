[01:55:09] <eddyb> zwarich: and this structure stores 3 concatenated vectors, one for each "space" https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/librustc/middle/subst.rs#L212

[01:56:15] <eddyb> it's not exactly cheap and there's no wasy way to build the damn thing from iterators without reallocating everywhere and while ensuring each value goes in the right "space"
[01:56:45] <eddyb> zwarich: and I was wondering whether de Bruijn indices would help here
[01:56:57] <eddyb> niko was away this week so he hasn't replied yet
[01:57:12] <eddyb> zwarich: something tells me HKT might have to use them
[01:57:39] <eddyb> and what we have is *kinda* like HKT, just limted to 2 levels + 1 Self
[01:58:02] <zwarich> eddyb: I am somewhat curious why HKT is so difficult
[01:58:24] <eddyb> me too
[01:58:40] <eddyb> I expect the hardest part to be plumbing it throughout the compiler
[01:58:53] <eddyb> implicit assumptions
[01:58:58] <eddyb> the entirety of trans :P
[01:59:11] <eddyb> (though it's gotten better)
[02:00:15] <eddyb> zwarich: so I'm thinking... we go back to "unchecked" indexes into a single substitutions vector, wrapped in a struct with a #[cfg] field that would hold an interned "layout" pointer

[02:01:12] <eddyb> basically a vector with a number of formal parameters for each "space"
[02:01:22] <eddyb> (which could grow with HKT)
[02:02:04] <eddyb> and when it's enabled, it's checked during substitution, to make sure the type parameter is compatible with it
[02:02:45] <eddyb> e.g. you don't want an index of 1 in TypeSpace to give you the first value in FnSpace just because TypeSpace isn't >= 2
[02:02:54] <eddyb> but you also don't want to be checking it all the time
[02:03:03] <eddyb> zwarich: tradeoffs!
[02:03:49] <eddyb> > Each De Bruijn index is a natural number that represents an occurrence of a variable in a λ-term, and denotes the number of binders that are in scope between that occurrence and its corresponding binder
[02:04:03] <eddyb> so I'm assuming "binder" here could be the spaces
[02:04:18] <eddyb> (we have a ty::Binder wrapper for HRTB and sometimes it's a bit silly to use)
[02:06:47] <eddyb> zwarich: I might have thought of de Bruijn indices as something magical, I'm reading the wikipedia page again and it seems to be just the number of binders betwee - OH
[02:07:06] <eddyb> zwarich: yeah. I thought "denotes" meant "magically stores" instead of "is equal to"
[02:07:15] <zwarich> eddyb: yeah, it's nothing magical, just a nice way to avoid considering renaming
[02:07:49] <eddyb> so we kinda used to do this :P. except in reverse
[02:08:21] <eddyb> that's an interesting thought: trait Trait<A, B> { fn foo<X, Y>(self); } stored as [X, Y, Self, A, B]
[02:08:35] <zwarich> eddyb: this is clearly da best http://gallium.inria.fr/~remy/mlf/mlfc-iceland.pdf
[02:09:22] <eddyb> that method and a fn foo<X, Y>() {} have indistinguishable X and Y
[02:09:44] *** Quits: ipetkov (ipetkov@moz-2v9vq9.oc.cox.net) (Client exited)
[02:09:50] <eddyb> which means you could add e.g. modules with type parameters and the nesting would be rightward in the substitution vector
[02:10:22] <eddyb> it kinda makes some sense, but we don't exactly have a "binder" per type param
[02:10:51] <zwarich> Rust's module system is :-/
[02:11:15] <zwarich> it has both modules and crates, and crates aren't actually units of separate compilation
[02:11:48] <eddyb> > Function parameters that are used polymorphically and only those need an annotation.
[02:11:54] <eddyb> ^^ that's my view on HKT
[02:12:04] <eddyb> and type lambdas
[02:12:23] <eddyb> no inference of higher-kinded anything
[02:12:31] <zwarich> eddyb: well, the type inference in that link is for higher-rank types, the inference situation for higher-kinded types might be worse
[02:13:11] <eddyb> we already screw up with closures used as e.g. for<'a> Fn(&'a T) -> &'a U
[02:14:21] <eddyb> we could kinda guess by the fact a bound requires it to work for any lifetime and force the closure to have `for<'a>` (which is not valid syntax so you can't just fix it yourself, you have to write a function. and that only works if you have no captures)
[02:15:09] <zwarich> I now realize that I don't really understand how closure types work in Rust
[02:15:19] <zwarich> all this stuff changed before 1.0 when I didn't care anymore :P
[02:16:35] <eddyb> zwarich: they're like anonymous structs packing their captures and implementing one or more of the Fn/FnMut/FnOnce traits
[02:17:29] <eddyb> if you have a fn foo<T, U, F: for<'a> FnOnce(&'a T) -> &'a U>(x: &T, f: F) -> &U { f(x) }
[02:18:17] <eddyb> you can call it a closure e.g. foo(&(0, 1), |pair| &pair.0) and it will work
[02:18:36] <eddyb> Rust will determine that the closure does indeed work forall lifetimes 'a
[02:18:47] <eddyb> zwarich: but it doesn't always work out
[02:20:42] <eddyb> zwarich: like here https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/librustc_typeck/check/mod.rs#L1553-L1562

[02:32:11] <eddyb> this is what I get for checking things at 5am
[02:33:09] <eddyb> zwarich: hmm. rustc's inference context already uses kind of a graph of relations between type variables
[02:33:36] <zwarich> eddyb: it probably uses a union-find data structure to implement unification
[02:33:52] <eddyb> I guess this graphical types stuff combines that with the regular types and adds more stuff on top
[02:33:58] <eddyb> zwarich: you're right
[02:34:13] <eddyb> now I'm not sure whether that's it or there's more
[02:34:18] <eddyb> oh screw it my brain hurts
[02:35:09] <eddyb> whoa coercions

[02:36:17] <eddyb> well that was a fun "read" (I still have no idea what the symbols represent)
[02:37:47] <eddyb> zwarich: niko does want to split type-checking into "constraint collection" and some of fixpoint propagation algorithm
[02:38:47] <zwarich> eddyb: I asked him about that a year ago, he seemed unsure that constraint generation could be separated from solving
[02:39:24] <zwarich> eddyb: in general you want to do this if you wan good error messages
[02:39:38] <eddyb> I'll try to remember to pass that graphical stuff by him (he should at least know it exists already, unless it's really recent)
[02:39:51] <eddyb> also cc jroesch

[02:41:06] <eddyb> zwarich: having a cool compiler is important :P
[02:41:20] <zwarich> eddyb: there are two papers in PLDI 2015 on giving better type inference errors
[02:41:38] <eddyb> (blame resolution i.e. no way to really tell what introduced a nasty constraint that everything else disagrees with)
[02:41:42] <eddyb> zwarich: oh oh oh
[02:41:47] <zwarich> not sure how well they would extend to subtyping

[02:42:12] <aatch> Type inference errors seem to be a common topic for people. I had a friend that did his honours project on type inference errors in Haskell.
[02:42:16] <zwarich> the more practical of the two uses Bayesian inference to try to find the constraint to blame
[02:42:29] <eddyb> keep in mind this isn't for type inference but region inference

[02:43:58] <zwarich> eddyb: region inference is basically just a type inference problem
[02:44:03] <eddyb> that example in the video is exactly the kind of shit I'm used to seeing from regionck
[02:44:13] <eddyb> zwarich: yeah but it's somewhat reduced
[02:44:37] <eddyb> you only have one kind of concrete region, more or less
[02:45:01] <eddyb> and then some parametrism and inference with subtyping relationships
[02:45:33] <eddyb> Bool is not numeric. in my case it was that some stack value doesn't live for 'static
[02:46:07] <eddyb> because in another branch of a conditional, I was creating an InvariantOver<'static> (there were no references inside and the invariance was a limitation of Rust at the time)
[02:46:48] <eddyb> the solution was to make that specific function generic over the lifetime, but I couldn't find the call because it was blaming the local variable which had the lifetime I wanted for all cases anyways
[02:46:54] <zwarich> eddyb: concrete regions will get more fun with no lexicology

[04:57:38] <eddyb> *machines even
[04:58:03] <eddyb> Gankro: the way I design such a thing is make sure I can make progress with every single byte
[04:58:22] <eddyb> translating an implementation from another language doesn't really work unless it's already streaming and resumable
[04:58:47] <Gankro> It was C
[04:58:57] <Gankro> And definitely built to be one-shot
[04:59:28] <Gankro> At least it's only frobbing bytes
[04:59:40] <eddyb> did you use Read?
[04:59:49] <Gankro> Yeah
[05:00:19] <Gankro> I'm mostly just frozen in terror
[05:00:33] <eddyb> so you have a pull decoder converted from C
[05:00:40] <eddyb> and you need a push (streaming) decoder
[05:01:04] <Gankro> I'm pretty sure I can just fudge it and make a degenerate testing stream that yields EOF after every byte
[05:01:20] <Gankro> to verify it works
[05:01:20] <eddyb> yeah, but that's not how streaming decoders work :P
[05:01:46] <Gankro> ?
[05:02:15] <eddyb> you don't want to pull bytes from Read, you want to push bytes into a state machine
[05:02:47] <Gankro> That seems like a meaningless distinction
[05:02:57] <eddyb> until you implement it
[05:03:07] <Gankro> Also only the state machine knows when bytes are needed...?
[05:03:34] <eddyb> this is not the first or the second time I've seen someone having to rewrite a big chunk of code from scratch because they started with Read
[05:03:42] <Gankro> Well, something outside the state machine can trivially walk the bytes
[05:03:44] <eddyb> and it keeps happening
[05:03:58] <eddyb> Gankro: the state machine returns the number of bytes processed
[05:04:47] <eddyb> after each state transition. preferably you should be able to consume every last byte from an arbitrary slice
[05:05:39] <eddyb> Gankro: with generators you could write code similar to using Read (but not quite) and get a state machine
[05:08:34] <eddyb> oh I think I came up with a pretty neat system for doing concurrent non-atomic reads and writes to an image buffer
[05:08:42] <eddyb> (interlaced with Adam7)
[05:09:42] <eddyb> it means I have to exit the state loop for every interlace transition but that should be negligible
[05:11:22] <eddyb> the important part is that the buffer only allows transactional access via closures
[05:11:50] <eddyb> and the writable handle has a start offset and an interlace stage
[05:15:15] <eddyb> once you exit the closure, a memory fence is emitted and you get back a cloneable Arc-based handle to the buffer, limited to the total amount written until now, but also remembering the last written section
[05:15:17] <eddyb> hmm
[05:17:04] <eddyb> it could just update the Arc and return the section. the load of the current state on the reader side would replace the cost of cloning an Arc and dropping a different Arc (which happen to be the same)
[05:17:44] <eddyb> the tricky bit will be wrapping it up in a safe interface. glium could do this, actually
[05:18:06] <eddyb> now I want to make a demo for slow-mode loading an interlaced PNG image
[05:18:14] <eddyb> 16 bytes per frame or something
[05:18:34] <eddyb> and being passed to two windows in two different threads, at the same time

[05:56:07] <Gankro> eddyb: reflecting on it more, is there ever a reason to write  pull parsers in the first place? Is it just usually easier?
[05:56:29] <eddyb> the same issue with writing sync code vs async
[05:56:46] <eddyb> it's easier to write blocking logic in imperative languages
[05:57:11] <eddyb> with generators, async logic (like push parsers) becomes easier to handle
[05:57:53] <eddyb> Gankro: also, writing a recursive descent parser like libsyntax's Rust parser, as push... that's just too crazy
[05:58:04] <Gankro> haha
[05:58:16] <eddyb> it's possible and it's great for error recovery

[09:17:54] <eddyb> yes
[09:18:00] <eddyb> look at how PHP is implemented
[09:18:08] <kimundi> cool
[09:18:14] <eddyb> well, not PHP
[09:18:24] <eddyb> there's a HTML syntax definition which can embed CSS, JS or PHP
[09:19:12] <kimundi> I'm currently thinking about a possible future where there are a few well know language-embedding macros like cpp! {} or html! {} or so that get support in syntax files
[09:19:59] <eddyb> heh

[09:20:34] <eddyb> kimundi: it will fuck up badly on mismatched delimiters, though
[09:20:35] <kimundi> Oh right, Rusts markdown docs could do the same
[09:20:45] <kimundi> well yeah
[09:20:59] <eddyb> an addition of mine to JS, a few years back, resulted in some oddities

[10:02:45] <Mutabah> well... some would say that () is good...
[10:03:02] <aatch> Mutabah, how does that solve the problem at hand though?
[10:03:25] <aatch> Mutabah, now indexing and function calls are ambiguous! Yay!
[10:03:29] <Mutabah> Yep :)
[10:03:53] <Mutabah> And then you go and unify the two, and use returnable lvalue references, and then we're C++
[10:06:22] <aatch> Also, nevermind the fact that `foo[T]()` would be confusing to anybody that is coming from a language that uses `[]` for indexing. You know, almost all of them.
[10:07:31] <aatch> Because syntax that people aren't used to is one thing, syntax that *looks* like what people are used to, but does something completely different is another thing entirely.
[10:10:03] <Havvy> aatch:  How was my argumentive skills in there?
[10:11:12] <aatch> Havvy, they seem fine.
[10:13:04] <aatch> Havvy, that guy a few comments up the tree needs a smack 'round the ear though.
[10:13:47] <aatch> I guess it does seem like we react poorly to criticism if your criticism is stupid.
[10:17:43] <Mutabah> :D
[10:18:00] <Mutabah> Probably because we've covered all these arguments before, and settled them ages ago
[10:18:12] <Mutabah> ... do we have a design FAQ somewhere?
[10:20:44] <Havvy> Honestly, I think that having two argument lists for a function (the compile time one and the runtime one) is silly.
[10:21:20] <zwarich> Mutabah: some of them were just settled by attrition
[10:21:51] *** Quits: bluss (bluss@moz-ec5o68.cust.bredbandsbolaget.se) (Quit: Lost terminal)
[10:23:18] <Havvy> I'd have preferred if the syntax was (for calling):  `drop(i32, my_i32)` instead of `drop::<i32>(my_i32)`
[10:24:07] <Mutabah> Havvy: That doesn't play nicely with inferrence
[10:24:13] <aatch> Mutabah, beat me to it.
[10:24:14] <Havvy> But that only works for function calls...and it'd be ambiguous when we get value based generics...and there's inferrence issues.
[10:24:15] <eddyb> yeah, but that's hard
[10:24:19] <Mutabah> Unless you use some character to separate the arguments
[10:24:41] <aatch> We could use `::` to seperate the arguments!
[10:24:45] <Havvy> Mutabah:  Or possibly a character to prefix the "generic" parameters?
[10:24:49] * eddyb popcorn
[10:24:51] <eddyb> how about
[10:24:53] <Havvy> aatch:  That wouldn't work.
[10:25:02] <eddyb> if it doesn't need a type param, drive it with inference
[10:25:04] <Havvy> `drop(@i32, my_i32)`
[10:25:18] <eddyb> if the type param isn't used anywhere else, pass it by value
[10:25:19] <Mutabah> ::<> doesn't look pretty... but it 1. matches C++ close enough for familiarity, and 2. is easy to parse, and 3. generics are kinda like a sub-scope anyway
[10:25:42] <Mutabah> Havvy: I'd be inclined to put the type args after the value ones
[10:25:43] <eddyb> size_of(i32)
[10:25:49] <eddyb> would be only way to call size_of
[10:25:58] <eddyb> deterministic!
[10:26:00] <Mutabah> Havvy: That way you can omit everything without confusing the parser
[10:26:13] <Mutabah> But, as said, it only works with functions
[10:26:15] <eddyb> the parser isn't the issue IMO
[10:26:16] <Havvy> Mutabah:  Yeah, that's bikesheddy there.
[10:26:21] <eddyb> Vec(T)
[10:26:23] <eddyb> pls
[10:26:34] <aatch> To be honest, I don't really mind `::<>`. Sure it's not the absolute nicest construct in the language.
[10:26:58] <aatch> But I'm writing a computer program, not creating an oil painting.
[10:27:04] <Havvy> The `::<>` operator is my favorite operator in Rust.
[10:27:15] <fmtq> really 
[10:27:22] <fmtq> it doesn't look like an operator to me

[10:28:32] <niconii> it's that easy to invoke undefined behavior in c++?
[10:28:43] <Mutabah> Yep
[10:28:56] <fmtq> beautiful
[10:28:56] <Mutabah> Well, implementation defined behavior
[10:29:04] <eddyb> it's as easy as it is in C + more ways
[10:29:11] <Mutabah> So, it'd be deterministic on one compiler... but  may not be what you expect
[10:29:26] <eddyb> I explained on HN how to expand it deterministically on Rust
[10:29:38] <niconii> Mutabah: same difference really
[10:29:48] <eddyb> but you don't need the same kind of tight increments/decrements in Rust anyways
[10:30:03] <Mutabah> niconii: Not quite, UD the optimiser can take advantage of
[10:30:13] <aatch> So `foo++++` is 1) valid (I think) syntax and 2) implementation defined behaviour?
[10:30:24] <eddyb> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9829298
[10:30:28] <Mutabah> aatch: Actually... it would fail to compile
[10:30:41] <eddyb> aatch: you're assigning to an lvalue, aren't you?
[10:30:44] <Mutabah> aatch: As ++ can only be done on a variable, but (foo++) is a value

[10:33:32] <Mutabah> eddyb: ... 22? Oh, yeah

[10:34:16] <eddyb> apparently it's still hard to do things right :P
[10:34:21] <aatch> eddyb, hmm, I don't think that'd be hard to fix though.
[10:34:40] <eddyb> I thought it was fixed last year

[10:35:06] <eddyb> my brain hurts
[10:35:06] <niconii> that seems like it's just asking for trouble
[10:35:10] <eddyb> niconii: it's just valid code
[10:35:24] <eddyb> with deterministic semantics (which happen to be implemented incorrectly)
[10:35:26] <aatch> niconii, if we disallowed that, we'd pretty much have to disallow `x = foo(x)` where x moves.

[10:35:52] <niconii> eddyb, aatch: mmm, i suppose...
[10:36:14] <aatch> niconii, the issue here is probably just that we're loading the value from the LHS before translating the RHS.
[10:36:30] <aatch> In fact, I'm sure I found and fixed that bug already...

[10:37:48] <eddyb> aatch: look at that issue, lots of fun examples
[10:39:07] <eddyb> can someone explain what sklogic is trying to say in that HN thread?
[10:39:07] <bombless> I think it's 21, because += should happend at the end of most outter expression
[10:40:03] <eddyb> bombless: i is 11 after the inner i += 1;
[10:40:08] <eddyb> bombless: and then you have i += i
[10:40:38] <eddyb> i is evaluated as an lvalue for i += expr *before* expr, but nothing is read or written from it until after expr is evaluated
[10:40:44] <eddyb> at least that's how it's supposed to work
[10:41:16] <eddyb> bombless: think in terms of function calls: AddAssign::add_assign(&mut i, { i += 1; i })
[10:41:31] <eddyb> where the borrow is deferred (as it should eventually be in all cases)
[10:41:58] <eddyb> ah, I think I know what the SSA stuff on HN is about: think syntax extensions producing SSA code and having to generate Rust source
[10:42:38] <eddyb> those things will want to work on the MIR anyways
[10:45:23] <aatch> I'm wondering if that guy knows what SSA actually is.
[10:46:30] <aatch> Single static assignment just means that variables only get assigned to once.
[10:47:51] <aatch> It's also not trivial to construct. I doubt that he's using a true SSA form for optimising a parsing grammar.
[10:48:20] <aatch> He sounds very much like somebody that has read all the books and learned all the words, but none of the ideas.

[12:47:08] <WindowsBunny> I think steam just crashed for me? o_0
[12:47:17] <WindowsBunny> well, terraria crashed, and steam is frozen
[12:51:36] <WindowsBunny> and steam died, so now to restart everything and hope I didn't really lose much

[13:35:42] <WindowsBunny> I think steam is spazzing out or something
[13:38:52] <Havvy> mrmonday:  I'm pretty sure there's a pressure point at which steam can freeze.
[13:39:03] <Havvy> "Yes, but given this shitstorm of defensiveness (not necessarily you), I'll just enjoy the weather instead."  :(
[13:39:27] <mrmonday> ooh, that's pretty cool
[13:39:29] <mrmonday> I didn't know that

[13:41:59] <Havvy> mrmonday:  http://schools.birdville.k12.tx.us/cms/lib2/TX01000797/Centricity/Domain/912/ChemLessons/Lessons/Phases%20and%20Changes/image022.jpg
[13:42:42] <mrmonday> I don't understand this diagram even a little bit
[13:43:07] <fmtq> it is a cool diagram
[13:43:16] <mrmonday> I agree
[13:43:18] <Mutabah> mrmonday: as the pressure goes down, the freezin/boiling point changes
[13:43:22] <Havvy> The Y-axis is the pressure. The X-diagram is the temperature. The color is the phase of water at that temperature/pressure.
[13:43:40] <Mutabah> mrmonday: triple point is the pressure where freezing and boiling collide
[13:43:56] <fmtq> it's crazy
[13:44:03] <Mutabah> (it's also used to refer to the temperature of that point too)
[13:44:06] <mrmonday> are the axes here logarithmic?
[13:44:11] <Havvy> Big note:  The x-axis is non-linear, so I'm assuming that the curves there are some standardized curve, not specific to water.
[13:44:14] <Mutabah> (The triple point of water is used to define the Kelvin)
[13:44:34] <WindowsBunny> freezing -> boiling is called sublimation
[13:44:49] <WindowsBunny> If you want to know what that's like, get some dry ice and watch it sublime
[13:45:00] <mrmonday> it has been a lot of years since I did anything close to this level of chemistry :>
[13:45:05] <WindowsBunny> the sublimation of dry ice is quite sublime
[13:45:33] <Havvy> "water phase diagram" is what I searched on Google Images, if you want to see other variants of this.
[13:46:08] <Havvy> WindowsBunny:  But what about the opposite direction?
[13:46:22] <WindowsBunny> Havvy: fuck if I know
[13:46:43] <WindowsBunny> Havvy: I have yet to see dry ice suddenly appear in my house
[13:47:19] <WindowsBunny> Havvy: deposition
[13:47:23] <Havvy> I would be a bit worried if you did see that.
[13:47:44] <Havvy> deposition huh....sounds like an odd choice there.
[13:48:08] <WindowsBunny> Havvy: You can see deposition on your window in winter
[13:48:10] <Havvy> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_diagram#Crystal_phase_diagrams has a better labeled chart, but also more complex since it also shows what type of ice is at specific points.
[13:48:12] <WindowsBunny> when frost builds up
[13:48:27] <WindowsBunny> because the frost is building up from water vapor in the air
[13:48:40] <Havvy> Ah, yeah.
[13:48:51] <WindowsBunny> it is depositing water onto your window to create frost
[13:49:50] <WindowsBunny> Havvy: It is due to the gas not having any particles in the air to condense on
[13:49:53] <Havvy> Ah, yeah, that seems to work. Though condensation is how most water gets deposited... :S
[13:50:06] <WindowsBunny> so the vapor can go below the freezing point
[13:50:20] *** Joins: blue_deref (blue_deref@moz-u9gmm1.res.rr.com)
[13:50:35] <WindowsBunny> and then when it hits something it can condense onto, since it's already below the freezing point, it instead deposits ice
[13:50:53] <WindowsBunny> Havvy: deposition is how snowflakes are formed :D
[13:51:07] <Havvy> Ah, cool.
[13:51:14] <Havvy> And hail?
[13:51:20] <WindowsBunny> and variations in temperature and humidity affect the details of snowflake formation
[13:52:04] <WindowsBunny> Havvy: hail is formed via droplets freezing
[13:53:34] <Havvy> Oh....
