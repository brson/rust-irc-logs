[16:45:12] <Tiffany> lol yeah
[16:45:13] <eternaleye> 3.) Poor choice of actual data storage format
[16:45:20] <eternaleye> 4.) Large space expansion over time
[16:45:28] <eternaleye> 5.) Large network traffic
[16:45:33] <Tiffany> the block chain is already 30 gigabytes that has to be downloaded to every client's computer (although I think they use some kind of compression thing? or don't download all of it?)
[16:45:44] <bascule> just dial the max block size up to 20MB. it'll be fine

[16:46:23] <eternaleye> (Regardless of what your view on those aims _is_, nontechnical goals tend to be harmful to technical goals)

[19:12:28] <bascule> quantum attacks! :o
[19:13:19] <bascule> quantum SAT solvers that can untangle symmetric crypto
[19:14:32] <Ilari> Except would those things also screw supposedly "post-quantum" asymmetric ciphers?
[19:16:53] <Tobba> I guess we simply don't understand enough about quantum computers yet?
[19:20:39] <Ilari> What kinds of operations those do is pretty well understood. But figuring out what problems one can efficiently solve with those is different matter (hell, we aren't very good at that kind of thing even with classical computing).

[20:04:06] <eternaleye> Tiffany: OCB is an AEAD mode that delivers performance close-to the underlying block cipher
[20:04:56] <eternaleye> Tiffany: Most AEAD modes are "two-pass", meaning that you are just plain doing more work
[20:05:12] <eternaleye> Tiffany: That's bad for speed/memory bandwidth/power consumption (take your pick)
[20:09:13] <eternaleye> Tiffany: Also, Rogaway (the primary author) _does_ have a history of designing good crypto
[20:09:14] <eternaleye> Tiffany: (and of being relatively sane wrt patents and such, though OCB got caught in the splash zone of Gligor, Donescu, and Jutla being less sensible)
[20:09:15] <eternaleye> Though that might come down on IBM in truth
[20:10:41] <Tiffany> does OCB reject forged packets quickly?
[20:11:55] <Ilari> Tiffany: I don't think it does.
[20:16:01] *** Quits: skeuomorf (skeuomorf@moz-d3l.n1e.32.197.IP) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[20:16:56] <eternaleye> IMO, the sole minus with OCB is that it's not nonce-misuse resistant, but that's not relevant in the TLS use case.
[20:16:57] <eternaleye> Of course, he has since created AEZ (for Caesar), which is very shiny indeed
[20:16:58] <eternaleye> Including arbitrary-length verification tags.
[20:19:18] <Ilari> Just that AEZ is based on AES, which is notorious for timing issues. And also isn't quantum-safe.
[20:23:43] <eternaleye> Ilari: There's the generic AEZ construct, and there's the instantiation of AEZ with reduced-rounds AES.
[20:23:58] <eternaleye> Ilari: AEZ can be instantiated with other block ciphers.
[20:25:02] <Ilari> Can it be instantiated with some 256-bit block / 256-bit key cipher? Too bad I don't think there are any(?) fast ones.
[20:25:27] <eternaleye> Ilari: Lemme pull up the paper
[20:27:06] <eternaleye> Ilari: It seems to be entirely generic
[20:28:01] <eternaleye> Ilari: The only thing that would vary is how small a message has to be for it to switch over to AEZ-tiny
[20:28:06] <eternaleye> Ilari: (sub-blocksize)
[20:28:26] <eternaleye> Ilari: http://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/aez/aez.pdf p7 (9 in the pdf)
[20:28:40] <eternaleye> Ilari: It really only needs something that satisfies "tweakable cipher"
[20:29:11] <eternaleye> Er, tweakable blockcipher
[20:29:57] <eternaleye> >> Let us call this construction just given AEZ-core [ E ] .  It is the generalization of AEZ-core that employs an arbitrary tweakable blockcipher E. It should not be surprising that the construction is a strong-PRP under the assumption that the TBC used is secure as a tweakable-PRP. We prove this in the academic paper corresponding to this submission.
[20:30:35] <eternaleye> AEZ10 uses XE to turn full-AES into a TBC
[20:31:00] <eternaleye> AEZ4 then reduces the round count, believing heuristically that this still provides adequate security
[20:31:27] <eternaleye> The same pattern could be used with pretty much any block cipher
[20:35:15] <Ilari> Threefish is one of the better known ciphers that can reach 256-bit blocks (tho 512-bit is the fastest). But being designed to be hash function core, it is pretty overkill as cipher.
[20:40:49] <Tiffany> how do the requirements differ between hash functions and block ciphers in counter mode?
[20:42:40] <Ilari> Hash function core ciphers have to withstand much worse attacks than block ciphers in real world use.
[20:45:31] <Tiffany> oh
[20:45:39] <Tiffany> I suppose
[20:45:57] <Tiffany> hash functions need to avoid collisions and they need to avoid preimage attacks
[20:46:16] <Tiffany> block ciphers don't really need to avoid collisions, and whether they avoid preimage attacks probably depends on how it works
[20:46:32] <Tiffany> I imagine a preimage attack on chacha would be working out the key from keystream
[20:46:45] <Tiffany> but other ciphers keep the key separate from the contents being encrypted..
[20:47:11] <Tiffany> is being overkill a bad thing, other than probably being slower?
[20:47:21] <Ilari> Yeah, it is slow.
