[21:09:38] <eternaleye> This is neat: https://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2009/EECS-2009-131.html
[21:09:51] <eternaleye> Might also help RISC-V in terms of cache timing attacks, once this gets implemented
[21:10:27] <eternaleye> (The RISC-V folks have stated that they intend to add this as an extension, rather than cacheline-prodding instructions like x86 has)
[22:08:51] <Riastradh> Better to choose algorithms that don't encourage secret-dependent array indices...
[22:09:36] <eternaleye> Agreed.
[22:09:36] <tiffany> riastradh: what if the secret-dependent array index algorithms are faster?
[22:10:03] <tiffany> although
[22:10:10] <eternaleye> However, this + something trustzone-like might be quite nice for AES and such
[22:10:13] <tiffany> you'd be kind of hard pressed to find an application where encryption is actually a bottleneck
[22:10:36] <cmr> Line-speed networking at 40Gbps+?
[22:10:44] <eternaleye> Jump into TrustZone for AES ops, it can either bitslice (constant-time) or S-box using the above.
[22:11:34] <tiffany> cmr: I'm not really familiar with applications that saturate 40 gbps links other than routers, and routers don't usually need to worry about encryption
[22:13:02] <Riastradh> tiffany: Bad idea to design new systems that way anyway because it will leave most users vulnerable.
[22:16:24] <eternaleye> tiffany: There's actually a good number in HPC, regarding node-to-node communication
[22:16:38] <tiffany> I figured HPC would be a thing
[22:16:42] <eternaleye> tiffany: And depending on some other things, storage arrays can hit that too
[22:16:51] *** Quits: atomic (atomic@moz-ghs.fu7.109.77.IP) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[22:16:57] <tiffany> oh yeah
[22:17:15] <eternaleye> tiffany: And in the presence of iSCSI, that brings encryption (ipsec) into the picture
[22:17:40] <eternaleye> Then there's SSL termination devices
[22:18:08] <eternaleye> Though those mostly sit by a WAN, and are less likely to need 40GbE aside from exceptional cases
[22:18:21] <eternaleye> (cough*google*cough
[22:18:23] <eternaleye> )
[22:19:07] <tiffany> interesting
[22:19:16] <tiffany> that's something I didn't really consider
[22:19:25] <tiffany> I figure individual webservers would handle ssl
[22:19:32] <eternaleye> tiffany: That varies a _lot_
[22:19:39] <eternaleye> tiffany: See also: CloudFlare's entire business
[22:19:48] <eternaleye> Then there's ipsec VPN termination
[22:19:55] <eternaleye> But again, WAN tends to cap that speed
[22:20:33] <tiffany> cloudflare's ssl thing is pretty terrible
[22:20:52] <tiffany> terminating ssl before you have even exited the public internet
[22:21:08] <eternaleye> tiffany: Sure. It's also 30% of TLS deployment on the public net, if I remember the press release right?
[22:21:34] <eternaleye> tiffany: Also, IIRC, it uses private certs between backend and cloudflare, and cloudflare holds the globally-valid cert or some such
[22:21:44] <eternaleye> tiffany: CloudFlare's a caching proxy, not just an SSL terminator
[22:22:04] <eternaleye> tiffany: So "terminating ssl before exiting the public internet" may not be entirely correct
[22:22:17] <tiffany> the backend isn't required to use ssl though, is it?
[22:22:24] <eternaleye> tiffany: Dunno
[22:22:41] <eternaleye> tiffany: I think it might require them to, but I don't use it.
[22:23:03] <eternaleye> tiffany: But it doesn't require them to have a _public cert_, and it shoulders most of the encrypted traffic
[22:23:16] <eternaleye> tiffany: Since cache hits don't hit the backend
[22:23:45] <eternaleye> tiffany: So they might (in aggregate) hit that 40Gb/sec limit
[22:25:05] <eternaleye> tiffany: And even past that, you get into next-gen stuff like using ORAM in a SoC in order to make it infeasible for someone to snoop the DRAM bus
[22:25:23] <eternaleye> tiffany: At which point 40Gb/sec looks pretty darn reasonable
[22:26:01] <eternaleye> tiffany: (there are at least two groups I'm aware of that have synthesized actual hardware that did this)
[22:31:38] <eternaleye> tiffany: Phantom ( http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~maas/papers/maas-ccs13-phantom.pdf ) and Hornet ( https://github.com/kwonalbert/oram )
[22:37:41] <eternaleye> Ah, here's the paper for the Hornet one: http://csg.csail.mit.edu/pubs/memos/Memo-513/memo513.pdf
[22:45:41] <bascule> tiffany: CloudFlare SSL is quantifiably better than no SSL
[22:45:50] <bascule> also CloudFlare's CA will be powering Let's Encrypt
[22:45:51] <bascule> so....
[22:46:36] <bascule> granted CloudFlare does have a "flexible SSL" mode that allows plaintext to the origin server, and another mode that doesn't authenticate the certificate
[22:46:40] <bascule> those are kind of bad
[22:47:19] <bascule> Ilari: nice, unbearable isn't going to use ALPN, and instead use a TLS extension
[22:47:25] <tiffany> is there a way to tell if a server is doing that?
[22:48:17] <bascule> doing what? using CloudFlare Universal SSL?
[22:48:29] <bascule> you can look at the subject of the certificate
[22:48:36] <bascule> it should be sniXXX.cloudflare.com
[22:48:38] <bascule> or something
[22:49:01] <eternaleye> bascule: I think tiffany wants a way to check if they're using "flexible ssl" or a stronger variant
[22:49:07] <bascule> oh
[22:49:08] <bascule> nope
[22:49:09] <bascule> :(
[22:49:25] <tiffany> sure, cloudflare flexible ssl is better than no ssl
[22:50:03] <tiffany> you only have to trust that the connection between cloudflare and the backend isn't being mitmed, which is somewhat unlikely when dealing with the datacenter to datacenter connections that are typical for websites
[22:50:21] <tiffany> residential connections are much more likely to have various types of malicious interference
[22:50:25] <tiffany> and public wifi etc
[22:51:00] <tiffany> you don't have to worry about skiddies setting up fake wifi networks, just malicious entities with the resources of a government
[22:51:45] <bascule> tiffany: I was saying Universal SSL
[22:51:51] <bascule> not necessarily flexible SSL
[22:51:58] <tiffany> but there's no way to tell the difference
[22:52:02] <bascule> they have an option that's non-shitty
[22:52:03] <bascule> haha sure
[22:52:04] <tiffany> you can only assume that your security is compromised
[22:52:12] <bascule> isn't that true of any site using TLS
[22:52:20] <tiffany> well okay
[22:52:44] <tiffany> you can only assume that your connection can be snooped by anyone who happens to have access to internet backbone routers
[22:52:52] <tiffany> as opposed to actually having to break into the website's servers
[22:53:05] <eternaleye> tiffany: Don't forget colo hosting
[22:53:35] <eternaleye> tiffany: Incidentally, google offers free colo hosting to stuff for GFiber, and has been gov'd in the past
[22:53:43] <tiffany> fun

[23:45:04] <bascule> gawd tiffany, you're freaking me out because there's another channel I hang out in with someone named tiffany, and I'm like "tiffany why are you talking about crypto? oh wait"
[23:45:27] <tiffany> heh
[23:45:39] <tiffany> what network is that?
[23:46:35] <tiffany> I haven't been to any network where my name was already taken
[23:47:33] <eternaleye> I think there's exactly one other person on the internet who uses "eternaleye"
[23:48:37] <eternaleye> Oh, huh, there's a second now
[23:48:38] <tiffany> your name sounds like a nethack graphical frontend
[23:49:03] <eternaleye> tiffany: Oh, you play Vultures/Falcon's :D
[23:49:11] <eternaleye> tiffany: (I love those)
[23:49:18] <tiffany> well
[23:49:29] <tiffany> I played falcon's eye when I had suse enterprise desktop 9.0
[23:49:38] <eternaleye> Hahahaha
[23:49:47] <tiffany> but I tried to play it again a couple months ago on my current arch install
[23:49:50] <tiffany> and couldn't get either to compile
[23:49:58] <eternaleye> I always played the Claw variants, since I like Slash'EM
[23:50:05] <eternaleye> (Doppelganger Wizard > *)
[23:50:50] <eternaleye> Though, NoeGNUd is also nice, especially with the "absurd" tileset
[23:53:08] <eternaleye> Also, Roguelikes are the reason I refuse to buy any laptop that is missing a numberpad.
[23:53:21] <tiffany> oh
[23:53:31] <tiffany> I was thinking of getting a keyboard without a number pad since I never use it
[23:53:43] <eternaleye> Diagonal motion is a _pain_ without it.
[23:53:46] <tiffany> it would be kind of cool to have it on the left side instead of the right, to reduce the hand to mouse distance
[23:54:29] <eternaleye> I'm a touchpad fan, so I mouse with my left, slide up for keyboard, and keep my right on the numpad (in roguelikes at least)
[23:54:43] <eternaleye> Although I don't need the mouse much for those
[23:54:57] <eternaleye> In NoeGNUd, I just use it to occasionally rotate/skew the perspective
[23:55:28] <tiffany> my touchpad is pretty awful, although I'm not sure that they get much less awful
[23:55:49] <eternaleye> tiffany: Synaptics used to be good, before they went all-in on that softbutton dain-bramage
[23:55:57] <tiffany> haha I turn all that crap off
[23:56:20] <eternaleye> tiffany: Well, these days they're making pads with no physical buttons at all in a bunch of cases
[23:56:25] <tiffany> I couldn't figure out if there was a config file or anything
[23:56:28] <tiffany> so I just run this at startup
[23:56:29] <tiffany> synclient TapButton1=0 TapButton2=0 TapButton3=0 ClickFinger1=0 ClickFinger2=0 ClickFinger3=0
[23:56:52] <eternaleye> tiffany: Dell at least got that right on my laptop (three real buttons, middle click is paste, Like It Should Be), but the pad itself is ALPS junk
[23:56:53] <tiffany> it was so bad that I couldn't actually use the touchpad without accidentally activating the right click gesture
[23:56:59] <eternaleye> And so is as jumpy as it gets
[23:58:20] <tiffany> my touchpad has two real buttons
[23:58:33] <tiffany> the only gesture I still have enabled is the one for scrolling
[23:58:45] <tiffany> it's the least awkward one and it's still kind of bad
