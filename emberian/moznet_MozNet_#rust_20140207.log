[04:40:50] <uzi_mantis> i'm seriously having trouble understanding what the best kind of str would be to return from my functions
[04:41:07] <uzi_mantis> when would i want to return a borrowed string versus an owned string..?
[04:41:21] <Eridius> uzi_mantis: return a borrowed string when you can, the caller can always convert it into an owned one
[04:41:49] <uzi_mantis> i see
[04:41:52] <Yurume> uzi_mantis: in most cases you need to return an owned string.
[04:42:00] <strcat> uzi_mantis: ~str and &str are somewhat different types - &str is a pointer and length providing an immutable view, and ~str is a dynamically sized string you can mutate
[04:42:27] <strcat> so as long as you're providing a view into some existing memory, you can and should use &str
[04:42:29] <Yurume> Eridius is right on that if you *can* return a borrowed string you should return that, but there are not many cases that it's possible.
[04:42:37] <Eridius> uzi_mantis: typically you can only return a borrowed string if you're returning a string that is accessible via one of your function's parameters, without modifications

[04:45:03] <Yurume> returning ~str does not necessarily mean that you need to copy it
[04:45:26] <Yurume> so for example, fn f(s: ~str) -> ~str { s } does not copy anything (besides from a pointer).
[04:46:24] <uzi_mantis> ahh yeah that makes sense, you're just returning exactly what the function took in
[04:46:44] <uzi_mantis> now, what if i wanted to return a borrowed string from an owned string from that same function signature?

[04:47:48] <Yurume> uzi_mantis: that's impossible. receiving ~str means the caller loses the ownership of that string.
[04:48:33] <Yurume> and since the ownership does not move back to the caller, s would be destroyed inside the function, making &str pointing s unsafe.

[04:52:45] <Yurume> uzi_mantis: only one scope can own one ~str, and if no scope owns ~str then it is deallocated. so if ~str does not move outside, once f returns that ~str is not owned by anyone, so will be deallocated.

[04:55:26] <apoelstra> uzi_mantis: no paradox, the caller simply does not own the string
[04:55:54] <strcat> uzi_mantis: generally when you return a reference, you're returning a reference based on a parameter you were based
[04:56:08] <uzi_mantis> how's the caller not own the string if the function only accepts ~str, owned strings, as a parameter?
[04:56:27] <strcat> uzi_mantis: if you take a ~str by-value, you can't return a borrowed reference to it

[05:08:54] <apoelstra> uzi_mantis: you realize that you always return ~"Error", yes?
[05:09:09] <apoelstra> i think you want an else{} around ~"Error"
[05:09:39] <uzi_mantis> wouldn't a return statement inside the body of the match statement break out of the function if it (the return) were reached?
[05:09:41] <Yurume> uzi_mantis: fn foo() -> int { a; b; c; d } returns `d` (ignoring type errors etc). fn foo() -> int { a; if bar() { return b; } c } returns b or c depending on bar(). fn foo() { a; b; c; d; } returns nothing (i.e. `()`) since d has a trailing semicolon.
[05:10:22] <Yurume> the second example is more commonly written as: fn foo() -> int { a; if bar { b } else { c } }
[05:10:35] <Yurume> but if you have multiple conditions you'd better use `return`.

[07:49:07] <wil> Hi - I believe I've found an issue with one of the examples in the docs.
[07:49:21] <wil> Specifically, the example at http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/0.9/std/io/signal/struct.Listener.html
[07:49:49] <mcpherrin> wil: not surprising ;)
[07:49:50] <wil> Aside from missing a fn main(), the example implicitly captures a mutable value in the spawn closure, which isn't allowed.

[13:48:20] <hein> thanks
[13:48:30] <hein> you need to explicitely dereference as mut, aha
[13:48:49] <Taneb> It makes an iterator out of an initial state and a closure that takes the state and makes some output or stops, possibly modifying the state

[16:03:37] <bstrie> I once pondered inventing a language, called heScme, which would just be a transpiler to scheme except that EVERY operator is infix
[16:03:49] <pnkfelix> bstrie: its a common suggestion
[16:03:49] <bstrie> binary-tree programming
[16:04:16] <bstrie> pnkfelix: you can't be serious
[16:04:20] <diverse> kvark: ah, I guess that depends on where your from. The point is, the news media keeps bringing up about Vladmir Putins anti-gay laws and restrictions to the Olympics. So the point of what Google is doing is showing their support for freedom of sport and giving actual evidence from the Olympic Charter stating that you must not discrimate anybody, even gays. It's just a rub in the face to Putin.
[16:04:21] <pnkfelix> bstrie: see e.g. http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-105/srfi-105.html
[16:04:59] <adridu59> is scheme related to haskell somehow?
[16:05:07] <bstrie> pnkfelix: I think you misunderstand, hello world in heSchme would look like ("hello" print "world")

[16:16:03] <abustany> Hi, I'm a bit confused on doing pattern matching on a managed object... Basically I can't do match x { @Foo(a, b, c) => ... }, the compiler tells me to use a nested match
[16:16:12] <abustany> but I can't find the right syntax for that :/
[16:16:30] <abustany> (running pretty much master)
[16:16:33] <apoelstra> my read is that ; turns an expression into a statement. you can concatenate statements but not expressions
[16:16:36] <kimundi> jadbaires: You can see it like this: A block always evaluates to the last expression in it, like { expr }. ";" is a seperator that allows you to have multiple expressions or statements in a block like this: { stmt; expr; expr }. If a block does end with a ; instead of a expression, thats sugar for ending with (): { expr; } -> { expr; () }
[16:16:36] <kimundi> Not sure if the is more clear though
[16:16:36] <kimundi> Afaik "let" is the only statement we really have in the block language
[16:16:47] <kimundi> urg, bad connection
[16:16:49] <bstrie> abustany: what version of rust are you using?
[16:17:29] <bstrie> abustany: @ within patterns does not indicate managed pointers, which is the problem you're seeing
[16:17:44] <hein> what happens if there's not enough memory for a ~[] allocation?
[16:17:45] <abustany> rustc 0.10-pre (14cb4be 2014-02-07 02:11:30 -0800)
[16:17:52] <abustany> ok, I understand
[16:18:20] <bstrie> abustany: @ within patterns means a strange thing that I don't quite understand, it's too functional for me :P
[16:18:28] <kimundi> bstrie, abustany: Well, @ in a pattern used to be useable as managed destructuring - but due the ongoing progress of removing the @ point from the langauge, its no longer valid for that

[16:20:46] <bstrie> kimundi: haskell's syntax is gross :P

[16:48:52] <kimundi> pnkfelix: I guess either V or (K, V) would make sense. But I'm just idly wondering here - basically I was thinking about how Option<T> could implement a few container traits, specifically one that gives it a contains(&T) method as shortcut for " == Some(T)". WHich lead me to look at the docs and noticing that we only have "contains" defined in Set<T>, and wondering how far that is significant.
[16:49:21] <pnkfelix> kimundi: Option could also implement Set to achieve, that goal, no?

[18:12:41] <Tobba> tehgeekmeisters: I've got a kernel going

[18:13:14] <Tobba> so the choice is either to write the functionality I did, or rip apart libstd/rust-core
[18:13:27] <Tobba> to write the functionality you need, which I did*
[18:13:34] <Tobba> rewrite*
[18:13:39] <Tobba> goddamn
[18:13:47] <dschatzberg> thats my question, is the idea that Rust competes with freestanding c/c++ or do something a bit better
[18:14:04] <sfackler> dschatzberg: there's some discussion of splitting libstd to make it more usable in a freestanding context here: https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/11968
[18:14:24] <tehgeekmeister> Tobba: I've seen a few kernel things going around. b0rk's and the rustboot thing she used. i wanna try to play around with trying to build something like microsoft research's singularity os in rust. seems like rust could be adapted to that fairly easily. maybe. it's ambitious. =P
[18:14:54] <sfackler> you'll be dealing with the same standard library issues in C or C++ as well in a kernel context

[18:16:30] <Tobba> I have to write the whole thing
[18:16:45] <Tobba> I kinda missjudged the format from the start, considering switching to Mach-O
[18:17:04] <tehgeekmeister> Tobba: singularity basically lets everything run ring 0 and does all the safety guarantees statically, just like rust
[18:17:14] <Tobba> neat
[18:17:28] <dschatzberg> not really, rust doesn't provide the same safety guarantees
[18:17:35] <tehgeekmeister> so basically, only allow safe code for non-kernel stuff, and you're a big part of the way there

[18:18:23] <Jemaclus> Not strictly a Rust question, but... let's say I have two CSV files: one with 43K rows and another with 100MM rows. I want to basically analyze each of the 100MM rows with data from each of the 43K rows. It seems better to store the 43K rows in memory (if possible) and then stream in the CSV data one by one.

[20:17:42] <guest1> thanks
[20:17:50] <Jemaclus> another dumb question
[20:17:54] <Eridius> from_str is defined in std::from_str and is included in the prelude

[20:19:17] <Jemaclus> just want to make sure I understand this correctly... does this mean that std::str inherits all of those traits/structs? I.e., I can do ~"foo,bar,baz".split(',') ?
[20:19:36] <Jemaclus> since .split() is part of StrSlice trait?
[20:20:03] <Eridius> Jemaclus: std::str has a bunch of traits like that becaues str is a built-in type and therefore methods cannot be impl'd on it directly
[20:20:20] <Eridius> if you click on eg.. std::str::Str you'll see that it's implemented for &str and ~str
[20:20:31] <Eridius> which means methods in that trait can be called on &strs and ~strs

[20:20:58] <Jemaclus> right
[20:21:08] <Jemaclus> so it automatically has the StrSlice trait
[20:21:11] <Eridius> Jemaclus: the structs, of course, are just structs. They're returned from various methods. Most of those are iterators
[20:21:28] <Eridius> yeah, normally you'd have to `use` a trait to be able to use its methods, but these particular traits are included in the prelude
[20:21:56] <Eridius> rusti: "foo,bar,baz".split(',').to_owned_vec()
[20:21:57] -rusti- ~["foo", "bar", "baz"]

[20:43:12] <Eridius> pull will merge
[20:43:31] <Zr40> suppose both of you create a new commit. One of you pushes first and succeds. The other pushes second and will fail, telling him to pull and merge first

[20:48:48] <guest1> so basically if i make a change and push. and my partner tries to push, he wont be able to, because he has an older version. so if he pulls, then it'll merge both our code?
[20:48:56] <guest1> and at that point he can commit and push?
[20:49:04] <guest1> if i  am understanding correctly...
[20:49:09] <Eridius> if he runs `git pull` it will merge and produce a merge commit
[20:49:17] <Eridius> if he runs `git pull --rebase` it will rebase his change on top of yours. That's probably what you want
[20:49:18] <apoelstra> guest1: that's right. git by default won't let you push anything it can't fast-forward merge, so you're safe
