[23:29:39] <glandium> roc: is it expected that doing "print &variable" and then "watch *$1" (assuming $1 is the answer to the print) doesn't work the same as "watch *addr" ?
[23:30:02] <roc> yes
[23:30:13] <glandium> O_o
[23:30:37] <roc> gdb has this (crazy IMHO) behavior that "watch <expression>" changes whenever the value of <expression> changes *as the program executes through scopes*
[23:31:00] <roc> for sane behavior you want watch -l
[23:31:02] <glandium> ... which is why I'm using $1 in the firat place
[23:31:05] <glandium> first
[23:31:07] <roc> exactly
[23:31:35] <roc> the default behavior is a) never what you want and b) incredibly slow
[23:31:36] <glandium> but I fail to see how that would influence rr
[23:32:01] <roc> not sure what you mean
[23:32:06] <roc> rr doesn't decide this
[23:32:32] <glandium> roc: rr spends much more time on the former than on the latter
[23:32:42] <glandium> like, orders of magnitude more time in some cases
[23:32:46] <roc> during reverse execution you mean?
[23:32:50] <glandium> yes
[23:32:54] <roc> well
[23:33:06] <roc> that could be because when the variable goes out of scope, gdb removes the watchpoint
[23:33:21] <glandium> $1 is an address
[23:33:23] <glandium> not a variable
[23:33:26] <roc> right
[23:33:35] <roc> in the former case the watchpoint doesn't get removed
[23:33:37] <roc> in the latter it does
[23:33:49] <roc> reverse execution with fewer watchpoints/breakpoints set can be a lot faster

[23:34:04] <roc> but I'm just guessing
[23:34:05] <glandium> i do mean watch *$1 vs. watch *litteral-value-of-$1
[23:34:11] <roc> oh
[23:34:13] <roc> hmm
[23:34:14] <roc> I dunno then
[23:34:20] <glandium> the latter being way faster
[23:34:25] <glandium> in some cases
[23:34:34] <roc> I'd enable GdbConnection logging and see what's different in what gdb sends to rr
[23:34:44] <glandium> ok
[23:35:52] <glandium> roc: btw, the bugs I filed don't happen when my watchpoint is properly aligned
[23:36:12] <roc> which ones?
[23:36:21] <glandium> roc: that is, they happen when I watch a uint16_t value at an odd address, but don't if I watch the bytes individually
[23:36:26] <roc> ok
[23:36:32] <roc> that's interesting
[23:36:48] <roc> unaligned watchpoints are emulated using multiple hardware watchpoints so maybe that's confusing things
[23:36:54] <glandium> roc: issues 1527 and 1530
[23:37:19] <roc> ok

[23:49:12] <roc> hmmmm
[23:49:31] <roc> it looks like in this slow case, gdb is checking the watched value for changes and deciding there wasn't one?
[23:49:46] <roc> what is the watched address? is it actually changing?
[23:49:57] *** Joins: lkuper (sid44041@moz-7edef8.ealing.irccloud.com)

[23:50:37] <roc> the whole GdbConnection log up to the repeating part, plus a log for the equivalent other command, would be useful
[23:50:38] <glandium> roc: no condition, and it does change
[23:50:55] <glandium> https://pastebin.mozilla.org/8840211 this is the output when using the literal address instead of $1
[23:51:04] <roc> is rr in an infinite loop or does it eventually stop?
[23:51:16] <roc> you should be able to ctrl-C and do when/when-ticks to see
[23:51:21] <glandium> hu wait, that's not the right output here
[23:51:57] <glandium> https://pastebin.mozilla.org/8840212 this is the right output when using the literal address
[23:53:06] <glandium> I wonder why it's setting a breakpoint on the stack
[23:53:17] <glandium> in the looping case
[23:53:53] <roc> which address is the one you want to watch?
[23:54:00] <glandium> 0x60c32cbd
[23:54:18] <roc> oh yeah sorry
[23:55:18] <roc> yeah we're reporting a watch hit on ffff9630 which seems like a problem
[23:55:24] <roc> better get the whole log to see how/when that got set
[23:55:28] <glandium> so... it looks like *$1 is still trying to evaluate what led to $1
[23:55:38] <roc> really?
[23:55:39] <roc> that's odd
[23:55:47] <roc> if you do watch -l does this problem go away?
[23:55:50] <glandium> because 0xffff9630 is what it's derived from
[23:56:16] <roc> also you could try doing something else to set $1
[23:56:58] <roc> probably I should read the gdb source code to see if it stores the underlying expressions for $ variables, but I'm a bit busy right now
[23:57:14] <glandium> watch -l *$1 works
[23:57:39] <glandium> man, that's crazy
