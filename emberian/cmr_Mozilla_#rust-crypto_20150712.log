[01:18:34] <Ilari> TLS certificate fun. Suppose that website has obtained a certificate from Let's encrypt. What it should send to client as certificates? :-)
[01:22:29] <Ilari> (Especially, the certificate chain)
[01:36:37] <Ilari> Well, Let's Encrypt client should config that, except hope that it won't config something that breaks TLS specs.

[12:55:27] <eddyb> haahaha
[12:55:38] <eddyb> I only saw that now
[12:55:58] <eddyb> Ilari: I don't even dare look at the abyss
[12:56:25] <eddyb> well, that, and the fact that I have other things to do
[13:10:33] <Ilari> Whee, got message stuck in moderation for TLS list for being too large (it does not have attachments nor HTML).
[13:25:32] <Ilari> "Only reason to install Adobe Flash is if you are developing exploits for it. The rest of you have no excuse."
[13:26:51] <Tiffany> ilari: arbitrary memory read/write, mess with the network interface however it likes, all undetectable by the OS, and there are of course security vulnerabilities in it...
[13:27:05] <Tiffany> rootkit you can't remove by wiping your harddrive sounds fun, doesn't it?
[13:28:44] <Ilari> Well, doesn't UEFI already take care of that?
[13:31:19] <Ilari> Also, why the heck does ME have arbitrary access to RAM anyway?
[13:31:52] <Tiffany> I don't think UEFI does those things?
[13:32:07] <Tiffany> I'm not sure it has unfettered access to RAM
[13:32:13] <Tiffany> but it can steal portions of memory for its own uses
[13:32:17] <Tiffany> I don't know if it can do much else
[13:32:31] <Tiffany> I do know that it can take over the display
[13:32:38] <Tiffany> one of the features of the ME is secure PIN access
[13:32:55] <Ilari> Well, ME is probably easier to exploit than UEFI.
[13:33:10] <Tiffany> where it highjacks your touch screen, taking all OS control, and displays a PIN entry
[13:33:18] <Tiffany> and then presumably sends it through the NIC itself, bypassing the OS
[13:33:29] <Tiffany> it's kind of weird
[13:33:35] <Tiffany> some of the code is signed, but not all of it
[13:33:51] <Tiffany> there's also a jvm using an obscure format from the early 2000s
[13:36:08] <Ilari> Also, AFAIK in UEFI, the BIOS write locking is done by SMM, so if one can elevate to SMM (and one of the BH 2015 presentations is allegedly about hardware flaw that lets one do that), one can presumably reflash the firmware.
[13:45:42] <Ilari> "Apparently ITU-T just updated X.509 last month. Corrigendum 1 is out"
[14:04:16] <Ilari> Also, saw article recently where the author would have been less scared if the NYSE "glitch" had been actual cyberattack.
[14:45:23] <Tiffany> bascule: I read your article on AE, and now I'm wondering what kind of flaws there are to be made with GCM and whatever
[14:45:46] <Tiffany> I'm trying to see if secretbox does anything special besides what I would think
[14:46:52] <Ilari> Tiffany: Well, GCM has only 96 bit nonce (which is bit small to make random) and GCM might be quite vulernable to timing attacks.
[14:47:09] <Tiffany> what about EAX?
[14:47:23] <Ilari> Also, if one uses fixed initial nonce, the strength might be quite below nominal.
[14:48:30] <Tiffany> https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium/blob/master/src/libsodium/crypto_secretbox/xsalsa20poly1305/ref/box_xsalsa20poly1305.c this doesn't look very special
[14:49:21] <Ilari> IIRC, xsalsa20 has nonce much wider than normal (was it 192 bits?)
[14:49:46] <Tiffany> apparently
[14:50:03] <Tiffany> ah
[14:50:12] <Tiffany> that's how it crams it into the state matrix
[14:50:22] <Tiffany> it uses 128 bits of the nonce to create a subkey
[16:46:03] <Tiffany> hahaha, I like how this paper just described the unix open()
[16:47:00] <Tiffany> "The corresponding analogy is to imagine a world with doors but without keys. When a person walks up to a door, the door magically opens if it deems the person worthy. For example, Unix filesystem permissions constitute an ambient authority mechanism, because the caller of a function such as open() does not choose any credentials to present with the request; the request merely succeeds or fails."

[21:41:38] <eternaleye> Tiffany: The idea that ACLs can implement least-authority confinement but require the superuser do it, while capabilities can offer least-authority while themselves being implemented with the least authority necessary, is pretty cool
[21:41:59] <eternaleye> Tiffany: It also brings to mind Popek and Goldberg's virtualization stuff, in a way
