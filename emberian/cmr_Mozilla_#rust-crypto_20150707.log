[00:00:19] <mcpherrin> 04:54 PM < bascule> looks like my coworker wants to implement Noise in Rust
[00:00:25] <mcpherrin> ooops

[00:00:44] <bascule> Tiffany: awesome
[00:00:59] <mcpherrin> putty's copy-paste on click and right click behavior is a pain :|
[00:01:04] <Tiffany> last time I was working on it I had a few confusions with the spec
[00:01:15] <Tiffany> like k = KDF(GETKEY(k, n)) or whatever
[00:01:23] <bascule> mcpherrin: Putty?!?! o_O
[00:01:27] <Tiffany> how is that supposed to behave when k is empty? treat it as zeros?
[00:01:48] <Tiffany> I'll ask about it if I'm still confused about it next time I work on it

[00:01:57] <Tiffany> the spec has received substantial attention since then
[00:02:20] <mcpherrin> bascule: Sometimes, you gotta Windows ;p
[00:02:44] <Tiffany> ah
[00:02:46] <Tiffany> it was clarified
[00:02:47] <Tiffany> that's good
[00:02:55] <Tiffany> " If k is empty, it's interpreted as zero-filled for input to the KDF. "

[00:21:36] <eternaleye> mcpherrin: MobaXterm is a much better alternative
[00:22:15] <eternaleye> mcpherrin: Last time I had to use windows (...for the half hour before my livecd finished downloading), I used that, and it was MASSIVELY superior
[00:22:28] <eternaleye> mcpherrin: http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/
[00:22:46] <eternaleye> mcpherrin: Side benefit: supports Mosh
[00:24:03] <Elaine> Talk about bloated, jeez.
[00:24:26] <Elaine> Is OpenSSH just plain not available for windows? :P
[00:24:59] <eternaleye> Elaine: A sensible terminal to _run it in_ is absent.
[00:25:17] <eternaleye> Elaine: CMD is terrible and crap, PowerShell is an object pipeline...
[00:25:31] <Elaine> Those are shells, they both run in the same terminal.
[00:26:06] <Elaine> ConEmu is decent.
[00:26:24] <eternaleye> Elaine: Huh, is that so? I always presumed they had different terminal emulation. Made more annoying by that windows calls the Explorer interface "the shell"
[00:27:42] <Elaine> yeah, it all uses the Console Host subsystem.
[00:28:37] <eternaleye> Mm
[00:29:29] <eternaleye> Elaine: Anyway, MobaXterm isn't all that bloated. It being a single-binary portable executable is convenient, support for Mosh is wonderful, and it having X11 forwarding support is quite nice indeed.
[00:29:55] <eternaleye> Elaine: You can also get stripped-down versions that have less plugins built in
[00:31:24] <Tiffany> windows 10 is supposed to get a proper terminal at least
[00:36:00] <sfackler> with openssh!
[00:45:15] *** Quits: brson (brson@moz-cfhap5.mtv2.mozilla.com) (Quit: leaving)
[00:48:56] <Ilari> Hmm... Windows... Does it still have "super-hidden" files (files that just won't show up in explorer, even if you turn display of hidden and system files on)?
[00:49:42] <Elaine> Ilari: yes.
[00:49:52] <Elaine> There are other ways of hiding files on Windows too.
[00:50:21] <Elaine> alternate data streams
[00:50:30] <Ilari> I ran into those years ago. Dir in cmd showed those, I don't remmeber if it required show hidden or show system switches.
[00:51:10] <Ilari> Or the stuff I ran into happened to be directories.
[00:52:18] <Ilari> And Internet Explorer cache happened to be somewhere inside one (and I needed something out of that cache), that's how I ran into those.
[01:07:40] <bascule> mcpherrin: Windows :(
[01:07:53] <bascule> mcpherrin: my existence has been blissfully Windows free for like 4 years now

[01:24:53] <Ilari> BTW, session-hash (THS fix) got approved (should hit RFC-Editor queue tomorrow).
[01:31:52] <Ilari> Also, even if TLS 1.3 surprisingly turns out to be even decent, there is still decommissioning all the present TLS 1.0 to 1.2(!) stuff... :-/
[01:38:44] <Ilari> And considering the amount of SSLv2(!!!) stuff still there, that is going to take a while to say the least. :-/
[01:38:56] <bascule> :(
[01:39:01] <bascule> SSLv3 diediedie
[01:39:19] <bascule> Ilari: so here's a thing I don't like
[01:39:27] <bascule> there are a lot of people who speak poorly of cipher agility
[01:39:33] <bascule> which is a perfectly good opinion to have
[01:39:40] <bascule> but they don't get on the TLS WG mailing list
[01:39:45] <bascule> and whine that things should be killed off
[01:39:55] <bascule> which is the most useful form of bitching about cipher agility that you can have, I think
[01:40:18] <bascule> cipher agility is a reality in TLS and no amount of absolutism will fix that
[01:40:20] <Ilari> TODO: Say that SHA-1 should be killed off TLS 1.3 too (broken and no real future).
[01:40:29] <bascule> yes, stuff like that
[01:40:54] <bascule> mandate the ClientHello signature algorithms(?) extension
[01:41:25] <Ilari> Basically, there is no one true cipher (even if we ignore all future attacks) for TLS.
[01:41:36] <bascule> it doesn't help these people are completely crazy, don't run TLS at scale, and constantly refer to 90s crypto with some sort of longing nostalgia
[01:41:54] <bascule> 1TCS is a bad idea in general, imo
[01:42:20] <bascule> it means when there is any kind of algorithmic failure (or protocol failure, or algorithm+protocol failure) there is no contingency plan
[01:42:31] <bascule> not that I'm a fan of proposed TLS contingency plans like FFDHE
[01:42:33] <bascule> to support RHEL5
[01:42:41] <bascule> but people are mad at me for mentioning how legacy ciphers broke Java
[01:42:44] <Ilari> AES-GCM and Chacha20-Poly1305. Both have major uses, even if both remain unbroken.
[01:42:46] <bascule> "you only care about Java!"
[01:42:52] <bascule> FFDHE people only care about RHEL5
[01:42:57] <bascule> YOU SHOULD NOT BE RUNNING RHEL5
[01:43:07] <bascule> it's a comedy and a tragedy to me
[01:43:22] <bascule> I need some James Mickens-style monologues to explain this
[01:43:43] <bascule> maybe I should ping USENIX
[01:44:05] <Ilari> I think I saw somebody argue that supporting EoL stuff is irresponsible.
[01:44:17] <bascule> we should just kill all the old shit
[01:44:19] <bascule> ALL OF IT
[01:44:32] <bascule> that's what I want
[01:44:45] <bascule> assume ECC as a baseline for key exchange
[01:44:59] <bascule> RSA is okay for legacy certificates used to sign ECDHE keys
[01:45:10] <bascule> but really they should move to ECDSA/EdDSA
[01:45:15] <bascule> FOR SPEED
[01:45:17] <bascule> and security
[01:45:34] <bascule> RSA is vulnerable to asymmetric computation attacks
[01:45:44] <bascule> so people are talking about introducing "puzzles" into TLS key exchange
[01:45:45] <bascule> fuck that
[01:46:12] <Elaine> b 23
[01:49:19] <Ilari> Hmm... Happen to know description of ECKDSA (not ECDSA nor ECGDSA, both of which I have seen descriptions of)?
[01:52:20] <bascule> perhaps I express myself poorly, but apparently it's avant garde to slap band aids on TLS instead of saying the old shit should diediedie and we should solve these problems by making TLS simpler instead of more complicated

[01:52:57] <Ilari> At least looks like RFC4492bis plans to kill off most of the curves.
[01:53:08] <bascule> seeeeeeeeeeeeeeeemsgood
[01:53:31] <bascule> fuck brainpool
[01:53:48] <bascule> Ilari: btw I made an ECC 101 poster
[01:54:04] <bascule> for the Crypto and Privacy Village at DEFCON
[01:54:09] <eternaleye> Ilari: It looks like it's specced in ISO 15946, based on the references I'm seeing
[01:54:15] <bascule> would love to have you cross-check it for factuality, clarity of explanations/terminology, etc
[01:55:11] <Ilari> bascule: Unfortunately, it is only curves 1-21 and FF01/FF02 (non-named). Which does not include brainpool. :-/
[01:55:24] <Ilari> Oops, 1-22, not 1-21.
[01:55:42] <Ilari> Lol: 22      secp256k1
[01:57:27] <Ilari> bascule: Then there was proposal for 1.3 for killing off all present curves except four (the fourth was NIST B-571(!), which seems somewhat used for some inexplicable reason).
[01:58:15] <eternaleye> Ilari: Mm, pg. 8 of ISO/IEC 15946-2 to be precise
[01:58:17] <Ilari> bascule: Got .pdf (with page size set to landscape A0 or something) or somesuch?
[02:00:21] <bascule> Ilari: can we keep the NIST curves people actually use (i.e. P-256) and kill everything else?
[02:00:59] <Ilari> BTW, the directory name (and repository name) for signature stuff I did was "ecidsa". :-)
[02:01:00] <bascule> Ilari: I feel I practically got laughed at for suggesting (FF)DHE diediedie
[02:01:05] <bascule> heh
[02:01:14] <bascule> yeah the CFRG stuff will be interesting
[02:01:26] <bascule> Ilari: PKCS#11 benefits no one and needs to diediedie too
[02:01:45] <bascule> Ilari: I went to this: http://www.w3.org/2012/webcrypto/webcrypto-next-workshop/
[02:02:17] <bascule> and my takeaway is that all of the present approaches to hardware encryption APIs are fucking shit and need to die in a fire because they are completely ill-equipped for modern use cases
[02:02:20] <Ilari> I am not quite sure what that I expands to. Either "Internet" directly, or something that expands to "Internet".
[02:02:55] <bascule> we use PKCS#11 to talk to our Yubikeys today (via CCID) interface
[02:02:58] <bascule> and use that for signatures
[02:03:07] <bascule> specifically via git notes
[02:03:19] <bascule> and I hate maintaining it
[02:03:21] <Ilari> Oh yeah, I needed to deal with PKCS#11 and CCID shit recently.
[02:03:22] <bascule> it doesn't work very well
[02:04:02] <bascule> I want Yubikeys to be accessible from web browsers
[02:04:06] <bascule> and I prefer the U2F model
[02:04:12] <Elaine> Ugh yes
[02:04:14] <bascule> where your signature key is unique per origin
[02:04:20] <Elaine> Fucking U2F deployment
[02:04:23] <Elaine> so slow :(
[02:04:26] <Ilari> (my ID card has smartcard chip. Has two certs on it).
[02:04:27] <bascule> :(
[02:04:49] <bascule> Elaine: upboat/comment here if you haven't already: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1065729
[02:04:54] <bascule> scumbag Mozilla
[02:05:33] <bascule> Ilari: my ID is a silly 9-digit number. America, FUCK YEAH!
[02:06:21] <Ilari> bascule: Oh, for extra fun: When I tried demo site for the card, the authentication worked, but signatures caused an attack alert (which is different from javascript blocking) from noscript.
[02:06:41] <bascule> unfortunately there's a minority portion of our country which I can only describe as suffering from a (possibly acquired) mental illness who opposes some form of modern, cryptographic identity issued at the national level
[02:07:17] <bascule> Ilari: when I was at the W3C WebCrypto hardware token forum, I brought up all the UX issues
[02:07:20] <bascule> nobody had any solutions
[02:07:26] <bascule> we broke out into sub-panels
[02:07:33] <bascule> I was like "I want to talk about UX!"
[02:07:34] <bascule> we talked
[02:07:40] <bascule> there were good, smart people involved
[02:07:43] <bascule> we had no solutions
[02:07:58] <bascule> I'm glad people cared
[02:08:23] <bascule> my view is you need to start from the user experience requirements and work backward
[02:08:45] <bascule> and the only way you can prevent people from signing attacker-controled data is to make that attack meaningless
[02:08:58] <bascule> by isolating signature keys using the same origin policy, at least in a browser
[02:09:21] <bascule> U2F already solves this problem
[02:09:44] <bascule> Brad Hill was there even
[02:09:46] <bascule> I was like
[02:09:49] <eternaleye> Ilari: There's also ISO/IEC 14888-3:2006
[02:09:51] <bascule> "use U2F, it's the only option"
[02:09:57] <bascule> but the whole room had a sunk cost in PKCS#11
[02:10:09] <bascule> PKCS#11 needs to die
[02:10:57] <bascule> I say that as someone who uses PKCS#11 as the underpinning of the signature scheme for all of our signed production artifacts
[02:11:00] <bascule> this is shit
[02:11:03] <bascule> I'm sorry we rolled it out
[02:11:13] <bascule> I feel sorry for the people who have to deal with this shit
[02:12:22] <Ilari> Here's the authentication UX when I use the card (in one service): 1) Insert the card. 2) Hit login 3) Select login via HST card. 4) Hit ready. 5) Browser asks for PIN, enter it. 5) Browser asks for cert to use. Hit OK as the only choice is correct. 6) Wait a bit. 7) Done.
[02:12:38] <bascule> oh god Ilari
[02:12:43] <bascule> here's U2F
[02:12:52] <bascule> you get to the second factor screen
[02:12:55] <bascule> you hit the button
[02:12:59] <bascule> you're authenticated!
[02:12:59] <bascule> DONE
[02:13:08] <bascule> so nice
[02:14:37] * bascule sees cmr opine on the U2F thread :D
[02:14:39] <Ilari> Oh, signatures are way more BS: One needs software for it. One nice piece of software requires OCSP, which requires registering on one site. Except that site is in foregin language most here can't decipher.
[02:15:13] <Elaine> :)
[02:16:31] <Ilari> bascule: Oh, and of the authentication methods supported by that site, that one is probably by far the least BS.
[02:17:11] <bascule> where cmr == Elaine I guess, heh
[02:17:14] <bascule> Elaine: thanks!
[02:17:14] <Elaine> yep
[02:20:26] <Ilari> bascule: Well, as far as authentication with client certs goes, that is pretty low amount of BS. Normally the amount of BS involved in client certs makes even super-advanced users give up.
[02:24:10] <Ilari> bascule: What could be useful: Finding the downsides of the 5 schemes, so perhaps one could combine things a bit to yield a better scheme (especially the 3 hash-signing Schnorr signature variants).
[02:25:39] <Ilari> (And it shouldn't be surprising which scheme I consider the worst).
[02:31:34] <mcpherrin> bascule: I need windows for my video games ;)
[02:31:49] <Ilari> As which I think is the second worst, I think Watson's scheme. The remaing three are pretty even (each with their own quirks)
[02:39:02] <eternaleye> mcpherrin: Personally, I like using PCI + USB passthrough to a VM
[02:40:53] <mcpherrin> eternaleye: I just have a seperate computer :P
[02:41:36] <mcpherrin> Not worth the hassle of getting passthru stuff to work right :P
[02:41:53] <mcpherrin> (and also to make multiseat work, since I have two places I use a computer)
[02:44:42] <bascule> mcpherrin: that's why I have a PS4! lol
[02:44:49] <bascule> and a Wii U
[02:44:51] <bascule> :D
[02:45:10] <bascule> Ilari: client cert UX in a browser is nothing short of atrocious
[02:45:25] <bascule> and I pretty much ignore the UX opinions of anyone who agrees with that statement
[02:45:38] <bascule> because to me that's like a litmus test of "can you recognize bad design"

[03:01:53] <eternaleye> bascule: I'd probably spell out 'primitive root', honestly. Something like "g=2 is not a primitive root modulo 17, because some clock values are not reachable with powers of two"
[03:03:53] <Elaine> such a strange juxtaposition of actual math and analogy, but maybe that's just my academic bias
[03:19:12] <bascule> eternaleye: there's not really enough space for a long-winded explanation, heh

[03:19:35] <eternaleye> bascule: Fair enough
[03:32:36] <bascule> Ilari: my biggest beef with client certs is I worship at the altar of the same origin policy and client certs don't follow it
[03:32:42] <bascule> at least in browsers
[03:32:51] <bascule> we heavily utilize client certs / "MTLS" at Square
[03:33:06] <bascule> everything is mutually authenticated and authorized via ACLs or bearer tokens

[14:38:21] <Ilari> bascule: Just sent quite strongly anti-SHA1 message to tls wg list.
[14:54:44] <Tiffany> are preimage attacks a lot harder than collision attacks?
[14:57:27] <Tiffany> collision attacks don't seem to break that much stuff
[14:57:41] <Tiffany> mostly things like digital signatures where the signature is of the hash instead of the actual content
[14:58:38] <Tiffany> second preimage is the most scary
[14:59:04] <Tiffany> breaks checksums, breaks HMACs, breaks pretty much every use of a hash function I can think of
[15:00:05] <Tiffany> actually, does second preimage break HMAC?
[15:01:08] <Ilari> Tiffany: Well, Collision attacks are very easy against MD5. Preimage attack against MD5 is far beyond current capaiblity (in open literature).
[15:01:22] <Tiffany> yeah
[15:01:42] <Tiffany> I mostly meant in terms of cryptanalysis
[15:02:10] <Tiffany> both SHA-1 and MD5 have crippling collision attacks, but neither has very good preimage attacks
[15:03:27] <Tiffany> "Furthermore, differential and rectangle distinguishers can lead to second-preimage attacks. HMAC with the full version of MD4 can be forged with this knowledge. "
[15:04:27] <Tiffany> it's pretty amazing how broken MD4 is
[15:05:39] <Ilari> Heh, blake2b reaches quite close to MD4 in speed on modern hardware.
[15:08:16] <Ilari> This despite security requirements exponentially greater (some attacks needing to be >10^100 times harder).
[15:11:37] <Tiffany> "The  DES  algorithm  itself has a few quirks which make the use of the crypt() interface a very poor choice for anything other than password authentication.  If you are planning on using the crypt() interface for a cryptography project, don't do it: get a good book  on  encryption and one of the widely available DES libraries."
[15:11:49] <Tiffany> thanks for the advice, manpage on crypt
[15:14:43] <Tiffany> there should really be more danger signs on old broken stuff
[15:18:18] <Tiffany> wikipedia says that SipHash is safe to use as a MAC
[15:18:21] <Tiffany> but it's only 64 bits...
[15:19:05] <Tiffany> well, the key is 128 bit
[15:19:14] <Tiffany> is this thing really safe as a MAC?
[15:22:29] <Tiffany> I'm looking through hash functions on wikipedia trying to find one that has a viable preimage attack
[15:22:37] <Tiffany> but all I keep finding are obscure functions that claim to be provably secure
[15:23:37] <eternaleye> Tiffany: I'd search for "preimage" on eprint.iacr.org
[15:25:15] <Tiffany> plenty of attacks, but I can't make out which ones are viable without reading the abstract of every single one
[15:26:43] <Tiffany> there's a 2^73 preimage against MD2

[15:35:46] <bascule> apparently I got mentioned there
[15:38:36] <Lurkin> Why is SHA-3 going to be a thing?  I thought SHA2 with sufficient rounds would be unbreakable in an individuals lifetime?
[15:40:06] <bascule> attacks always get better
[15:40:48] <Tiffany> in case a significant attack on SHA-2 does show up, nobody wants to be running around like headless chickens
[15:42:51] <Tiffany> although they usually have a fair amount of warning
[15:43:16] <Tiffany> a series of attacks improving on the last until finally it gets down to about 2^60 and everyone has to switch

[15:55:22] <mcpherrin> Hooray, Tata
[15:56:53] <Tiffany> where did you get that from lurkin?
[15:56:58] <Tiffany> ASICs are not why SHA-2 is being replaced
[15:57:14] <Tiffany> ASICs are why you should never use SHA-2 for password hashing, sure
[15:57:56] <mcpherrin> SHA-3 has a lot smaller gatecount than SHA-2 was my understanding
[15:58:04] <Tiffany> oh
[15:59:37] <Tiffany> according to stack overflow, the SHA-3 competition was started because of fears that SHA-2 would be broken with the same attacks that had broken MD5 and SHA-1
[16:04:57] <Tiffany> hm
[16:05:06] <eternaleye> Lurkin: SHA-2 also has known issues
[16:05:14] <eternaleye> Lurkin: Such as length-extension
[16:05:35] <eternaleye> Lurkin: Which IIRC is a fundamental issue of the Merkle-Damgärd construction
[16:05:39] <Tiffany> it looks like the reason keccak was chosen because of being sufficiently different from SHA-2, being fast in hardware, and of course security
[16:05:48] <Ilari> Bad joke: Two good hashes came out of SHA-3 competion, both with 2 in name. :->
[16:06:08] <eternaleye> Ilari: Blake2 and ?
[16:06:18] <eternaleye> Ilari: I'd also consider Skein a good hash
[16:07:15] <Ilari> eternaleye: Yeah, Skein is pretty good (especially given the kitchen sink it is).
[16:08:02] <Tiffany> apparently the OpenSSL vulnerability only affects 1.0.1 and 1.0.2, not 1.0.0 or 0.9.8?
[16:08:22] <Ilari> Something that came to mind: Is the variable output length in Skein of similar utility as XOF (except one needs to know the length before hashing)?
[16:10:20] <eternaleye> Ilari: XOF?
[16:10:44] <Ilari> eternaleye: The constructs like SHAKE256 (variable output length version of SHA-3).
[16:10:59] <eternaleye> Mm
[16:11:41] <Ilari> Because output widths greater than pipe width are definitely defined behaviour.
[16:11:46] <eternaleye> Ilari: Well, IIRC Skein is a sponge construction - I don't know that one _does_ need to know the length before hashing
[16:12:04] <Ilari> eternaleye: Output length, not message length.
[16:12:18] <eternaleye> Ilari: Yes.
[16:12:49] <Ilari> eternaleye: And one does need to know that (it is part of parameters block that comes very early on).
[16:13:03] <eternaleye> Ilari: Sponge functions ingest variable data to fixed state, and then can be "squeezed" for variable output
[16:13:08] <eternaleye> Ilari: Ah, I see
[16:13:17] <eternaleye> Ilari: For some reason, I thought the variable output mode was the bare sponge
[16:13:29] <Tiffany> sponge functions sound like they'd be good for implementing a whitening function or PRNG
[16:13:56] <eternaleye> Tiffany: Entirely possible, especially with state forking
[16:14:05] <Ilari> One thing to beware with SHAKE128/SHAKE256: The XOF outputs of same message are truncations of each other. Not true with Skein running with variable output.
[16:14:21] <eternaleye> Tiffany: "reseeding" is just re-forking the state from a "master" that true randomness is continually fed into
[16:15:17] <eternaleye> Tiffany: Of course, one can also build a sponge from PRF digest + stream cipher
[16:15:35] <Tiffany> I've heard of ChaCha being used as an RNG
[16:22:24] <eternaleye> Tiffany: Really, stream ciphers _are_ PRNGs
[16:22:26] <eternaleye> Tiffany: The only real difference is it's called "keying" rather than "seeding"
[16:22:27] <eternaleye> Tiffany: "reseeding"  &c is really just building wrappers on top of it.
[16:24:52] <Ilari> "I think that the main reason we haven't got client auth working on a large scale is that the administration and usability issues that impact the Web Server PKI are even more severe for client PKI."

[16:46:48] <bascule> U2F on the other hand is amazing
[16:47:26] <bascule> Ilari: client certs don't follow the same origin policy, and punt the concern of what certs/keys go to what sites to the user
[16:47:29] <bascule> which is terrible

[19:49:31] <Ilari> (It might be possible to do nasty hacks with Webcrypto or something, but those are rather nasty).
[19:51:25] <Ilari> But webcrypto impiles Javascript, and it is very easy to create severe usability problems with Javascript.
[19:52:36] <Ilari> E.g. If something looks like a link, it has to be proper anchor with href pointing to a sane place. Anything else is asking for usability problems.
[19:54:57] <Elaine> Just had a panic moment with my yubikey, it stopped responding to button presses >_> cleaned it with some alcohol and it's fine though.
[19:58:01] <Ilari> Heh, reminds me of one incident with LHC. Loose cable causing magnet quench sensor to not work when it was needed (fortunately there was second sensor to trigger LBDS quickly enough).
[19:59:17] <Ilari> Also, some presentation had: Spurious quench detection: ~5 hours of downtime. Quench not detected: ???? hours of downtime. Quench sensor not working: No downtime but dagerous situation.
[20:00:23] <Ilari> (IIRC, in 2008 there was rather serious incident there, repairs took over a year)
[20:00:42] <Elaine> ouch
[20:01:34] <Tiffany> I remember that the LHC ended up having an incident which caused a rupture in liquid helium lines that cool the superconducting magnets
[20:01:43] <Tiffany> and the repairs did take over a year
[20:02:00] <Ilari> It has been estimated that just having to swap one magnet would be like 6 weeks of downtime (nothing like SPS, where they swapped a magnet in like 24 hours while ago).
[20:02:08] <Ilari> Tiffany: Yeah, that.
[20:02:17] <eternaleye> bascule: I calculated it out, and Snow has almost twice the overhead of HIP when pitting Snow's *best* case against HIP's *worst*: https://github.com/zrm/snow/issues/1
[20:02:42] <Tiffany> what is snow?
[20:03:16] <Tiffany> oh
[20:03:27] <eternaleye> bascule: HIP's ESP/BEET transport wrapped in UDP for NAT hole-punching is 26 bytes overhead; Snow needs at least 40, and with IPv6 it adds _60 bytes_ per packet
[20:05:00] <Ilari> Oh great... Webcrypto contains a nasty security hole for certain usecases.
[20:07:35] <Ilari> -> If you want any resembelance of security for origin, HPKP is a must.
[20:07:49] <Ilari> (As big footgun it is)
[20:10:48] <eternaleye> Oh, miscalculated: Snow is more than double, as it's 60 bytes overhead with IPv4 and *80* with v6
[20:12:05] <Ilari> And of course, Chrome behaviour with HPKP makes it even more of a footgun.
[20:25:04] <Tiffany> what's chrome's behaviour with HPKP?
[20:26:14] <Ilari> Tiffany: Certificates up the chain can get replaced (even SHA-256 ones) and if HPKP points to replaced certificate, things break.
[20:29:31] <Ilari> Also for fun, it seems that LHC intensity is currently limited by software(!) problems (preventing setting up of some hardware that would be needed for higher intensities).
[20:30:08] <Tiffany> I don't worry all that much about packet overhead because IPv6 alone is 40 bytes
[20:31:00] <Tiffany> although I guess in snow's case it is pretty significant
[20:32:09] <Ilari> Still, two beams with 16 trillion protons each, each at 6.5 trillion eV is not something to be toyed with...
[20:41:14] <eternaleye> Tiffany: With any tunnel, overhead matters quite a bit
[20:42:44] <eternaleye> Tiffany: Especially if you want to do clever things like onion routing, which multiplies overhead by the number of hops.

[21:20:05] <bascule> Elaine: why aren't you using libsodium?
[21:20:15] <bascule> eternaleye: lol, nice
[21:20:24] <bascule> eternaleye: yeah Snow is like... yawn
[21:20:28] <bascule> they're using RSA?
[21:20:30] <bascule> wat
[21:20:54] <bascule> one of my baseline requirements for "good crypto" is: are they using RSA? if so, they fail
[21:22:08] <Ilari> Also, it is possible (if inefficient) even today to use those candidate PQ schemes in such way that failure of such scheme would only be meaningful in quantum context.
[21:22:08] <Elaine> bascule: I'm experimenting with protocol design, afaict when I looked at libsodium it didn't expose many "guts"
[21:22:47] <Ilari> Elaine: Yeah, that's kinda the point with libsodium.
[21:22:52] <Elaine> Ilari: I know :P
[21:23:03] <bascule> Elaine: what guts do you want?
[21:23:10] <bascule> it exposes scalar multiplication for Curve25519
[21:23:23] <bascule> I wish it exposed it for Ed25519
[21:23:38] <Elaine> Where in the docs is that?
[21:23:55] <Elaine> I did poke around for it.
[21:24:48] <Elaine> I see it in the source now.
[21:25:12] <Tiffany> I think I just got BoxN to work
[21:25:20] <Tiffany> it would be nice if there were test vectors
[21:25:32] <bascule> test vectors for what?
[21:25:41] <Tiffany> noise
[21:26:00] <Tiffany> is there a way to print a byte array as a glob of base16 using println!?
[21:26:52] <Elaine> Tiffany: not directly I don't think (need to use a print!("{:x}", byte) loop)
[21:27:44] <Tiffany> is it just me or does the rust documentation load really slow?
[21:28:25] <eternaleye> bascule: HIP has ECDSA and RSA sigs as MTI, and the only KEX is [EC]DHE. 1536-FF-DHE is MTI; NIST P-384 is a SHOULD
[21:30:43] <eternaleye> bascule: Yes, they got those last two backwards.
[21:30:47] <eternaleye> bascule: At best.
[21:32:21] <Tiffany> hm
[21:32:23] <Tiffany> that's weird
[21:32:28] <Tiffany> there shouldn't be any prologue data
[21:33:37] <bascule> eternaleye: heh
[21:33:58] <eternaleye> bascule: The sad thing? It's *still* better than anyone else has done.
[21:34:16] <bascule> hahaha
[21:34:18] <eternaleye> bascule: Groups are always defined, ephemeral is the only way to KEX, etc.
[21:34:46] <Tiffany> oh, that's why
[21:34:47] <Ilari> Doesn't Tokbind/unbearable have PKCS#1 v1.5 sigs? Despite the fact that those should have been dumped a long ago?
[21:34:52] <Tiffany> :x doesn't pad out to 2 digits
[21:34:53] <Tiffany> oops
[21:35:51] <bascule> Ilari: oh god, does it?!
[21:35:58] <bascule> Ilari: ungh
[21:35:59] <bascule> wtf
[21:36:12] <eternaleye> bascule: They have to live up to their name _somehow_...
[21:36:25] <bascule> I have been making that pun since they started, lol
[21:36:30] <Tiffany> :02x
[21:37:57] <Ilari> bascule: Also, it has construct much like SignatureAndHashAlgorithm from TLS... And then uses confusing numbers: In TLS, 3 is ECDSA. In Tokbind, 3 is ECDSA with P-256.
[21:38:10] <bascule> :(
[21:47:34] <eternaleye> bascule: One nice thing about the HIP base exchange: The WG verified it as SIGMA-compliant, which saves a LOT of potential trouble

[21:51:12] <Tiffany> so my implementation of noise has explicit descriptors, and it's currently 375 lines long

[21:58:38] *** bpugh is now known as bpugh_
[21:58:40] *** bpugh_ is now known as bpugh
[22:05:52] <bascule> Tiffany: nice!
[22:06:07] <bascule> Tiffany: you should annoince it on the Noise ML ;)
[22:06:10] <bascule> announce...
[22:07:51] <Tiffany> I'm not terribly confident about it right now
[22:07:55] <Tiffany> maybe when I have handshakes
[22:08:08] <bascule> it's okay, nobody is, including Trevor? ;)
[22:08:45] <Tiffany> I'm currently just calling it 'libnoise', unsure if I should pick a more creative name first
[22:10:20] <bascule> someone already ganked "noise" on crates.io :(
[22:10:37] <Tiffany> is it another squatter?
[22:10:47] <bascule> don't think so
[22:10:53] <bascule> a procedural noise generation library?
[22:11:03] <Tiffany> oh
[22:11:07] <Tiffany> it's owned by noise-rs
[22:30:26] <eternaleye> Tiffany: Maybe call it "susurrus"? Low-level noise :D
[22:31:02] <eternaleye> Tiffany: Or for extra pun, "susurrust"
[22:33:36] <Tiffany> so I was thinking about how one would unify all the different noise configurations into a compatible protocol
[22:34:08] <Tiffany> and I figured that you could just jam a structure containing information like the presence of a PSK and the descriptor configuration into the prologue
[22:34:28] <Tiffany> but then I looked and none of these handshakes do DH in the first message, thus leaving the prologue unauthenticated: NN, NX, KN, KX, XX, IN
[22:36:10] <Tiffany> I suppose it is eventually authenticated
[22:36:17] <Tiffany> the next message will authenticate h
