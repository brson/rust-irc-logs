[09:08:43] <mcpherrin> so this exists
[09:08:54] <Tobba> yep
[09:08:57] <Tobba> kinda underused
[09:09:30] <bjz> o/
[09:09:33] <bjz> hehe
[09:09:44] <bjz> it is where cmr and I complain about the weather
[09:10:08] <mcpherrin> Man, the weather.
[09:10:15] <mcpherrin> Big drought in California.
[09:10:25] <bjz> he complains about how his hair freezes as soon as he steps out outside (-30C)
[09:10:40] <bjz> I complain about living in an oven (46C)
[09:11:07] <bjz> although thankfull that was only for a couple of days
[09:11:22] <mcpherrin> it's been about 10C to 20C in the SF bay area for a long time ;)
[09:11:26] <mcpherrin> Sunny every day
[09:11:35] <bjz> *drools*
[09:11:47] <bjz> how bad is it in summer btw
[09:11:57] <mcpherrin> 20C to 30C
[09:12:02] <bjz> nice!
[09:12:13] <bjz> nothing over that really?
[09:12:17] <mcpherrin> Rare
[09:12:20] <bjz> awesome
[09:12:28] <mcpherrin> I have only lived here a few months
[09:12:38] <mcpherrin> before that I was in Canada, much colder
[09:12:39] <bjz> I *might* be heading there this coming summer
[09:12:59] <bjz> ahh
[09:13:04] <mcpherrin> When I visited my parents in december, it was -40 the entire time :P
[09:13:20] <bjz> Canada is like australia - huge and mostly uninhabitable
[09:13:31] <mcpherrin> Yeah :P
[09:13:33] <bjz> :P
[09:14:09] <mcpherrin> I've only been to Australia pre-birth :P
[09:14:10] <bjz> People think it's crazy we only have 22 million people
[09:14:33] <bjz> when Australia is about the same size as the US
[09:14:39] <mcpherrin> A lot more of Canada is habitable than currently is
[09:14:46] <bjz> ah
[09:14:54] <bjz> hopefully is will stay that way
[09:14:56] <mcpherrin> But yeah the whole tundra is ... wasteland
[09:15:07] <bjz> but I doubt it - with all the warming
[09:15:21] <bjz> apparently it hits the hardest near the poles
[09:16:17] <bjz> which part of canada btw, mcpherrin?
[09:16:30] <mcpherrin> Rural northern Ontario :)
[09:17:40] <mcpherrin> Then university in Waterloo, Ontario
[09:17:52] <bjz> is that abit west from the french part?
[09:18:06] <bjz> I don't know enough about Canada
[09:18:35] <mcpherrin> So Quebec is the concentration of French, but up in rural northern ontario it's pretty bilingual
[09:18:48] <mcpherrin> next province over, and historically mingled while settling
[09:19:56] <bjz> neat
[09:20:06] <bjz> sounds like an interesting country
[09:20:16] <mcpherrin> Oddly enough, my manager here in California is french-canadian
[09:20:23] <bjz> this is beautiful: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Algonquin_Cache_Lake_Lookout.JPG
[09:20:39] <bjz> (from the ontario page)
[09:20:58] <mcpherrin> Yeah, basically what my back yard looks like :)
[09:21:10] <mcpherrin> (Not the rocks though, I'm too close to james bay for rocks :P
[09:21:14] <bjz> well, what it used to look like :D
[09:21:21] <bjz> (sorry)
[09:21:33] <mcpherrin> haha, yeah
[09:21:49] <bjz> have you moved a long distance beofre
[09:21:53] <mcpherrin> I haven't really got a permanent home in California yet so I still think of things like "my back yard" as my parents 
[09:22:00] <bjz> yeah
[09:22:03] <bjz> it's weird
[09:22:09] <Tobba> I live in sweden
[09:22:13] <Tobba> how everythign look right now: http://excite-english.com/blog/uploaded_images/slush-709389.jpg
[09:22:14] <bjz> the strange displaced feeling
[09:22:21] <Tobba> its terrible
[09:22:29] <bjz> DIRTY SNOW SLUSH
[09:23:10] <mcpherrin> https://www.dropbox.com/s/kvbj7944669turt/2014-01-01%2013.00.36.jpg
[09:23:19] <mcpherrin> ^ what I left behind
[09:23:34] <Tobba> the only worse thing is when it all melts over the day because the winter was hot as fuck
[09:23:36] <dbaupp> Tobba: apparently there was very little snow this year?
[09:23:41] <Tobba> then all freezes up over the night
[09:23:51] <Tobba> yeah there were only like 1 or 2 weeks of winter in the middle of january
[09:23:58] <dbaupp> oh
[09:24:02] <Tobba> its all melting up now again
[09:24:06] <mcpherrin> https://www.dropbox.com/s/vy9c8ai2nqij1ez/2013-12-28%2011.07.26.jpg Also, winter swimming!
[09:24:15] <mcpherrin> Tobba: Do you swim in winter or is that just finlanders :)
[09:24:21] <bjz> isn't the jet stream all messed up atm?
[09:24:21] <Tobba> mostly the finlanders
[09:24:36] * dbaupp lived in Sweden for 6 months in 2012... had snow from november
[09:24:38] <bjz> for you north americans?
[09:25:01] <Tobba> tbh I cant really remember 2012s winter
[09:25:07] <Tobba> it was 2011 or 2012 that was brutal though
[09:26:13] <dbaupp> when I was there, there was no snow and it wasn't particularly cold until one weekend when it crashed to -20
[09:26:46] <Tobba> thats basicaly what tends to happen sometimes
[09:26:48] <dbaupp> and then there was so much that arlanda closed & busses stopped etc. etc.
[09:26:50] <Tobba> bonus if it rained the day before
[09:27:17] <Tobba> extra bonus if I'm in a hurry and dont notice the ice
[09:27:30] <dbaupp> hah, fun times :P
[09:27:34] <mcpherrin> flash freezes are the wrost
