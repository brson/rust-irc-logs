[01:21:11] <niconii> so i've been looking into what it'd take to make a pure-rust replacement for ncurses
[01:21:22] <niconii> as one might expect, unicode mucks everything up :D
[01:21:32] <fmtq> as it shoul
[01:21:33] <Elaine> it'd mostly just be tedious
[01:22:09] <fmtq> Elaine: why the nick change? it confused me before
[01:22:21] <Elaine> fmtq: reasons.
[01:22:32] <fmtq> uh ok
[01:23:24] <niconii> most CJK characters are two columns wide (except some are ambiguous depending on whether you're in a CJK/non-CJK context), right-to-left text exists...
[01:23:38] <niconii> unicode-width is helpful for the first case as least
[01:24:24] <niconii> combining characters are a thing, of course

[01:28:14] <Havvy> You can always make your own string type.
[01:28:35] <rootnode> gooood morning
[01:31:16] <FreeFull> niconii: Sometimes, adding a character will make things shorter, with arabic text. That might not apply to monospace stuff though
[01:31:34] <Elaine> monospace is a myth
[01:31:51] <niconii> i'm not really familiar with arabic, unfortunately, so that could get messy in a hurry
[01:32:05] <FreeFull> niconii: The person who wrote rustbox wants to make it pure rust according to the readme, but right now it's just bindings to termbox
[01:33:55] <Tiffany> Monospace considered harmful
[01:34:39] <Tiffany> I use source sans pro in hexchat 
[01:35:15] <Tiffany> I wish I could draw text diagrams without needing monospace 
[01:35:20] <FreeFull> I use irssi, with DejaVu Sans Mono
[01:39:39] <Elaine> is it even possible to do correct fixed-width text layout?
[01:40:37] <eddyb> Elaine: Hasklig screws a bit with certain editors
[01:44:56] <niconii> Elaine: there's no one-size-fits-all layout, it's locale-dependent because of historical reasons with CJK encodings
[01:46:32] <niconii> Elaine: also... iirc even if you handle right-to-left stuff correctly, arabic still ends up looking pretty gnarly
[01:47:59] <niconii> hmm, actually i suppose it's not so bad as long as your terminal doesn't suck
[01:51:55] <niconii> http://i.stack.imgur.com/45igH.png
[01:52:00] <niconii> ...yeah this is more what i was thinking of
[01:52:18] <niconii> seems like you *can* get it to look right though
[01:53:49] *** Joins: Quxxy (chatzilla@moz-0nv.jkp.167.59.IP)
[01:57:01] <Tiffany> Elaine: I think so, but nobody does
[01:58:42] <Tiffany> At least, to an extent that ascii art still works, just don't throw in any Unicode 
[01:59:20] <niconii> there's a fair amount of things you need to be aware of to do it right
[01:59:41] <niconii> if you forget about the existence of everything but the latin alphabet... yeah you're gonna have issues
[02:01:33] <Quxxy> Ooh, ooh!  We talkin' 'bout Unicode again? :P
[02:02:33] <niconii> Quxxy: yup
[02:03:12] <niconii> in the context of a curses replacement and monospace layouts
[02:03:23] <Quxxy> Oooh; nasty
[02:03:50] <Quxxy> Have you discussed half-width vs. full-width? :P
[02:03:56] <niconii> yep
[02:04:47] <niconii> and the fact that some are just flat-out ambiguous, and depend on whether the locale is non-CJK or CJK
[02:05:19] <Quxxy> Didn't know that
[02:05:27] <niconii> ...actually it's probably not even as simple as "check the locale"
[02:05:29] <Quxxy> What about mixed LTR/RTL text?
[02:05:37] <Quxxy> Actually, I wonder how arabic even works in monospace
[02:05:44] <Quxxy> (or *if*)
[02:05:44] <Elaine> Quxxy: like this: http://i.stack.imgur.com/45igH.png
[02:05:46] <niconii> brought that up too
[02:06:10] <niconii> there are screenshots of arabic that actually looks decent
[02:06:44] <Quxxy> I like how you phrase that; "there exist screenshots of arabic that doesn't look like someone sneezed noodles on to a monitor"
[02:07:07] <Elaine> Sneezed noodles are usually in smaller chunks.
[02:07:14] <Elaine> oh actually yeah that's accurate
[02:07:21] <Elaine> I was comparing to actual arabic text in my head
[02:08:08] <Quxxy> Presumably, you brought up the supercombiner
[02:08:30] <niconii> here's an example where it actually, y'know... works: http://i.imgur.com/ZMxFnN8.png
[02:08:31] <Elaine> not it specifically
[02:09:05] <Quxxy> Well, I'm out of ideas for how to mess it up, then :P
[02:09:11] <niconii> well, i mentioned combining characters
[02:09:21] <niconii> i didn't mention terrifying abominations
[02:10:26] <niconii> anyway, even if you're aware of all of those, there's still a lot of things that could go wrong
[02:10:38] <Tiffany> Supercombiner is something that it is typically undesirable to render correctly 
[02:10:46] <niconii> for instance... what if you overwrite a fullwidth character with a halfwidth character?

[07:51:12] <eddyb> oh you might have figured that one out
[07:51:22] <eddyb> 3. where did you get rustc?
[07:52:31] <eddyb> I modified rustup to patch everything. Tobba and Ericson2314 (IIRC) have a Nix expression that does everything for you, just wants a date for the nightly
[07:53:09] <eddyb> Quxxy: https://github.com/Ericson2314/nixos-configuration/blob/dell/user/.nixpkgs/rustc-nightly.nix
[07:53:59] <eddyb> Quxxy: https://github.com/Ericson2314/nixos-configuration/blob/dell/user/.nixpkgs/config.nix#L80-L83
[07:54:04] <eddyb> that's how it's using it
[07:54:27] <eddyb> Quxxy: if you set the hash to some dummy value, you'll get an error with the hash of the actual file, so that's really easy to solve
[07:56:01] <Quxxy> eddyb: 1. because it's my own damn fault for installing this thing when I *really* wasn't looking to learn it properly; I seriously underestimated how much effort it would take
[07:56:08] <Quxxy> 2. yeah, figured
[07:56:21] <Quxxy> 3. I downloaded the latest nightly tar.gz
[07:56:40] <Quxxy> I didn't run rustup because I wasn't sure if I still needed root, or if it'd even work with NixOS
[07:56:47] <eddyb> it's not that hard, actually, I did it manually for Servo
[07:56:53] <Quxxy> And I searched the package list for rustc and only found a really out-of-date one
[07:57:09] <eddyb> find bin | xargs -n1 patchelf --interpreter /run/current-system/sw/lib/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 --set-rpath /run/current-system/sw/lib/
[07:57:20] <eddyb> where bin is the directory you have your binaries in
[07:57:35] <Quxxy> The other problem was that the instructions I found for patching binaries didn't work
[07:57:38] <eddyb> (for servo there's mutiple ones)
[07:57:46] <Quxxy> It referred to an env. variable that I don't have so... *shrugs*
[07:57:52] <Quxxy> Will try that
[07:57:59] <eddyb> yeah, because those instructions are the correct ones
[07:58:10] <eddyb> they are also for a Nix derivation

[07:59:07] <eddyb> Quxxy: UNIX is broken
[07:59:34] <eddyb> and this is one of the things that makes NixOS incompatible with binary blobs
[07:59:53] <eddyb> Quxxy: ls lib/**.so should work too
[08:00:18] <eddyb> heck, ls .servo/**/bin/* would've worked for the other one for me, as well
[08:00:23] <eddyb> or even echo
[08:00:55] <eddyb> Quxxy: anyways, one of the tricky bits is that .so's need patched, too. otherwise it would be just one simple command

[08:28:44] <eddyb> instead of running ./mach build -d, I run nix-shell --command './mach build -d'
[08:28:47] <Quxxy> The problem is that this is all still more-or-less gibberish to me

[08:30:56] <Quxxy> Mmm
[08:31:02] <eddyb> https://nixos.org/patchelf.html
[08:31:48] <eddyb> Quxxy: patching is necessary because there's no global library directory
[08:32:16] <Quxxy> Mmm
[08:32:18] <eddyb> "pure" nix binaries use absolute paths inside /nix/store for their dependencies (including ld-linux.so, the dynamic loader)
[08:32:36] <Quxxy> Right; which is how it solves the sxs problem
[08:32:45] <eddyb> sxs?
[08:32:49] <Quxxy> Side-by-side
[08:32:53] <Quxxy> Windows terminology :P
[08:33:04] <eddyb> I knew it was windows, but I didn't know what it stood for
[08:33:16] <Quxxy> Well, cargo is starting, at least; let's see if it can build...
[08:33:17] <eddyb> so there's like 3 ways to get something going
[08:33:29] <eddyb> abuse /run/sw/current-system/sw/ as traditional /
[08:33:49] <eddyb> use nix-shell (with a default.nix file, like my servo one) - this is good for development work
[08:33:58] <eddyb> or create a derivation (package)
[08:34:01] <Quxxy> (On modern Windows, there's a "winsxs" directory that contains shitloads of hard links to every version of every library; the "final solution" to DLL Hell :P)
[08:34:23] <eddyb> with minimal work you can use the rustc-nightly package I linked
[08:34:50] <eddyb> if you want me to, I can explain how to set that up
[08:34:58] <Quxxy> I didn't know about /run/blah before, but I vaguely got the other two
[08:35:14] <eddyb> well, if you look at the patchelf commands...
[08:35:38] <Quxxy> The ones I saw on the wiki used $NIX_GCC
[08:35:51] <eddyb> yeah, because that's the proper way
[08:35:54] <Quxxy> Which I assumed was either out of date, or something that was only defined within the package system
[08:35:59] <eddyb> the latter
[08:36:02] <Quxxy> Right
[08:36:08] <eddyb> or both, I'm not sure
[08:36:12] <Quxxy> :3
[08:36:37] <eddyb> so: https://github.com/Ericson2314/nixos-configuration/blob/dell/user/.nixpkgs/rustc-nightly.nix

[08:39:10] <eddyb> Quxxy: neither

[10:00:27] <eddyb> Quxxy: the OS isn't stable
[10:00:37] <fkaa> say i want to make a parser/lexer in rust, should i write it by hand or are there some funstuff to help me out?
[10:01:23] <eddyb> Quxxy: using a stable release is just a sure way to keep it old
[10:01:25] <eddyb> (forever)
[10:01:38] <Quxxy> eddyb: Fair enough; I only ask because if that is likely to upgrade a lot of packages, I'll try to finish this profiling stuff first, since an upgrade will likely take at least an hour

[14:03:18] <eddyb> nope

[16:42:24] <Tiffany> weird and shiny?
[16:42:42] <RC9> XMPPwocky, didnt you mention you were going to publish more on that TF2 RCE bug through sprays today
[16:43:02] <RC9> if so... when :D im interested in reading more
[16:43:08] <Tiffany> I can't think of any reason why a rock would be weird and shiny other than having a very low roughness value
[16:43:17] <Tiffany> unreal does use a proper physically-based rendering pipeline
[16:44:41] <niconii> don't know the context, but speaking of rocks... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xuXkVzBdJQ

[17:24:25] <zofrex> Tiffany: I dunno why I guess it's a mix of lack of physically based rendering and lack of subsurface scattering (for rock-like things and people-like things respectively) but a lot of things in games always look weird and smooth and shiny

[18:00:04] <fkaa> i suspect quantum-physically based rendering is going to be the next big thing
[18:00:49] <Elaine> context?
[18:01:14] <fkaa> none, i don't even know what quantum physics is exactly
[18:01:22] <fkaa> assuming it's not physics
[18:01:53] <fkaa> should've added /s
[18:02:05] <Tiffany> the main thing about PBR is that you use real photometric and radiometric units instead of halfassing it
[18:02:33] <Tiffany> phong model is pretty awful for getting scenes to look realistic
[18:02:46] <Tiffany> I have never seen a phong system which actually maintains conservation of energy
[18:02:47] <Elaine> fkaa: so why do you suspect that? or does the /s apply everywhere
[18:02:57] <fkaa> everywhere
[18:03:01] <Elaine> k
[18:03:27] <fkaa> i feel like making a pbr example/demo too
[18:03:43] <Tiffany> my engine supports basic PBR
[18:03:56] <fkaa> but it feels like to fully show it off you'd need a full scene
[18:04:20] <fkaa> Tiffany: in rust?
[18:04:26] <Tiffany> no
[18:04:38] <Tiffany> you can make rust bindings pretty easily, though
[18:04:55] <Tiffany> I made some basic ones a while ago, but they'd have to be rewritten because of the syntax changes
[18:06:10] <fkaa> got a link?
[18:06:26] <Tiffany> I don't think I have the bindings anymore
[18:06:28] <Elaine> fkaa: https://github.com/TheCodeLab/IntenseLogic
[18:06:29] <Tiffany> they were really basic
[18:06:32] <Elaine> is the engine
[18:06:44] <fkaa> intense!
[18:06:49] <Tiffany> beware, all the information I've written is super out of date
[18:06:55] <fkaa> oo, C
[18:07:03] <fkaa> feels pretty exotic to me
[18:07:12] <Tiffany> most engines are written in C++
[18:07:12] <fkaa> i've only done c++
[18:07:45] <Tiffany> it also doesn't actually run on windows at the moment
[18:08:11] <Tiffany> I don't have access to a windows machine with which to diagnose a segfault
[18:08:39] <Tiffany> it will probably stop running on OS X if I decide to use vulkan and apple doesn't make a U-turn
[18:09:43] <Tiffany> the architecture of the rendering pipeline is data oriented
[18:12:09] <Tiffany> https://github.com/TheCodeLab/IntenseLogic/tree/master/demos/lighting this demo is mainly for testing the PBR stuff
[18:12:30] <Tiffany> uses MIT-licensed textures from cube 2

[18:13:31] <Tiffany> I don't have that many pretty scenes to show
[18:13:54] <zofrex> I should update this... https://github.com/zofrex/rust-raytracer
[18:14:07] <zofrex> I was gonna rewrite my Java raytracer (university project) to Rust
[18:14:07] <Tiffany> http://i.imgur.com/2mAujTA.png http://i.imgur.com/1hfscdC.png
[18:14:23] <Tiffany> heh .rc
[18:14:28] <Tiffany> wow, 2013
[18:14:36] <zofrex> this code is OLD
[18:14:48] <zofrex> I'm showing up how terrible I am now, been doing Rust this long and I still suck at it
[18:15:08] <Tiffany> ray tracing on the gpu is pretty fun
[18:15:16] <Tiffany> since it's so close to being doable in real time
[18:15:21] <zofrex> I'm so far away from that
[18:15:34] <fkaa> would be fun to have something like glslang on rust
[18:15:39] <zofrex> CPU, multithreaded, phong shading, reflection, refraction, and that's about as far as I go
[18:15:42] <zofrex> didn't even get to texturing
[18:16:28] <Elaine> fkaa: https://github.com/kmcallister/glassful
[18:16:46] <fkaa> different things
[18:17:06] <zofrex> I'd love to build up that knowledge, I really want to try creating my own HDRI lightmaps and applying them in my own engine

[18:18:12] <RC9> minecraft is more pc locked
[18:18:31] <Tiffany> yeah but I'm on sandybridge graphics
[18:18:32] <fkaa> Tiffany: raytracing is pretty easy to do in realtime
[18:18:33] <RC9> (mostly due to java and a poor implementation, though voxel code can be a bitch)
[18:18:36] <RC9> er
[18:18:38] <RC9> CPU locked^
[18:18:42] <fkaa> just downscale to 2x2 resolution \o/
[18:18:45] <Tiffany> minecraft is mostly memory, driver, and PCI bus bottlenecked
[18:18:48] <RC9> such real time
[18:18:52] <RC9> very raytrace
[18:18:53] <RC9> wow
[18:19:03] <Tiffany> well
[18:19:08] <Tiffany> you can mix raster and raytraced graphics
[18:19:14] <Tiffany> unreal does that
[18:19:25] <Tiffany> that's basically the only way to do indirect lighting

[18:21:24] <Tiffany> oh my, you're actually trying to build it?

[18:21:39] <Tiffany> it's pretty finicky

[18:24:55] <Peach> i.e. when you leave scope of a function that returns a value

[18:25:40] <Tiffany> uhh, in which way?
[18:25:53] <Tiffany> honestly I should just replace the build system with something less messy
[18:25:58] <fkaa> tup also doesn't color error/warnings so it takes me like 1s per message
[18:26:03] <Tiffany> tup is nice in that it never has stale files, but...
[18:26:25] <fkaa> ah, forgot gl loader..
[18:26:35] <Peach> fkaa - Well yes because the defer is expected to produce a result after the function has end, what if say  the function has    return somethingthatusesprintf();
[18:26:47] <Tiffany> sorry this is so terrible fkaa
[18:26:54] <Tiffany> usually I'm the only person trying to build this
[18:27:16] <Peach> Really, I'm trying to implement basic destructors in C
[18:27:16] <Tiffany> the readme hasn't been updated in 10 months, and 10 months is probably how long it's been since anyone has actually expressed interest
[18:27:20] <zofrex> it could be worse, it could be written in Rust 0.6 or whatever the hell mine's in
[18:27:22] <fkaa> Peach: temp* temp = somethingthatusesprintf(); deferstuff(); return temp;?
[18:27:49] <Peach> fkaa: that doesn't work if the function returns a non pointer
[18:28:41] <fkaa> Tiffany: i'm used to wading through build systems
[18:29:03] <Tiffany> one of the other projects I work on has a custom build system which uses python to generate ninja files and it works much better
[18:29:10] <Tiffany> it gets stale, though
[18:29:32] <fkaa> err, where do i pass compile flags to tup?
[18:29:36] <fkaa> tup init -DTGL_USE_GLEW?
[18:29:47] <Tiffany> you have to put them into config files
[18:29:50] <Tiffany> I'll give you mine
[18:30:15] <Tiffany> ah, wait, nevermind
[18:30:24] <Tiffany> tup variant configs/release.tup
[18:30:45] <Tiffany> oh
[18:30:48] <Tiffany> that one might be broken
[18:30:53] <Tiffany> debug.tup might work
[18:31:22] <Tiffany> tup variant takes a config file and then makes a build configuration for it, that automatically gets built when you run tup
[18:31:27] <Tiffany> build-release, build-debug, etc
[18:32:25] <fkaa> "Package gl was not found in the pkg-config search path."
[18:32:33] <Tiffany> oh my
[18:32:35] <fkaa> guess i need to learn pkg-config as well
[18:32:44] <Tiffany> all the pkg-config names I use are the ones from arch linux
[18:32:51] <Tiffany> for some stupid reason, the names of the .pc files vary between distros
[18:32:56] <Tiffany> which like entirely defeats the point of pkg-config
[18:33:08] <Elaine> yeah
[18:33:27] * fkaa <-- osx
[18:33:33] <fkaa> maybe i should've mentioned that from the start
[18:33:36] <Tiffany> oh
[18:33:42] <Tiffany> this may or may not work on OS X
[18:33:51] <Tiffany> it's a very strange operating system, and I don't have machines to test with
[18:33:52] <fkaa> haha :p
[18:36:24] <Tiffany> there's some ugly code I had to write because of OS X not supporting POSIX.1-2008
[18:36:29] <fkaa> MWUAHHA
[18:36:34] <fkaa> i edited the makefile instead
[18:36:59] <Tiffany> which makefile?
[18:37:15] <fkaa> in tiffgl root
[18:37:33] <Tiffany> huh
[18:37:36] <Tiffany> I didn't know that was still there
[18:37:57] <Tiffany> if you really want to you can probably bypass tup entirely for building IL
[18:38:37] <Tiffany> each directory under src/ is turned into a static library of the same name, and then each directory under demos/ is compiled and linked with the IL libraries and the various dependencies
[18:38:55] <Tiffany> as well as helper.c and main.c
[18:39:31] <Tiffany> the dependencies are GL, libpng, sdl2, bullet, and libuv
[18:41:47] <fkaa> ;_;
[18:41:59] <fkaa> these sort of things really give me a headache
[18:42:07] <fkaa> that's what i like about rust
[18:42:12] <fkaa> it just works™
[18:46:32] <fkaa> Tiffany: i'm kind of interested in writing something in C though, looks cleaner than c++ in a sense
[18:46:47] <Peach> C is cool!
[18:47:07] <Peach> Right now I'm trying to make a language like rust but it generates C
[18:47:08] <zofrex> I love C. It's still full of opportunities to shoot yourself in the foot, but there's something comforting about a well-written C codebase
[18:47:30] <Peach> right now I'm working on destructors and defer statements
[18:47:35] <Peach> exporting to C
[18:47:48] <Peach> (it appears difficult)
[18:49:19] <Tiffany> I've gotten kind of sick of writing in C after 3 years
[18:49:22] <Tiffany> it's very verbose
[18:49:42] <Tiffany> zero-cost abstraction is difficult to impossible
[18:50:04] <fkaa> considered writing intense logic in rust? :)
[18:50:07] <Elaine> zofrex: well-written C codebases consist entirely of correctness proofs in my mind :P
[18:50:36] <Tiffany> I thought about it once
[18:51:01] <Tiffany> I think I'd sooner use C++
[18:51:04] <Tiffany> I already have C++ projects
[18:51:28] <zofrex> Elaine: don't ask why but I spend a fair amount of time reading the source code to aolserver of all things
[18:51:30] <Tiffany> I have been using rust for crypto stuff
[18:51:33] <zofrex> and I really like it
[18:59:46] <Peach> Anyone know if go can import libraries directly from the internet? And if go does it, can Rust do the same?
[19:00:26] <Tiffany> well.. you can put dependencies from the internet in your Cargo.toml
[19:00:48] <Elaine> Peach: go can, yes, you use a github url for example.
[19:01:13] <Peach> OH COOL, shouldn't Rust then add in the language itself:  import "http::github.com/SDL2/rust"  too
[19:01:16] <Peach> that would be nice
[19:01:17] <Elaine> no.
[19:01:20] <Peach> oh
[19:01:22] <Elaine> for lots of reasons.
[19:01:27] <Peach> design differences?
[19:01:41] <Elaine> it used to work that way but it turned out to be a terrible idea and it's a bad idea in go too.
[19:02:07] <Peach> Oh! I'm all ears to learn why
[19:02:23] <Peach> (I was thinking of implementing that in another programming language)
[19:02:34] <Peach> so help me reconsider
[19:02:41] <Elaine> http://0x74696d.com/posts/go-get-considered-harmful/

[19:04:44] <Elaine> http://forums.thedailywtf.com/forums/t/27755.aspx is the canonical horror story
[19:09:07] <Tiffany> that is amazingly terrible
[19:09:21] <Tiffany> the least they could have done would have been to include the commit has in the import
[19:09:27] <Tiffany> hash
[19:09:37] <Tiffany> but then you get into "this is what submodules are for" territory
[19:09:46] <Tiffany> cargo's approach is very nice
[19:09:53] <Elaine> agree, cargo does it right.
[19:10:03] <Tiffany> I remember rustpkg
[19:14:55] <Tiffany> I have to wonder how anyone ever thought this would be a good idea in go
[19:15:02] <Tiffany> and how it's lasted this logn
[19:17:09] <Tiffany> hm

[20:56:39] <brandonson> hmm.  I wonder what the orbital period of a planet orbiting a star which orbits another, larger star is
[21:03:15] <brandonson> Nephos: what happens if you do self._x = self._x + move_x?  I feel like I've done that before and had it work
[21:03:33] <brandonson> god damnit, I'm still doing that

[21:05:00] <RC9> i think you all scared peach enough to send him crying in a corner
[21:05:01] <RC9> lol
[21:05:06] <RC9> those links
[21:05:11] <RC9> belong in a haloween stories book
[21:07:33] <brandonson> XMPPwocky: eh, I'm taking a more naive approach, was more a question of whether I'll care about how long the planet takes to go around its star, or how long it takes to get back to its original position w.r.t the central star

[21:09:21] <brandonson> XMPPwocky: I'm basically just reducing to the two-body problem, three-body probably would be too resource-intensive I think.
[21:09:43] <brandonson> full-on n-body physics is tempting, but I'd be way out of my league trying to validate all that
[21:15:32] <XMPPwocky> exploit in source is patched
[21:15:35] <XMPPwocky> here it was:
[21:15:35] <XMPPwocky> https://github.com/ValveSoftware/source-sdk-2013/blob/master/mp/src/public/sentence.cpp#L1045
[21:24:04] <niconii> uhh, so as someone who doesn't know c++, can you explain what was happening?
[21:24:39] * RC9 spams refresh on xmppwocky
[21:24:44] <Tiffany> buffer overflow, niconii
[21:24:55] <RC9> lol
[21:24:59] <Tiffany> looks like a special valve version of gets()
[21:25:15] <niconii> ahh
[21:25:48] <XMPPwocky> sentences can go in a special chunk of WAV files
[21:25:58] <XMPPwocky> wav files can come from servers or be embedded in custom maps
[21:25:58] <Tiffany> oh, I suppose I should explain that arrays implicitly cast to pointer in C++
[21:26:00] <XMPPwocky> qq
[21:26:07] <Tiffany> it's not like in rust where to pass something by reference you have to & it
[21:26:10] <niconii> i was confused as to what `buf.GetString( token );` was actually doing
[21:26:25] <Tiffany> I figure buf.GetString takes a char*
[21:26:28] <XMPPwocky> yeah
[21:26:32] <Tiffany> and then it fills the char* with stuff
[21:26:40] <niconii> but yeah, i guess that makes sense, i think arrays do the same thing in C too
[21:26:41] <Tiffany> and then overflows and writes shellcode sleds over the stack
[21:27:02] <XMPPwocky> Tiffany: well, you actually have to ROP. luckily, there's a very nice non-ASLR module for that
[21:27:22] <brandonson> ROP?
[21:27:38] <Tiffany> return oriented programming, brandonson
[21:28:03] <Tiffany> it's when you write a bunch of stack frames with the return address set to the contents of some function which contains the instruction you wish to execute followed by a ret
[21:28:17] <Tiffany> with a sufficiently large codebase with which to ROP over, you can find just about any instruction right before the end of a function
[21:28:20] <XMPPwocky> https://gist.github.com/XMPPwocky/dfe1f873689cec6fca48 it was a pain because at the end of the buffer, 4 words later, there's a pointer to buf that gets used before CSentence::InitFromBUffer returns
[21:28:33] <XMPPwocky> so you only can overwrite 3 words, max, or else you just crash too early
[21:29:21] <XMPPwocky> the pre-rop chain, there, decrements esp by 2000, which puts it near the middle of the buffer, where you have loads of room
[21:29:34] <XMPPwocky> the main ROP chain makes the stack executable
[21:29:42] <XMPPwocky> so you'd just put shellcode after that, and boom
[21:31:10] <XMPPwocky> one exceedingly annoying thing is that GetString stops at NUL
[21:31:26] <XMPPwocky> but also at anything that makes isspace() return true: 0x09, 20, and 0a-0d
[21:35:06] <Tiffany> valve should really do static analysis
[21:35:48] <XMPPwocky> yeah
[21:36:09] <XMPPwocky> that's just been sitting around since the original source engine, as far as i can tell
[21:36:27] <XMPPwocky> i also prodded them about making that DLL ASLR
[21:36:30] <XMPPwocky> everything else is
[21:36:36] <XMPPwocky> but this one library gets injected into all Steam games
[21:36:46] <XMPPwocky> and there's no reason it can't be, as far as i can tell
[21:38:23] <Tiffany> do you have to opt into ASLR?
[21:39:13] <XMPPwocky> on windows, it's set at compile time
[21:39:20] <RC9> how hard would it be to have made this mistake in rust
[21:39:21] <XMPPwocky> i think it's on by default now, but wasn't always, or something
[21:39:52] <XMPPwocky> RC9: impossible in safe code, pretty hard in unsafe code
[21:39:54] <XMPPwocky> because Rust has slices
[21:40:07] <RC9> i smell a pr opportunity :D
[21:40:10] <XMPPwocky> there's little reason to pass just a pointer to a buffer
[21:40:55] <Tiffany> yeah, in this example you'd just pass an &mut buf and it would panic
[21:41:00] <Tiffany> but there's no reason to write it that way in rust at all
[21:41:04] <Tiffany> you could just have it return a slice
[21:41:45] <Tiffany> C++17 is supposed to get proper slice classes iirc, so this kind of code won't need to exist anymore
[21:41:54] <Tiffany> however, it won't have borrow checking
[21:52:18] <XMPPwocky> yeah. anyways, can you do it in Rust? sure. but it'd be hilariously unidiomatic and require an unsafe block
[21:55:15] <Peach> slice classes?

[23:39:16] <niconii> so much stuff is completely different, but then suddenly something will peek through that's pretty much the same
[23:47:40] <zacts> I have an interesting pdf
[23:47:46] <zacts> to share: http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/6255/AIM-380.pdf?sequence=4
[23:47:57] <zacts> although not rust related, but it can be applied to rust I guess
[23:49:30] <Elaine> seems pretty tame

[23:49:43] <zacts> it was kind of entertaining to me
[23:49:55] <Elaine> in terms of being old hat at this point
[23:50:06] <zacts> Elaine: totally old hat?
[23:50:10] <zacts> did you actually read it?
[23:50:21] <Elaine> I'm reading it now.
[23:50:29] <zacts> let me post the lecture that ties it into modern CS
[23:50:39] <Elaine> the introduction isn't inspiring

[23:50:59] <zacts> let me pastebin the abstract for the lecture

[23:55:07] <zacts> but, hopefully one day I'll have enough knowledge to grok modern machine learning
[23:55:24] <zacts> in comparison I guess Sussman's PDF is kind of old-school to many modern ML techniques
[23:55:47] <Elaine> it's a completely different approach
[23:55:58] <Elaine> machine learning is unrelated to symbolic reasoning, as the term is used these days.
[23:56:08] <Elaine> (thus why it's called machine learning and not AI anymore)
[23:56:18] <Elaine> (to separate it from the reductionist heritage)
[23:56:55] <zacts> ah I see
