[16:14:13] <masch> Hi. I just build rust-0.8-pre from source because my package manager only delivers up to 0.5. Is there still a network module like std::net::tcp in 0.8
[16:14:34] <masch> *?

[16:52:06] <bstrie> masch: our network stuff is in a state of chaos right now
[16:52:36] <bstrie> masch: we're completely rewriting all this from the ground up. there *might* be some of the new net stuff in the rt module
[16:52:55] <bstrie> er, the rt crate
[16:53:09] <bstrie> but, we probably have no documentation for that crate right now!
[16:53:32] <bstrie> at least not any that I can find

[16:55:02] <masch> :(
[16:55:10] <masch> thanks for the answer thou
[16:55:28] <masch> *though
[16:55:42] <bstrie> masch: yeah, sorry :(
[16:55:54] <bstrie> masch: net stuff is a priority for us, it's just a tricky subject
[16:56:18] <bstrie> we had to write the first net lib to understand that the approach was entirely wrong for what we wanted
[16:56:42] <masch> i think so ;) would be strange if a language developed by a browser community/company would not support network
[16:57:10] <masch> will rust still use libuv for io stuff?
[16:58:04] <bstrie> masch: by default, yes. one of the biggest advantages of all this new work is that the event loop will be swappable, so that you can use something other than libuv if you want
[16:58:55] <masch> okay, sounds cool. i think i really should put more efford in learning rust. Seems to have some really good ideas

[17:23:06] <bstrie> masch: be careful, right when you think you know rust it tends to change out from under you :)
[17:23:20] <bstrie> it's reasonable to wait until we're a bit more stable

[17:49:25] <masch> bstrie: does the basic syntax still change
[17:49:30] <masch> or just the base lib?
[17:58:31] <bstrie> masch: basic syntax still changes sometimes, we currently have several breaking syntactic and semantic changes brewing
[17:58:42] <masch> okay
[17:58:47] <bstrie> *hopefully* the big language changes will all be complete by 0.8
[17:58:51] <bstrie> due in three months or so
[17:59:00] <bstrie> but the libs will continue to break until 1.0
[17:59:20] <masch> thats reasonable
[17:59:58] <bstrie> on the plus side it's fascinating to have been able to watch the language change so many times in the past few years

[20:26:35] <Jeaye> So true
[20:26:50] <Jeaye> Rust has changed so much and it changes so quickly
[20:40:20] <wm4> I wonder how the rust compiler is bootstrapped fully with so many language changes
[20:40:24] <wm4> is it even possible?
