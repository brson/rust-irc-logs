[00:00:06] <barosl> "These MSIL binaries are all combined it into a single EXE that contains all types and data for the application. For example, the new EXE contains its own copy of System.Object and System.String. This is analogous to static linking when you build a C++ application."
[00:00:17] <barosl> Yes, it produces a single binary
[00:00:52] <aatch> XMPPwocky, doesn't look like. It's just compilation.
[00:01:46] <cmr> XMPPwocky: why would there be? it's AOT, they can do all the optimization they want.
[00:02:01] <cmr> They claim it's "as fast as C++", presumably they're using the same compiler backend.
[00:03:37] <barosl> "As fast as C++ with a GC", I guess :P
[00:03:51] <aatch> cmr, many things claim to be "As fast as C++" and turn out to be true only in some cases.
[00:04:04] <cmr> Sure.
[00:04:08] <cmr> I don't expect it to be true.
[00:04:14] <cmr> But I don't expect it to be egregiously bad either.
[00:04:31] <barosl> But still, I have no problem if it just compiles to single binary on Linux
[00:05:17] <barosl> And looking at MS's recent moves it's very likely
[00:05:17] <aatch> cmr, they are using the same backend as the C++ compiler though.
[00:05:56] * barosl looks for C# Web frameworks
[00:06:40] <barosl> I wonder how many open source projects in C# are there...
[00:06:46] <cmr> I like Nancy.
[00:06:51] <cmr> C# has a pretty active open source project.
[00:06:55] <cmr> s/project/community
[00:06:57] <barosl> Yeah, Google search suggests that
[00:07:01] <barosl> Nancy, I mean
[00:07:37] <cmr> asp.net is open source and has more features if you're into more features.
[00:07:56] <cmr> if you're just going to use it for WebAPI though nancy is wayyy better
[00:08:38] <barosl> I'm in favor of a micro framework-like approach in general, so Nancy looks more interesting
[00:08:45] <aatch> One thing that's interesting is that cl.exe does partial devirtualisation, (basically turning a virtual call into a series of compares + static calls), which would work well for C#
[00:09:17] <barosl> O.o That's amazing
[00:11:50] <aatch> barosl, yeah. It works off of profile info, so `vcall()` turns into `if fptr == f1 { f1(); } else if fptr == f2 { f2(); } else { fptr() }`, meaning branch prediction can take effect.

[00:14:07] <XMPPwocky> aatch: so insta-Rust-enum? :Pp
[00:14:11] <XMPPwocky> oh god my chin
[00:15:03] <aatch> XMPPwocky, well, sort of, but it still has the actual virual call there.
[00:15:38] <barosl> aatch, What's the disadvantages of that approach? Code bloat?
[00:16:13] <XMPPwocky> barosl: if you miss that inline cache, you now have a bunch of non-taken branches too
[00:16:28] <XMPPwocky> but most code in practice probably gets called with the same types most of the time
[00:16:50] <aatch> barosl, I assume so. But as long as you don't add in too many cases, it's unlikely to be worse than doing the virtual call itself.
[00:16:52] <barosl> At least one or two "specialization"s might not harm much
[00:18:01] <aatch> As I said, it uses PGO, so most of the time, the first one or two branches will be the ones that get taken.
[00:20:08] <aatch> The biggest advantage is avoiding the pipeline stall from the virtual call. Branch prediction means that it doesn't need to know the value of `fptr` to start pipelining the static call.
[00:20:29] <aatch> Which is nice if `fptr` is itself loaded from a vtable.

[12:01:58] <cmr> It constant folds the overflow check, then dead code elimination removes the rest of the function.
[12:02:06] <cmr> (I suspect)
[12:02:17] <FreeFull> Compilers are awesome
[12:02:46] <cmr> I'm not sure I agree :P
[12:03:11] <cmr> It's hard to get an optimizer to work well, especially since most of the problems only have good heuristics.
[12:03:41] <Gankro> Vectorization in particular seems super unreliable
[12:04:02] <Gankro> But that might be a rustc thing, dunno about gcc
[12:04:42] <cmr> Gankro: part of it is the IR that we ask LLVM to vectorize.
[12:04:58] <cmr> It's not the straightforward loops that it knows how to vectorize right away.
[12:05:03] <cmr> It takes some work to get there.
[12:05:38] <Gankro> Any idea what we're doing different from e.g. C++?
[12:06:02] <Gankro> Just unrecognizably sloppy ir gen?
[12:06:22] <cmr> I think our slice iterators are solid, I'm not sure if clang++ does much better there. I haven't looked at it a lot.
[12:06:27] <Gankro> Or is there something about how we do itrrators/loops?
[12:06:32] <huon> autovectorization is always somewhat dubious
[12:07:44] <Gankro> cmr I was really confused to see &Vec vs &[T] loops giving different codegen
[12:08:21] <cmr> Gankro: is that still true?
[12:08:37] <cmr> slash do you have an example I can poke at
[12:08:55] <FreeFull> https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/35vyej/10_stable_is_nearly_here/cr8ogm7
[12:09:44] <Gankro> On phone, but all I did was write a noinline fn that takes a Vec i32, iterates it, and sums thr values, returning it
[12:10:10] <Gankro> Summing being manual and not an iter adaptor
[12:10:17] <cmr> Ok.

[21:07:26] <Tiffany> unity is plagued by really shitty networking libraries
[21:07:29] <XMPPwocky> i do want to look at unreal just because the source is available
[21:07:34] <Tiffany> I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of these games had logic errors too
[21:07:39] <Tiffany> like trusting the client too much
[21:07:40] <XMPPwocky> so i can afl it
[21:07:57] <Tobba> Tiffany: of course, but that's not as fun as RCE
[21:08:00] <Tiffany> xmppwocky: ew
[21:08:01] <FreeFull> XMPPwocky: So you send a NAN position, and then the next tick, whatever position you want?
[21:08:07] <Tobba> though I'd imagine a lot of games have stray evals
[21:08:09] <Tiffany> that would print errors under ubsan
[21:08:23] <XMPPwocky> FreeFull: yeah, so you teleport
[21:08:35] <FreeFull> Interesting
[21:08:40] <XMPPwocky> Tiffany: 0.0/0.0 is undefined?
[21:08:45] <Tiffany> tobba: you'd be surprised how much of a pain speedhacks and forcefield hacks can be
[21:08:46] <XMPPwocky> i thought it was well-defined as NaN
[21:08:53] <Tiffany> xmppwocky: it's a  signalling nan or something
[21:08:57] <XMPPwocky> oh right
[21:08:59] <FreeFull> I think it's implementation defined in C
[21:09:11] <Tobba> XMPPwocky: heh I assume being at NaN means nothing bad can happen to you either
[21:09:19] <Tobba> modify your client to always send NaN unless you're shooting
[21:09:35] <XMPPwocky> heh
[21:09:36] <Tiffany> in minecraft if you manage to NaN your position you get stuck there
[21:09:48] <FreeFull> Stuck until teleport?
[21:09:50] <Tiffany> your velocity ends up NaN, so even when you teleport away you're still NaN
[21:09:55] <FreeFull> Ah
[21:10:12] <Tiffany> there are a few bugs which cause this
[21:10:17] <Tobba> I'd imagine there is some way to reset your velocity
[21:10:18] <FreeFull> I would have thought teleport would make velocity 0
[21:10:21] <Tobba> but you'd probably have to time it perfectly
[21:10:29] <Tiffany> there's various division by zero bugs
[21:10:38] <Tobba> does velocity preserve when you rejoin the game in SMP?
[21:10:38] <Tiffany> especially with tnt and minecarts
[21:10:43] <FreeFull> Tobba: Probably requires a server restart
[21:10:46] <Tiffany> oh
[21:10:47] <Tiffany> it doesn't
[21:10:53] <Tiffany> you can survive otherwise deadly falls
[21:10:57] <fkaa> ferris is cute
[21:10:57] <Tobba> fun
[21:11:00] <Tiffany> but yeah, speedhacks and forcefield
[21:11:08] <Tiffany> there's this minecraft game called dwarves versus zombies
[21:11:12] <XMPPwocky> csgo had a fun bug recently that teleported people to 0,0,0 if they sent a forwardmove/sidemove/upmove of the largest possible float
[21:11:13] <Tiffany> there's usually 30-60 people in a game at a time
[21:11:19] <XMPPwocky> non-inf that is
[21:11:20] <XMPPwocky> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRvaDJTZ2gY
[21:11:21] <Tiffany> one person FF hacks, it screws over everyone playing
[21:11:23] <Tobba> not sure if it'd go NaN instantly, but you could probably use it to teleport if you manage to get a movement packet in fast enough
[21:11:47] <Tiffany> DvZ has some mechanics that differ from vanilla minecraft, so it throws off some of the hacking tools
[21:11:52] <Tiffany> like they don't auto-heal you
[21:12:11] <Tiffany> users of hacked clients usually either do that manually or assign a macro to spam it
[21:12:16] <Tiffany> the latter will run your mana out really fast
[21:12:25] <XMPPwocky> iirc, what happens is that the server validates your usercmd early on
[21:12:38] <Tiffany> minecraft is a pristine example of why you shouldn't trust the client though
[21:12:45] <Tiffany> minecraft trusts your position so long as you aren't trying to walk through walls
[21:12:47] <XMPPwocky> but if you send something huge, the next math operation the server does will end up making things +inf/-inf
[21:12:50] <Tiffany> and it doesn't check jump height at all
[21:12:53] <Tiffany> or collision boxes
[21:13:02] <Tiffany> you can walk through spaces too small for a player and jump into the sky
[21:13:07] <XMPPwocky> which then runs unprotected
[21:13:07] <Tiffany> and run arbitrarily fast
[21:13:19] <Tobba> also teleport through ceilings
[21:13:27] <FreeFull> I bet there are anti-cheat mods
[21:13:33] <Tiffany> there are
[21:13:36] <Tiffany> but they're really shitty
[21:13:43] <Tiffany> they don't work well at all
[21:13:55] <Tiffany> they basically teleport you backwards every time it thinks you're cheating
[21:14:02] <Tiffany> but it doesn't actually prevent any hacked clients
[21:14:06] <Tiffany> just makes them more annoying to use
[21:14:10] <Tiffany> and it also fucks laggy players pretty badly
[21:14:29] <Tobba> it doesn't help that MCs networking is a big ball of TCP
[21:14:33] <Tiffany> yeah
[21:14:43] <Tiffany> it sends chunk data over the same connection as position updates
[21:14:47] <XMPPwocky> ...
[21:14:49] <Tiffany> it re-downloads all of the chunks when you die
[21:14:50] <fkaa> or that it's easily moddable/hackable
[21:15:01] <Tiffany> and it doesn't prioritise or throttle data at all

[21:15:14] <Tobba> Tiffany: oh my god that
[21:15:18] <Tobba> fuck that
[21:15:19] <Tiffany> so people with connections like mine find that the game is basically unplayable
[21:15:30] <Tobba> for some reason the initial world sending is REALLY slow
[21:15:38] <Tiffany> a hundred enderman updating positions 20 times per second destroys my connection
[21:15:44] <Tobba> so when playing in SMP you essentially *have* to set yourself to creative mode to avoid certain death when entering any portal
[21:15:52] <Tiffany> hah

[21:15:57] <Tiffany> I tried playing on a UHC server once
[21:16:10] <Tiffany> I spawned in, lagged out, and found out 3 minutes later that I died to a witch
[21:16:11] <Tobba> it's moderately infuriating to play with friends :P
[21:16:35] <Tobba> it gets worse with mods that add a million tile entities everywhere

[21:17:07] <Tobba> though unmodded minecraft is incredibly boring, most modpacks are overly huge and it sucks
[21:17:17] <Tobba> picking together your own takes ages, and you miss out on some good stuff
[21:17:23] <Tiffany> some mods actually add tile entities to the worldgen
[21:17:29] <Tiffany> hundreds of tile entities per chunk

[21:17:40] <Tobba> yeeep
[21:17:41] <Tiffany> because their egos are too big
[21:17:56] <Tobba> I can't actually recall any mods doing that now, any idea which ones?
[21:18:00] <Tiffany> xycraft does it
[21:18:07] <Tiffany> because every ore has to have a custom renderer
[21:18:21] <Tiffany> it doesn't even use multitexturing, so it has horrid Z-fighting
[21:18:48] <fkaa> vanilla minecraft is capped at opengl 1.x or something crazy
[21:18:52] <Tiffany> basically the shiny bits are this animated noise texture
[21:18:58] <Tobba> I remember building this massive 100 block tower with blocks from oh so many mods in it
[21:19:00] <XMPPwocky> fkaa: i remember there's an "advanced" setting to use
[21:19:01] <XMPPwocky> VBOs
[21:19:02] <Tobba> in the end we were getting like 10-20 FPS
[21:19:06] <Tiffany> yeah
[21:19:14] <Tiffany> it's really easy to build lag islands if you don't plan builds carefully
[21:19:19] <Tobba> also half the floors were blown to hell and back, stupid thaumcraft
[21:19:19] <fkaa> yeah but mixing new and old doesn't necessarily give better perf
[21:19:23] <Tiffany> fkaa: they use gl 1.x with extensions
[21:19:47] <Tiffany> normal blocks in chunks are drawn with display lists by default (thank god) but they have an optional VBO-based renderer
[21:19:52] <Tiffany> they're going to start requiring shaders in 1.9
[21:20:00] <XMPPwocky> .......
[21:20:01] <Tiffany> or they were, until they fired their graphics programmer
[21:20:06] <Tiffany> it's unclear now
[21:20:10] <Tobba> seriously?
[21:20:20] <Tiffany> they fired him because he got drunk and said stupid things on the internet
[21:20:23] <XMPPwocky> ...
[21:20:24] <Tobba> there have been multiple mods that have beat the renderer into using GLSL
[21:20:31] <Tiffany> uh
[21:20:33] <XMPPwocky> hematite pls
[21:20:38] <Tiffany> those are all mods that add extremely expensive postprocessing effects
[21:20:40] <fkaa> Tiffany: pretty sure there were some other circumstances

[21:22:04] <Tiffany> I'm not sure what mojang actually wants to use shaders for
[21:22:14] <Tiffany> they are only going to be using the baseline shaders
[21:22:17] <Tiffany> i.e. what you had in 2.1
[21:22:21] <Tiffany> vertex + fragment
[21:22:32] <Tobba> it's probably better than using the fixed function pipeline
[21:22:44] <Tiffany> they don't really do anything besides rendering triangles though
[21:22:56] <Tiffany> there's not really any post processing effects that would benefit currently
[21:22:58] <Tobba> afaik every lighting update has to essentially re-do the whole VBO for the chunk to fit new vertex colors in
[21:23:00] <Tiffany> er, not post processing
[21:23:05] <fkaa> lots of em!
[21:23:10] <Tiffany> they're not going to change lighting
[21:23:18] <fkaa> the ao is baked into the vertices, yeah
[21:23:24] <Tiffany> and they can't use the 2.1 shader model to recalculate AO
[21:23:26] <Tobba> they could change it to use a separate buffer
[21:23:32] <Tiffany> oh
[21:23:43] <Tiffany> yeah, probably
[21:23:53] <Tiffany> are VAOs in 2.1?
[21:24:28] <Tobba> pretty sure they are
[21:24:44] <Tobba> every GPU in a system that can run MC will support them, anyways
[21:24:50] <Tiffany> yeah lol
[21:24:52] <Tobba> which is a pretty high bar actually considering how hard it murders the CPU

[21:25:17] <Tiffany> some people complain that minecraft is upping it's GPU requirements

[21:25:30] <Tiffany> if you have a GPU that doesn't support 2.1, your computer can't run minecraft
[21:25:32] <Tiffany> there's no doubt about it
[21:25:33] <XMPPwocky> i bet the gpu driver people hate that
[21:25:40] <Tiffany> although
[21:25:41] <Tiffany> naturally
[21:25:46] <XMPPwocky> because they have to optimize their old codepaths for mc
[21:25:59] <Tobba> XMPPwocky: I'm not sure how much there is to optimize there actually
[21:26:06] <Tiffany> there are some systems still being sold today which don't support GL 2.1
[21:26:08] <Tobba> most of what they do when "optimizing" games is just replace shaders and change pixel formats
[21:26:14] <Tiffany> like, you'd think you can't run minecraft on an intel atom CPU

[21:27:02] <Tobba> and strain on uploading data to the GPU during chunk updates, which I imagine is quite bad
[21:27:07] <Tiffany> all of the major vendors have more or less abandoned immediate mode
[21:27:16] <Tiffany> it's still supported, but they're not making it any faster

[21:40:59] <Tiffany> since resource packs are only supposed to affect the look of the game
[21:41:04] <fkaa> i'd really like for mods to be in lua
[21:41:08] <Tiffany> plugins will be treated separately
[21:41:08] <lahwran> OMFG NO
[21:41:11] <Tiffany> ugh no
[21:41:12] <fkaa> haha
[21:41:22] <lahwran> lua is sooooo bad
[21:41:40] <lahwran> mods should be in a java-like language
[21:41:44] <lahwran> (kotlin, definitely)
[21:42:05] <lahwran> (or ceylon, but interop, and kotlin is actually popular, even though there are several dumb mistakes in its construction)
[21:43:30] <Tiffany> plugins will probably be in java
[21:43:47] <Tiffany> but you could easily enough drop in some runtime libs and write in whatever jvm-based language you like
[21:43:56] <Tiffany> that's how some minecraft mods are written
[21:43:59] <niconii> mods should be in intercal
[21:44:08] <Tiffany> there's a few written in scala
[21:44:10] <Tiffany> some written in boo
[21:44:19] <fkaa> lahwran: but lua is lightweight :(
[21:45:03] <lahwran> fkaa: :|
[21:45:19] <lahwran> lua has a freakishly optimized vm
[21:45:26] <lahwran> that's not the same thing as being a lightweight *language*

[21:56:53] <Tobba> I think bytecode is safe outside of LuaJIT
[21:56:59] <Tiffany> no it's not

[21:57:27] <Tiffany> I don't know about luaJ
[21:57:38] <Tiffany> I don't know about luaJIT
[21:57:48] <Tiffany> it's best overall to assume that
[21:57:57] <Tiffany> 1. the bytecode has dangerous operations that can't be expressed in source form
[21:58:05] <Tiffany> 2. that the interpreter does not sanity check the bytecode
[21:58:28] <Tiffany> there's no real reason to use bytecode anyway
[21:58:55] <Tiffany> it's pretty close to isomorphic with source form, so it's awful at protecting IP, it's not really any faster to load, because lua's syntax is really simple
[21:59:18] <Tiffany> it's just an unnecessary attack surface

[22:14:46] <Tiffany> oh god
[22:14:50] <Tiffany> lost cause, burn down the source tree
[22:15:08] <Tiffany> what codebase is that?
[22:15:11] <XMPPwocky> > php
[22:15:16] <Tiffany> oh
[22:15:22] <Tiffany> lol
[22:15:38] <XMPPwocky> i did end up getting control of eip from that Source exploit, btw
[22:15:51] <XMPPwocky> afl actually figured it out
[22:16:05] <XMPPwocky> and started jumping to other parts of the code because it was more "unique crashes"
[22:16:10] <XMPPwocky> pretty amazingly clever
[22:16:11] <Tiffany> hahahahaha
[22:16:13] <Tiffany> that's amazing
[22:16:29] <Tiffany> that must be how there's 5000+ unique crashes in php
[22:17:27] <XMPPwocky> in unrelated news, anybody know how to kill a sentient AI that keeps crashing all myNOTHING IS WRONG, PLEASE CONTINUE HUMANS".DCC SEND \x00 9CTCP
[22:17:46] <fmtq> lol
[22:18:00] <fmtq> what is eip 
[22:18:09] <Tiffany> extended instruction pointer?
[22:18:13] <fmtq> what does it mean
[22:18:22] <Tiffany> the instruction pointer in 32 bits
[22:18:28] <Tiffany> instead of ip, which is probably 16 bits
[22:18:38] <XMPPwocky> i wonder if "ap" is a thing
[22:18:43] <fmtq> does this mean you can pretty much point at anywhere in the codebase
[22:18:46] <fmtq> and have it execute
[22:18:47] <Tiffany> yeah
[22:18:51] <fmtq> fuck.
[22:19:02] <XMPPwocky> i also control everything except eax it seems
[22:19:18] <Tiffany> so you can successfully perform a return from libc attack?
[22:19:29] <Tiffany> or uh
[22:19:33] <Tiffany> call mprotect on the heap
[22:19:39] <Tiffany> and then jump into shell code
[22:20:00] <XMPPwocky> well, there's aslr on linux
[22:20:06] <XMPPwocky> but the core executable isn't PIC
[22:20:11] <XMPPwocky> so i'd have to ROP off that
[22:20:31] <Tiffany> is there aslr on windows?
[22:20:51] <XMPPwocky> Tiffany: yes, but it has to be enabled per-module
[22:20:54] <Tobba> XMPPwocky: 82 days, bloody hell
[22:20:55] <XMPPwocky> it uses runtime code patching
[22:21:01] <Tiffany> and it's not?
[22:21:03] <XMPPwocky> instead of just relocations
[22:21:17] <XMPPwocky> Tiffany: oh this is all on linux, because that's what 90+% of gameservers run on
[22:21:22] <Tiffany> oh

[22:21:56] <XMPPwocky> and this works server-to-client too

[22:23:41] <barosl> It is hard to convince the people whose concepts on Unicode are ruined by Python...
[22:23:49] <XMPPwocky> python2 or python3?
[22:23:52] <barosl> Both
[22:24:35] <barosl> Unicode is inherently variable-lengthy, so treating individual characters like an array is never a good idea

[22:25:10] <Tobba> XMPPwocky: fun fact: that worm was meant to play 1982 overture and do a thing as well
[22:25:20] <Tobba> but the server distributing the file pretty much instantly died
[22:25:40] <barosl> Swift may be a language with the most extreme, but also correct Unicode handling out of the box
[22:26:07] <XMPPwocky> Tobba: lol
[22:26:31] <barosl> Swift's character type (Character) is an array of code points
[22:27:07] <fmtq> I can pan the map in offsets now :D
[22:27:14] <fmtq> not even buffering it because who has time for that shit
[22:27:23] <barosl> So if you loop over a string you get an iterator of arrays, not of chars
[22:27:28] <barosl> Which is pretty elegant
[22:28:28] <fmtq> nice
[22:28:58] <fmtq> barosl: I did something similar for defining deadkeys in a descriptor for keyboards I'm working on
[22:29:01] <fmtq> because some keys can be ligatures
[22:29:06] <fmtq> it's basically just nested maps 
[22:29:29] <fmtq> effectively treating the keys as an array of bytes 
[22:29:43] <fmtq> it just so happens your text editor knows what it means :P 
[22:31:32] <bluss> barosl: we could have a string iterator that returned a &str for each character
