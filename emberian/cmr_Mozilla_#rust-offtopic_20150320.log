[05:51:59] <c74d> Cabal is just a package manager (and a notoriously poor one, too). Your operating system's package manager (where applicable) may be able to replace it (there are tools to convert Cabal package definitions to package definitions for Gentoo Linux's Portage and I think Arch Linux's pacman, at least), or, failing that, the advanced, cross-platform package manager Nix can replace it.

[05:54:06] <c74d> (Of course there's also the "build manually" option.)
[05:54:13] <barosl> I generally prefer not to install packages as a system level, so those package managers may not feel suited to me
[05:54:34] <barosl> Although I heard Nix had something different
[05:55:02] <c74d> I believe Nix supports installing packages per-user (indeed, I believe installing packages globally with it is discouraged). eddyb would know more.
[06:00:07] <bombless> cabal has a sandbox feature which I think cannot be replaced by package manager from OS
[06:04:45] <c74d> Insofar as Cabal sandboxing is used to elude dependency conflicts, Nix takes that much further (and with, I believe, less waste of space). Portage can theoretically effect that too, but its relevant feature (slotting) requires support in each relevant package definition.
[06:06:31] <bombless> Oh HDD space is cheap now.. See nodejs, let's be happy to waste HDD space.
[06:06:44] <c74d> OS package managers may not generally be capable of sandboxing(-equivalent functionality), but I don't see why they couldn't be in theory (and Nix is in practice, being the OS package manager of NixOS).
[06:07:22] <bombless> No I just mean, in practise. So I'm not talking about the ideal future.
[06:08:14] <c74d> Oh, so "is not", not "cannot be". (Still, Nix.)

[15:55:57] <Tobba> nope
[15:55:58] <fmtq> like Belgium?
[15:56:09] <Tobba> I'm looking for 0days
[15:56:16] <Tobba> it turns out this is incredibly easy using the shotgun approach
[15:56:36] <fmtq> haha
[15:57:37] <Tobba> current death tool: over 2 million devices
[15:59:43] <Tobba> you'd expect someone to be sued over some of the shit I've found
[15:59:47] <Tobba> but that never happens
[15:59:51] <fmtq> nope
[15:59:57] <fmtq> consumer grade routers have telnet open to the internet
[16:00:01] <fmtq> with hardcoded root passwords.
[16:00:03] <Tobba> oh yeah that was one of them
[16:00:07] <fmtq> the war hasn't happened and we already lost.
[16:00:07] <Tobba> like 500k in brazil
[16:00:28] <Tobba> has a command that lets you write and execute arbitrary memory under a submenu
[16:00:41] <fmtq> I
[16:00:42] <fmtq> nope.[
[16:00:44] <fmtq> NOPE
[16:00:45] <fmtq> NOPE!
[16:00:47] <fmtq> FUCK IT
[16:00:51] <fmtq> cancel the Internet.
[16:01:18] <fmtq> that's like building a car out of C4 and allowing anyone to place a detinator wherever they want
[16:01:38] <Tobba> also I was responsible for finding this one https://twitter.com/Viss/status/577922916752306176 (mega is my friend)
[16:01:52] <Tobba> there are only a few hundred of those on the internet but they control industrial stuff
[16:02:04] <fmtq> oh I've seen you before.
[16:02:16] <Tobba> according to shodan 3k of them
[16:02:32] <fmtq> we are only like one degree removed from each other.
[16:02:38] <GaryOak_> eeekkk
[16:03:21] <Tobba> fun fact: those devices have no auth on the SOAP interface, but there is auth on the folder containing the tool that lets you change things (which just calls the SOAP interface)
[16:03:35] <fmtq> DLink?
[16:03:36] <GaryOak_> damn
[16:03:39] <Tobba> i.Lon
[16:03:47] <Tobba> oh that tweet doesn't mention that
[16:03:48] <Tobba> google it
[16:04:03] <fmtq> oh.
[16:04:04] <fmtq> but it's in the code
[16:04:06] <fmtq> if I had looked.
[16:04:16] <fmtq> ilon100/v4.0
[16:04:21] <fmtq> SOAP though
[16:04:32] <fmtq> obviously necessary for a consumer grade router right
[16:04:45] <Tobba> it's not a router
[16:04:50] <Tobba> it's an industrial controller
[16:04:56] <fmtq> oh shiiit 
[16:05:17] <Tobba> though siemens made a series of routers. now that was comedy
[16:05:30] <Tobba> (theres no auth on downloading the config)
[16:05:31] <fmtq> I seriously just don't get SOAP.
[16:05:33] <Tobba> which has the password.
[16:05:43] <fmtq> all of the why 
[16:06:04] *** sunfish-away is now known as sunfish
[16:06:21] <Tobba> hm
[16:06:31] <fmtq> anyway, enough XML nightmares for today
[16:06:35] <fmtq> I'm going to find a pub soon I think 
[16:06:45] <fmtq> and then say "HOW MANY CROWNS?!"
[16:06:47] <fmtq> on a loop 
[16:07:03] <Tobba> at least one of the 0days I found a few years back in a very common device (2M+ exploitable on shodan previously, 1.6M now) is finally getting fixed
[16:07:21] <Tobba> I never reported it because the vendor is a PITA and by googling I found someone had discovered and reported it around the same time I Did
[16:07:38] <Tobba> turns out it was discovered on another product line and they only realized it extended to the one I found it on years later
[16:08:48] <cyndis> One of my favorite security wtf's is that some samsung phones have/had a /dev/exynos-mem that offered full r/w access to all physical memory to all users..
[16:09:08] <Tobba> hahaha what
[16:09:51] <cyndis> not even a debug feature, it was used by the camera application; apparently the way they did camera image stuff was that the kernel driver wrote the image somewhere and the userspace app then read it from there
[16:10:04] <Tobba> oh. wow.
[16:10:13] <cyndis> interesting design certainly :)
[16:10:33] <Tobba> I don't even
[16:11:10] <Tobba> I still don't know why ISPs set up routers so that they face the public internet
[16:11:14] <Tobba> just. why.
[16:11:57] <Tobba> at least this one has passwords
[16:12:05] <tiffany> incompetence?
[16:12:15] <Tobba> ARRIS routers have no way to even set up passwords
[16:12:27] <Tobba> they change password ever day using a (very well documented) scheme
[16:12:51] <Tobba> another model has a password which is blank by default, which most ISPs leave it at
[16:13:05] <Tobba> I'm not sure if they can even be configured not to be world visible
[16:13:07] <GaryOak_> Do the manufacturer's just assume these will never hit the internet?
[16:13:11] <Tobba> ARRIS: a sign your ISP hates yos
[16:13:16] <Tobba> you*
[16:14:56] <Tobba> however, consumer routers usually aren't very interesting
[16:15:20] <Tobba> things businesses use are usually a lot more interesting

[20:17:20] <WindowsBunny> tiffany: Of course
[20:17:24] <tiffany> I mean hell, have you ever tried navigating the hundreds of dialogs that windows has in the bowels of the control panel?
[20:17:31] <WindowsBunny> Uh, yes?
[20:17:44] <WindowsBunny> Or was that a rhetorical question?
[20:17:58] <tiffany> it very quickly dives into low-level PCI details without so much as explaining a single thing
[20:18:12] <tiffany> there's countless online tutorials which explain how to do various things with the GUI
[20:18:21] <tiffany> all of which involve lots of manual clicking and screenshots
[20:19:30] <tiffany> my experience with terminal applications is not, generally, that
[20:19:48] <tiffany> there's some obscure things, but usually the documentation is quite clear
[20:20:26] <tiffany> I have never even seen the word "simply" used in a manpage, I think
[20:21:03] <tiffany> most of the time, manpages will be honest as to the complexity of the thing they are documenting, and often offer rationale sections for why it is this way
[20:21:18] <tiffany> win32, on the other hand, I have not once seen a rationale section, for even the most insane of design decisions
[20:21:35] <WindowsBunny> Well it's not open source, so they don't need a rationale
[20:21:48] <WindowsBunny> If you want rationale, you go to the blogs of microsoft devs
[20:22:02] <WindowsBunny> some of those blogs are wonderful
[20:22:19] <tiffany> more often than not the actual reason is lost to history, or at least, the reason only applies for old hardware nobody uses anymore
[20:22:42] <WindowsBunny> and then they had to make everything stable for eternity
[20:23:02] <tiffany> and the crazy thing is how windows often has architecture-specific hacks that are applied across all configurations

[20:23:22] <tiffany> iirc windows doesn't ever use the 64kb of memory below the 2^31 address, because of alpha
[20:23:27] <XMPPwocky> alpha?
[20:24:07] <tiffany> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEC_Alpha
[20:24:13] <XMPPwocky> windows ran on that?
[20:24:25] <tiffany> early in its life, windows NT ran on a lot of architectures
[20:24:27] <WindowsBunny> windows ran on a lot of things
[20:24:35] <tiffany> they got dropped as time went on, but the hacks remained
[20:24:42] <bombless> Nope, I believe it's about 8086.
[20:25:02] <tiffany> windows 2000 had both x86 and powerPC versions available
[20:25:22] <XMPPwocky> So what license are other licenses under?
[20:25:23] <XMPPwocky> say, the GPL
[20:25:35] <XMPPwocky> is the license itself public domain?
[20:25:35] <tiffany> for over a decade it was x86 only, but now it runs on ARM
[20:25:43] <cmr> XMPPwocky: it isn't under a specific license.
[20:26:05] <tiffany> windows NT 3.1 ran on x86-32, alpha, and MIPS
[20:26:06] <cmr> it's just plain copyright, and their FAQ says you can copy the terms to your own license but can't keep the name, the prologue, or the bit at the bottom
[20:26:26] <tiffany> the GPL is trademarked, isn't it?
[20:26:43] <bombless> Yeah... partly because David came from DEC.
[20:26:50] <cmr> no, trademark is completely different.
[20:27:03] <bombless> He made an OS for Alpha before he join MS.
