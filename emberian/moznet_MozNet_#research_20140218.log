[19:01:09] * cmr waves
[19:01:56] <nrc> pnkfelix: that's all the emails
[19:02:05] <pnkfelix> nrc: thx
[19:03:16] <pnkfelix> nrc: I clearly have been very confused, I got the impression from azita's email that Diane was supposed to be coordinating the transport from SFO, so I was just waiting word from her.
[19:03:59] <pnkfelix> i'll reply to the emails with my plane schedule
[19:06:10] <larsberg> looks like there are currently early arrivers (nrc and myself before 11AM PST) and late (niko post-7PM PST)
[19:07:29] <jdm> keeners
[19:08:27] <nrc> jdm: coming to the Rust work week?
[19:08:43] * nrc wishes we had a wiki page with who was coming etc.
[19:08:44] <jdm> nrc: nope. burnt out on travel, and I'm not all that involved with rust.
[19:08:58] <nrc> fair enough
[19:09:21] * jdm literally just got back from a month on the road an hour ago
[19:09:38] <nrc> larsberg: did you look into changing your flight to arrive later?
[19:09:44] <nrc> jdm: :-(
[19:09:56] <nrc> time for a rest
[19:10:31] <jdm> definitely
[19:10:48] <larsberg> nrc: did not, and now I worry it's too close and I'd end up sitting in the cargo area :-( I'm glad that we'll be booking the travel portion on our own again soon.
[19:11:28] <nrc> heh, yeah, me too
[19:11:43] <larsberg> I've also found our travel agency does not respond well to hypotheticals (from the summit travel, where they kept unbooking my economy plus upgrade)
[19:12:18] <larsberg> "you said you'd prefer an aisle in the back over that window bulkead seat, right?"
[19:12:19] <nrc> I think it is a different travel agency - they were pretty good with my too-ing and fro-ing
[19:12:43] <nrc> :-(
[19:14:00] <larsberg> I'm fine with driving us + whomever else down, since azita said she might want an extra car around in san jose if we want to go out for a dinner
[19:15:15] <nrc> cool - I'd rather not do the driving out of SFO - wrong side of the road and all
[19:19:59] <pnkfelix> I figure I should just make a wiki page for Rust Work Week 2014 on the intranet, any reason not to?  (Its LDAP password protected...)
[19:20:48] <jdm> no reason whatsoever
[19:20:53] <jdm> it is The Done Thing

[19:27:38] <shu> there's a rust work week in SJ?

[19:44:06] <pnkfelix> nrc: larsberg: okay, times are all up on the page now, hopefully this ends up being helpful.
[19:46:18] <brson> pnkfelix: there's an etherpad for the work week
[19:46:32] <pnkfelix> brson: ah, maybe that would have been better
[19:46:34] <brson> where's your wiki page?
[19:46:40] <pnkfelix> brson: but then again, embedded tables can be niced
[19:46:45] <pnkfelix> brson: https://intranet.mozilla.org/RustWorkWeek2014
[19:47:03] <pnkfelix> brson: I guess the two pages can reference each other
[19:47:12] <pnkfelix> the etherpad will probably more convenient for much content
[19:48:15] <brson> pnkfelix: is 2pm too late for you to have meetings?
[19:48:42] <pnkfelix> brson: I think there's probably a logarithmic scale for these things
[19:48:47] <pnkfelix> brson: 2pm is 10x better than 3pm
[19:48:55] <pnkfelix> brson: and 1pm is 10x better than 2pm
[19:49:07] <pnkfelix> brson: (give or take 1 million units)
[19:50:15] <pnkfelix> brson: huon mentioned the idea of maybe mixing it up, alternating between late and early.  But I responded that is probably too complicated (e.g. too likely for people to lose track on a given week and then miss the mtg)
[19:50:27] <cmr> (I can also do any time before 8am, but that's no fun for people actually in PST)
[19:50:48] *** Joins: eholk (eholk@moz-BA312F07.crest.iu.edu)
[19:51:28] <larsberg> pnkfelix: we do the alternating-weeks thing on Servo (to fit Simon and our European collaborators one week and Korea the next) and it works pretty well
[19:51:52] <pnkfelix> larsberg: oh, if there's precendent elsewhere, then maybe we should consider it
[19:51:55] <larsberg> Though it does cause a lot of extra work for jack because one follows with daylight savings time and one does not (TIL: korea does not do daylight savings)
[19:52:50] <larsberg> I think we alternate a 10AM PST one week and a 4PM PST the next (the 4pm one is 9AM korea)
[19:56:59] <nrc> we did alternating times for gecko/gfx too

[19:57:38] <nrc> it's kind of pain if something you want to discuss is brought up at the 'wrong' week
[20:00:32] <nrc> man, I will be so happy to have later meetings - pre-breakfast meetings are hard - I feel like I'm attending a meeting drunk :-p
[20:01:02] <jdm> haha
[20:01:13] <jdm> I once gave a talk over the internet at 4am
[20:01:18] <jdm> that sure was something
[20:01:47] <nrc> I bet
[20:01:55] <nrc> I would have failed so badly at that
