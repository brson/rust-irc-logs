[09:32:56] <Havvy> It's currently the top post.
[09:32:58] <bvssvni> noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!
[09:33:06] <bvssvni> it can't
[09:33:17] <Havvy> Oh, Notch even chimed in on VR.
[09:33:33] <bvssvni> John Carmack, pls quit and start another
[09:33:46] <eddyb> I personally like https://www.spaceglasses.com/ but the release version is so expensive :(
[09:34:32] <bvssvni> why on earth
[09:34:45] <bvssvni> would you go into a VR with your real name :P
[09:36:05] <Havvy> http://notch.net/2014/03/virtual-reality-is-going-to-change-the-world/
[09:36:27] <Havvy> bvssvni:  I'd go in a VR as Havvy.
[09:36:38] <Havvy> (Which is more well known than my legal name.)
[09:36:47] <bvssvni> yeah
[09:36:57] <bvssvni> that's what avatars are for
[09:38:13] <Havvy> If avatars are the names you use to interact with other people, what the heck are the names you are born with?
[09:38:37] <bvssvni> legal justification of nationality
[09:40:01] <bvssvni> I think the point to have avatars is being able to have multiple avatars
[09:40:12] <bvssvni> that can't be tied to a single identity
[09:40:39] <bvssvni> non-interfering activities = fluidity
[09:42:34] <eddyb> huon: oh, I was going to ask. how does fixed point work?
[09:43:14] <eddyb> huon: the fixed point combinators, that is. naive execution would lead to infinite recursion AFAICT
[09:45:25] <bvssvni> it's the first time since the gravity waves/inflation news that I got shocked by the news
[09:56:13] <Havvy> I find I can make non-interfering activities using the same avatar just by teaching people basic sociology.
[09:58:49] <bvssvni> Havvy: good luck trying to teach everyone
[09:59:34] <Havvy> I come off as a sage to non-programmers, so I actually do have the opportunity to teach most people.
[10:00:08] <bvssvni> ah, net neutrality is a difficult debate
[10:00:15] <huon> eddyb: laziness
[10:00:21] <huon> eddyb: (is how the haskell definition works)
[10:00:50] <eddyb> huon: so you stop the recursion by not executing a function?
[10:04:09] <bvssvni> I wonder if Facebook will make privacy guarantees about OR
[10:05:43] <bvssvni> the problem is having a large market of people that are not that concerned about privacy
[10:14:26] <huon> eddyb: by not evaluating the value yes
[10:14:44] <huon> (well, I guess it's a function call for haskell)
[10:16:47] <eddyb> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GADT#Higher-order_abstract_syntax
[10:16:53] <eddyb> eval (Fix f)     = (eval f) (eval (Fix f))
[10:17:15] <eddyb> how does that work, exactly?
[10:17:39] <eddyb> if the function doesn't use its argument, it's not evaluated?
[10:18:44] <eddyb> I mean, I understand using functions for lazy evaluation, but not this
[10:19:18] <huon> every value is lazy in Haskell
[10:19:45] <huon> i.e. `f (1 + 2)` doesn't evaluate the sum unless f uses the argument
[10:19:54] <eddyb> I guess it's not an issue if you use monads for IO
[10:20:25] <huon> monads allow you to sequence operations into an IO action, and then the magical main function evaluates this action
[10:20:39] <eddyb> about that, I've thought the IO monad was like an event loop
[10:20:47] <eddyb> or rather, an action loop
[10:20:51] <huon> (well, the main function is evaluated by some magical other function outside the realm of Haskell)
[10:20:53] <huon> not really?
[10:21:49] <huon> it's more of a reification of IO actions, i.e. you can pass around some IO action (i.e. evaluation runs IO) as first objects
[10:21:51] <eddyb> let (action, callback) = main; loop{(action, callback) = callback(do(action));} or something like that
[10:22:21] <eddyb> but one explanation shows that IO just fakes purity for impure functions using a RealWorld "baton"
[10:22:44] <huon> and then the a >>= b monad operation for IO makes a new IO action object that passes the result of running a into b (but doesn't actually run either of them)
[10:22:54] <eddyb> huon: yeah, that's what I thought
[10:23:25] <eddyb> huon: is this accurate? http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/IO_inside
[10:23:41] <huon> I guess your event loop thing kinda works, but it's not the thing that makes most intuitive sense to me personally
[10:24:03] <eddyb> I guess it would be a typed recursive evaluation
[10:24:08] <huon> eddyb: well, it's on the Haskell wiki, so I assume it's pretty good
[10:24:40] <eddyb> huon: but it's not the model we have in mind :/
[10:24:47] <huon> what do you mean?
[10:25:11] <eddyb> what it shows there is faking purity
[10:25:15] <huon> yeah?
[10:25:22] <huon> >>= just becomes function composition
[10:25:23] <eddyb> not executing actions outside of pure Haskell
[10:25:32] <eddyb> there is a slight difference
[10:25:38] <huon> and then you end up with `main = <some function>`
[10:25:58] <huon> and the Haskell runtime evaluates that function by passing in the current RealWorld
[10:26:16] <eddyb> that's not what I had in mind :(
[10:26:20] <huon> main :: RealWorld -> ((), RealWorld)
[10:26:26] <huon> is the example they give
[10:26:35] <eddyb> and it actually makes the IO monad look like a ridiculous hack instead of an elegant one
[10:26:35] <huon> s/example/type/
[10:26:41] <huon> what do you mean?
[10:26:52] <huon> I think the function composition interpretation is very neat
[10:26:57] <huon> and the opposite of a hack
[10:27:18] <eddyb> they have impure functions pretending to be pure by taking and returning RealWorld
[10:27:31] <huon> an "IO" is something that transforms the current state of the RealWorld into a new RealWorld, possibly creating a value
[10:27:57] <huon> they're not impure functions
[10:28:15] <huon> (not quite, at least)
[10:28:29] <eddyb> they're masquerading
[10:28:58] <huon> yeah, so?
[10:29:00] <eddyb> main realworld = printLn "foo" realworld
[10:29:12] <eddyb> that's not pure, that's pretending to be pure
[10:29:23] <eddyb> while I had an explanation in mind which would be really pure
[10:29:34] <huon> it is pure
[10:29:44] <huon> it's just a function that transforms a realWorld
[10:29:51] <eddyb> we should bring strcat in here :P
[10:30:24] <huon> his point about "Haskell's not pure because it uses CPU" is slightly different to this
[10:30:36] <bvssvni> the problem I think is explaining what the computer does in terms of how a language should be interpreted
[10:30:57] <huon> at least, I don't think it's relevant to "is modelling IO as a function transforming the state of the world a hack"
[10:36:47] <bvssvni> in Haskell the terminology gives the impression that there is a sharp distinction between pure and impure functional programming
[10:37:11] <bvssvni> in physics one uses convergence to approximate the "correct" solution after many iterations
[10:37:29] <bvssvni> which can be thought of a semi-thing in the space between "pure" and "impure"
[10:38:13] <bvssvni> so an compiler can reason about functions that converge in a similar way as "pure" and "impure"
[10:40:45] <bvssvni> it boils down to tagging program logic that requires different semantics
[10:47:58] <eddyb> huon: https://gist.github.com/eddyb/504beee795c50465f910
[10:48:48] <huon> eddyb: isn't Chain just `-> IO<T>`?
[10:49:24] <eddyb> huon: nope
[10:49:35] <eddyb> (forgot B, updated)
[10:49:49] <eddyb> Chain<A, B>(IO<A>, |A| -> IO<B>) -> IO<B>
[10:49:54] <huon> Ah
[10:50:03] <eddyb> not sure how to solve the existential issue there :(
[10:50:15] <huon> trait objects \o/
[10:50:16] <huon> :P
[10:50:41] <eddyb> in any case, you get the idea
[10:50:54] <eddyb> was this attempted in Haskell?
[10:51:34] <huon> I've seen tutorials (iirc) that explain IO a little like that, yes
[10:51:47] <huon> Nothing's original :P
[10:54:33] <bvssvni> eddyb: what are these 'for' statements for?
[10:54:54] <eddyb> bvssvni: to replace type parameters
[10:55:16] <eddyb> I find traditional GADT definitions too flexible
[10:55:22] <eddyb> and redundant
[10:56:08] <huon> too flexible?
[10:56:39] <eddyb> huon: can you even do -> SomethingElseThanTheAdtType a b c at the end of the constructor type?
[10:57:29] <bvssvni> eddyb: so it is kind of manipulating the set of variants in the enum by interfering the type by usage?
[10:57:30] <huon> dunno
[10:57:55] <eddyb> bvssvni: yeah, producing GADTs
[10:58:10] <eddyb> huon: hence redundant
[10:58:11] <huon> "Data constructor `Foo' returns type `Int' instead of an instance of its parent type `A a'"
[10:58:12] <huon> nope
[10:58:15] <huon> you can't
[10:58:51] <huon> I guess it is redundant, but it's not *that* redundant (especially if you're specifying most of the type parameters with "custom" types.)
[11:00:34] <bvssvni> eddyb: won't that make exhaustive matching impossible in generic functions?
[11:01:15] <huon> bvssvni: yes
[11:01:25] <eddyb> you simply strip out the cases that will never match
[11:01:34] <bvssvni> haha
[11:01:35] <eddyb> (after monomorphization)
[11:01:44] <huon> (well, at least, you can construct GADTs that make GHC's exhaustiveness checker upset)
[11:01:46] <eddyb> bvssvni: it's a powerful optimization tool
[11:01:49] <huon> iirc
[11:02:01] <bvssvni> eddyb: :)
[11:02:31] <huon> eddyb: we could also just specialise `Result<T, Void>` to `T`, which gets us many of the desirable optimisations (I think I saw you suggest this too, yesterday)
[11:02:33] <eddyb> generic functions with GADTs are no different than Some(x).unwrap() for me
[11:02:36] <bvssvni> well it is so abstract it gets funny
[11:02:42] <eddyb> huon: yupp
[11:02:53] <eddyb> you hit uninhabited enums with GADTs, too
[11:03:36] <eddyb> huon: I was considering switching a variant off by changing () to !
[11:04:09] <eddyb> ()pen and C!osed
[11:04:43] <huon> :/
[11:05:14] <eddyb> I know how to fix my type issue
[11:09:36] <eddyb> huon: https://gist.github.com/eddyb/504beee795c50465f910
[11:10:28] <eddyb> that means main doesn't have an outside defined type, but that should be okay
[11:10:59] <eddyb> impure fn start() {main().execute()}
[11:11:32] <eddyb> huon: if you really wanted purity in Rust for some reason
[11:12:36] <huon> eddyb: looks like trait objects :P
[11:12:50] <eddyb> nope, statically typed
[11:13:06] <eddyb> huon: the => Trait is "return anonymous type bounded by Trait"
[11:13:59] <huon> "efficient trait objects"

[11:51:25] <Havvy> `mut` has different meanings in `let mut x = ...`   and `&mut`, right?
[11:52:26] <eddyb> Havvy: yeah, mutable local vs mutably borrowed reference
[11:52:36] <Havvy> So why do they have the same keyword?
[11:52:45] <eddyb> because they're both about "mutable"
[11:53:00] <Havvy> `let var x: &mut Y;`
[11:53:17] <eddyb> `let var` makes me cry
[11:53:46] <Havvy> Whyso?
[11:53:56] <eddyb> especially coming from ES6
[11:54:05] <eddyb> Havvy: because it's kinda like saying `let let mut`
[11:54:08] <Havvy> ES6 is a different language.
[11:54:10] <eddyb> Havvy: not sure what the issue you're having with `mut` is
[11:54:39] <huon> `mut` is specifying that the memory slot the variable is in allows for mutation, in both cases
[11:54:51] <huon> let mut x = 1; => x is a mutable slot
[11:55:10] <huon> let ptr = &mut x => ptr points to data in a mutable slot
[11:55:51] <Havvy> huon:  Ah. So then mut does mean the same thing.
[11:56:26] <huon> yep
[11:56:47] <huon> (also, that was amazingly ontopic for #rust :P )
[11:57:03] <Havvy> Yeah, I asked in the wrong channel.

[11:59:10] <eddyb> Havvy: `mut` in patterns and `&mut` mean a different thing, but the `mut` is the same concept. not sure how you deduced what you did considering my first answer
[11:59:47] <huon> eddyb: because "mutable local" and "mutably borrowed" aren't obviously the same thing?

[13:53:31] * ChrisMorgan understood their definition last time he looked but not their purpose, and so has completely forgotten what they do
[13:53:38] <eddyb> and a certain lack thereof
[13:54:07] * eddyb is disgusted by the actual impurity of IO now that he's learned the truth
[13:54:10] * ChrisMorgan is sure that he doesn't want Rust to have anything called monads: it'd be absolutely terrible for marketing.
[13:54:35] <eddyb> ChrisMorgan: you can implement them in the library
[13:54:42] <ChrisMorgan> So I understand.
[13:54:45] * bvssvni thinks monads does not make unless the language is lazy evaluated
[13:54:56] <eddyb> make what? babbies?
[13:55:00] <bvssvni> *sense
[13:55:01] <bvssvni> haha
[13:55:15] <eddyb> ChrisMorgan: trait Monad<*> {.... methods ....}
[13:55:24] <eddyb> ChrisMorgan: sorry, trait<*> Monad
[13:55:30] * eddyb confuses his own pseudonotation
[13:56:11] * ChrisMorgan should go to bed before he tries to understand monads
[13:56:35] <huon> ChrisMorgan: a definition of a monad is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors (to refresh your understanding :P )
[13:56:59] <ChrisMorgan> How could I ever have forgotten.
[13:59:31] <eddyb> huon: what does MonadPlus do for Maybe?
[14:00:53] * eddyb should just read the damned sources

[14:10:07] <eddyb> https://github.com/ghc/ghc now I can look at things
[14:10:14] <bvssvni> ah
[14:10:21] <bvssvni> (liftM f) action
[14:11:06] <eddyb>  (a -> b) -> (IO a -> IO b) should be equivalent to  (a -> b) -> IO a -> IO b
[14:11:13] <huon> s/should be/is/
[14:11:13] <eddyb> i.e. right associative
[14:11:35] <eddyb> huon: considering I could very well be wrong
[14:12:06] <bvssvni> what is the use cases of liftM?
[14:12:10] <huon> (regarding liftM aka fmap as lifting a function into a new function that acts through the Monad/Functor is a good way to look at them, though)
[14:12:12] <bvssvni> *are
[14:12:39] <huon> liftM fibonacci readInteger
[14:12:44] <huon> like Option.map
[14:12:47] <huon> or Result.map
[14:15:49] <eddyb> there we go https://github.com/ghc/packages-base/tree/master/Control
[14:16:18] <eddyb> oh dear the , at the start of lines
[14:16:31] <eddyb> the last place I saw this was npm source and it made code unreadable
[14:19:17] <eddyb> ah, mplus is || for Maybe
[14:19:44] <eddyb> (and yes, I realize that the || semantic I'm thinking of is pretty much exclusive to JS, but it's still interesting)
[14:20:55] <eddyb> huon: where is `class Monad`?
[14:21:05] <huon> the || operator is called <|> in Haskell 
[14:21:17] <huon> (at least the name from the Applicative type class is that)
[14:21:33] <huon> inside `import GHC.Base`, I think
[14:21:33] <eddyb> huon: does it act like mplus for Maybe?
[14:21:43] <huon> eddyb: yes, exactly the same
[14:21:52] <eddyb> ah okay
[14:23:18] <eddyb> there we go https://github.com/ghc/packages-base/blob/master/GHC/Base.lhs#L212
[14:24:25] <eddyb> huon: does Haskell just infer kinds?
[14:24:49] <eddyb> seems kind of volatile
[14:25:24] <bvssvni> ah, now I get the >>= thing
[14:28:30] <eddyb> huon: I now wonder whether LLVM can do fix-point
[14:29:09] <eddyb> i.e. would it make unbounded recursion bounded when the result is not used?
[14:33:42] <eddyb> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7472699 lol, leaks
