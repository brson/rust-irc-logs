[05:15:22] <cmr> austincheney: as for colors to use, you can tell which color is which by the underline color on the boxes. For example, http://seld.be/rustdoc/master/std/borrow/fn.to_uint.html
[05:16:18] <cmr> Also the colors used for links
[05:30:37] <bjz> how do you go up a level?
[05:31:11] <bjz> btw, the src thing is nice
[05:31:11] <cmr> From the current location in the docs?
[05:31:14] <bjz> yeah
[05:31:25] <cmr> The big header-looking path's segments are clickable
[05:31:42] <bjz> ahh
[05:32:05] <cmr> Seldaek: might want to add some sort of visual hint that those are links?
[05:32:14] <cmr> probably wouldn't be as pretty
[05:32:24] <cmr> maybe just a very light gray dashed underline
[05:33:46] <bjz> have you thought of having them in the sidebar? the clickable path is super nice, but maybe it's more of a 'short-cut/sugar' kind of thing
[05:34:26] <cmr> I do want to have a tree browser like http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/4.2.1/#!/api/Ext.state.Provider
[05:34:42] <bjz> most folks look at a nav bar for their 'escape hatch'
[05:35:13] <cmr> bjz: the path in the sidebar is also clickable
[05:35:33] <cmr> anyway I need sleep
[05:35:34] <cmr> 'night
[05:35:37] <bjz> I was sort of thinking just having it stacked
[05:35:54] <bjz> so std on one line, next level below
[05:35:59] <bjz> then the items
[05:36:19] <bjz> then the full path as the header of the page
[05:36:36] <bjz> it would also be bettwer for more deeply nested modules
[05:36:51] <bjz> so that the name doesn't clip out
[05:37:04] <bjz> or if the module names are long
[05:52:53] <austincheney> cmr: i would need to know what the definition or schema for the colors are without going to each page for the query algorithm to execute correctly
[05:53:51] <austincheney> its a difference in execution speed of ~.005seconds versus 20minutes to visit each page at execution time
[05:55:58] <austincheney> cmr: also sencha has tree viewers in their stuff because their head UI guy wrote the premier parser JS parser for JS
[05:56:30] <austincheney> cmr: if you want you can use my parser to acheive the same results much faster
[05:56:43] <austincheney> but i have to warn you that my parser is very low level
[05:57:00] <austincheney> and I have been told that it is challenging to understand

[11:52:50] <Seldaek> bjz: the module names don't clip out if they're too long they'll stack vertically as you described
[11:53:02] <Seldaek> as long as they fit though I think it's more readable on one line
[11:53:37] <bjz> I'm talking more about knowning you can navigate using them
[11:54:04] <Seldaek> austincheney: the linking/coloring/rendering stuff I can quickly fix it up once you're done, it's maybe a bit obscure but all the info is in the search index data
[11:54:48] <bjz> you can't tell by eye that they're clickable. That's fine for the heading, but maybe it would be more understandable for them to be regular blocks like the other items in the sidebar
[11:55:19] <Seldaek> myeah, I figured people would just try :p
[11:55:29] <bjz> Seldaek: I love love love the heading, don't change that
[11:55:35] <bjz> :)
[11:56:59] <dbaupp> Seldaek: http://seld.be/rustdoc/std/index.html is out-of-date, isn't it?
[11:57:00] <bjz> Seldaek: yeah it's difficult when you design something, some things that you thank are obvious aren't
[11:57:30] <Seldaek> dbaupp: everything is out of date
[11:57:45] <Seldaek> but that particular page is very old
[11:57:48] <Seldaek> the right url is http://seld.be/rustdoc/master/std/index.html
[11:57:57] <Seldaek> I should probably delete this old stuff 
[11:58:21] <dbaupp> thanks

[12:43:26] <austincheney> i think i will add click filterring to the cloumn headings
[13:17:39] <cmr> austincheney: I don't understand; why would a JS parser be useful to Rust documentation?
[13:18:16] <austincheney> well, in this case a rust parser written in JS would be more appropriate
[13:18:44] <austincheney> but this is why such a feature is in place with the Sencha tools that are largely written in JS
[13:18:59] <cmr> I still don't see why; the doc backend can add whatever information is necessary to the json that rustdoc_web consumes
[13:19:18] <cmr> I'm pretty sure it's already there in the form of the item tree
[13:19:49] <austincheney> from the standpoint of static documentation.... as in a context-free definition of terms, you dont need a parser
[13:20:09] <austincheney> but if want to analyze a given instance of code with such precision then a parser will be required
[14:27:09] <bjz_> cmr: so is the idea that the tools your using might be useful for IDE/completion tools as well?
[14:27:16] <cmr> bjz_: yup
[14:27:20] <bjz_> awesome
[14:27:39] <cmr> I want to be able to extract documentation from crate metadata
[14:27:50] <cmr> haven't gotten around to it yet
[14:27:50] <bjz_> that's super cool
[14:29:02] <bjz_> will there be a way to do red-squigglies in the future? I guess that's not really rustdoc domain
[14:29:59] <cmr> yeah, nothing for rustdoc to do about that.
[14:30:11] <cmr> The compiler isn't structured very well for IDE integration right now
[14:30:17] <cmr> It can't do partial compilation etc
[14:30:32] <bjz_> but yeah, that's cool that this can kill two birds
[14:30:42] <bjz_> oh wel yeah
[14:31:00] <bjz_> yeah I guess you couldn't have it updating
[14:31:09] <bjz_> (for completion stuff)
[14:31:26] <cmr> But for already-compiled/valid crates, it works great
[14:31:34] <bjz_> yeah ofc
[14:31:44] <bjz_> still great
[14:33:02] <dbaupp> I get redsquigglies in emacs with the new rust-mode
[14:33:22] <bjz_> orly? :o
[14:33:29] <dbaupp> i guess they're just syntax errors though; I haven't really examined it precisely.
[14:33:35] <cmr> I get them in vim too, but it's just simple compile errors.
[14:33:44] <cmr> Nothing fancy.
[14:34:08] * bjz_ should really learn emacs
[14:34:23] <cmr> doomlord has a gedit plugin that gives it for gedit too
[14:34:36] <cmr> As well as integration with his jump-to-definition tool
[14:39:11] <bjz_> dbaupp: how do you work with projects in emacs
[14:39:34] <dbaupp> bjz_: what do you mean>
[14:39:35] <dbaupp> ?
[14:40:24] <bjz_> like in sublime I have a sidbar with my directory structure and tabs along the top. what is the ideomatic way to use emacs?
[14:40:47] <dbaupp> I just leave every file I've opened open, and can switch to any with `C-x b <substring of filename>`
[14:41:08] <dbaupp> and then have split panels with multiple files (normally 2 side by side)
[14:41:13] <dbaupp> and that's all
[14:41:17] <bjz_> oh ok
[14:41:19] <bjz_> neat
[14:41:22] <dbaupp> but I'm not emacs wizard at all.
[14:41:42] <cmr> I do basically the same thing
[14:41:48] <cmr> (in vim)
[14:41:48] <bjz_> how do you close one of the panels?
[14:41:54] <bjz_> -_-
[14:42:00] <dbaupp> C-x 0 will close the one you're on
[14:42:07] <cmr> though sometimes I do use the NERDTree file browser
[14:42:14] <dbaupp> C-x 1 will expand the one you're on to full screen
[14:42:22] <dbaupp> *full window
[14:42:31] <bjz_> dbaupp: sorry for the lmgtfy questions :P
[14:42:48] <dbaupp> don't worry :)
[14:43:42] <bjz_> neat - C-x 2 = horizontal split, C-x 3 = vertical
[14:46:59] <bjz_> dbaupp: yeah I kept getting these split panels and couldn't figure out how to get rid of them (was playing with it a few days ago)
[14:47:20] <bjz_> I had to close and open it again to get it back to normal -_-#
[14:49:28] <dbaupp> haha :)
[14:50:01] <bjz_> I felt like my mum with all those browser toolbars
[14:50:03] <dbaupp> C-g is useful too... if it's complaining at you about something, just hit it repeatedly to cancel everything.
[14:50:10] <bjz_> haha
[14:51:00] <bjz_> do you prefer it in-terminal or the standalone application?
[14:53:19] <dbaupp> i normally have it standalone
[14:53:55] <dbaupp> firefox, email, emacs and terminal(s) are what I have open all the time and pretty much nothing else
[14:54:03] <dbaupp> (oh, well, pdf readers too)
[14:54:47] <dbaupp> (and it's easier to find the emacs window when it doesn't look like a normal terminal)
[14:55:46] <cmr> dbaupp: pdfjs!
[14:55:53] <cmr> I recommend using the dev version from git
[14:55:56] <cmr> Works very well
[14:56:02] <cmr> ...not so well if you have a slow computer
[14:56:09] * dbaupp doesn't have a slow computer
[14:56:21] * dbaupp also likes having his pdfs outside his webbrowser
[15:05:07] <bjz_> love me some pdfjs
[15:08:10] <bjz_> dbaupp: since we're all off-topic, you might enjoy this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNNeesM50XM
[15:09:52] * dbaupp would prefer to keep politics off #rust* :)
[15:10:02] <dbaupp> (but hahaha :) )
[15:10:58] <bjz_> :)
[15:11:25] <bjz_> (hence why he did not post it on #rust)
[15:11:50] <bjz_> ohhh
[15:11:52] <bjz_> rust*
[15:11:54] <bjz_> :D
[15:53:12] <cmr> By now we could probably use a #rust-offtopic

[22:49:45] <austincheney> updated to add hyperlinking, predefined colors for types, and filtering
[22:50:04] <austincheney> http://prettydiff.com/rustdocb/master/
[22:50:35] <austincheney> i am told the slowest form of softing that evil could possibly create is bubble sorting that I use extensively in the code
[22:51:42] <austincheney> please feel free to change this if you wish, but all the data resides through an API, the DOM, so I believe the API is the greater complexity opposed to a few lines of code
[22:53:03] <cmr> austincheney: Array.prototype.sort :|
[22:53:28] <austincheney> also the "complete" function has a second argument for maximum passes through the raw data that is currently set at 1000.  feel free to increase this number for more results or reduce the number for faster execution
[22:53:55] <cmr> you should just be able to do list.sort()
[22:53:57] <austincheney> cmr: i could not figure out how to use the sort method to sort a table row based upon the data in cells of a certain column
[22:54:41] <austincheney> all the data must be read from the dom, the sorting is outside the dom in the js, and then result is written back to the dom
[22:54:46] <cmr> austincheney: you pass it a closure that compares two things, so whatever the comparison you use in the code you'd just shove in the closure
[22:54:55] <austincheney> and dom node lists do not inherit from the array prototype
[22:55:00] <cmr> oh
[22:55:36] <austincheney> the problem there is that i can convert a node list to a native array, but then you loose all of its dom properties that link it and provide context
[22:55:38] <cmr> That's unfortunate
[22:55:41] <cmr> yeah
[22:55:49] <cmr> I know of such pain with the dom
[22:55:57] * cmr strongly dislikes the web as a platform
[22:56:56] <austincheney> the web is hard to extend properly because it is not centrally managed and the business that run the web are based upon marketing opposed to content or technology
[22:57:34] <austincheney> i think the w3c has seen this problem for a long time but is usually powerless to fix it.... particularly when the primary opposing audience is less mature and more engaged
[22:58:38] <austincheney> and so you get stupid crap like living standards that want to compete against xml instead of setting any sort of vision or unified objective
[23:00:19] <austincheney> standards documents are just conformance errata.  if a certain group really wanted to move things forward they would have built new software and defined their goals instead of endlessly writing standards for technologies not currently in use
