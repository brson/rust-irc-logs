[06:08:42] <bjz_> L8D: most likely non-existent
[06:09:02] <bjz_> L8D: I would reccomend looking at the tests in the module's source
[06:09:15] <bjz_> that would be the most up-to date 'docs'
[06:09:20] <bjz_> (sorry)
[06:09:35] <bjz_> IO is being revamped
[06:09:53] <bjz_> I'm not sure if file IO will be part of that, but it might be
[06:10:01] <L8D> man
[06:10:18] <L8D> I'm sorry rust, I've just given up because of the lack of documentation.
[06:10:42] <bjz_> L8D: the docs are pretty damn good for a language that's still evolving
[06:10:51] <L8D> touche
[06:11:16] <bjz_> It takes a bit of effort being an early adopter :(
[06:11:35] <L8D> But for %90 of everything in the standard libraries I have no idea what these things are talking about...
[06:11:51] <bjz_> what do you mean?>
[06:12:21] <L8D> Well, I still to this date have no idea how to use the json library.
[06:12:25] <bjz_> rustdoc itself is pretty badly designed
[06:12:40] <bjz_> it was done before we had traits, I think
[06:13:00] <bjz_> so it doesn't really make the methods all that discoverable
[06:13:04] <L8D> And for half of the functions I use, I get type errors, then I match the type and then it says I have too many arguments...
[06:13:32] <L8D> And there is no example I can find for rust.
[06:13:35] <bjz_> L8D: so yeah, for that reason I reccomend looking at the actual tests as opposed to the docs
[06:13:40] <L8D> Except for the manual and tutorial
[06:13:52] <L8D> Where are these tests?
[06:14:26] <bjz_> L8D: https://github.com/mozilla/rust/blob/master/src/libextra/json.rs#L1336
[06:15:06] <L8D> I see.
[06:15:39] <bjz_> L8D: it's unacceptable for a language that claims to be production-ready to force devs to look at the lib source
[06:15:53] <bjz_> L8D: but Rust doesn't claim to be production ready :)
[06:15:54] <L8D> agreed.
[06:16:24] <L8D> So is there any differences between rust's '~' and C's '*' ?
[06:16:53] <bjz_> on the plus side, you can learn a bit by browsing the source of the libs, but be wary that they sometimes use old, out of date ideoms
[06:17:00] <bjz_> umm
[06:17:15] <bjz_> ~ is like malloc/free
[06:17:16] <L8D> I'm really confused as to how pointers work in rust
[06:17:27] <L8D> I know C-style pointers.
[06:17:53] <bjz_> L8D: http://pcwalton.github.io/blog/2013/03/18/an-overview-of-memory-management-in-rust/
[06:18:10] <bjz_> http://pcwalton.github.io/blog/2013/05/20/safe-manual-memory-management/
[06:18:24] <bjz_> http://pcwalton.github.io/blog/2013/04/12/a-hard-case-for-memory-safety/
[06:19:28] <bjz_> L8D: also, http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/tutorial-borrowed-ptr.html
[06:20:03] <bjz_> L8D: sometimes it's better to hang around the moz-org #rust channel - there are more experienced folk there
[06:20:11] <bjz_> (and more people ingeneral)
[06:20:33] <bjz_> ie. the core devs hang out there, not here
[06:21:05] <L8D> mozilla has their own IRC server?
[06:21:10] <bjz_> aye
[06:21:29] <bjz_> look at the topic of the channel ^
[06:21:53] <L8D> ...
[06:22:06] <bjz_> this one should really be ##rust, because it's unofficial :(
[06:22:23] <bjz_> me and strcat have been trying to convince bstrie
[06:22:25] <bjz_> :P
[06:23:25] <bjz_> L8D: do those links help?
[06:24:29] <L8D> Yes
[06:24:38] <bjz_> from what I understand, C's * actually conflates multiple behaviours into one pointer. Rust just separates them out.
[06:24:43] <L8D> I couldn't find anything of the sort after browsing around the doc pages and google
[06:24:51] <bjz_> yeah, sorry
[06:24:51] <L8D> err, duckduckgo
[06:25:18] <bjz_> irc can help a ton, especially the official channel
[06:25:31] <bjz_> again, the price of being an early adopter
[06:26:07] <bjz_> folks are pretty nice though, and the is usually somebody with some know-how on there around the clock
[06:26:37] <L8D> Well, my main purpose of learning rust is for https://github.com/L8D/the-json-test
[06:26:48] <L8D> If you want, you could write an entry for rust
[06:30:50] <bjz_> Ah neat!
[06:30:59] <bjz_> that's a good idea!
[06:31:29] <L8D> Thanks?
[06:31:33] <bjz_> I would be wary about doing one for Rust though, as the JSON lib could be subject to change
[06:32:05] <L8D> Well, do you know any other languages not already implemented?
[06:32:28] <bjz_> D
[06:32:39] <bjz_> Clojure
[06:32:45] <bjz_> OCaml
[06:32:52] <bjz_> C#
[06:33:04] <L8D> If you can write it in Clojure or OCaml that'd be great
[06:33:06] <bjz_> there are lots that could be added
[06:33:30] <bjz_> oh, you mean me?
[06:33:36] <bjz_> ahh, sorry, got lots on my plate
[06:33:38] <L8D> See the "LANGS WANTED" section, feel free to do a pull request of more langs
[06:33:59] <bjz_> have you looked at rosetta code?
[06:34:25] <L8D> No I haven;t
[06:34:33] <L8D> But I justed looked it up
[06:34:37] <bjz_> dunno if they have a JSON thing on there
[06:34:58] <bjz_> http://rosettacode.org/wiki/JSON
[06:35:10] <L8D> I was about to paste that exact link
[06:35:58] <bjz_> it's a nice site too
[06:36:44] <bjz_> I think Rust has some examples on there, but they're almost certainly out of date by now
[06:38:29] <L8D> I guess I'll just port the code from JSON and File IO and combine them for my repo
[06:38:43] <L8D> for most of the languages
[06:39:03] <L8D> I could totally see rosettacode as a great learning resource.
[06:39:19] <bjz_> awesome
[06:39:24] <bjz_> glad I could help
[06:39:31] <L8D> thank
[06:39:32] <L8D> you
