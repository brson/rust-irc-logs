[01:11:13] <bjz> brson: TheHydroImpulse has been talking about the design of the website
[01:12:05] <bjz> there is a reop in the channel topic ^
[01:12:57] <bjz> We're going to be using the issues list for dicussing things
[01:15:50] <brson> great!
[01:17:43] <brson> i definitely like the direction the screenshot is going

[02:32:48] <bjz> brson: it's be good to have a branding style guide as well. all our stuff is pretty scattered atm
[02:33:14] <bjz> brson: but yeah, that would be an effort and a half
[02:34:07] <diverse> The newest site design, looks really good so far.
[02:36:30] <bjz> still would be good to experiment with laouts - like focusing on positioning etc. black and whit boxes to start with to keep things focused. I'll have a go, but I have lots of other things I'm doing atm too

[06:25:11] <bjz> Also added links to some inspiring sites: https://github.com/TheHydroImpulse/rust-website/issues/5#issuecomment-32116145
[06:26:57] <bjz> Man, go's gopher is just so cool: https://www.google.com.au/search?q=go+gopher&tbm=isch
[06:27:16] <bjz> shame 'Rust' doesn't really evoke any thing
[06:27:51] <bjz> Apart from Rust monsters from D and D, and they aren't the most pleasant things
[06:29:03] <dbaupp> the Rust Rabbit
[06:29:30] <dbaupp> the Rust Rooster
[06:29:35] <dbaupp> "Ruster" for short

[07:32:42] <diverse> I thought the cogwheel logo for Rust gives it a sense of power and industrialness
[07:33:47] <diverse> I don't understand the need for a mascot change?
[07:35:07] <dbaupp> because we can have some *hilarious* puns with a different mascot
[07:35:13] <dbaupp> :P
[08:18:22] <bjz> diverse: try not to shoot down ideas too early, in the creative stage
[08:18:40] <bjz> diverse: just playing around with ideas
