[01:42:24] <cmr> Seldaek: Yeah, I haven't fixed that yet
[01:47:12] <cmr> Seldaek: http://seld.be/rustdoc/master/std/unstable/raw/struct.Closure.html
[01:47:14] <cmr> That's a bug
[01:50:00] <cmr> http://seld.be/rustdoc/master/extra/base64/index.html
[01:50:09] <cmr> Seems wrong for the structs
[01:50:16] <cmr> (MIME and STANDARD and URL_SAFE)
[01:51:07] <cmr> Seldaek: the bug is you render Unit as nothing
[01:51:12] <cmr> It should be rendered as ()
[01:54:05] <cmr> The Config thing is my fault
[02:04:09] <cmr> ...huh
[02:04:12] <cmr> the span in the AST is wrong
[02:04:26] <cmr> This is the first legitimate bug in libsyntax I've hit
[09:16:48] <Seldaek> cmr: fixed Unit rendering
[16:21:09] <cmr> " Congratulations on having it be usable on an iOS machine straight out of the gate. This is something that still eludes scaladoc, for example."
[16:21:17] <cmr> Seldaek: I didn't even know it worked on mobile, nice job!
[16:21:22] <cmr> (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6199775 btw)
[16:23:44] <Seldaek> cmr: ah does it, I made it responsive-ish but never checked on a mobile :)
[16:24:13] <cmr> heh
[16:24:17] <cmr> yay accidental features!
[16:24:41] <cmr> I mean the markup is pretty simple, it's not surprising it works well
[16:25:00] <Seldaek> yeah well it isn't really responsive
[16:25:25] <Seldaek> and the search engine seems to be killing the iphone I'm trying it on right now :)
[16:26:05] <Seldaek> I guess what that commenter meant is that it works better than all those other iframe-based fugly doc generator :p
[16:44:58] <jga> good work!
[16:47:01] <Seldaek> cmr: also you should have written the frontend it written in node, you'd have 300 upvotes by now on HN :p
[16:47:18] <cmr> heh
[16:47:36] <cmr> implementation technology is fundamentally uninteresting though ;(
[16:48:03] <Seldaek> yeah but the HN node hipsters don't agree :p
[16:49:49] <cmr> heh
[19:58:19] <Seldaek> man the TODO list is growing :p
[21:56:15] <dbaupp> nice work cmr and Seldaek! :)
[21:56:26] <dbaupp> (and especially Seldaek's frontend stuff.)
[21:57:27] <Seldaek> I think it might be perceptual differences at play here, but I don't feel like I did everything :p
[21:57:44] <Seldaek> I'd have no clue how to even start something like rustdoc_ng :p
[21:58:06] <dbaupp> you're the one going to be taking the heat, since you did the thing everyone sees :P
[21:58:21] <Seldaek> definitely
[21:58:50] <Seldaek> then again the upside is that the current docs are really limited
[21:58:54] <dbaupp> (I guess I'm just sufficiently bad at design etc, that someone who is good seems like a magician :) )
[21:59:07] <Seldaek> yeah that's what I mean by perception :p
[21:59:50] <Seldaek> I'm just a design guru in the land of systems devs, the CPU whisperers :p
[22:00:04] <dbaupp> hahaha :)
[22:01:00] <Seldaek> though really the design part is all thanks to my girlfriend, I would have done a mess of it as well
[22:01:31] <dbaupp> pass on my admiration, then. :)
[22:01:34] <Seldaek> I just did the glue between the photoshop file and the json :P
[22:01:53] <dbaupp> "just" :P
[22:02:14] * dbaupp looks at the backscroll, clearly it was easy and without any pain at all
[22:02:20] <Seldaek> haha
[22:02:47] <Seldaek> no thanks to you for helping "clean up" the json ;)
[22:03:10] * dbaupp runs away
[22:03:26] <dbaupp> (it was for your own good :P )
[22:05:11] <Seldaek> hehe
[23:15:45] <Seldaek> cmr, dbaupp: any ideas how to fix https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6200898 ?
[23:16:38] <cmr> Seldaek: Dunno... maybe just list all the method names and a short description under the traits on the module pages?
[23:16:42] <cmr> For example http://seld.be/rustdoc/master/std/iterator/index.html
[23:16:56] <cmr> AdditiveIterator would list "sum - Iterates over the entire iterator, summing up all the elements"
[23:17:16] <Seldaek> is that a solution though?
[23:17:30] <Seldaek> I don't know if we read the same problem
[23:17:57] <cmr> Well his specific concern was he needs to look into the trait pages to find the `insert` method.
[23:18:01] <cmr> ...I think
[23:18:06] <Seldaek> the issue to me is that for example where do you find str.as_slice() (if this even exists;) ?
[23:18:13] <Seldaek> on http://seld.be/rustdoc/master/std/str/index.html there's nothing about "str" itself
[23:18:30] <cmr> hm, yes.
[23:18:36] <Seldaek> well ok there is http://seld.be/rustdoc/master/std/str/trait.Str.html 
[23:18:43] <Seldaek> but that's like on vec
[23:18:56] <cmr> maybe we *do* need to special-case the builtin types somehow
[23:19:00] <Seldaek> a ton of stuff that's implemented but since we don't show the "vec" struct or whatever it is
[23:19:07] <Seldaek> you can't see them aggregated
[23:19:09] <Seldaek> and that sucks
[23:19:17] <Seldaek> so yes I think it'd be good
[23:19:38] <cmr> I think the JSON already has everything you need for it...
[23:19:44] <Seldaek> maybe they could be on the std page 
[23:19:50] <cmr> it has the raw Primitive and Vector types
[23:20:13] <Seldaek> like on http://seld.be/rustdoc/master/std/index.html there'd be MODULES and PRIMITIVE TYPES
[23:20:15] <cmr> so perhaps you could have a pseudo-module listing the built-in types as "structs" or something
[23:20:18] <cmr> yeah
[23:20:21] <cmr> exactly
[23:20:41] <Seldaek> not sure how to do this
[23:20:44] <Seldaek> but sounds good
[23:21:30] <cmr> maybe in your indexing pass you could just list all the traits implemented for the Primitive/Vector types?
[23:21:31] <Seldaek> what primitives are there.. str, [], ?
[23:21:56] <cmr> int, uint, float, str, bool are the primitives
[23:22:13] <cmr> they are sometimes inside of a Unique or BorrowedRef
[23:22:21] <Seldaek> is vec not one?
[23:22:32] <Seldaek> well, not in the json, but I mean logically speaking for users of the language
[23:22:32] <cmr> vec is Vector in the JSON, not Primitive
[23:22:34] <cmr> ok
[23:22:41] <cmr> so yeah, the numerics, str, and vector
[23:22:50] <Seldaek> and bool :)
[23:23:03] <Seldaek> but I guess bool doesn't have any methods
[23:23:24] <cmr> ah yes bool
[23:23:26] <cmr> it does, actually
[23:23:35] <Seldaek> orly!
[23:23:46] <cmr> oh, nevermind, they are free function
[23:23:56] <cmr> besides like Eq
[23:24:01] <Seldaek> bool.is_bool().is_bool().is_bool()
[23:24:07] <Seldaek> yeah ok
