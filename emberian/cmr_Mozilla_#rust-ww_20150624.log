[19:44:40] <pnkfelix> Tutorial slides link: http://bit.ly/1N93I0P
[19:44:56] <pnkfelix> you can zoom out via `esc`-key, showing an overview
[19:45:11] <Gankro> Elaine: get outta here, free loader! :P
[20:05:19] <Gankro> pnkfelix: "we instead create it within fn fill_vec, and transfer the freshly created from fill_vec" -- should be "the freshly created vec"?
[20:08:06] <Gankro> turpl is now hosted at http://cglab.ca/~abeinges/blah/turpl/_book/ (got rustbook working)

[21:16:53] <steveklabnik> huon beat me to it :)
[21:45:32] <Gankro> "1.0 was rushed -- core team"
[21:48:45] <steveklabnik> https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=765645 <- 
[21:48:48] <steveklabnik> best bug every
[21:48:49] <steveklabnik> ever
[21:50:10] <steveklabnik> Will be issuing Mozilla and Microsoft an invoice for ALL THE TIME i will personally have to spend RE-WRITING the opacity and box shadow codes on EVERY SINGLE PAGE in our entire network, just because you guys REFUSE to include a simple legacy-alias line in the master browser code.
[21:50:15] <steveklabnik> My hourly rate as CEO of this Corporation is HK$1900 or US$247.00 per hour.
[21:51:37] <Elaine> lol
[22:00:45] <aturon> acrichto: wycats: i'm thinking we could run a "cargo install" discussion in parallel with a rustc refactoring discussion; thoughts?
[22:00:57] <acrichto> aturon: sgtm
[22:00:59] <steveklabnik> yeah
[22:01:03] <wycats> what is the cargo install discussion?
[22:01:03] <steveklabnik> i'd be in for that
[22:01:06] <aturon> should edunham join for that?
[22:01:26] <aturon> wycats: figuring out what the feature should actually be, and potentially how to prioritize it
[22:01:35] <wycats> which one should I be in?
[22:01:41] <aturon> cargo install
[22:01:43] <wycats> c
[22:01:56] <wycats> just wanted to make sure I wasn't missing something
[22:06:44] <edunham> aturon: good idea; I'll head back over
[22:06:50] * edunham was sneaking some quiet time to hack on deliverables
[22:08:11] <nrc> edunham: work is not allowed at the work week
[22:16:27] <wycats> lol
[22:16:36] <edunham> nrc: spoken like someone who wants the infrastructure to stay on fire
[22:16:52] <edunham> unfortunately, I must disagree with great prejudice against those goals.
[22:21:01] <acrichto> https://etherpad.mozilla.org/rust-ww-cargo-install
[22:21:23] <nrc> wait, infra is not meant to be on fire?
[23:18:35] *** Joins: brson (brson@moz-ilu.bfn.243.173.IP)
[23:18:40] <brson> don't forget we have to make a release tomorrow
[23:22:40] <brson> i think everything is ready...
[23:22:56] <nrc> brson++
[23:23:36] <huon> which version of rust will the tutorial use?
[23:24:13] <steveklabnik> brson: what about that cargo regression? cc acrichto 
[23:26:45] <brson> unless somebody objects strongly atm it looks like we're shipping it
[23:27:49] <acrichto> steveklabnik: brson: I'm ok with this regression
[23:30:13] <pnkfelix> huon: 1.0 for exercises, nightly for demonstration (b/c I'm showing e.g. thread::scoped at some point)
[23:31:11] <huon> pnkfelix: I'm just thinking that 1.1 will be released tomorrow (and probably before the tutorial)?
