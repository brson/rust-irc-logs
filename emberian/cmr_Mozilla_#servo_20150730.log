[00:34:43] <gw> pcwalton: that diff is just looping over all pending events, right?
[00:35:09] <pcwalton> gw: yeah, I just added a loop { } and changed _ => None to _ => continue
[00:35:17] <pcwalton> and made the "event" at the end into "return event"

[00:36:36] <gw> pcwalton: doesn't that make the poll events iterator block until an event though? or am I misreading?
[00:37:11] <pcwalton> gw: that's covered by the "if event == nil { return None; }" check right after [NSApp nextEventMatchingMask:]
[00:37:41] <gw> pcwalton: ok, so what does this patch actually achieve? sorry, head not working this morning
[00:38:07] <pcwalton> actually, wait, one of the commits is wrong

[00:38:44] *** Joins: gordonb (gordonb@moz-1lu30l.static.qwest.net)
[00:39:01] <pcwalton> so, what the patch does is that seeing an unknown event type doesn't cause poll_events() to just return None
[00:39:10] *** chmanchester is now known as chmanchester|afk
[00:39:12] <pcwalton> instead, it keeps looking for events until it finds an event type it *does* know about
[00:39:28] <pcwalton> this was causing problems in the particles demo because NSApplicationDefined events would start stacking up in front of NSMouseMoved events
[00:39:37] <gw> ah, I see. yep, makes sense. r+
[00:40:11] <gw> probably worth noting that in the commit comment for when we upstream it

[00:50:53] <gw> pcwalton: SimonSapin: ok. here's my spec question. in the percentage paragraph of https://drafts.csswg.org/css2/visudet.html#the-height-property, it says "If the height of the containing block is not specified explicitly (i.e., it depends on content height), and this element is not absolutely positioned, the used height is calculated as if 'auto' was
[00:50:53] <gw> specified." however, we attempt to do this when getting the computed value (see https://github.com/servo/servo/blob/master/components/style/properties.mako.rs#L568). the problem is that we can't actually know if the parent height is explicit at that point (e.g. the parent may have auto for height, but be absolute with top/bottom specified, or parent may be
[00:50:53] <gw> percentage and the grandparent is explicit). so it seems to me we shouldn't do anything when getting the computed value there, and we should handle this later on during layout if we detect that condition when we have all the information available. does that sound right to you?
