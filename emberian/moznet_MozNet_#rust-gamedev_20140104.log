[05:11:00] <acrichto> bjz: hello!
[05:11:05] <bjz> o/
[05:11:12] <acrichto> so right now glfw() returns from poll_events() to get a 60fps frame rate
[05:11:20] <acrichto> can I get it to give me a frame rate of Nfps?
[05:11:34] <bjz> there is glfw::set_swap_interval
[05:11:43] <acrichto> I tried that, but it didn't seem to speed things up
[05:11:44] <bjz> I think that does it
[05:11:46] <bjz> hmm
[05:11:52] <acrichto> hm, maybe I was just using it wrong
[05:12:07] <acrichto> what's the paraemter?
[05:12:08] <acrichto> ms?
[05:12:26] <bjz> I should really make better docs, based of the glfw docs
[05:13:05] <bjz> glfw::window_hint::refresh_rate?
[05:14:01] <acrichto> no dice
[05:14:05] <acrichto> glfw::window_hint::refresh_rate(120);
[05:14:09] <acrichto> glfw::set_swap_interval(120);
[05:14:20] <bjz> http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/group__context.html#ga6d4e0cdf151b5e579bd67f13202994ed
[05:14:39] <acrichto> does that mean a value of 120 is 120fps?
[05:15:00] <pcwalton> acrichto: I don't think you can go higher than 60
[05:15:06] <pcwalton> eglSwapInterval() ain't going to give you higher than 60
[05:15:07] <acrichto> :(
[05:15:09] <bjz> http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/window.html#window_hints_fb
[05:15:11] <pcwalton> DRI2 just doesn't support it
[05:15:15] <bjz> hm
[05:15:16] <pcwalton> you just have to not swap
[05:15:26] <acrichto> how so?
[05:15:39] <acrichto> I barely know what I'm doing graphics-wise as-is
[05:15:49] <bjz> acrichto: could you try glfw::window_hint::refresh_rate(0)?
[05:16:14] <pcwalton> acrichto: actually you could try http://www.khronos.org/registry/egl/sdk/docs/man/xhtml/eglSwapInterval.html
[05:16:18] <pcwalton> eglSwapInterval(0)
[05:16:20] <acrichto> bjz: sadly no
[05:16:25] <pcwalton> that may make eglSwapBuffers() not block
[05:16:36] <pcwalton> you better not call glFinish() or anything that causes a read back though
[05:16:44] <acrichto> umm...
[05:17:06] <pcwalton> set the swap interval in glfw to 0
[05:17:16] <bjz> acrichto: you might have to ask on #glfw
[05:17:19] <acrichto> https://github.com/alexcrichton/jba/blob/rust/src/gl.rs#L58-L66
[05:17:23] <acrichto> so that's my current event loop
[05:17:27] <acrichto> is that completely wrong as-is?
[05:17:34] <bjz> but yeah, try what pcwalton says
[05:17:37] <acrichto> as in relying on poll_events() to only return 60fps
[05:17:45] <pcwalton> the reason you're capped to 60 is that swap buffers ordinarily waits for the X server to reply back from the CopyBuffers DRI2 call
[05:17:53] <pcwalton> and that will happen only 60 FPS I believe
[05:17:58] <pcwalton> you need to make it stop doing that
[05:18:08] <pcwalton> I think you can do that with eglSwapInterval == 0
[05:18:20] <acrichto> bjz: that's not in gl-rs is it?
[05:18:25] <acrichto> I'd have to extern { ... } it
[05:18:40] <bjz> acrichto: glfw should handle that
[05:18:53] <pcwalton> I think we're going to have to switch away from GLFW on Linux sadly
[05:18:56] <pcwalton> for Servo
[05:19:05] <bjz> yeah
[05:19:06] <pcwalton> because of a silly Mesa limitation
[05:19:12] <pcwalton> that means we're going to have to speak raw DRI2 to X
[05:19:14] <pcwalton> which makes me sad
[05:19:20] <acrichto> what library has eglSwapInterval
[05:19:21] <pcwalton> I learned about all that yesterday :)
[05:19:30] <pcwalton> acrichto: I think glfw::set_swap_interval probably wraps it
[05:19:33] <bjz> pcwalton: there is also the issue of android :(
[05:19:55] <pcwalton> for Android you can talk to the surface flinger on ice cream sandwich
[05:20:01] <pcwalton> and get it to make you a SurfaceTexture
[05:20:02] <pcwalton> I believe
[05:20:14] <bjz> pcwalton: I think in the long term you'd want to move away from something like glfw
[05:20:24] <pcwalton> I would like to keep it, it's not a problem with GLFW actually
[05:20:27] <pcwalton> it's a problem with EGL
[05:20:32] <bjz> dang
[05:20:34] <pcwalton> Mesa's implementation of it
[05:20:45] <pcwalton> you can't use a EGL X connection to load an EGLImageKHR that was created on an EGL DRI connection
[05:20:47] <pcwalton> for some silly reason
[05:20:49] <bjz> what does dreda have to say about it?
[05:20:52] <pcwalton> it's just a sanity check
[05:21:22] <pcwalton> we could contribute a DRI2 backend to dreda for GLFW but I bet he would not be happy :)
[05:21:29] <bjz> *she
[05:21:32] <pcwalton> oops, sorry
[05:21:40] <bjz> I would talk to her at least
[05:21:54] <pcwalton> I need to get it working first in my test case
[05:22:02] <pcwalton> I have it working on Nouveau and VMware but not on Intel cards
[05:22:04] <pcwalton> for some odd reason
[05:22:09] <pcwalton> not speaking DRI2 properly I guess
[05:22:41] <bjz> before making any judgements. I know she has a tendency not to want to bend over backwards complicating things for compatibility, but it's worth asking anyway.
[05:22:45] <pcwalton> https://github.com/pcwalton/linux-drm-sharing-test/blob/master/drm-server.c
[05:22:49] <pcwalton> look at that ugliness
[05:23:14] <bjz> :(
[05:23:16] <pcwalton> bjz: the goal of this is to lock down the renderer process in Servo so that it cannot talk to the X server
[05:23:23] <pcwalton> but so that it can still issue GL commands directly
[05:24:02] <pcwalton> since I think this will become secure enough on Servo's time frame and is faster than proxying all GL calls to a separate process
[05:27:40] <bjz> yep
[05:28:12] <bjz> I wonder if we should just be making our own context handling thing. But that would be a huge amount of work

[05:56:17] <Skrylar_> I had to refactor it a bit, I did the same thing as termbox where SDL has a sentry object for cleanup

[09:14:00] <skrylar> bjz: Lua wrapping sure will be "fun"
[09:14:12] <bjz> :P
[09:14:17] <bjz> ugly?
[09:14:27] <skrylar> depends how derpy macros are
[09:14:33] <skrylar> and how smart the optimizer is
[09:16:04] <skrylar> bjz: at least in D its fully possible to use a macro which looks at a function signature, produces a full C-ABI function which makes the appropriate type checks / unboxes and calls the original method
[09:16:34] <skrylar> the D version is literally used something like, "mixin support_lua!(myfunction)" 
[09:17:17] <skrylar> it ought to be possible to have support_lua!(fn myfunction(blah blah custom macro things here)), but i don't know how much will be supported
[09:18:08] <skrylar> you have to do offsets in Lua (e.g. value at -2) which i don't think macros can encode, which means using a variable or stack pops; and i'm not sure that the optimizer is smart enough to realize "let mut x = 0" and later "x += 2" mean "oh, this is always a static assignment, i can get rid of X entirely"
[09:19:39] <bjz> mm
[09:21:35] <skrylar> thats the one thing i don't really like with rust :/ macros need to be more useful
[09:22:21] <skrylar> in any language which goes "we got rid of #define based macros" i usually end up using ERB to put them back in, because there are times a little static code gen from ruby saves a lot of maintenence
[09:23:19] <skrylar> at one point i thought it'd be nice to take a language like Io, and have it so that the source file actually ran in an interpreter; the code output would basically be assembling the AST with the scripting language, and using userland code to compile it
[09:31:21] <skrylar> as for physfs
[09:31:26] <skrylar> i donno, i'll have to play with rust's IO
[09:31:36] <skrylar> bjz: isn't rusts file IO deprecated atm?
[09:32:11] <bjz> mm
[09:32:19] <bjz> you'd have to ask on #rust
[09:33:15] <zokier`> didn't they just bring in a new io system, would it really be already deprecated?

[09:38:38] <zokier`> yeah, old std::io got removed and rt::io was moved in its place

[09:42:09] <skrylar> I've seen a weirdly large number of websites lately doing that horizontal 3-tone look

[09:47:29] <skrylar> theres a handful i've come across lately that look very similar
[09:47:54] <bjz> eh, website trends
[09:48:45] <bjz> on the one hand you want a site to be familiar enough so users don't go "wut", but on the other hand if you make it too similar they go like "bleh"
[09:51:56] * skrylar ponders what to do now
[09:58:10] <skrylar> SDL_Texture and Render modules are probably the best, just because they let you get pixels on the screen

[20:46:03] <bjz> csherratt: well I guess it's projecting a a homogeneous vector into 3d space
[20:48:27] <bjz> "We define the image of P in three-dimensional space, which we denote by ~P, as the projection of P into the three dimensional space in which w = 1 using the formula: ~P = <x/w, y/w, z/w>"
[20:48:31] <bjz> :/
[20:51:55] <bjz> "In the simplest situation, the center of projection is the origin and points are mapped to the plane z = 1, working for the moment in Cartesian coordinates. For a given point in space, (x, y, z), the point where the line and the plane intersect is (x/z, y/z, 1). Dropping the now superfluous z coordinate, this becomes (x/z, y/z)." http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_coordinates#Use_in_computer_graphics
[20:52:08] <bjz> map_tp_cartesian? :P
[20:52:21] <bjz> soops: map_to_cartesian
[20:52:44] <csherratt> hmm.
[20:53:03] <bjz> gotta look at your PRs
[20:53:13] <bjz> sorry, been stressing about a resume
[20:53:36] <csherratt> For internship?
[20:55:12] <bjz> aye
[20:55:51] <bjz> bit late, but it's in now -_-#
[20:56:27] <csherratt> I hate writing a resume. It always feels like bragging.
[20:56:32] <bjz> not sure if we should keep the transform stuff in in the transform types
[20:56:47] <bjz> heh, even worse is the cover letter
[20:57:56] <bjz> it's been a while since I've looked at cgmath, I need to get in the headspace - sorry
[20:58:29] <csherratt> no rush. I just had those two changes in my personal repo for a while and figured I should send them upstream.
[20:58:38] <bjz> yeah
[20:58:52] <bjz> the nice thing about those are they're fast
[20:59:15] <bjz> maybe we need constructors for transform::Decomposed that do that
[20:59:53] <bjz> oh wait
[20:59:55] <bjz> I mean
[21:00:18] <bjz> transform::AffineMatrix3
[21:00:40] <bjz> not sure about the naming of that
[21:00:58] <bjz> well, I guess you can also have an AffineMatrix2
[21:01:31] <bjz> Decomposed should probably Decomposed3
[21:02:13] <bjz> so yea, AffineMatrix3::from_transform
[21:02:36] <bjz> so yea, AffineMatrix3::from_scale

[21:23:37] <csherratt> hmm
[21:37:11] <csherratt> bjz, I am going to drop the translate and scale since Transform3D is equivalent.
