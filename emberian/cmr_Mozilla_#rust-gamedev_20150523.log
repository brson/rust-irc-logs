[06:51:18] <tomaka> With Rust everything always runs perfectly if it compiles
[06:51:29] <HeroesGrave> Unless you have logic errors
[06:51:43] <HeroesGrave> Or you're trying to write safe-ish interfaces to unsafe code
[06:51:46] <tomaka> which doesn't happen since you have strong typing

[06:52:53] <tomaka> didn't you want to use glium? :o
[06:53:19] <HeroesGrave> Yeah, but I decided I'd see if I could finish off my own library first.
[06:54:05] <HeroesGrave> I started off with a different goal in mind than glium and gfx-rs, but as I worked on it, some things didn't work and the working design is now somewhat close to glium
[06:56:47] <HeroesGrave> I think I might give glium a go anyway, to see what it's like
[06:57:13] <tomaka> :)
[06:57:19] <tomaka> I'm here if you have troubles/questions/bugs
[06:57:29] <HeroesGrave> Hopefully I won't
[06:57:34] <HeroesGrave> The docs look pretty good
[06:59:21] <HeroesGrave> Are there still plans to support emscripten?
[06:59:37] <HeroesGrave> There's an issue open but the branch it links to 404s
[07:00:03] <tomaka> Glutin more or less supports it
[07:00:15] <HeroesGrave> Awesome
[07:00:23] <tomaka> but emscripten + rust is ultra hacky
[07:00:44] <tomaka> Even if you manage to setup things correctly (which isn't easy), the compile times are aweful
[07:00:51] <tomaka> like one hour or so every time
[07:00:58] <HeroesGrave> ah.
[07:01:11] <tomaka> working on it would be painful

[23:33:39] <Tiffany> well, dimly lit is pretty relative

[23:49:29] <desophos> Sprite has a generic <I: ImageSize>, which appears to be texture::ImageSize; how can i find out what implements that? that's literally the only code in texture https://github.com/PistonDevelopers/texture/blob/master/src/lib.rs
[23:52:29] <HeroesGrave> Here's one: https://github.com/PistonDevelopers/gfx_texture/blob/master/src/texture.rs
[23:52:43] <Dabo> desophos, I think it would be something in the backend you are using
[23:52:54] <Dabo> like in opengl_graphics or gfx, or whatever it is
[23:53:07] <Dabo> The rendering backend will hold the texture stuff implementations
[23:53:27] <Dabo> https://github.com/PistonDevelopers/opengl_graphics/blob/master/src/texture.rs is where it is for opengl
[23:53:36] <Dabo> HeroesGrave's linked the one for gfx
[23:53:45] <HeroesGrave> One for glium: https://github.com/PistonDevelopers/glium_graphics/blob/master/src/back_end.rs
[23:53:48] <desophos> ok, so graphics re-exports texture::ImageSize?
[23:53:52] <desophos> that's what was confusing me
[23:54:42] <Dabo> desophos, er, no, ImageSize is a trait I think, the backend is just the only thing which implements it
[23:55:01] <desophos> Dabo: yes, but nothing imports texture::ImageSize, it seems
[23:55:05] <desophos> they all import graphics::ImageSize
[23:55:17] <desophos> er, uses, whatever
[23:55:43] <Dabo> desophos, ahhh, yeah
[23:55:58] <desophos> ok, i wasn't sure if they were two different things or not
[23:56:29] <desophos> or if Sprite will accept something that implements texture::ImageSize but not graphics::ImageSize 
[23:56:33] <desophos> er, other way around
[23:57:25] <desophos> i'll try and find out

[23:58:04] <desophos> lol, nvm, Sprite itself uses graphics::ImageSize
[23:58:08] <desophos> the compiler was just confused
[23:58:55] <desophos> well, not confused, but it told me texture::ImageSize because i suppose that's where the trait is originally from
