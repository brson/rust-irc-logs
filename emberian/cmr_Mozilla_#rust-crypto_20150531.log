[13:39:58] <Tiffany> hmm
[13:40:59] <Tiffany> there was an attack on RC4 in the first year it leaked, one that points out that RC4 has some nasty biases
[13:41:12] <Tiffany> RC4 really should have been removed from or never added to SSLv2
[13:41:25] <Tiffany> oh
[13:41:39] <Tiffany> the reason everyone stuck with this cipher despite all its flaws is the performance, isn't it
[13:43:22] <Tobba> probably
[13:44:25] <Tobba> though its history probably has something to do with it
[13:46:37] <Tiffany> I don't really know how the performance compares
[13:46:53] <Tiffany> it's 7 cycles per byte on the original pentium, which is certainly faster than software AES
[13:53:01] <Tobba> I'm not really sure why anyone would think it was a good idea even before it was broken though
[13:53:17] <Tobba> it was just based on poorly understood logic
[13:54:23] <Tobba> I'm also not sure why people say "leaked"
[13:54:31] <Tobba> I guarantee someone just RE'd it
[13:54:46] <Tiffany> maybe
[13:54:55] <Tiffany> but in any case, it went from being a trade secret, to not being a trade secret
[13:55:04] <Tiffany> and was never officially published
[14:30:23] <Ilari> Has Chrome moved RC4 to fallbacks only yet?
[14:54:23] <Ilari> Apparently yes..
[15:05:20] <Ilari> Ugh, looks like no Mac OS X or iOS version supports proper TLS ciphers.
