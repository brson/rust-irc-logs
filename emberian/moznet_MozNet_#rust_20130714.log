[02:31:47] <jmgrosen> what's the easiest way to sleep on a task? extra::timer::sleep? if so, where do i get &IoTask?
[02:32:38] <dbaupp> jmgrosen: I think there's a global_task function or something like that, that returns the current task
[02:32:42] <dbaupp> jmgrosen: but I don't know
[02:32:49] <strcat> jmgrosen: in libextra there's global_uv_loop::get or something
[02:32:55] <strcat> and it gives you an IoTask
[02:33:20] <strcat> extra::uv_global_loop::get()
[02:33:29] <jmgrosen> strcat, dbaupp, and is that "global" to the current task?
[02:33:52] <strcat> woo it updated the iterator tutorial
[02:34:03] <dbaupp> jmgrosen: http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/extra/uv_global_loop.html
[02:34:05] <strcat> jmgrosen: it's really global, I think there's just one event loop
[02:34:15] <strcat> it's totally safe to use it from different tasks though
[02:34:27] <strcat> http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/tutorial-container.html#iterators :D
[02:34:32] <jmgrosen> strcat: but what if i only want to pause one task?
[02:34:36] <strcat> now covers double-ended iterators and size hints among other things
[02:34:43] <strcat> jmgrosen: it will only pause 1 task
[02:34:50] <jmgrosen> strcat: oh, okay
[02:34:50] <strcat> jmgrosen: it's just the event loop that's global
[02:34:52] * dbaupp loves how uv::hl doesn't exist any more
[02:35:17] <strcat> jmgrosen: as in there's one event loop using epoll on files/sockets/timerfd/signalfd (on Linux, other APIs elsewhere)
[02:35:30] <jmgrosen> strcat: gotcha, that makes sense
[02:35:38] <strcat> so on Linux, libuv will use timerfd to get a kernel timer and just add it to the fd event loop with epoll
[02:35:56] <dbaupp> strcat: yay good documentation! :D
[02:36:00] <strcat> jmgrosen: the rust APIs have a long way to go though, it's odd to event have an IoTask at all.
[02:36:22] <dbaupp> jmgrosen: extra::uv is probably going to disappear with the new runtime too
[02:36:26] <jmgrosen> strcat: i agree totally :3
[02:36:34] <jmgrosen> dbaupp: ah? the new one entirely in rust, that is?
[02:36:45] <dbaupp> jmgrosen: yeah
[02:37:19] <dbaupp> jmgrosen: I believe most of the functionality is moving to be wrapped up as part of the runtime, so there will hopefully be a decent api

[04:15:59] <Jeaye> Where did local_data go? Maybe we should update a changelog as we go, instead of just for each release? Or should we all just be digging through commits?
[04:16:49] * Jeaye didn't mean to sounds condescending, but, in retrospect, probably did.
[04:17:06] <goffrie> std::local_data?
[04:17:28] <Jeaye> Yup.
[04:17:51] <goffrie> I mean, is std::local_data not there?
[04:18:41] <Jeaye> rustc is telling me it's not.
[04:19:01] <goffrie> hmm, because I still have src/libstd/local_data.rs
[04:19:16] <goffrie> looks like the interface changed slightly recently, though (?)
[04:19:37] <Jeaye> Well, the 'use' didn't fail, but where I was using it (and where it was previously working) is not longer compiling due to an unresolved local_data::local_data_ge.
[04:19:46] <goffrie> local_data::get I think
[04:19:52] <Jeaye> So, you're right, it's actually just the interface that changed.
[04:19:57] <Jeaye> Apologies.
[04:20:12] <goffrie> I actually have no idea about this and I'm just looking through `git log -p` :p
[04:21:02] <Jeaye> Yeah, that's what I often do (or ask in here). A changelog in the repo would be nice for those who aren't following bors.

[11:29:28] <dbaupp> awesome
[11:29:34] <drrb> I've had a couple of troubles with it
[11:29:43] <drrb> Firsly, I've just noticed some emails from a couple of months ago implying that the grammar might be abandoned
[11:30:17] <drrb> And secondly, it looks pretty convoluted in parts (to ensure it's LL(1), i gather)
[11:30:36] <drrb> I just wanted to check if anyone knows what's happening with it?

[11:31:18] <drrb> (e.g., is it being abandoned/refactored to be more readable/practical at the expense of being LL(1)?)
[11:31:51] <dbaupp> I think stuff like that (i.e. formalising the parts of the language) is stalled
[11:31:55] <dbaupp> since it moves so fast
[11:33:01] <dbaupp> and, the last commit was 2 months ago, which is an age in Rust-land
[11:33:10] <drrb> Until the language stabilises?
[11:33:39] <dbaupp> yeah... while I don't know for sure, I'd guess it it's been set aside for now.
[11:34:51] <drrb> Ok, no worries. I think I might write my own for now.

Often that allows to see a mistake in either the assumptions the author made (the "why" part) or the translation into code (the "what you intended to do")
[13:32:11] <dbaupp> jfbk: `rustc --emit-llvm -S my-file.rs`
[13:32:34] <dbaupp> jfbk: (leaving off --emit-llvm outputs the final asm, leaving off -S outputs the LLVM bitcode.)

[13:34:35] <doener> jfbk: sometimes you might want to add --passes "" to avoid all inlining
[13:35:00] <ChrisMorgan> Ick. Don't like that, two flags which actually use the full four states to mean utterly different and non-obvious things—why not make it obvious and have --emit={asm,llvm-ir,llvm-bitcode} (or more boolean flags, which can then be done together to output more than one of them at once)?
[13:35:05] <dbaupp> doener: yeah, good commit messages are always very nice when going back in time... maybe we should start being harder on decent commit messages/a clean history for pull requests?
[13:35:25] <dbaupp> ChrisMorgan: "why not make it obvious" = no-one's done it yet
[13:35:43] <dbaupp> ChrisMorgan: feel free to change it to be more reasonable :)
[13:35:54] <ChrisMorgan> Actually, no need for the bool flags to get more than one. --emit=asm,llvm-ir would work, as would --emit=asm and --emit=llvm-ir. But I prefer boolean ones.
[13:36:06] <doener> dbaupp: I'd be supportive of that, but it's not my call to make

[14:17:14] <jozefg> So may I ask a somewhat general question about rust?
[14:18:30] <ChrisMorgan> Does rustc x.rs -o foo produce a file named foo on Windows, or foo.exe?
[14:18:46] <ChrisMorgan> jozefg: first rule of thumb for IRC: don't ask to ask, just ask!
[14:19:28] <ChrisMorgan> (Read: yes!)
[14:19:31] <dbaupp> ChrisMorgan: probably foo, but I have no idea.
[14:19:50] <ChrisMorgan> I would expect and hope foo, but I don't know for sure.
[14:19:57] <dbaupp> ChrisMorgan: since on linux, rustc -S x.rs -o foo will dump the asm to foo (not foo.s)
[14:20:00] <jozefg> ChrisMorgan: Right, I'm writing a runtime system right now in C and dying on the inside. I'd love to switch to a more typesafe language like rust, Is it possible with rusts's runtime to create a garbage collector/interface nicely with x86? Not worried about delays due to rusts garbage collector
[14:20:12] <spider-mario> is the master branch broken right now?
[14:20:18] <jozefg> More just wondering if it's feasible at all
[14:20:29] <spider-mario> on my machine, it deletes x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/stage0/lib/rustc/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/lib/libmorestack.a before extracting the stage0 archive
[14:20:36] <spider-mario> then, ld complains that it can’t find -lmorestack
[14:21:04] <spider-mario> is libmorestack.a missing from the stage0 archive?
[14:21:25] <dbaupp> jozefg: Rust's runtime system is currently being rewritten to Rust, and there is a GC written in Rust (the GC for Rust itself), so the answer is yes.
[14:21:49] <dbaupp> jozefg: (that GC hasn't landed yet, though.)
[14:21:49] <jozefg> :D Excellent
[14:22:11] <jozefg> Is the source available online?
[14:22:22] <jozefg> I seem to remember rust being foss
[14:22:48] <dbaupp> spider-mario: I built a few hours ago on x64 and x86 linux and it worked... does running ./configure && make again help?

[17:02:00] <doomlord> interesting stuff
[17:02:18] <thiez> doomlord: I'm not doing that kind of stuff, but there are a lot of 3-element vectors of f32 :)
[17:02:54] <doomlord> it can help on some platforms, it can reduce code size which is nice
[17:03:49] <doomlord> i suppose you might have math speed masked by memory issues if you aren't seeing a speedup (or was the compiler already doing any auto-vectorizing? )
[17:04:20] <thiez> doomlord: I doubt it was vectorizing, but can't really be bothered to read the assembly tbh :p
[17:04:35] <thiez> perhaps I should have a look
[17:04:40] <doomlord> sometimes simd can be a slowdown, if doing branchy code,if the simd unit has a deeper pipeline..

[17:12:10] <strcat> mark_edward: yes, but not in the current form it is now
[17:12:24] <jensnockert> doomlord: It is also because SIMD vectors in Rust are stored in memory, not registers, possibly.
[17:12:28] <MaikKlein> does someone know if there is a mathematical programming language with a compiler? where you could write sth like A{1,2,3,4} is_subset of B{1,2,3,4,5,6,7}
[17:12:30] <strcat> it needs to be a balanced binary tree, and have a completely redone API
[17:12:46] <jensnockert> MaikKlein: Mathematica?
[17:12:48] <doomlord> oh that would be a killer, if it was moving more temporaries out to the stack or whatever

[17:13:30] <thiez> jensnockert: surely LLVM would correct that with optimizations on?

[18:52:58] <lpapp> rust would be nice, but there is 1-2 features I personally dislike. Perhaps, I do not know much about them, and that is why.
[18:53:04] <cmr> lpapp: which?
[18:53:17] <goffrie> lpapp: we must know :)
[18:53:28] <lpapp> I do not like "fn" personally.
[18:53:54] <lpapp> I understand it can help avoiding the AST complexity.
[18:54:08] <lpapp> but those things are not handled by end users in C++, but the compiler.
[18:54:17] <lpapp> so a regular user might feel it an additional coding work.
[18:54:24] <kimundi> lpapp: The nice thing about fn and let is that it makes rust code very grep-able
[18:54:25] <goffrie> well, it avoids silliness like the "Foo bar(Bar());" stuff in C++ :)
[18:54:25] <lpapp> and another mistake for errors when it is forgotten.
[18:54:38] <cmr> well it makes the grammar LL(1)
[18:54:40] <engla> fn is our best keyword, so short and nice
[18:54:40] <lpapp> another potential*
[18:54:43] <sp3d> they're handled by end-users who have to wait much longer at compile in C++ than it takes to type those 3 characters every so often
[18:54:44] <cmr> C++ grammar isn't context free, Rust is.
[18:54:58] <jesse99> it's nice for tooling in general, syntax highlighting for example
[18:55:00] <cmr> (Also, we don't have to type out the "void" return type..)
[18:55:09] <goffrie> (heh, so many people suddenly jumped in!)
[18:55:23] <sp3d> mention syntax and everyone has an opinion ;)
[18:55:53] <lpapp> 19:55 < cmr> C++ grammar isn't context free, Rust is. -> yes.
[18:56:16] <lpapp> jesse99: yeah, but many people are not using special tools.
[18:56:35] <lpapp> many people are stuck with vi(m), like me. :)
[18:56:38] <jesse99> well the noise thing about rust is that you can highlight it well using dirt simple tools
[18:56:42] <vladimir-lu> but fn compares quite nicely with say, Scala or Python
[18:56:53] <jesse99> there are vim rust stylers
[18:56:58] <lpapp> vladimir-lu: yes, like def in python, but I disliked it there, too. :)
[18:56:59] <engla> lpapp: many of us are "stuck" with vim too
[18:57:17] <Earnestly> I like being stuck with vim :< (although emacs is nice too)
[18:57:21] <strcat> http://stackoverflow.com/a/14589567/1009916 there's a code sample there where the C++ compiler has to check if a number is prime before the program can be fully parsed

[18:59:40] <goffrie> lpapp: that's true, but rust has more powerful type inference
[18:59:42] <strcat> auto infers the type from the RHS expression
[18:59:44] <lpapp> but honestly, I have no clue what let is
[18:59:45] <cmr> vladimir-lu: lots of things.
[18:59:52] <sp3d> but generally rust compilation would be slower with a harder-to-parse grammar
[18:59:56] <lpapp> so, I rather stay away from talking about parallelism.
[18:59:59] <kimundi> rusti: let x = 5; x
[19:00:00] -rusti- 5
[19:00:03] <strcat> 'let' in rust can destructure patterns and the type inference is done throughout the local function
[19:00:05] <kimundi> rusti: let x: uint = 5; x
[19:00:06] -rusti- 5
[19:00:06] <strcat> it's not just from the RHS
[19:00:21] <vladimir-lu> ok
[19:00:29] <strcat> rusti: let mut xs = ~[]; xs.push(5) /* type of `xs` inferred here */; xs
[19:00:30] -rusti- ~[5]
[19:00:39] <kimundi> rusti: let (x, _, y) = (1, 2, 3); x + y
[19:00:39] <cmr> vladimir-lu: I honestly think it would just need to be rewritten
[19:00:40] -rusti- 4
[19:01:05] <lpapp> phew, you started typing a lot. :)
[19:01:10] <lpapp> but it is good.
[19:01:10] <sigma> was there not an antlr grammar floating around somewhere?
[19:01:19] <goffrie> and we have fun stuff like return-type inference, which C++ can't do.

[19:01:29] <vladimir-lu> lpapp: also, having the grammar context-free means it's easier to build tools for IDEs :P
[19:01:29] <lpapp> if "fn" does not result faster compilation, then I am back to my original opinion.
[19:01:36] <cmr> goffrie: return type inference is explicitly a no-no
[19:01:36] <strcat> goffrie: only for closures
[19:01:40] <goffrie> wait, we don't? ... oops, never mind
[19:01:44] <lpapp> vladimir-lu: sure, but the thing is this for me:
[19:01:57] <strcat> goffrie: rust explicitly chooses to only do type inference in local scopes
[19:01:57] <lpapp> 1) Languages are better optimized for end users
[19:01:59] <goffrie> maybe I didn't understand what return-type inference means
[19:02:00] <strcat> so closures have types inferred
[19:02:03] <jesse99> it's just way better to be unambiguous about where functions are for everyone, people and tools included
[19:02:09] <strcat> global constants/functions don't
[19:02:09] *** Joins: LU324_ (stuff@moz-A17E9A7B.dyn.embarqhsd.net)
[19:02:11] <lpapp> 2) Because tools are written by a "few" people, but the language is used by million.
[19:02:23] <goffrie> oh, yes, what I meant was something like let f = <something with multiple possible return types>
[19:02:23] <jesse99> c++ for example is horrid, to reliably find functions you need a very sophisticated parseer
[19:02:37] <strcat> lpapp: it's not going to change, Rust has `fn` because we think it looks better than the alternative

[19:02:53] <strcat> and there's a goal to have good support for editors like vim with only regexp to highlight syntax
[19:02:59] <vladimir-lu> right, so surely something that makes it more obvious what a particular construct is doing is better for end-users?
[19:03:03] <engla> Rust has functions that are generic over the return type
[19:03:12] <cmr> lpapp: (Of all the semantic things to disagree with, the `fn` syntax is so absoluetly trivial...)

[19:03:38] <lpapp> cmr: yeah, I am not saying it is hard.

[19:03:50] <lpapp> I am just saying, I need to type as an end programmer than it would be necessary.
[19:03:52] <strcat> and closures
[19:04:03] <cmr> lpapp: it's still less than c++
[19:04:08] <cmr> 'void foo() { ... }'
[19:04:12] <cmr> 'fn foo() { ... }'
[19:04:16] <lpapp> I understand that the IDE and editor developers would have somewhat more difficult times, but on the other hand, the majority (end programmers) would need to type less.
[19:04:17] <vladimir-lu> lpapp: be aware that most of the time you're reading, not typing
[19:04:27] <strcat> lpapp: it has `fn` because it looks good, that's all
[19:04:31] <strcat> lpapp: it's easy to read
[19:04:42] <strcat> the concerns about good support for editors came later afaik
[19:04:59] <strcat> it's not going to change so it's not productive to bikeshed about it
[19:05:00] <goffrie> lpapp: most people here don't seem to mind :) and it adds some consistency between function declarations and function types, too.
[19:05:19] <lpapp> goffrie: well, a language is not designed for people on irc, but maybe at large out there. ;)
[19:05:23] <thiez> Surely the implicit return more than makes up for the horrible task of having to type 'fn'?
[19:05:44] <strcat> lpapp: declarations and type definitions mirror each other

[19:07:52] <lpapp> goffrie: surely, so could a "C++ grepper".
[19:08:06] <lpapp> for the end user it does not matter what tool they call in the end of the day. :)
[19:08:13] <strcat> lpapp: you can't parse C++ without doing type checking though
[19:08:18] <strcat> and type checking is turing complete
[19:08:20] <jesse99> I think the main problems were changes to generics, borrowed pointers, and such
[19:08:23] <doomlord_> you could probably make a text editor insert 'fn' automatically :) that'd be a lot easier than the things you have to deal with in c++ tools..
[19:08:24] <thiez> except that the C++ grepper would be ridiculously complex, making it slower.
[19:08:26] <strcat> in C++
[19:08:31] <lpapp> strcat: yep, but the ground work can be done by the tool whatever it is.
[19:08:39] <lpapp> so I am not concerned about aiding the tool.

[19:09:27] <vladimir-lu> lpapp: have you ever used say, VS C++ or Xcode for C++ writing? the completion is horrible, precisely because parsing/making sense of C++ is so difficult
[19:09:35] <strcat> lpapp: it's there because 'fn(int, int) -> bool' is the type of a 'fn foo(x: int, y: int) -> bool'
[19:09:44] <cmr> vladimir-lu: eh? visual studio's c++ intellisense is fantastic
[19:09:53] <cmr> at least in recent versions, dunno about older ones
[19:10:03] <lpapp> strcat: you can have alternative return syntax in c++ too.
[19:10:07] <doomlord_> whilst you're editing text, the code is in an incomplete state- markers (and context free grammar) would make it easier to give auto completion assist 
[19:10:08] <sigma> I've always found it really slow on lower end machines...
[19:10:20] <strcat> lpapp: it's not there as an alternative to anything, it's consistent with the type
[19:10:28] <goffrie> I've only used kdevelop for c++, and found it had quite good completion, until you started using templates :P
[19:10:28] <vladimir-lu> cmr: it still comes short of the Java tools
[19:10:39] <lpapp> strcat: I mean, you can achieve this with C++11:
[19:10:41] <strcat> lpapp: rust tries hard to make declaration, destructuring, construction and the type definition use the same syntax
[19:10:45] <strcat> lpapp: I'm not talking about C++
[19:10:50] <strcat> I'm talking about what rust does
[19:10:52] <jesse99> I've found studio's c++ auto-complete awful with older versions of studio, c#'s is really nice tho
[19:10:58] <lpapp> "'fn foo(x: int, y: int) -> bool" - "foo(x: int, y: int) -> bool"
[19:11:18] <strcat> lpapp: rust puts 'fn' there because the type uses 'fn' and the language makes them use the same syntax
[19:11:20] <lpapp> strcat: yeah, but I am trying to give a practical example of why I prefer markes less function writing.

[19:14:01] <jensnockert> fn makes it a lot more greppable.

[19:23:17] <strcat> definitely not going to be in C++14 at least
[19:23:19] <cmr> lpapp: there's no objective way to measure syntax besides how it can be parsed, and Rust is objectively better than C++ in that regard.

[19:24:29] <strcat> it's somewhat ridiculous to say rust has more typing than C++
[19:24:36] <strcat> honestly sounds like trolling
[19:24:38] <lpapp> no no
[19:24:39] <cmr> lpapp: Yes, it's another factor to deal with, but it's extremely trivially unimportant
[19:24:46] <lpapp> I am not saying rust has more typing.

[19:25:01] <lpapp> I am claimng, as I wrote before, marker is more typing *in general* than no marker.
[19:25:06] <doomlord_> i like rust because i'm very lazy when it comes to typing and navigating
[19:25:07] <lpapp> claiming*
[19:25:12] <sigma> afaik removing "fn" would lead to more typing being required in other places
[19:25:42] <lpapp> why?
[19:25:54] <doomlord_> if i had to type "function " to get rid of header files.. i still would
[19:26:07] <goffrie> oh boy, CPP :p
[19:26:31] <strcat> lpapp: there are baseline requirements like the language being memory safe, and tokenizing being possible with only regexp
[19:26:46] <doomlord_> its a good tradeoff IMO - a few extra keywords and colons here and there to make a language where you dont have to keep the declarations in a specific order..
[19:26:57] <doomlord_> .. makes moving things around much more pleasurable

[19:27:04] <lpapp> strcat: it is not the language layer to solve IMO. These are compiler internals.
[19:27:06] <strcat> lpapp: there are alternatives to 'fn', sure, but the ones meeting the basic requirements aren't going to be any prettier
[19:27:11] <strcat> lpapp: it's nothing to do with a compiler
[19:27:29] <nano> TIL rust syntax is designed to be parsed by regex
[19:27:32] <strcat> all rust code needs to be able to be syntax highlighted accurately by vim, pygments, kate/pandoc, etc.
[19:27:37] <strcat> nano: not parsed, tokenized
[19:27:45] <nano> yeah
[19:27:51] <goffrie> ^ yeah. regex can't even deal with parens :)
[19:28:02] <doomlord_> visual studio is the best C++ IDE - but to this day i still miss the window manipulation of "breif"..
[19:28:17] <lpapp> strcat: I have syntax highlight in C++ with vim.
[19:28:35] <goffrie> lpapp: sure, but it's limited compared to what vim can do with more-easily-parsed languages.
[19:28:45] <strcat> lpapp: it can accurate highlight function calls vs. types? no
[19:28:46] <lpapp> goffrie: why?
[19:28:49] <strcat> accurately*
[19:28:53] <lpapp> it is the matter of a vim plugin.
[19:29:02] <lpapp> using libclang underneath for instance.
[19:29:11] <lpapp> with a proper binding.
[19:29:12] <jensnockert> People tend to hate me when I say I actually like xcode for C++ stuff :(
[19:29:16] <goffrie> lpapp: I'm not aware of any vim highlighter that uses clang :)
[19:29:24] <Ralith> xcode is clang-based
[19:29:28] <lpapp> goffrie: yes because clang is new.
[19:29:29] <Ralith> I understand that that allows it to be very good
[19:29:35] <strcat> I'm not aware of vim syntax highlighting being done with anything but the vim syntax highlighting engine
[19:29:39] <lpapp> goffrie: but I do not see technical limitations to work out one.
[19:29:39] <jensnockert> Xcode is nice.
[19:29:47] <strcat> syntax checking + quick fix, yes
[19:29:48] <Ralith> especially the snazzy static analyzer integration
[19:29:59] <doomlord_> jensnockert, xcode /mac is nice ... :)
[19:30:31] <doomlord_> every language has a series of tradeoffs, some of which are just subjective preferences
[19:30:36] <doomlord_> there's plenty in C++ that is just subjective
[19:30:40] <strcat> I don't think vim really offers integration with an external syntax highlighter
[19:30:45] <doomlord_> and in java, c# etc
[19:30:46] <strcat> there's just no way to do it
[19:30:49] <lpapp> so, this is a show stopper for me with rust right now, but I shared my opinion as an end developer as requested, anyway. :-)
[19:31:05] <jensnockert> doomlord_: It is.
[19:31:14] <jensnockert> doomlord_: I may be biased though.
[19:31:19] <strcat> lpapp: alright, it's not going to ever change though
[19:31:22] <doomlord_> couldn't you make a macro to automatically insert 'fn ' 
[19:31:39] * jesse99 can't fathom how having to type 'fn' could be a show stopper
[19:31:45] <doomlord_> i mean you could write the source without 'fn' , and something like a code-formatter inserts it
[19:31:58] <SiegeLord> You can't satisfy every developer
[19:32:03] <strcat> lpapp: it could also omit the 'struct' and 'static' keywords too
[19:32:08] <strcat> and just infer that from the patterns
[19:32:11] <strcat> 'impl' too
[19:32:15] <lpapp> SiegeLord: fwiw, I am at a C++'ish conference, and many people think like that.
[19:32:26] <jesse99> well my thought is that he is either trolling like someone said earlier, or he's only been programming for like 3 months
[19:32:38] <goffrie> lpapp: that seems incredible to me, that people worry about three chars :)
[19:32:40] <strcat> lpapp: it's not going to change though, really - talking about it isn't productive
[19:32:52] <doomlord_> compared to the other features in the language ...
[19:32:57] <lpapp> strcat: yes, static could be removed when it is clear from the context.
[19:32:59] <SiegeLord> lpapp: It's the objective truth... the developers need to be flexible
[19:33:01] <doomlord_> this is how i see it;
[19:33:11] <Earnestly> strcat: I suggest we paint it red
[19:33:15] <strcat> the basic syntax of the language has been hashed out and debated time and time again
[19:33:17] <lpapp> strcat: well, you asked my opinion
[19:33:21] <doomlord_> people move from C/C++ to java, C#, or scripting langauges for *programmer productivity* benefits
[19:33:23] <jensnockert> goffrie: I wish it was function sometimes :(
[19:33:29] <lpapp> do not blame me when I try to please you... :)
[19:33:31] <SiegeLord> I don't like 100% of rust's syntax decisions, but I know you can't satisfy everybody
[19:33:35] <goffrie> jensnockert: how come?
[19:33:39] <SiegeLord> At least it uses {}'s and ;'s :P
[19:33:45] <strcat> the basic syntax of the language has been hashed out and debated time and time again, it's not really up for debate anymore
[19:33:46] <doomlord_> wouldn't the world be a better place if they had the same benefits they seek in a more efficeint native , deterministic memory managed language
[19:33:57] <jensnockert> goffrie: Easier on the eyes imho, nothing else.
[19:34:09] <doomlord_> Theres' nothing else that has rusts blend of efficiency and convinience
[19:34:16] <goffrie> jensnockert: hm, to me it's just the opposite :P
[19:34:19] <cmr> doomlord_: and safety
[19:34:34] <doomlord_> i've looked at many other langauges (seeking mental excercise) .. but i had to reject them all because of GC
[19:34:48] <goffrie> jensnockert: javascript's functions are just so painful to write, haha. (so I use coffeescript.)
[19:34:51] <doomlord_> yet there are SO many things they do so elegantly that one finds C++ clunky afterward
[19:35:09] <jensnockert> goffrie: Mainly because JS sucks deluxe.
[19:35:17] <goffrie> true :P
[19:35:43] <jensnockert> Exceptionally so when trying to do low-level stuff.
[19:35:49] <doomlord_> in C++ you're cursed with different function call syntax based on acess rights/location within module ... there's a constant alternation between a.foo(b) and foo(a,b) .. its a mess
[19:36:05] <lpapp> I heard that rust supports multicore programming "natively".
[19:36:17] <lpapp> how about gpu programming?
[19:36:28] <doomlord_> they're not that far yet :)
[19:36:31] <cmr> lpapp: there was prelim work on it but it didn't mature.
[19:36:47] <doomlord_> considering how long the language has been around, its doing rather well
[19:36:48] <lpapp> I guess gpus are just as prevalent as multiple cpus.
[19:37:01] <goffrie> doomlord_: we don't have UFCS just yet :p
[19:37:17] <vladimir-lu> but they have different challenges and OpenCL seems to be the best bet for general computing with them for now

[19:37:37] <goffrie> lpapp: well, I have yet to use any program that uses gpu processing and I suspect it wouldn't work too well on my machine anyway (crappy graphics card, open source drivers, ... :P)
[19:37:59] <lpapp> Ralith: actually, gpus are pretty general for algorithms nowadays.
[19:38:02] <goffrie> I mean, gpu compute, not "gpu processing".
[19:38:04] <jensnockert> vladimir-lu: There is a standardized bytecode for OpenCL though, which is essentially LLVM bitcode. So compiling rust to that, wouldn't be too hard.
[19:38:11] <thiez> goffrie: CTFE would be even nicer.
[19:38:12] <SiegeLord> It'd be... interesting to have a Rust->OpenCL compiler
[19:38:19] <Ralith> lpapp: I'm not sure what that is supposed to mean.
[19:38:30] <lpapp> goffrie: yeah, I guess, but I think it is a very important step towards proper empowered computing.

[19:39:20] <goffrie> vladimir-lu: I think you might be thinking of mixins though
[19:39:27] <vladimir-lu> goffrie: yep - enjoy debugging those strings you generated
[19:39:29] <lpapp> Ralith: gpus are available even on the cheapest hardwares, like 20-25 USD for a raspberry pi.
[19:39:40] <thiez> mixins and ctfe are a pretty powerful combination
[19:39:42] <Ralith> yes?
[19:39:50] <goffrie> CTFE+mixins is pretty much that though: foot-shootingly powerful.
[19:39:51] <lpapp> Ralith: see the MS keyword for it, just as an example.
[19:40:00] <lpapp> that is a bit tigther integration into the language than say, OpenCL.
[19:40:03] <jensnockert> lpapp: Yeah, but those do not support OpenCL.

[19:42:31] <SiegeLord> goffrie: The LLVM D compiler has the advantage of being written in C++, heh
[19:42:38] <lpapp> the point is that you have got a GPU for extremely cheap nowadays unlike decades ago.
[19:42:41] <lpapp> it is just as popular as multicores.
[19:43:09] <goffrie> SiegeLord: what, is there something wrong with Rust? ;)
[19:43:16] <doomlord_> thing is that GPU  programming can still be done by other means
[19:43:20] <lpapp> and certain domain people would be more interested in gpu support than multithreading for several CPU cores.
[19:43:26] <SiegeLord> goffrie: It can't interface with LLVM primary API
[19:43:30] <jensnockert> goffrie: Yeah, the LLVM C interface is the issue :(
[19:43:32] <doomlord_> rust is here to solve problems of complex, large software
[19:43:33] <lpapp> just like multithreading can be done ...
[19:43:35] <goffrie> oh yeah, I forgot about that.
[19:43:47] <doomlord_> GPU programming tends to be simple algorithms run on large datasets
[19:43:54] <goffrie> let's write our own codegen :P
[19:43:59] <doomlord_> GPU's are inherently not optimized for large programs
[19:44:03] <cmr> lpapp: it's trivial to do with syntax extensions though... rust can easily support it.
[19:44:08] <doomlord_> thats the difference between CPU and GPU
[19:44:13] <lpapp> "simple algorithms", heh. :)
[19:44:19] <doomlord_> CPU's are optimized for large programs.. which is what rust is designed for
[19:44:21] <thiez> rusts pointer semantics could map nicely to GPU, but for now rust development will focus on completing the language :)
[19:44:29] <goffrie> ^ pretty much.
[19:44:30] <doomlord_> +1
[19:44:34] <cmr> lpapp: hell, it could be extern "GPU" fn foo() { ... }
[19:44:56] <lpapp> cmr: that is what I meant by the MS language support, yes.
[19:45:04] <doomlord_> the fact rust doesn't have shared memory between tasks is more like GPU than c++

[19:45:30] <SiegeLord> GPU programming is all about shared memory though...
[19:45:38] <doomlord_> its more suited to a functional style which is very well suited to parallelism..
[19:45:57] <lpapp> so the short answer is "no", then.
[19:46:00] <doomlord_> .. the syntax is designed to be more pleasant for a functional style .. whereas C++ inherits from C

[19:47:50] <Ralith> jensnockert: the LLVM folks are happy to accept patches to the C API
[19:48:05] <Ralith> jensnockert: though in my experience you're best off just writing a bunch of shims yourself.
[19:48:08] <lpapp> well, a C++ developer would say header files are not that bad
[19:48:10] <jensnockert> Ralith: Yeah…
[19:48:13] <lpapp> the ones I talk to, in here.
[19:48:22] <lpapp> if you mind them, the IDE can always help you.
[19:48:39] <lpapp> like you change the const modifier, and it adds for you automatically in the header file.
[19:48:44] <doomlord_> i think an IDE to insert "fn " is easier than an IDE to manage header files
[19:48:46] <lpapp> so basically the question is where the issue is addressed.
[19:48:46] <Earnestly> I don't know, when languages need IDe to support them, I grow suspicious
[19:48:52] <Earnestly> s/IDEs
[19:49:03] <lpapp> I personally agree about that, it should be addressed at the compiler level similarly to the preprocessor.
[19:49:10] <cmr> they're necessary for templates and such though, we don't need them in rust for generics.

[19:49:54] <lpapp> does rust have a header file generator option?
[19:49:59] <cmr> Earnestly: They are monomorphized, yes.

[19:50:08] <Earnestly> Aw, okay
[19:50:20] <goffrie> lpapp: "rust header file" isn't super meaningful, since it wouldn't be actual Rust syntax.
[19:50:22] <cmr> Earnestly: The alternative is dynamic dispatch.
[19:50:28] <cmr> Earnestly: which we have trait objects for.
[19:50:39] <lpapp> cmr: that I do not like. ;)
[19:50:42] <doomlord_> you can generate a summary of every item declared in rust with a grep :)
[19:50:46] <lpapp> cmr: I still think that a summarized header file is good.
[19:50:56] <lpapp> cmr: but I agree about that I would not like to type it.
[19:50:58] <doomlord_> because its' generated and not edited, it can be kept in sync
[19:51:00] <goffrie> what is it that rustdoc does?
[19:51:04] <doomlord_> more easily
[19:51:09] <lpapp> hence, I thought there could be a compiler option to generate it, for those who are interested.
[19:51:13] <cmr> goffrie: parses the source, extracts doc comments.
[19:51:18] <cmr> (uses libsyntax)
[19:51:33] <doomlord_> i use grep (trait|impl|struct|fn) :) the output is much like a header
[19:51:33] <lpapp> goffrie: not fully, but protodef helps some.
[19:51:34] <goffrie> I feel like rustdoc is analogous to generating a header file in some way
[19:51:35] <cmr> lpapp: Oh, you mean just a summary of all the "classes" and their methods and such?
[19:51:41] <lpapp> cmr: yep.

[19:58:46] <doomlord_> have i understood correctly that networked applications is a big focus for rust (i.e. browsers) - the solution is lightweight tasks, 'actor model' - (see erlang?)
[19:58:59] <lpapp> cmr: let us say, you need to handle errors on close.
[19:59:15] <lpapp> cmr: but it is not recommmended in C++ for a valid reason to throw exceptions in the destructors.
[19:59:23] <cmr> lpapp: we don't have exceptions
[19:59:34] <lpapp> cmr: so how is RAII working in rust
[19:59:38] <goffrie> lpapp: if a destructor fails, then the task fails. boom.
[19:59:55] <doomlord_> tasks dont share memory by default, and they're lightweight
[20:00:04] <doomlord_> you can spawn tasks when you wouldn't want to create threads
[20:00:28] <vladimir-lu> cmr: what do you mean by compiled version of the dependencies?
[20:01:01] <doomlord_> so its valid to create a tasks for something that might fail, then deal with it by message  passing... if it fails, its in its own heap, it doesn't affect the main program (unless you went out of your way to ask it to)

[20:01:45] <sigma> doomlord_: the erlang method of "let it fail and spawn a new one" is valid in rust
[20:01:49] <strcat> lpapp: there are no errors on close of a socket/file that you don't get from doing a flush first though

[20:02:07] <cmr> Oh, wait, nevermind.
[20:02:09] <cmr> Heh
[20:02:09] <strcat> and you can't really handle it on the close itself because whether or not an error happens, you already closed it

[20:02:50] <goffrie> vladimir-lu: from libfoo.so's metadata
[20:02:52] <cmr> vladimir-lu: right, those are important from the libfoo.so
[20:03:03] <cmr> vladimir-lu: "metadata" including all of those things are written to the object file
[20:03:07] <vladimir-lu> is that in the .so itself?
[20:03:10] <goffrie> yes
[20:03:11] <cmr> Yes
[20:03:13] <vladimir-lu> cool :)
[20:03:24] <SiegeLord> I wonder how that'll work for static libraries
[20:03:24] <lpapp> strcat: maybe in an ideal world, where problems do not exist, it would work.
[20:03:33] <SiegeLord> Can you put non-object data in .a's?
[20:03:36] <strcat> lpapp: what 'problems'?
[20:03:38] <vladimir-lu> is there a library to extract it?
[20:03:39] <lpapp> but back to the real back, with errors got in the dtor will break RAII.
[20:03:53] <cmr> vladimir-lu: librustc
[20:03:56] <lpapp> strcat: any problem on close.
[20:04:05] <lpapp> or deallocate.
[20:04:07] <strcat> lpapp: no problem can happen on close not caught by a flush first though
[20:04:13] <strcat> and no problem *can* happen in deallocation
[20:04:17] <lpapp> strcat: so?
[20:04:29] <strcat> so, what's a case where there's actually an error so handle?
[20:04:30] <lpapp> strcat: man socket writes that it can fail
[20:04:39] <lpapp> so it will fail at many times.
[20:04:45] <lpapp> fail many*
[20:04:45] <strcat> lpapp: closing doesn't do a write, flushing does - it happens that a close implies a flush, but you can flush earlier
[20:04:59] <lpapp> besides, there are other resources where deallocation, close, etc can cause issues, really.
[20:05:16] <doomlord_> in these cases tasks could be the answer 
[20:05:21] <lpapp> strcat: as I wrote before, we are not living in a perfect world.
[20:05:22] <goffrie> lpapp: absolutely, but how _can_ you handle it without just failing
[20:05:39] <lpapp> if we lived in a perfect world, we would not need thread programming helpers either.
[20:05:45] <lpapp> we simply do not live in Alice's world.
[20:05:49] <doomlord_> rust syntax is better at dealing with faliures .. matching option types ... 
[20:05:50] <lpapp> so errors are to be expected.
[20:05:53] <strcat> lpapp: don't know what you mean by thread programming helpers
[20:06:08] <lpapp> in which case, C++ is hard to deal with in a RAII manner if not impossible.

[20:06:34] <doomlord_> so rust has tasks, option types to deal with failiure more robustly
[20:06:55] <goffrie> lpapp: this feels like an issue that's not related to languages, but to libraries
[20:06:55] <cmr> And the condition system
[20:07:07] <strcat> lpapp: I'm not really sure how it's related
[20:07:08] <lpapp> goffrie: it is related to the language.
[20:07:11] <strcat> freeing memory can't fail
[20:07:14] <lpapp> goffrie: it is not a library thing.
[20:07:17] <sp3d> where's the condition system documented? I've heard of it several times but never read anything that really explains it
[20:07:22] <strcat> closing a flushed socket/file can't fail
[20:07:22] <lpapp> goffrie: language handles the stack unwinding.
[20:07:28] <lpapp> I mean the compilers.
[20:07:32] <cmr> sp3d: it isn't, really. just the source.
[20:07:42] <sp3d> which source is that, then? :P
[20:07:49] <doomlord_> so you put the task that can fail in its own "task"   the langauge support helps, with 'do' sugar 
[20:08:00] <cmr> sp3d: src/libstd/condition.rs
[20:08:01] <doomlord_> do spawn { somthing that can fail, now it has its own heap .... }
[20:08:06] <goffrie> lpapp: if you don't want to get killed by a destructor, make your library not kill you in its destructors.
[20:08:08] <lpapp> strcat: memory is /not/ the only resource.

[20:08:35] <strcat> lpapp: I don't know how you'd handle the error beyond failing in the destructor and catching that failure at a task boundary though
[20:08:42] <strcat> there's no way to get a return value from the destructor
[20:08:46] <doomlord_> what they've done with 'do' sugar is make lambdas as convinient to use as regular programming constructs
[20:09:02] <lpapp> goffrie: why it has nothing to do with the library, is because it is limited by the language.
[20:09:06] <doomlord_> so in essence you can build your own constructs to handle things that can fail, if you like :)
[20:09:10] <strcat> lpapp: rust specifies failure in a destructor as being valid, and it's completely possible to handle it
[20:09:13] <strcat> lpapp: but it's not implemented yet
[20:09:15] <lpapp> it is a library agnostic "rule" that exceptions should be avoided in the dtor.
[20:09:36] <strcat> but you can't really do much with a failure from a destructor since you'll lose the task
[20:09:41] <doomlord_> this sounds like a problem with the universe, not with any language :) "things can break"

[20:54:02] <thiez> but at some point we had some huuuuge functions because a number of #[inline(always)] functions were calling eachother
[20:54:24] <mark_edward> what are the downsides of that in most cases?
[20:54:37] <mark_edward> isn't less function calls == better performance?
[20:54:49] <cmr> mark_edward: no
[20:54:49] <thiez> there comes a point where having a few call+ret instructions is cheaper than flushing your cache all the time :p
[20:54:54] <cmr> yeah
[20:54:58] <cmr> cache pressure
[20:55:23] <thiez> every instruction that has to be fetched from memory is a transfer that couldn't be used for something useful like data
[20:55:33] <cmr> mark_edward: the only real advantage to inlining is that LLVM can do more optimizations based on the context

[20:58:56] <strcat> the primary benefit of inlining is the optimization you're able to do when the guts of the function are exposed directly
[20:59:17] <strcat> spilling registers and the actual call aren't that bad.

[21:03:21] <pcwalton> it works

And a new smaller one allocated: [[_]  [_] ]. Now there is a small fragment of free space between those two that can not be used for bigger memory allocations.
