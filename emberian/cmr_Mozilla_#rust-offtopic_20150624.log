[00:39:22] <Tobba> also lol @ reddit trying to figure out UDP vs TCP
[00:39:41] <Havvy> Tobba:  Link?
[00:39:51] <Tobba> http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/3atp7o/tcp_v_udp_for_games/
[00:39:54] <ChrisMorgan> Tobba: throw SCTP into the mix for added fun.
[00:40:09] <Tobba> nobody seems to have figured out you can implement something which behaves exactly like TCP ontop of UDP (and the only difference will be that some routers apparently choose to drop UDP packets first, which makes sense)
[00:40:12] <Havvy> I thought SCTP was TCP.
[00:40:13] <ChrisMorgan> And SFTP just to see if anyone’s actually paying attention.
[00:40:25] *** Quits: panicbit (mike@moz-vqobnf.dip0.t-ipconnect.de) (Quit: WeeChat 1.2)
[00:40:25] <ChrisMorgan> Havvy: nope.
[00:40:36] *** Joins: panicbit (mike@moz-vqobnf.dip0.t-ipconnect.de)
[00:41:03] <ChrisMorgan> Havvy: if we had SCTP instead of TCP in widespread usage, HTTP/2 would have been much simpler.
[00:41:43] <ChrisMorgan> Tobba: that’s where things like SCTP-on-UDP and QUIC come in.
[00:41:52] <Tobba> yep
[00:43:22] <aatch> To be honest, it's not even really a Fast vs. Slow thing. UDP will always be faster if you don't care about dropped packets or consistent ordering.
[00:44:39] <Tobba> even when sending files there can be advantages to UDP, if you drop a packet in TCP you have data which could have been written to disk getting bunched up in the TCP stack
[00:45:19] <Tobba> I'm imagining that could actually become quite nasty if trying to send files at gigabit speeds
[00:47:00] <aatch> Tobba, exactly. But using UDP directly can be harder and sometimes TCP is good enough. Being able to treat a socket more-or-less the same way as you treat file is nice.
[00:47:45] <aatch> Like most things, it's all about picking the right tool for the job.
[00:48:18] <Tobba> of course
[00:49:11] * Tobba wonders if TCP over UDP is a thing
[00:49:19] <panicbit> udptunnel
[00:49:29] <panicbit> https://code.google.com/p/udptunnel/
[00:49:32] <Tobba> neat
[00:51:19] <panicbit> I wish there were a notification server that allowed roaming in a secure way just like mosh does
[00:52:27] <Elaine> Tobba: there's a dns tunnel too, somewhere.
[00:52:39] <Elaine> extremely slow but very effective at punching through firewalls.
[00:52:59] <Tobba> there's an ICMP tunnel as well, which is also convenient for punching through firewalls
[00:53:00] <Elaine> that thread is indeed a shitshow.
[00:53:11] <panicbit> lol
[00:53:14] <aatch> My understanding of UDP though is that it's pretty much just IP + ports
[00:53:18] <panicbit> tcp over sms is patented
[00:53:23] <Tobba> what the fuck
[00:53:27] <Elaine> aatch: precisely.
[00:53:31] <panicbit> patents suck
[00:53:43] <aatch> So TCP over UDP seems a bit redundant.
[00:54:12] <Tobba> aatch: headers + length + checksum, if you stripped the port, length and checksum parts from the TCP header and slapped it in an UDP frame you'd have the exact same thing
[00:54:40] <Tobba> so you could also argue that TCP is redundant
[00:55:27] <aatch> Tobba, but TCP has a bunch of behavioural components as part of the protocol.
[00:56:13] <Tobba> I can't think of anything other than that NATs etc handle TCP specially
[00:56:25] <Tobba> but we could use a less shitty method of dealing with them anyways
[00:57:16] <aatch> Tobba, well end-points handle TCP differently to UDP.
[01:01:30] * Tobba would like to see IPv4 replaced with a simple src:dst:endpoint header, where src and dst are of arbitrary length and the endpoint number is like a port (it'd be a nightmare to decode in hardware though)

[01:16:39] <Tobba> Mutabah: hm? IPv6 just kinda stacks more stuff ontop
[01:17:08] <Tobba> with the design I mentioned you could even drop the ethernet header without complicating things
[01:18:02] <Elaine> I suspect Mutabah meant about nightmarish decoding.
[01:18:09] <Tobba> ah yeah
[01:19:03] <brandonson> what's so bad about ipv6 as far as hardware is concerned?
[01:19:45] <WindowsBunny> I wish my ISP would let me us ipv6 already
[01:20:06] <Tobba> variable length would allow interoperation of different address spaces, I mean you could do that with IPv6 by placing the IPv4 address space in IPv6, but there isn't a way to do that that's guaranteed to work
[01:20:50] <Tobba> to be easier to decode in HW, replace the variable-length addresses with IPv6 addresses I guess
[01:22:06] <Tobba> brandonson: annoying extension headers, and then theres mobile IPv6, which is an utter clusterfuck

[01:25:44] <Tobba> I'm kinda annoyed with how the IPv6 address space has been allocated so far
[01:26:44] <Tobba> mostly, did we really have to make 64 bits useless through the autoconfiguration madness
[01:27:07] <Tobba> and 6to4 addresses use a /48, for... whatever reason
[01:31:17] <brandonson> Tobba: to be fair, even with only 64 bits of useful info, that's a crazy big address space

[01:55:05] <Tobba> probably
[01:55:20] <Elaine> yes.
[01:55:28] <Tobba> the PS4 also has a crazy huge data bus due to the GDDR5 memory

[03:39:48] <bstrie> the RFC to put an associated constant on the Sized trait is so hilarious that I want to teach my friends rust just so that I can have more people acknowledge what a completely bizarre and hilarious idea it is

[03:40:54] <bstrie> Mutabah: it's both!
[03:42:02] <Quxxy> That's... yeah, that's so obvious... but since we're post 1.0 now... but then, assoc. consts aren't stable yet, are they?

[04:31:11] <c74d> I'm pretty sure I remember something like that, but it might have only applied to giving things away for free, or to goods rather than services, or just not to too-big-to-jail entities.
[04:31:53] <swgillespie> MS got in trouble for that for antitrust reasons, not really because they were giving stuff away in and of itself
[04:32:38] <bstrie> antitrust law is thorny, but yeah, microsoft gave away IE for free to force netscape to make their browser free, and the antitrust there was with the bundling, not with the freeness

[12:59:37] <ChrisMorgan> I have gone adding my own bits to it, too (the #script7435 element in that case).
[13:00:05] <Romster> that is awesome.
[13:00:07] <ChrisMorgan> I really should submit that “press f for fullscreen” upstream, if someone hasn’t implemented it since then.
[13:00:35] <Romster> no more publisher needed when there is svg
[13:01:56] <ChrisMorgan> I suspect that for more strictly technical presentations I’ll be heading away from pure SVG to HTML, however. I’ve been constructing some pretty nifty things for these sorts of purposes recently, like http://tty-player.chrismorgan.info/ in the last ten days.
[13:02:33] <ChrisMorgan> I’ll still feel the need to draw things in my slides, though. SVG will not disappear from my life completely!
[13:04:06] * ChrisMorgan switched tty-player to using the Shadow DOM today with great results in Chrome but some issues with the scoped styling in Firefox
[13:09:18] <ChrisMorgan> Firefox’s developer tools don’t treat Shadow DOM very well, showing the composed DOM but not the shadow or light DOMs or marking it as the composed DOM or clarifying the source of the scoped styles or anything like that (they haven’t committed to shipping it, and it has to be turned on as the dom.webcomponents.enabled preference, so it’s not so surprising that they haven’t put
[13:09:21] <ChrisMorgan> the trouble into making the developer tools handle it elegantly).

[13:14:16] <ChrisMorgan> Don’t worry. Seriously. We’ve already passed the point where you can expect to find readable source code; the existing model is strongly hampering us.
[13:14:36] <sunfish> there's an isomorphic text format, so view source will just translate the binary format into that
[13:15:50] <ChrisMorgan> Romster: the JavaScript of the web is with very few exceptions running on -O0, for no good reason.
[13:15:52] <Quxxy> Romster: Until someone starts distributing their JS runtime as a wasm blob, I don't think we'll be quite rid of JS :P
[13:16:20] * Quxxy dreams of a future where any language with a wasm blob at a well-known address can be used for scripting
[13:17:24] <ChrisMorgan> Quxxy: your Rust code will compile to a wasm blob. If you want to compile rustc to wasm, feel free. Just don’t ask normal people to download it, it’ll be massive.
[13:17:51] <Romster> ah

[13:18:04] <Quxxy> I wasn't even considering it, but I meant more along the lines of having runtimes at cachable URLs
[13:18:22] <Quxxy> So once your browser grabs the, say, es9.wasm blob, it doesn't have to grab it again
[13:18:37] <Quxxy> New version of JS?  Release a new blob and everyone's upgraded
[13:18:38] <ChrisMorgan> That’s the idea of CDNs.
[13:18:41] <Tiffany> it does have to make the http request and receive a 304 response though
[13:19:12] <Tiffany> and also load it into memory, and keep space around for it to be cached
[13:19:24] <Tiffany> it can't really be too large unless you have a special system for permanently caching files
[13:19:31] <Quxxy> Well, that *was* the idea :P
[13:20:00] <Quxxy> I *did* say "dream" and not "well-considered plan"
[13:20:00] <Tiffany> anyone who runs ccleaner regularly will get angry why some sites take 5 minutes to load the first time if they have to download a 30 megabyte runtime blob
[13:20:05] <Tiffany> okay
[13:20:10] <Tiffany> it would be nice
[13:20:17] <Tiffany> I'm thinking something along the line of chrome apps, but for runtime dependencies
[13:20:59] <Quxxy> sunfish: While you're here, is the #webassembly IRC channel actually used by anyone?  I've been idling in there a while and not so much as a peep :P
[13:21:02] <Tiffany> there's no doubt that people are going to do it though
[13:21:22] <Quxxy> Of *course* people will.  People will do *anything*, especially if it's a bad idea *and* funny

[13:22:36] <sunfish> Quxxy: it's kind of sporadic
[13:23:04] <sunfish> people have widely varying schedules and timezones, so github tends to be where most things go
[13:23:11] <Quxxy> sunfish: Fair enough
[13:25:01] <Tiffany> I suppose
[13:25:08] <Tiffany> how big is the fully loaded minified jquery blob?
[13:27:41] <ytain> which jquery?
[13:28:59] <Tiffany> it looks like the minified version 2 blob is 33.6 KB
[13:30:02] <Tiffany> oh, but that's only the core version?

[14:42:30] *** Quits: yjv (yjv@moz-ll38tk.pa.comcast.net) (Connection closed)
[14:47:13] <Tiffany> it depends on the source of energy of those racks of servers
[14:47:24] <Tiffany> if you're running them off wind, solar, hydro...
[14:48:04] <Tiffany> if you're running them off of a car engine hooked up to a generator, then you'd need however many servers are needed to match the wattage of a car
[14:48:13] <Tiffany> a 300hp engine is equivalent to 223kW
[14:48:50] <Tiffany> so you just account for the inefficiency of the generator and then get as many servers it takes to use up all that electricity
[14:51:19] <Tiffany> let's say each server is drawing 423W (random internet site says that's a mid-range server) and is 1U, on 22U racks; you would need 23 racks
[14:51:39] <Tiffany> that sounds weird
[14:51:43] <Tiffany> it seems like too many
[14:51:48] <Tiffany> are car engines really that powerful?
[14:53:19] <Romster> average car is 140 kilowatts i guess
[14:53:54] <Romster> but you don't drive it flat out all the time so on average depends on the driver and terrain and weight being towed
