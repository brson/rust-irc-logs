[00:00:54] <canhtak> hi
[00:01:18] <canhtak> bjz : i saw that you have made a binding for penal.
[00:01:53] <canhtak> Have you successfully play sounds in a different task than the task where you create and make the ALCcontext current?
[00:04:20] <Luqman> canhtak: that should work fine since afaik OpenAL doesn't care which thread you make the call from since it's gonna do stuff in it's own thread
[00:06:25] <canhtak> yes i know that
[00:06:44] <canhtak> but in a task each call to an al function give me an error...
[00:11:57] <Luqman> hmm, sorry i've no idea
[00:11:59] <canhtak> and alcGetCurrentContext return null

[00:30:33] <canhtak> the problem is that i work on the same code from this morning and it begin to be really awful. 
[00:31:06] <canhtak> but i've juste made a minimal test and it work… so the problem come from me.

[00:52:25] <canhtak> bjz: i don't currently use it (sorry), but i write an library on the top of OpenAL so i prefer to call directly OpenAL
[00:52:54] <canhtak> but at the beginning i use it and i have not found way in the binding to call default devices
[00:54:46] <bjz> I think that might be an extension. not sure. What would you normally do?
[00:55:10] <canhtak> or an other problem (i think) is that you put alcGetError as a method of Device, so if the device can't be created you cannot know why
[00:56:04] <bjz> ahhh
[00:56:05] <bjz> haha
[00:56:10] <canhtak> default device = alcOpenDevice(NULL)
[00:56:13] <canhtak> ?
[00:56:32] <bjz> ok, that's not too hard to add
[00:57:15] <bjz> Device::open_default ?
[00:57:37] <canhtak> no it's not, but i feel more free by calling directly openal (sorry)
[00:57:57] <canhtak> no it doesn't exist on the binding for the moment
[00:58:21] <bjz> yeah I know :)
[00:59:02] <bjz> but yeah, maybe I should do a more basic binding. I was sort of following the haskell bindings, trying to make something more type safe

[01:01:13] <canhtak> yes i understand, but it can be more complicated when you read OpenAL C doc and after you must search in the binding the functionality that you need.
[01:01:44] <bjz> yeah, that is an issue
[01:02:10] <bjz> thanks for your point of view

[01:40:26] <canhtak>   not necessarily their goals are not the same
[01:41:04] <Amaranth> RTTI means I can get a string containing the name of the type at runtime to use for identification

[01:42:31] <Amaranth> For some reason it is in the intrinsics code but https://github.com/mozilla/rust/blob/master/src/libstd/unstable/intrinsics.rs#L44 is what I'm talking about
[01:43:09] <Amaranth> Oh, right, I guess that does make sense
[01:43:48] <Amaranth> get_tydesc() is an intrinsic, at compile time if you call it the compiler will generate the TyDesc for the type you're trying to query

[06:07:08] <Ralith> mcpherrin: basically, I feel like GL3.2+ core is a pretty solid low-level API, and I'm curious why AMD is doing this whole thing
[06:07:41] <cmr> It apparently has benefits.
[06:07:45] <Ralith> only tech details I've seen so far have been some crap about "more draw calls" which is patently absurd
[06:07:55] <cmr> But I withold all judgement until there are specs and implementation to poke at.
[06:08:24] <Ralith> probably a good call
[06:08:56] <Ralith> I just don't see the need for a new API right now, unless they're just trying to offload the work of driver development to the community (which would imo be a good thing)
[06:09:02] <cmr> The only thing I have to judge it off of is that BF3 with Mantle recommends a $130 card, with probably-D3D, a ~$300 card.
[06:09:12] <cmr> BF4, sorry.
[06:09:24] <Ralith> hadn't heard of that; that's interesting, but probably contrived
[06:09:29] <cmr> Yeah
[06:11:25] <Ralith> in the unlikely event that it's not especially hardware-specific, it'd be pretty amusing if nvidia took their purported openness and turned around and pushed out their own impl in a few months
[06:13:50] <mcpherrin> Ralith: So my day job is writing drivers (not graphics), and to me, I don't like OpenGL all that much.  Feels like it's not really representative of how the hardware works, and has to implement *everything* so it's not as clean as it could be
[06:14:16] <mcpherrin> Having two or three different "opinionated" APIs would be better, I think.
[06:14:50] <Ralith> mcpherrin: I don't really care how representative it is of the hardware so long as it doesn't add a ton of overhead and lets me do what I want to.
[06:15:15] <Ralith> as far as realtime rasterized 3D goes anyway
[06:15:19] <mcpherrin> In particular the memory management stuff seems really off to me
[06:15:39] <cmr> To me, a strength of opengl is that I don't particularly have to care about that.
[06:15:47] <Ralith> I agree that having as direct access to the hardware as possible is good in principle for coming up with different ways to do things or different things to do entirely
[06:15:47] <cmr> But I can see that that isn't always desirable.
[06:16:07] <mcpherrin> That's why I think we need a standard low-level API so we can write cleaner high level ones :P
[06:16:16] <mcpherrin> With more seperation of concerns.
[06:16:18] <cmr> I anxiously await specs.
[06:16:27] <Ralith> I think 'standard' and 'low level' may not go well together
[06:16:56] <Ralith> but anything that makes drivers smaller/simpler/more reliable seems like a good thing
[06:17:40] <cmr> It'll be interesting to see where they drew the abstraction boundary.
[06:17:59] <Ralith> indeed
[06:18:31] <Ralith> (in particular, thinner drivers == easier to get good linux support, for example)
[06:19:05] <mcpherrin> Easier to audit for security, too
[06:19:11] <cmr> nvidia seems to be significantly improving wrt linux
[06:19:14] <mcpherrin> WebGL is terrifying :P
[06:19:22] <Ralith> has nvidia actually done much more than talk yet?
[06:19:27] <cmr> Apparently that "What can we do to make things better?" request on the lkml wasn't just talk.
[06:19:42] <cmr> well, no, but they weren't even doing that before.
[06:19:58] <Ralith> if they haven't done more than talk, why do you say it wasn't just talk?
[06:20:00] <Ralith> o.O
[06:20:08] <mcpherrin> well they did release some new specs
[06:20:16] <Ralith> iirc they were fairly trivial ones
[06:20:18] <mcpherrin> not useful ones mind you
[06:20:20] <cmr> I mean, they weren't just saying it to get good press, they seem to be following through.
[06:20:30] <Ralith> sounds like that remains to be seen
[06:20:31] <mcpherrin> but honestly, getting anything going is a massive first step
[06:21:01] <Ralith> could just be maneuvering wrt. valve
[06:21:10] <Amaranth> I suspect the major thing for Mantle is just giving you more control over buffer and state management
[06:21:11] <cmr> Supposedly they're going to work with Mesa to revamp and unify the linux gl abi
[06:21:20] <cmr> Ralith: That'd be my guess
[06:21:41] <Ralith> cmr: point being there might not actually be any substance to it if behind-closed-doors negotiations don't go their way.
[06:21:50] <cmr> yeah
[06:21:56] <cmr> that's true
[06:22:01] <cmr> politics and money, as usual
[06:22:05] <Ralith> indeed
[06:22:27] <Amaranth> NVIDIA's work with the nouveau guys so far has only been for things that make nouveau useful enough to bring up a display that lets you install their proprietary driver
[06:23:18] <Ralith> a nice gesture of good faith would be docs on the clock and fan controls so recent cards are actually usable
[06:23:22] <Amaranth> Show us specifications for reclocking and I'll think they're serious about support
[06:23:35] <Ralith> surely that can't involve much third party IP
[06:23:38] <Amaranth> Yeah with such documentation nouveau would even been competitive
[06:23:43] <Amaranth> s/been/be/
[06:23:54] <mcpherrin> Have you guys ever read NDA docs from hardware vendors?
[06:24:03] <mcpherrin> They are frequently shit.
[06:24:11] <Amaranth> Well, that is assuming their performance scales well with the clock boost which almost certainly won't happen at first
[06:24:18] <mcpherrin> They have things like "go ask tom@ to explain how this works"
[06:24:29] <mcpherrin> So it's not always a matter of releasing docs but of writing them
[06:24:36] <Amaranth> Of course, I understand that
[06:24:37] <Ralith> that seems plausible
[06:24:56] <Amaranth> But they've mentioned power management as something they aren't comfortable releasing and needs a lot of legal review
[06:25:45] <Amaranth> I understand that releasing documentation often means actually writing documentation and that legal will want to check it all
[06:25:55] <Amaranth> But the vibe I got was that legal would reject releasing it
[06:26:15] <mcpherrin> there's internal politics around that sort of thing too
[06:26:26] <Amaranth> Of course but why do I care about that?
[06:26:36] <mcpherrin> you don't, but the guys pushing to release it do
[06:26:55] <Ralith> well, if they want to put meat to their claims they'll have to deal
[06:27:21] <mcpherrin> so I mean, the vibe you get isn't a good way to predict what'll happen
[06:27:45] <mcpherrin> you'll piss off legal if you say something that makes it sound like they're going to rubberstamp it
[06:27:55] <mcpherrin> or whatever.
[06:28:38] <Amaranth> I bailed on NVIDIA hardware back in 2008 after they went over a year with drivers that didn't function properly when using an OpenGL compositing window manager and basically needing two codepaths to support NVIDIA and support everything else. I'm probably quite biased here.
[06:28:59] <mcpherrin> your mistake is trying to use X
[06:29:04] <mcpherrin> it's just such a clusterfuck of bad.
[06:29:04] <cmr> heh
[06:29:33] <Amaranth> It wasn't even that they hadn't fixed the bug, it was that I had talked to NVIDIA developers via IRC and email about it and at one point was told they just didn't care about this use case so hadn't looked at it
[06:29:44] <Ralith> I'm rather put out at them currently for their drivers bringing down the whole system when you start X with a Quadro K1000M
[06:30:13] <Amaranth> Of course Vista had just kicked their ass with the driver requirements for their compositor and you'd think they would see that such things would be standard on Linux desktops too
[06:31:08] <Amaranth> To this day you still need a separate code path to do efficient buffer swaps in the compositor on NVIDIA hardware, as far as I know
[06:32:02] <Amaranth> mcpherrin: If you aren't using X on Linux why would you care to even install the NVIDIA driver?
[06:32:50] <mcpherrin> Amaranth: I'd install the nvidia driver in windows or OSX :p
[06:33:06] <mcpherrin> Wayland is at least a step sorta in the right direction
[06:33:22] <Amaranth> Their dynamic clocking also seemed to just be checking argv[0] and choosing what clock speeds to use while that program is running
[06:33:29] <Amaranth> I think they've gotten a lot better there though
[06:34:08] *** Joins: pnkfelix (pnkfelix@moz-43495417.fbx.proxad.net)
[06:34:22] <Amaranth> And that's not as bad as AMD who actually put optimization hacks in their driver for compiz which then broke things when compiz started making use of more modern OpenGL features
[06:34:36] <Amaranth> The solution there was to modify argv[0], setup the GL context, then change it back
[06:34:43] <cmr> wat
[06:34:53] <cmr> I mean props to them for actually doing something about it
[06:34:55] <cmr> but wat
[06:34:59] <cmr> (AMD, not compiz)
[06:35:01] <Amaranth> Basically they all suck and we should use the open source drivers :P
[06:35:09] <Amaranth> This is why my laptops are Intel only
[06:35:10] * cmr uses the foss drivers exclusively
[06:35:40] <cmr> I use AMD cards, because I wanted hyperthreading more than I wanted IGP (low-end Xeon vs i7)
[06:35:55] <cmr> And working with mesa/piglit is rewarding
[06:36:02] <cmr> working on, rather
[06:36:17] <mcpherrin> What's the GL situation on intel/linux?
[06:36:20] <Amaranth> Oh yeah piglit is awesome
[06:36:27] <cmr> mcpherrin: within 90% of windows
[06:36:41] <cmr> we got the first ES3 impl
[06:36:46] <cmr> They do a lot of work on mesa
[06:36:55] <cmr> but... it doesn't really transfer over to the gallium drivers, not that much.
[06:36:57] <Amaranth> mcpherrin: Intel is the one pushing support for new GL versions in Mesa and depending on the benchmark they're basically identical to the Windows driver
[06:37:06] <cmr> (except piglit)
[06:37:32] <mcpherrin> What's piglet?
[06:37:39] <cmr> It's the automated GL testsuite that mesa uses.
[06:37:49] <cmr> Regression tests, mostly, but it checks strict conformance to the specs.
[06:37:59] <cmr> It's quite wonderful. Mesa moves slower, but it's so much more high quality.
[06:38:04] <Amaranth> Linaro wants to use it for the proprietary ARM drivers too
[06:38:06] <mcpherrin> I'm not sure where Intel/Windows is either
[06:38:15] <Amaranth> Or rather they are using it but last I checked it was a hacked up proof of concept
[06:38:16] <mcpherrin> Like, I don't know what GL versions the new haswell stuff supports
[06:38:22] <cmr> 4.2 I think?
[06:38:26] <Amaranth> mcpherrin: On Windows? 4.3 iirc
[06:38:29] <cmr> 4.0
[06:38:35] <mcpherrin> 4-something is good!
[06:38:43] <mcpherrin> As long as it's not stuck in 2-land or something
[06:38:51] <cmr> http://www.anandtech.com/Gallery/Album/2291#18 claims 4.0
[06:38:53] <Amaranth> On Linux they're probably going to land geometry shader support before the end of the year
[06:38:55] <mcpherrin> I just got rid of a laptop that only did GL1.4 :(
[06:39:04] <cmr> Yeah, my netbook only does 1.shit
[06:39:17] <mcpherrin> yeah
[06:39:28] <mcpherrin> Amaranth: nice!
[06:39:43] <cmr> I mean, I love it, I use it to ssh into my desktop on the go, and it runs spacechem well, but can barely play youtube videos without stutter
[06:39:49] <cmr> Probably flash's fault more than the gpu
[06:40:05] <mcpherrin> your problem is trying to use flash :-P
[06:40:29] <Amaranth> And they've got large chunks of 4.x stuff already but the big one is tessellation which apparently there isn't a lot of interest in writing or using
[06:40:38] <Luqman> cmr: really, you should use shumway
[06:40:42] <cmr> Luqman: I do, now!
[06:40:46] <cmr> Well, not on the netbook
[06:40:50] <Luqman> lol really?
[06:40:53] <cmr> yup
[06:41:05] <cmr> I deployed it to all the lab builds here
[06:41:10] <Luqman> how well does it work?
[06:41:11] <Amaranth> http://cgit.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/tree/docs/GL3.txt
[06:41:12] <cmr> (open source labs)
[06:41:19] <cmr> Luqman: when it works, it works well
[06:41:22] <cmr> When it doesn't, it doesn't.
[06:41:31] <cmr> Probably just feature completeness really, haven't had any stability problems.
[06:41:34] <cmr> The fallback is solid.
[06:41:46] <mcpherrin> Luqman: I tried to use shumway for a day or two 
[06:41:57] <mcpherrin> though I mostly spent said day clicking the fallback button
[06:43:43] <cmr> Amaranth: I don't really know how up to date that document is.
[06:43:51] <Amaranth> cmr: Recently updated
[06:43:55] <cmr> The mesa devs I've talked to don't actually know the status of some of those features.
[06:44:02] <cmr> (like glsl 1.50)
[06:45:28] <Amaranth> http://www.x.org/wiki/Events/XDC2013/XDC2013IanRomanickMesaStateOfTheProject/Mesa-State-of-the-Project.pdf
[06:45:40] <cmr> Ohhh
[06:45:48] <cmr> I should have paid attention to the recent confs
[06:47:07] <cmr> geometry shaders by nov would be fantastic
[06:47:45] <cmr> I don't care about them, but that 3.2core will be deliciously sweet
[06:48:22] <Amaranth> afaik they're still planning on doing core only
[06:48:25] <Amaranth> Like OS X
[06:48:30] <Amaranth> That'll kind of suck
[06:48:38] <cmr> I don't really blame them
[07:02:50] <cmr> Ralith: http://www.x.org/wiki/Events/XDC2013/XDC2013AndyRitgerVendorNeutralOpenGL/linux-opengl-abi-presentation.pdf is what I was thinking of re: abi
