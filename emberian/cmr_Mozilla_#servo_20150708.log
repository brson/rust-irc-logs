[01:04:26] <pcwalton> yeah, it's likely that there's low-hanging fruit before we hit the long tail
[01:05:20] <larsberg> and I think we have to get through those before we can open any E-Easy CSS reftest bugs, because the things that are broken require fixes to tables, whitespace handling, etc.

[02:32:44] <mt2d2> it looks like the generated rust code does use the right default value if argc is only 1, but tries to covert it somehow, and returns JSFalse on error. Could this be how undefined is getting turned into 0?
[02:34:57] <mwu> returning JSFalse means that an exception was thrown
[02:35:26] <mwu> oh, misread
[02:35:37] <mwu> the conversion could be misconverting undefined to 0

[03:05:25] <mt2d2> okay, so following script/dom/bindings/conversion.rs through to jsapi, it looks like there is a helper function to convert from a HandleValue to a u32 in a Result
[03:06:01] <mt2d2> https://github.com/servo/rust-mozjs/blob/master/src/rust.rs#L653 — I’m wondering, is this missing a case to handle the undefined value? but then I’m left wondering why the default conv_fn (which seems to just call into spidermonkey directly) doesn’t get that case correct

[03:10:16] <mt2d2> right so, I’m thinking it points back to the generated binding. There’s a match on FromJSValConvertible::from_jsval, and on error it assigns that u32 to JSFalse, which seems like it could be a 0 
[03:10:30] <mt2d2> but I thought that was attached an exception of some kind
[03:11:30] <mwu> we shouldn't be hitting the JSFalse path
[03:12:09] <mwu> which suggests the SM conversion is the one returning 0
[03:12:34] <mt2d2> hmm, a debugger would probably pick this out 
[03:12:38] <mwu> and I think it is
[03:12:51] <mwu> judging from the comments in the conversion code saying that NaNs are converted to zero
[03:13:18] <mt2d2> so whose resposiblity is it to convert 0 to the default value?
[03:13:27] <mt2d2> if spidermonkey is returning 0
[03:13:36] <mwu> you don't
[03:13:50] <mwu> you have to catch the undefined value before it goes to spidermonkey
[03:14:05] <mt2d2> ah right ok :) 
[03:14:11] <mt2d2> so is that place in the generated bindings? 
[03:14:15] <mt2d2> (do they have a name?)
[03:14:40] <mwu> either the bindings or the binding utils/conversions
[03:14:50] <mwu> I don't remember that part too well

[19:59:22] <laleh> what application you are using?
[19:59:36] <cimes> oh, powermetrics is an Apple tool
[19:59:43] <laleh> yeah
[20:00:11] <cimes> ok - and you were capturing the energy for entire execution?
[20:00:20] <laleh> yes
[20:00:46] <cimes> ok.  I'm running in linux, so that particular tool won't help me
[20:00:59] <cimes> Currently I'm reading energy from the MSR on the intel chip in my laptop

[20:04:07] <cimes> here's a little debug output if you're interested - http://pastebin.com/dz2CsAHg
[20:04:46] <cimes> some things run so fast I can't get energy at a fine-grained enough scale, so it comes out as 0
[20:04:54] <laleh> cimes: haha it is cool
[20:05:14] <cimes> additionally, some energy is double counted since stuff runs in parallel, but so it goes
[20:05:28] <laleh> which website is this?
[20:05:33] <dlight> cimes, so, I picked up the conversation in the middle, is this measuring energy spent on processing? how do you do that?
[20:05:35] <cimes> just loaded google.com
[20:05:38] <laleh> oh I see
[20:05:50] <dlight> also this is a lower bound right? there's HDD and other stuff that draws power
[20:05:58] <cimes> dlight, I just read from the energy monitor before the callback functoin executes then again after it's finished
[20:06:17] <cimes> it's only capturing what the MSR measures - so on-chip stuff

[23:52:23] <pcwalton> i.e. it doesn't let you serialize it, it only lets you pretend to serialize it
[23:52:59] <nrc> oh yeah, the faux-polymorphic Deref - it deeply offends me

[23:54:15] <pcwalton> .0 is at least short
[23:54:35] <jack> nrc: Can you explain more why it offends you?
[23:54:44] <nrc> deref'ing a length 1 tuple struct to the contents is OK by me
[23:55:07] <nrc> it's using Deref in general as a poor mans polymorphism which I don't like
[23:55:08] <pcwalton> oh, OK
[23:55:13] <pcwalton> I can switch it to use that
[23:55:25] <jack> pcwalton: I'd prefer switching if nrc is fine with it.
[23:55:31] <pcwalton> ok, I'll make that change
[23:55:34] <jack> So it's some other use than 1-tuple structs?

[23:57:36] <nrc> jack: it's implicit (and therefore surprising to readers of the code), it only works on method calls/field access - i.e., it has no type polymorphism, it is limited in use (you must have the target as a field), and it doesn't have the expected behaviour with generalisation
[23:57:53] <mwu> I bet we can emulate parts of dom inheritance using stacks of derefs
