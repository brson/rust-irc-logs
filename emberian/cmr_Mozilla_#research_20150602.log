[20:36:22] <pnkfelix> does anyone happen to know offhand, if I were to take a mac and install linux on it, could I then run mac OS X in a vmware image on top of linux?

[21:26:17] <nrc> pnkfelix: my experience of native Linux on a Mac was not great
[21:26:32] <nrc> it worked OK - relatively stable, but dodgy graphics and power options
[21:26:47] <nrc> no external monitor, no sleep/suspend, no hibernate
[21:26:59] <nrc> which was kind of a show stopper for me
[21:30:02] <pnkfelix> nrc: whch distribution were you using, out of curiousity?
[21:30:12] <nrc> Ubuntu
[21:30:24] <nrc> that and arch seems to be the common options for doing this
[21:54:14] <pnkfelix> nrc: ok.  i spent much of the weekend getting arch going on a couple of "old" mac laptops
[21:54:39] <pnkfelix> nrc: but I definitely am a little worried about the display and power setup not being quite right
[21:55:15] <nrc> I have a 2014 retina mac book pro. I found one or two reports of people getting the power and display working properly, but I could not reproduce
[21:55:21] <nrc> and I tried *a lot*
[21:55:40] <nrc> however, I'm no expert at these things, so I was really just following different sets of instructions
[21:55:49] <nrc> its possible some minor tweak would have fixed things
[21:56:24] <pnkfelix> nrc: yeah I was deliberately focusing on older hardware in the hopes that the kinks had been worked out
[21:56:29] <nrc> there's only so many times you can reinstall the OS befire you give up though....

[21:56:50] <edunham> aturon: okay, sounds good
[21:57:04] <pnkfelix> nrc: and then after I finally got it going on an old MacBook Air, I discovered that its processor was too old to run `rr`
[21:57:13] <edunham> oh, yeah, it's meeting time
[21:57:19] <nrc> pnkfelix: on the upside, I was impressed by the general stability and performance of Linux on Mac

[22:44:48] <nrc> mbrubeck: I don't want to nag, but are you writing minutes for this week's moco meeting? Wondering if I should watch the recording
[22:45:45] <mbrubeck> nrc: I missed the meeting live, but a group of people took minutes for most of it. I'm watching the video and filling in gaps, will send out the notes tomorrow probably.
[22:45:58] <nrc> mbrubeck: awesome, thank you!
[22:46:10] <nrc> mbrubeck: and thanks for doing the minutes in general, really appreciate it!
[22:46:17] <mbrubeck> You're welcome!
