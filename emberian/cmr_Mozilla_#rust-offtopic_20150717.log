[00:47:37] <npm> question about sweet tea
[00:47:41] <npm> I felt you would know
[00:48:43] <npm> do you know if you can get any good sweet tea in VA?
[00:49:04] <Astraea> Never been there, but probably
[00:49:55] <npm> we're on the east coast (from the west), and we're going fairly south
[00:50:01] <npm> and I really wanted to try it
[00:50:13] <npm> thanks ☺
[00:53:52] <Lurkin2> npm sweet tea is like lipton iced tea
[00:54:10] <Lurkin2> With about another half a cup of sugar per serving involved.
[00:54:15] <Lurkin2> And often some lemon slices.
[00:54:36] <Lurkin2> Don't turn it down if you find some homemade but don't get diabetes over it 
[00:55:08] <Lurkin2> GA is where I had some though.
[00:55:13] <Lurkin2> And heard it called "sweet tea"
[00:55:22] <swgillespie> it ain't sweet tea if there's not too much sugar in it
[00:55:23] <swgillespie> :P
[00:56:28] <Lurkin2> :)
[00:56:52] <npm> 😁
[00:56:56] <swgillespie> i'm from GA and i was responsible for making sweet tea at my first job
[00:57:08] <swgillespie> it's a scary amount of sugar
[00:57:18] <swgillespie> and if you don't put tons and tons in people complain

[03:22:37] <Astraea> Also I think our proper demonym is rustaceans :p
[03:43:59] <dpc> What could be the reason that my rust projects are not built daily on travis-ci anymore/
[03:49:08] <Peach> Can we get rid of build systems in the modern day now?
[03:49:19] <Peach> I really wish I could just see any github project,
[03:49:23] <Peach> download code,
[03:49:36] <Peach> double click on the universal project file
[03:49:41] <Peach> and have it compile

[03:54:02] <Peach> uhhhh
[03:54:08] <Peach> I'm being serious aatch 
[03:54:14] <Peach> I just mean something like Cmake,
[03:54:25] <Peach> but installed by default and everyone can easily run stuff
[03:55:02] <Peach> I *dislike* how I sometimes have to update Cmake before I *generate* the stuff to compile code
[03:55:22] <aatch> Peach, yeah, and that requires a lot more uniformity in the environments people use.
[03:55:48] <Peach> Basically, I'm talking about C++ really, there's 0 uniformity across libraries and code paths :'(
[03:56:27] <Peach> Has Rust or any other language made compiling other's code hassle free and you don't have to manually install other libraries etc.?
[03:57:26] <aatch> Peach, well cargo does a good job inside the Rust ecosystem.
[03:58:08] <aatch> Peach, but there will be build systems as long as there are difference between platforms.
[03:58:34] <aatch> Even something as small as an instruction being available.
[04:00:57] <Peach> Well what I really mean is how automatic it is. For example if I wanted to show a friend who never programmed before a project (often a graphical opengl experiment, game engine etc.) that he had to compile himself.... existing projects never make such things straightforward
[04:01:58] <aatch> Peach, I'd argue they do make it straightforward normally. Most projects just need to do `./configure && make` and just work.
[04:02:22] <Peach> it gets complicated when something uses external libraries though
[04:02:30] <Peach> super complicated :'(
[04:02:51] <aatch> Peach, well what are projects supposed to do about that?
[04:03:07] <aatch> Peach, never use external libraries? Always bundle them?
[04:04:04] <blueridanus> I think Rust manages this very well. Cargo is pretty damn good. On C++, it's more painful for me, personally
[04:04:30] <Peach> Naw aatch - you're answering from the opposite perspective
[04:04:39] <Peach> the issue is "building can be complicated"
[04:05:04] <Peach> there's nothing wrong with the concept of using external libraries
[04:05:09] <aatch> Peach, no, from the sounds of it, "dependency resolution can be compilated" is the issue.
[04:05:41] <Peach> any ideas how one would solve this problem in a theoretical new language ecosystem?
[04:06:41] <aatch> Peach, the same way the other new languages have? With tooling for it. Cargo's main use is that it make it easy to download and build dependencies.
[04:07:23] <aatch> If I want to build a Rust project, most of the time I can just do `cargo build` and have it all work.
[04:07:26] <blueridanus> ^, why is Cargo not good enough?
[04:09:12] <blueridanus> You could always make a .sh file for your friend too.
[04:10:01] <aatch> The thing is, it's generally assumed that people building from source are either developers or otherwise familiar with the process.
[04:11:24] <blueridanus> Indeed. I can see people that are just beginning not being too familiar with it, though.
[04:12:18] <blueridanus> It took some time before I figured out what all of the git/version control terminology means, for example
[04:13:10] <Layl> aatch, I am entirely uninformed about the conversation but...
[04:13:19] <Layl> just because someone building from source is capable of making it work
[04:13:23] <Layl> doesn't mean it should be hard
[04:13:27] *** Joins: freefall (ff@moz-388gu4.ip-37-187-129.eu)
[04:13:47] <Layl> because generally when you suddenly need to build something from source, it's for a purpose
[04:14:00] <Layl> you're not thinking "hey I'm gonna build X from source that should be fun"
[04:14:12] <Layl> rather it's "I want to do Y which means I need to build X from source"
[04:14:13] <aatch> Layl, I didn't say that though. It's more that building-from-source is not something optimised for non-technical users.
[04:14:28] <Layl> which often with C++ results in "god damn it why can't I just build X from source why does it give 500 compile errors"
[04:15:07] <Layl> generally I have the opinion that, if your build process is not "cargo build", you're going to lose contributors to your project
[04:15:14] <aatch> I think that building from source should, at most, be a `./configure && make`
[04:15:24] <Layl> people who would have otherwise contributed if the build process wasn't hard
[04:15:42] <Layl> unfortunately that often isn't the case in C++, aatch 
[04:15:53] <Layl> even if make is used
[04:15:58] <blueridanus> C++ is hell in that aspect.
[04:16:32] <Layl> I recall a while back when I tried to build CEGUI from source, the first step was "make these 50 decisions on what libraries you want to use"
[04:16:34] <blueridanus> The problems begin with the language itself: include files, function prototypes, etc
[04:16:52] <blueridanus> Then there's the ecosystem...
[04:16:53] <aatch> The main issue I've had with C++ is how many projects don't compile with the version of the compiler I have.
[04:17:09] <Layl> that's the advantage of having cargo, a common central standard
[04:17:18] <Layl> that's as automated as possible
[04:17:29] <Layl> there's no way to have weird build configurations because cargo aint havin none of that
[04:17:38] <blueridanus> When I was beginning programming, I fell in love with Javascript.
[04:17:50] <blueridanus> There's no cost to just sticking a library 
[04:17:58] <blueridanus> That encourages experimentation.
[04:18:00] <Layl> same with post-NuGet C#
[04:18:17] <Layl> and rust is going the same way
[04:18:27] <Layl> setting up a library to use with rust takes 5 seconds
[04:19:26] <Layl> aatch, ever had to build Source engine from source?
[04:19:30] <Layl> I would not recommend it
[04:19:48] <aatch> Layl, nope, but having seen some of the code in it, I can imagine that the build system can be difficult.
[04:20:01] <Layl> there's like 20 projects
[04:20:06] <Layl> with many native dependencies
[04:20:20] <Layl> including microsoft's (deprecated old) voice SDK and a protobuf
[04:21:02] <Layl> as well, it depends on very specific microsoft compiler versions
[04:21:38] <Layl> iirc it will just flat out not work if you don't have some vague MS-specific header that only sometimes gets sent along
[04:22:10] <Layl> then there's valve's own project generator
[04:22:21] <Layl> which is their 'solution' to not having to use cmake
[04:22:36] <Layl> which just flat out crashes for some people with no error

[09:10:51] <aji> pluto truthers?
[09:10:58] <niconii> like even if they did fake it
[09:11:11] <niconii> like... would that even change anything
[09:11:53] <Elaine> more funding?
[09:12:04] <Elaine> hell of a 20-year publicity stunt though
[09:13:28] <niconii> and they did it to get more funding from who, the government? what kind of half-assed conspiracy theory includes nasa but not the rest of the government anyway
[09:13:41] <Elaine> yeah
[09:14:20] <niconii> go big or go home
[09:14:21] <blueridanus> You know what's scary?
[09:14:26] <blueridanus> The like/dislike ratio on the video.
[09:14:35] <niconii> clearly, they faked the photos of pluto because it's actually a *REALLY REALLY BIG* reptilian

[12:24:21] <Sho> that seems to me to be better than silently ignoring a malformatted config file
[12:24:48] <Sho> especially considering it mostly runs config-less by default these days, so anything actually in the config probably matters to you
[12:24:59] <XMPPwocky> the thing is, when X crashes, you now have no desktop at all
[12:25:19] <Sho> well but if you can't fix it on the cli why did you edit xorg.conf

[12:26:03] <XMPPwocky> it's not a matter of not being able to, it's a matter of it being pretty obnoxious

[12:28:40] <XMPPwocky> hm,  good to know

[16:18:45] <blueridanus> You can use node-webkit or Electron.
[16:19:10] <Peach> also I'm not a web developer, I do more statically compiled stuff
[16:19:27] <Peach> like I use OpenGL and whatnot
[16:19:36] <blueridanus> That sounds cool, do you have a repository or something like that?
[16:20:22] <Peach> Not yet, I'm funny because I'm waiting until my projects are close to as perfect as possible before I show off my code
[16:20:39] <Peach> But right now I'm in the exciting stage of making a dream UI design language
[16:21:05] <blueridanus> But then people that are interested like me can't take a look or even help your project :(
[16:21:48] <Peach> I'm sorry blueridanus, it's just not ready but it soon will be
[16:22:08] <Peach> Right now the only thing I have is a fancy OpenGL text editor that supports unicode and code completion
[16:22:22] <Peach> I'm working on the other fancy stuff right now
[16:22:42] <Peach> blueridanus: do you have any suggestions on what your ideal UI and UI programming language would look like?
[16:23:07] <Peach> Something high level and easy to use and minimalist and is super easy to use and reason about
[16:23:25] <blueridanus> HTML and CSS get pretty close.
[16:23:33] <blueridanus> I find them sometimes too limited, though
[16:24:10] <blueridanus> But yeah, I may have some ideas. I have wasted a lot of time thinking about doing an UI library.
[16:24:37] <blueridanus> How are you doing things right now, roughly?
[16:26:47] <Peach> Ok - so the system lets you define 2D rectangles (which you can scale/rotate/move dynamically) - and they act as the GUI hitboxes and they call a script when clicked (and they also support mouse over scripts)
[16:27:06] <Peach> and then the graphics of the UI is a separate thing so the system stays flexible
[16:27:41] <Peach> And now I'm making presets that take the hitboxes and the rendering and let you make a high level window system that's resizable and has easy toolbar creation
[16:29:23] <blueridanus> Do you have a nice system for positioning stuff?

[16:30:27] <Peach> Yes, you mean like drag and drop to place hitboxes?
[16:30:40] <dfockler> positioning is one of the harder parts of UI
[16:30:43] <blueridanus> Hmm, no, I mean, like, positioning elements.
[16:30:52] <Elaine> Layout.
[16:30:54] <Peach> AH
[16:30:55] <Elaine> is what it's called ;P
[16:30:56] <dfockler> at least in the code
[16:31:06] <Peach> Yes, toolbar layout
[16:31:13] <Peach> and resizable windows
[16:31:19] <blueridanus> Layout, indeed, but especifically, things to make poisitioning easier :p
[16:31:30] <blueridanus> Like CSS's viewport units
[16:31:33] <blueridanus> % units
[16:33:04] <blueridanus> positioning*
[16:33:42] <blueridanus> If you are not familiar with CSS, I suggest you take a look. Flexbox, for example, is an extremely useful way to do layout

[17:25:25] <Elaine> Those tests are shit
[17:25:54] <eddyb> are they being annoying shits, or just lame?
[17:26:07] <Elaine> both, depends on the precise test.
[17:26:12] <Elaine> and sometimes they're outright wrong.
[17:26:22] <eddyb> just like school!
[17:26:36] <Elaine> I had to send a few corrections about the C test, not sure if they ever got fixed, never got an email back.
[17:26:42] <Elaine> similarly the Linux one
[17:27:23] <Peach> Ok, I'm mad at Apple, their recent UI redesigns (iOS7+ and OS X Yosemite)  aren't as pretty as they should be
[17:27:34] <Peach> Google actually does better in UI pretty:  https://www.google.com/design/spec/animation/meaningful-transitions.html
[17:27:52] <zofrex> google talks a big game but doesn't put it into practice
[17:28:26] <Elaine> ^
[17:28:30] <Peach> WELL AT LEAST THEIR MOCKUPS ARE PRETTY
[17:28:34] <Peach> :P
[17:28:51] <Astraea> what's wrong with apple's stuff?
[17:29:05] <zofrex> use the wifi screen on ios and then get back to me
[17:29:13] <Peach> The color choice and too much removal of helpful shadows Astraea 
[17:29:21] <zofrex> it's like "we would mock Blackberry for this" levels of awful
[17:29:23] <Peach> The recent flat UI
[17:29:35] <Peach> The flat UI apple is what I'm talking about Astraea 
[17:29:43] <Peach> They could have done better
[17:29:43] <Astraea> I enjoy the flat UI
[17:29:53] <Astraea> and I just watched those transitions that you linked
[17:29:53] <Peach> They could have done better
[17:29:56] <Peach> Oh?
[17:29:57] <Astraea> and they've very gaudy imo
[17:30:01] <Peach> lol
[17:30:14] <zofrex> I don't get why people fixate on things like the flat ui
[17:30:20] <zofrex> visual choices like that are very subjective
[17:30:23] <Astraea> then again their material design stuff has been largely hit or miss
[17:30:25] <zofrex> when there are objectively awful things in iOS
[17:30:45] <Astraea> they're going for an origami/paper feel in a lot of places, but then you have those huge expanding circle transitions
[17:30:48] <Astraea> even clicking things does that
[17:30:53] <Elaine> like the fact that their keyboard loses shift mode when you switch to a different keyboard (numeric) :|
[17:30:58] <zofrex> I dunno who came up with the swipe, tap x, collapse thing that's used for notifications and alarms but it looks *wrong* and it's painful to use
[17:31:08] <Peach> Ok so here's what I'm REALLY talking about Astraea: http://wpuploads.appadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/iOS-7-Lock-Screen-576x1024.png
[17:31:17] <zofrex> editing more than one alarm at once is an unnecesarily unenjoyable experience. so many taps!
[17:31:27] <Peach> That text is too thin and if you have a light background *you can't read the text*
[17:31:28] <dfockler> ugh everything trending on github, is little android animations 
[17:31:28] <Astraea> might be personal preference, Peach 
[17:31:33] <Astraea> I enjoy the lock screen a lot
[17:31:40] <Peach> No no, I'm talking about being able to read the text
[17:31:42] <Astraea> it's amazingly simple and conveys all information
[17:32:09] <Astraea> hmm
[17:32:11] <Astraea> well
[17:32:16] <Astraea> I love my lock screen anyway
[17:32:35] <eddyb> https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Tracking-Antenna_~01d33bde86c4350032
[17:32:44] <eddyb> > are you located in Australia?
[17:32:53] <Peach> that's an entire unobjective thing about how they could have put a very faint shadow on text to make it legible on any background
[17:33:06] <Peach> If you say put a background with varying brightness in the image
[17:33:14] <Peach> I'm pretty sure it becomes illegible
[17:33:16] <Astraea> the "> slide to unlock" is difficult to read
[17:33:20] <Astraea> though I think it shouldn't even be there
[17:33:41] <blueridanus> It could change color.
[17:33:50] <blueridanus> Given a sufficiently dark background, be white
[17:33:54] <Astraea> I especially like when you swipe left
[17:33:57] <Astraea> and the background blurs
[17:33:57] <blueridanus> On a very light background, be dark
[17:34:01] <Astraea> and the content is very, very obvious
[17:34:03] <Peach> Yeah that would be smart blueridanus 
[17:34:20] <Astraea> two seconds, let me switch backgrounds on my phone
[17:34:31] <Peach> but it would have to support checkboard
[17:34:37] <eddyb> mmm https://www.upwork.com/jobs/ARM-Cortex-embedded-system-design-for-IOT_~0117a5fd963e1d726a
[17:34:39] <Peach> Astraea: how does it handle a checkboard pattern?
[17:34:40] <Elaine> But then you need the text to be different colors in different places, which is awfully slow to implement.
[17:34:47] <Elaine> Might as well just use the drop shadow.
[17:34:51] <Peach> ^
[17:35:04] <Peach> Yeah I wish apple would have done either
[17:35:06] <Elaine> (need to split the curves based on background color)
[17:35:06] <eddyb> I just hope I can do contracting work without dealing with shitty PHP fodder
[17:35:15] <Astraea> it does change the text color
[17:35:16] <blueridanus> Elaine: Oh, I wasn't thinking about it being different colors in different places. That would look weird and ugly.

[17:36:15] <eddyb> this is really cool
[17:36:17] <zofrex> that's one problem Google *has* solved
[17:36:26] <Peach> Cause yeah backgrounds with very dark and very light parts, I don't think apple's visual style handles it
[17:36:40] <Astraea> Peach: unreadable
[17:36:40] <Peach> Style is fine, but it needs to be legible
[17:36:47] <blueridanus> Peach: Maybe with some blend modes?
[17:36:50] <Peach> Oh yeah see that's what I meant Astraea 
[17:36:51] <Astraea> looks like it takes the average light/darkness
[17:36:55] <eddyb> wait
[17:37:04] <Astraea> and adjusts the font color as a whole in accordance with that
[17:37:11] <zofrex> Google released a library for android that analyses images and gives you a pallette of colours that goes with it / contrasts with it
[17:37:12] <Peach> Apple could do better
[17:37:13] <zofrex> it's very nice
[17:37:24] <eddyb> doesn't NaCl do what they want? (but maybe a different curve)
[17:37:29] <niconii> Astraea: average light/darkness? so... what if you give it gray?
[17:37:50] <Elaine> eddyb: I'm not even certain their size requirements are meetable.
[17:37:55] <Peach> They could use a shader that inverts the color of the background
[17:37:55] <Astraea> niconii: okay, maybe not exactly that
[17:38:02] <blueridanus> niconii: Are you just rewording the classic problem of "what you round 0.5 to?"
[17:38:05] <Astraea> I just did a grayish background and it's black

[17:38:21] <Astraea> I need to do an android app soon
[17:38:23] <zofrex> http://www.willowtreeapps.com/blog/palette-the-new-api-for-android/
[17:38:33] <Astraea> and I'm not even that familiar with the UI idioms of android... -_-
[17:38:40] <eddyb> it's turing complete so it should be possible, unless you have high-entropy data that exceeds that limit
[17:38:52] <blueridanus> niconii: I guess in a gray, either should look nice.
[17:38:55] <zofrex> Astraea: I am, feel free to poke me for help
[17:38:57] <Elaine> No, that doesn't mean it should be possible.
[17:38:57] <blueridanus> gray background*
[17:39:02] <zofrex> I was on the Android team here for 18 months
[17:39:04] <niconii> blueridanus: no, it's just that if you take the average brightness of solid 0.5 gray, and invert it, it'd be the same shade of gray
[17:39:11] <Elaine> There are complexity results about minimum size of code to implement a function...
[17:39:24] <Astraea> zofrex: thanks, I might hit you up a bit later
[17:39:26] <blueridanus> niconii: That's not how you choose the font color, though.
[17:39:29] <Astraea> it's a relatively simple application
[17:39:30] <zofrex> :)
[17:39:59] <Astraea> blueridanus: he was responding to me, I was wrong
[17:40:06] <niconii> (she)
[17:40:11] <eddyb> Elaine: I can't help but think of the demo scene which always seems to find the craziest ways to pack random pieces of functionality is limited space
[17:40:12] <Astraea> ugh
[17:40:13] <Astraea> sorry =(
[17:40:22] <Astraea> yes, she
[17:40:26] <Peach> So yeah, for my UI design, I'm going with minimalism BUT still have things readable
[17:40:28] <Elaine> eddyb: yeah but visual effects have a lot of wiggle room.
[17:40:28] <blueridanus> niconii: You'd pick the luminance component of the color, and choose whether black or white looks better.
[17:40:33] <eddyb> Elaine: I'm not 100% it's possible, but I expect it to be
[17:40:47] <eddyb> 100% certain
[17:41:12] <blueridanus> Here's what I'm talking about, btw:
[17:41:12] <blueridanus> http://harthur.github.io/brain/
[17:41:14] <niconii> blueridanus: not saying it's a *good* way of doing it, was just going off of Astraea
[17:41:14] <eddyb> I could try it as a challenge
[17:41:30] <blueridanus> niconii: Oh, alright.
[17:41:40] <Astraea> the funny thing is we've had this conversation before, niconii. I typed before my brain could stop me, lol
[17:42:15] <Peach> The cool thing about flat UI is that it's laughably simple to implement in OpenGL
[17:42:24] <Peach> you don't even need any external image files
[17:42:38] <Peach> you can just draw flat simple polygons with vertex color
[17:43:09] <Peach> gradients are even super simple to make and require no external image system
[17:43:40] <blueridanus> Flat UI should be easy, but what if you need bézier curves?
[17:43:55] <Peach> The thing is , most flat UI just uses squares
[17:44:02] <Astraea> I'm actually a pretty bad UI designer, dunno how I always get stuck with jobs that require it...
[17:44:05] <Peach> So developers can be lazy and just use squares
[17:44:05] <zofrex> Peach: you'd think that, then you look at android, and every app has a bazillion bitmaps for the UI in all the different possible DPIs
[17:44:17] <Peach> EXACTLY sofrex
[17:44:21] <Peach> I was going to say that
[17:44:30] <blueridanus> zofrex: This kind of thing really annoys me.
[17:44:40] <Elaine> eddyb: it'd be a fun challenge. it'd probably be fine, but I'm not 100% certain.
[17:44:41] <zofrex> it does have vector support now
[17:44:45] <Peach> ironically smart phones still use bitmaps and that actually slows down rendering because of texture reads
[17:44:46] <zofrex> but it's relatively new
[17:44:55] <Peach> despite using flat UI
[17:45:17] <zofrex> I'm sure for non trivial things, rasterizing vectors on the fly is slower than reading in a texture
[17:45:23] <Peach> (and again flat UI is silly simple to implement fast using OpenGL etc.)
[17:45:31] <Peach> Yes zofrex for beziers
[17:45:36] <blueridanus> Can you do vector rasterization on GPUs?

[17:45:42] <blueridanus> With good performance?
[17:45:52] <zofrex> do you want to write the documentation explaining to designers which shapes are slow and which are fast? :P
[17:45:56] <Peach> blueridanus: GPUs ARE vector rasterization
[17:46:08] <Peach> everything a GPU usually does is exactly that
[17:46:12] <blueridanus> Peach: Vector as in "vector graphics"
[17:46:15] <Peach> Yes
[17:46:28] <Peach> Since the beginning of OpenGL,
[17:46:33] <blueridanus> Wait, so there are parallel bézier curve algorithms?
[17:46:59] <Peach> all graphics have been defined using vertex primitives, and yes you can easily do bezier curves as well
[17:47:16] <blueridanus> Oh. Huh.
[17:47:30] <Peach> the UI system I'm making is fully hardware accelerated vector rastierzation
[17:47:37] <blueridanus> Should I expect better performance than a CPU for parametric curves like that?
[17:47:45] <Peach> Yes blueridanus 
[17:48:22] <Astraea> well... to render a bezier curve you still need to break it down into primitives
[17:48:47] <Peach> OR you could use a geometry shader Astrae
[17:48:55] <Astraea> true
[17:48:59] <blueridanus> I mean, GPUs are massively parallel and I don't know how you can take advantage of that for bézier curves
[17:49:07] <Peach> tessellation <3
[17:49:35] <cyndis> there's also NV_path_rendering :p don't know how that works
[17:49:45] <blueridanus> But doesn't that mean we are going on the road only recent video cards support? 
[17:49:51] <blueridanus> The compute shader stuff and etc
[17:50:12] <Astraea> well...
[17:50:18] <Astraea> ugh, opengl
[17:52:03] <blueridanus> Peach said he was using a very old video card and the library has curves, so... I guess it works then. Cool.
[17:52:16] <Astraea> zofrex: android can still do a lot of stuff in the background, right?
[17:52:33] <Astraea> that's my current hiccup with iOS and my workarounds are becoming increasingly... uglier
[17:53:30] <Peach> For me, I'm building a system that works with the oldest GPUs possible so high speed fancy rendering can be a standard for all future tech - from low end smartphone GPU to high end desktop GPU
[17:54:11] <Peach> Plus, if you can get it 60FPS on low end, then it means everyone will have high framerate UIs forever in the future <3

[18:42:20] <Peach> I want a theoretical iPad that has enough laptop features that it's a suitable replacement
[18:42:39] <Peach> It would be so cool if apple made an iPad that you can build apps on
[18:42:46] <Peach> Like an Xcode for iPad
[18:43:03] <blueridanus> Would it run iOS? 
[18:43:28] <blueridanus> Or OSX?
[18:45:06] <blueridanus> Apple wouldn't do a OSX tablet, and iOS is not a suitable laptop replacement...
[18:45:07] <Peach> it would run on iOS
[18:45:10] <Peach> but
[18:45:19] <Peach> it would be a modified one
[18:45:40] <Peach> Remember blueridanus , iOS *IS* a fully capable OS, it's just that apple restricts the GUI
[18:46:02] <blueridanus> Oh. I'm not too familiar, apologies.
[18:46:10] <Peach> technologically, there is nothing impractical about having a full desktop like UI for iOS
[18:46:23] <Peach> iOS runs the same core architecture that OSX runs
[18:46:39] <Peach> it's really just the UI that makes it appear so limited
[18:46:58] <Peach> but in reality you can seriously make a "Xcode for iPad"
[18:47:04] <Peach> you could make a compiler and everything
[18:47:28] <Peach> and apple could theoretically unlock the system so it's as customizable as a desktop OS
[18:47:38] <blueridanus> Why don't they?
[18:48:03] <Peach> Because they know a lot of people aren't responsible enough with their tech
[18:48:29] <Peach> 90% of iPad users are the kind that don't really tinker much with their OS, they just browse the web and watch movies

[18:53:39] <Peach> On iOS, there's an entirely different window system
[18:54:03] <blueridanus> That's a shame.
[18:54:10] <blueridanus> And could be easily be solved by responsive design.
[18:54:38] <Peach> Well remember, OSX couldn't have foreseen the iPhone/iPad revolution
[18:54:40] <blueridanus> "your screen is too small? here's a version of the ui with less of the less important stuff we don't have space to show"
[18:55:13] <blueridanus> "you have touch capability? here's a version of the ui that isn't for mouses."
[18:55:16] <Peach> there HAD to be rewrites to make the system work better for low power devices and of course multi touch
[18:55:39] <Peach> Apple could make a new OS that unifies the code between iOS and OSX, but it won't because there's like no power user market
[18:56:09] <Peach> And plus, apple doesn't want you to install apps freely like you can on OSX
[18:56:15] <blueridanus> But is unifying both platforms something only power users can enjoy?
[18:56:18] <Peach> it wants to restrict everything to its own app store

[19:03:31] <Astraea> Peach: tablet wouldn't work for programming without a much better physical interface for the programmer
[19:03:56] <Astraea> UI isn't really the inherent limitation
[19:04:07] <Peach> do you mean keyboard Astraea ? what do you mean physical interface?
[19:04:31] <Astraea> Screen size, keyboard, mouse
[19:05:02] <Astraea> Tablets are great content consuming devices, not so great at content creation (though there are exceptions)
[19:05:20] <blueridanus> Stick a stylus and it becomes great at content creation.
[19:05:31] <blueridanus> Not for code, obviously
[19:05:48] <Astraea> Even for writing it's mediocre with a stylus
[19:05:58] <Astraea> Art is better
[19:06:00] <blueridanus> Not for writing either, that's indeed mediocre
[19:06:05] <Astraea> But you need pressure levels

[19:06:13] <blueridanus> Yeah, you do

[22:26:08] <GBGamer> rant about τ meaning 2π:
[22:27:19] <GBGamer> τ means torque
[22:27:19] <GBGamer> therefore, if you have, say, 4π Nm of torque
[22:27:19] <GBGamer> τ = 2τ Nm
[22:27:20] <GBGamer> which obviously makes no sense

[22:36:05] <scott> π is two under a bar, ie. in the denominator, so τ is dividing by half as much, so it's twice as large.

[22:56:44] <XMPPwocky> does nobody see the problem with this plan
[22:57:01] <scott> Tau looks like a T and it stands for one Turn around a circle in radians.

[23:01:34] <GBGamer> scott: "mostly"?
[23:02:14] <GBGamer> but tau literally only makes one or two equations nicer
[23:02:29] <GBGamer> and one or two equations worse
[23:02:32] <scott> GBGamer: I mean, it's a silly mnemonic that might work for someone. Personally I don't have any trouble remembering with tau and pi are.
[23:02:40] <GBGamer> I don't see what's wrong with keeping pi
[23:03:17] <scott> I completely disagree. Tau lets me figure out a lot of trigonometry more quickly.
[23:03:49] <scott> Tau/4 being 90deg is a lot more instant in my mind even with less practice with tau.
[23:04:23] <GBGamer> I can see that
[23:05:12] <GBGamer> I just prefer pi
[23:05:18] <GBGamer> because πr^2 is far nicer than τ/2 r^2
[23:05:34] <GBGamer> okay it is time for food
[23:08:21] <scott> Pi
[23:09:01] <scott> Pi's not going away but it makes sense to use tau when it helps. I've seen game developers like Jon Blow use it in code because it makes stuff easier to reason about.
