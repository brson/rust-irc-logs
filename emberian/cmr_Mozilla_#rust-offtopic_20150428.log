[03:15:33] <FreeFull> Arch forced me to  use systemd a while ago
[03:15:46] <barosl> While I'm still a bit skeptical to systemd's approach, at a glance, its `blame` tool looks great...
[03:16:22] <barosl> Which profiles the boot-up time taken by system jobs
[03:17:57] <barosl> Unfortunately, but expectedly, it also broke my system, ignore the existing runlevel settings
[03:18:18] <Astrum|Lap> I'm quite out of the loop, what is systemd's approach?
[03:18:21] <barosl> I've set a few services not to start automatically, but systemd ignores it and just starts it right away
[03:18:43] <barosl> Astrum|Lap, It integrates formally separate system components into one gigantic huge process
[03:18:47] <barosl> formerly*
[03:18:57] <Astrum|Lap> hmmm
[03:19:44] <barosl> Traditionally `init` just managed forking and executing new processes, and orphaning abandoned processes
[03:19:54] <barosl> systemd does more things out of the box
[03:20:21] <barosl> e.g. mount points are also supported in systemd
[03:20:35] <barosl> They are treated similar to ordinary system jobs
[03:21:23] <barosl> AFAICT the gain from this is that it provides you a uniform interface to different aspects of the system

[03:32:43] <Havvy> Astrum|Lap:  What /do/ you use?
[03:32:48] <geofft> I mean, worst case, the kernel reserves pid 1 
[03:33:00] <geofft> and you special-case the exit code, so that processes don't become zombies if their parent pid is 1

[03:34:54] <Havvy> Speaking of which, I need to update the rustc package to beta.3 tomorrow.
[03:34:58] <barosl> I guess the latter is for "overlay"?
[03:35:00] <Astrum|Lap> actually I use OSX most of the time, but strangely I'm burried in fish for everything except browsing the web and IRC
[03:35:03] <geofft> yup 
[03:35:04] <Astrum|Lap> maybe I should switch to irssi
[03:35:11] <barosl> The package maintainer's version seems to be located in the former
[03:35:26] <barosl> Hmm, trying to reasonate this...
[03:35:35] <geofft> and (having worked on image-based Linux deployments) I _really_ like systemd's push to make it possible to have everything but /etc read-only 
[03:35:36] <geofft> and shared 
[03:35:41] <Havvy> And probably try to add myself to the maintainers list.
[03:36:13] <geofft> so that the OS "upgrade" process can just be the delivery of a new system image that provides /usr, /bin, /lib, etc. 
[03:36:31] <barosl> That's cool

[03:41:27] <barosl> hostnamectl? Seriously?
[03:41:43] <niconii> homura!
[03:41:57] <geofft> hostnamed! 
[03:42:13] <geofft> I mean I kinda agree with that one 
[03:42:26] <geofft> there _should_ be a way to change your hostname (e.g. for DHCP) and inform everyone 
[03:42:40] <geofft> and it should be the case that your hostname always resolves 
[03:42:41] <Havvy> barosl:  Yeah, there's a lot of complaints that systemd consumes too much of the ecosystem.
[03:42:51] <geofft> at some point (I think pre-systemd) Lennart got annoyed by the latter bit and wrote nss-myhostname 
[03:42:59] <barosl> niconii, I name my systems after girls in anime!
[03:43:08] <geofft> which is literally just an NSS plugin that resolves your hostname to 127.0.0.1, I think? 
[03:43:19] <geofft> it's sorta like putting your current hostname in /etc/hosts but less manual 
[03:43:23] <barosl> Havvy, I heard that complaints a lot of time, but never expected it also included hostname management :P
[03:43:38] <geofft> and then he decided this is a reasonable property for systemd to depend on, and pulled it in 
[03:43:51] <Havvy> systemd as an ecosystem is great. systemd as an init system just feels weird.
[03:44:01] <barosl> geofft, So the point is that we can utilize hostname changes as an event?
[03:44:14] <geofft> yeah, there's some D-Bus signal that gets emitted when your hostname changes 
[03:44:31] <geofft> http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/hostnamed/ 
[03:44:36] <Havvy> D-Bus is a terrible name. :S
[03:46:05] <barosl> Does systemd completely ignore the legacy /etc/init.d ?
[03:46:24] <FreeFull> Yes
[03:46:27] <barosl> I'm asking this because Upstart tried to support both, which are the ones in /etc/init and the ones in /etc/init.d
[03:46:44] <barosl> Ok, then I think I can safely remove the directory
[03:46:51] <geofft> http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/Incompatibilities/ 
[03:46:56] <geofft> it attempts to support them 
[03:46:59] <barosl> Wut
[03:47:16] <geofft> but I think that a systemd unit file of the same name suppresses the init script, or something? 
[03:47:20] <barosl> The backward compatibility could make things complex
[03:47:30] <barosl> Oh, hmm
[03:47:35] <barosl> That's viable

[06:08:18] <swgillespie> If I link against libgccjit, does my library have to be GPL too? or is that covered under gcc's linking exception?
[06:13:03] <bstrie> swgillespie: static linking or dynamic
[06:13:09] <swgillespie> bstrie: dynamic
[06:15:00] <swgillespie> the gcc docs make it seems like the "runtime library" is the only thing covered under the exception

[06:18:27] <WindowsBunny> oh dang, dirt rally
[06:18:30] <WindowsBunny> mmmm
[06:43:34] <nathan7> libgccjit is definitely GPL, because it uses a bunch of GCC
[06:43:55] <nathan7> it can't be LGPL (or have a linking exception) without relicensing GCC

[08:38:41] <bstrie> tell me if this idea is brilliant or stupid
[08:39:04] <bstrie> we make cargo do for C++ what it already does for rust
[08:39:14] <bstrie> and make crates.io the best C++ project repo in the world
[08:39:35] <bstrie> (I didn't ask if it was infeasible, that's obvious)
[08:40:07] * Yurume was thinking about an alternative branch of crates.io dedicated for precompiled libraries
[08:40:25] <bstrie> here's my reasoning: clearly there is demand for package managers that are integrated with a language
[08:40:42] <Yurume> so that, well, the alternative crate ships with library binaries and very simple build.rs
[08:40:55] <bstrie> to wit: if you come up with a new programming language in this day and age, but don't have a solution for a package manager, you're dead in the water
[08:41:18] <bstrie> but people are always whining about having to have a million different package managers installed, one for each language
[08:41:51] <bstrie> it seems that, at some point in history, we will solve this, and that the natural beginning will be by having a package manager that supports two languages
[08:42:01] <VShell> I mean. with C++, you can generally get away with using the OS package manager.
[08:42:29] <bstrie> VShell: people also whine incessantly about OS package managers not being sufficient for languages
[08:42:51] <bstrie> fixing this is beyond the scope of my crazy idea
[08:43:29] <bstrie> anyway, C++ might be a good thing for this because it already has a huge ecosystem and it's never grown its own package manager
[08:43:48] <barosl> VShell, I've heard of that claim fairly amount of times, but I'm a bit skeptical. The usual GitHub libraries I like to test are not likely to be included in the OS package managers anytime soon, that's normal because they set a relatively high standard on accepted packages
[08:43:56] <bstrie> as you say, people get by with the OS package manager, but I doubt developers wouldn't welcome something less onerous and more cross-platform
[08:44:34] <barosl> See PyPI, NPM, and Creates.io - They all don't restrict packages to be accepted. Anyone can push anything
[08:44:36] <VShell> maybe.
[08:44:50] <barosl> Of course it has security concerns, but it also has advantages
[08:45:34] <bstrie> I see OS package managers as for serving end-users, and language package managers as for serving developers
[08:45:52] *** Joins: Rym_ (y@moz-rmaga4.range86-187.btcentralplus.com)
[08:46:00] <barosl> bstrie, But weren't there already a few C++ package managers out there? I'm doubtful that a newly emergine one can actually get a notable mind share at this point
[08:46:17] * VShell likes Nix/Guix as an OS package manager that (theoretically) works well for development.
[08:46:31] <barosl> Well, I do remember one, uhh...
[08:46:41] <barosl> It was from the MS-friendly land...
[08:46:51] <barosl> Yes. NuGet
[08:46:58] <VShell> NuGet?
[08:47:00] <VShell> heh
[08:47:35] <barosl> Welp, I was wrong. It's primarily for the .NET paltform
[08:47:43] <VShell> barosl: the trouble is it's heavily dependent on Powershell and there's no decent implementation of Powershell for Mono, last time I checked.
[08:47:54] <VShell> it's primarily for .Net but supports C++.
[08:48:05] <barosl> Woot
[08:48:20] <barosl> Frankly I didn't even expect Powershell to be ported to Mono
[08:48:30] <barosl> That's a good thing to do
[08:49:16] <bstrie> barosl: I've never even heard of any C++ package managers
[08:49:26] <barosl> Besides package managers, what is the most go-to way to build a project in C++ nowadays?
[08:49:26] <bstrie> I've heard of NuGet, but I think of that as just apt for windows
[08:49:36] <barosl> Still CMake?
[08:49:41] <VShell> barosl: https://github.com/Pash-Project/Pash huh, someone's got enough of a Powershell reimplementation working on Mono for NuGet to work. bet there's other problems, though.
[08:50:01] <VShell> bstrie: it's really not, it's a development package manager.

[08:53:40] <VShell> barosl: I mean, Unity games run on Mono under all systems and they work fine.
[08:54:08] <barosl> Don't Unity games rely on DirectX?
[08:54:21] <barosl> Is Mono also capable of emulating it?
[08:54:31] <VShell> nope. the renderer is swappable, Unity games are available for Linux and OSX.
[08:54:38] <barosl> Wait... it's Unity, it's cross platform, it can't be Windows-specific

[15:13:46] <scott> me neither
[15:13:58] <scott> brains are good at skipping irrelevant details
[15:14:58] <mrmonday> I've come across it quite a lot when I talk to non-native speakers who correct what they're saying, thinking they've just made a terrible mistake and said something completely nonsensical
[15:15:16] <mrmonday> and I haven't even noticed a mistake
[15:15:47] <mrmonday> (though have a confused look on my face, trying to wonder why they corrected themselves...)
[15:16:14] <mrmonday> it'd be nice if programming languages were like that
[15:16:21] <mrmonday> I just tell them what to do, and they do it

[15:16:33] <mrmonday> just doing the right thing regardless
[15:17:13] <scott> I like to imagine programming evolving into a kind of dialogue with the compiler
[15:17:24] <mrmonday> [I guess, on the other hand, there'd be a lot of really horrible code out there if that worked...]
[15:17:27] <scott> some languages are getting there in some ways
[15:17:30] <mrmonday> [even more than there already is...]
[15:17:55] <scott> e.g. Haskell now lets you leave holes in types and expressions and have the compiler tell you what types need to go in them
[15:18:00] <mrmonday> pretty much all the good languages {as far as I'm concerned} are kinda like that
[15:18:17] <tiffany> idris lets you design proofs for your code interactively

[15:26:16] * Zoxc uses Qt Creator or VS
[15:26:30] <scott> IDEs are pretty great for navigating unfamiliar codebases
[15:26:50] <mrmonday> LLVM's no way near as bad as a Java class on OO design patterns :p
[15:27:07] <mrmonday> at least most of the code for doing a particular thing is in one place, even if it calls functions all over everywhere
[15:27:28] <mrmonday> at which point you can use your favourite editor/IDE to jump to definition anyway
[15:27:29] <Zoxc> LLVM has some huge files
[15:27:59] <mrmonday> I'll take a huge file over tons of tiny ones any day
[15:28:39] <scott> +1
[15:28:57] <scott> sometimes large files are a sign of poor organization, but tons of tiny files are usually a worse sign of that

[15:29:34] <mrmonday> I dunno if that comment was funnier or everyone having the same reaction :P
[15:29:46] <tiffany> I try to stick to around 300 lines per file
[15:30:42] <scott> in Rust, or Haskell? that's pretty small
[15:31:49] <ChrisMorgan> For ultimate coolness, store multiple “files” in the one file, separated by the form feed character (U+000C, ^L). Aspen used to use that in <http://aspen.io/simplates/>, but apparently switched to using the separator [---] instead. Sad.

We were heavily into Zope and Plone at the time. This was in the Zope 2 days. The original idea was something like, “What if you could put a Script (Python) and a ZPT in THE SAME FILE!?” Steve has since switched careers to philosophy.’

[15:37:37] <mrmonday> I don't generally keep track of web stuff, I spotted that a few frameworks have started just having their own fake DOM, then occasionally updating the actual one, since it's magnitudes faster
[15:37:46] <mrmonday> thought that was kinda interesting
[15:38:01] <Zoxc> Now, how do deal nicely with mutual recursion for type inference?
[15:38:32] <eddyb> mrmonday: that's an obvious thing
[15:38:38] <mrmonday> probably spotted it through Elm, which can add some nice guarantees about it thanks to immutablility and things

[15:39:08] <mrmonday> I still feel that way
[15:39:14] <mrmonday> same for CSS
[15:39:15] <eddyb> I don't think Elm was even a thing back then

[15:39:31] <eddyb> it was after ACE, and I just hated the ACE codebase

[15:39:46] <mrmonday> oh, Elm I've looked at recently
[15:40:11] <eddyb> so I did the virtual DOM thing before "virtual DOM" was a mainstream technique name

[23:22:52] <WindowsBunny> Colorful is something that FF does when the font it uses supports color
[23:23:02] <WindowsBunny> IE meanwhile does not use color
[23:23:14] <eddyb> WindowsBunny: just paste here 4 different colorful emoji
[23:23:17] <WindowsBunny> Unless you explicitly use an emoji font with color

[23:25:58] <tiffany> I don't think symbola was designed to be used at this low of a size
[23:26:02] <WindowsBunny> tiffany: Is your LCD layout backwards?
[23:26:11] <tiffany> no?
[23:26:26] <eddyb> hmpf, the font size is ridiculously small
[23:26:34] <WindowsBunny> Mine is red on left and blue on right
[23:26:41] <WindowsBunny> but yours is blue on left and red on right
[23:26:47] <WindowsBunny> RGB vs BGR
[23:26:47] <Zoxc> That looks backwards indeed
[23:26:47] <tiffany> I thought BGR was standard for LCDs
[23:27:04] <WindowsBunny> your screenshot looks horrifying on my screen
[23:27:37] <WindowsBunny> I'm pretty sure RGB is more common
[23:27:41] <ChrisMorgan> Enormously.
[23:28:17] <tiffany> I can't really look at my screen close enough to tell which I actually have
[23:28:22] <tiffany> I have no idea how I would configure it either way
[23:28:28] <tiffany> editing fontconfig xml maybe?
[23:28:55] <WindowsBunny> You can use the cleartype tuning utility
[23:28:56] <WindowsBunny> wait
[23:29:00] <WindowsBunny> you're not on windows
[23:29:03] <tiffany> yes
[23:29:10] <WindowsBunny> Well, no idea then
[23:29:18] <Zoxc> KDE and GNOME has settings for it
[23:29:24] <tiffany> well, I don't run kde or gnome
[23:29:30] <WindowsBunny> Another reason I hate programs which don't use native font rendering
[23:29:36] <tiffany> I'm using i3, but I have the xfce tools in this fucked up half-running zombie state
[23:29:37] <Zoxc> Wayland tells it's clients =P
[23:29:38] <WindowsBunny> they ignore my cleartype font rendering choices
[23:29:53] <tiffany> you must hate me windowsbunny
[23:29:58] <tiffany> I use freetype on all platforms, including windows
[23:30:14] <tiffany> although I'm not against using cleartype on windows
[23:30:18] <tiffany> I just don't have a way to test it
[23:30:49] <WindowsBunny> tiffany: I do hate you :D
[23:31:03] <WindowsBunny> I hate a lot of people it seems
[23:31:06] <barosl> How about making a cross platform font renderer wrapper?
[23:31:20] <tiffany> oh
[23:31:21] <barosl> e.g. Using cleartype on windows, using ??? on os x, otherwise freetype
[23:31:25] <WindowsBunny> barosl: I'll provide the DirectWrite bindings if someone wants to do that
[23:31:30] <tiffany> I was just doing it in my gui library
[23:31:39] <tiffany> I could make it separate, but it's not worth making it its own git repo
[23:32:13] <eddyb> WindowsBunny: can I just use ClearType like I use FreeType?
[23:32:28] <eddyb> WindowsBunny: i.e. ask for metrics and a texture
[23:32:29] <barosl> I wonder how much difficulty is there to narrow down the platform differences
[23:32:44] <eddyb> WindowsBunny: because I don't care that much on top of that
[23:33:01] <eddyb> https://i.imgur.com/sdZcpTP.png
[23:33:22] <eddyb> no colors, though
[23:33:35] <eddyb> I'm not sure what I have actually has colors
[23:34:26] <WindowsBunny> eddyb: Segoe UI Emoji has colors, you just have to specifically enable them somehow
[23:34:34] <WindowsBunny> Not many font renderers understand how to do that
[23:34:44] <tiffany> I have no idea how cleartype works
[23:34:53] <tiffany> I think there's two interfaces to it?
[23:34:54] <WindowsBunny> eddyb: Also, can I see you use emoji in the code itself, and not just in the UI?
[23:34:56] <tiffany> GDI and DirectRender
[23:34:59] <tiffany> or something
[23:35:00] <WindowsBunny> DirectWrite
[23:35:02] <tiffany> and one is old and slow as shit
[23:35:07] <barosl> eddyb, What is the editor? The icons on the menu items are cute
[23:35:07] <WindowsBunny> GDI is the older shittier one
[23:35:08] <tiffany> and the other doesn't work well under wine
[23:35:18] <WindowsBunny> DirectWrite is new and fuck wine
[23:35:31] <WindowsBunny> I still can't stand alcohol so fuck wine
[23:36:17] <tiffany> freetype + harfbuzz is pretty simple
[23:36:21] <eddyb> WindowsBunny: emoji in code requires Hasklig to support them...
[23:36:35] <eddyb> WindowsBunny: oh wait it actually does because I can see them in kate /facepalm
[23:36:43] <tiffany> you use freetype to parse a ttf file, you use harfbuzz to perform layout (tell you where to put each glyph), and then you ask freetype for the glyphs and do all the blitting yourself
[23:36:45] <eddyb> barosl: I just pasted what WindowsBunny gave me into my code
[23:37:06] <barosl> Hmm?
[23:37:11] <barosl> Are you making an editor?
[23:37:16] <eddyb> yes :)
[23:37:22] <eddyb> see other screenshots above
[23:37:42] <WindowsBunny> tiffany: DirectWrite just handles everything
[23:37:49] <eddyb> like https://i.imgur.com/DPP7jwR.png and https://i.imgur.com/tyF3JMT.png
[23:37:52] <eddyb> WindowsBunny: that's not a good answer

[23:38:10] <barosl> O.o That overlay windows are impressive
[23:38:24] <tiffany> so you make a "Direct2D factory" with "D2D1CreateFactory()"
[23:38:26] <eddyb> it's very hacky, I assure you :P
[23:38:32] <tiffany> which is a COM interface, mind you
[23:38:36] <tiffany> and then you load a font using it
[23:39:09] <tiffany> oh wow
[23:39:11] <tiffany> this is complicated
[23:39:23] <tiffany> so you need to make a direct2D context
[23:39:36] <tiffany> and you need to make a brush and stuff to draw with
[23:39:54] <WindowsBunny> tiffany: Here's some sample code

[23:39:57] <tiffany> you can draw multicolored/gradiated text for whatever reason
[23:40:00] <tiffany> I'm looking at some right now
[23:40:21] <barosl> eddyb, Where did you get the idea of showing the types of each method in the chain? Or is that your own?
[23:40:22] <eddyb> actually, no, I can't see the last set of emojis in kate :/
[23:40:49] <tiffany> eh
[23:40:51] <WindowsBunny> DirectWrite is very flexible, but also somewhat complex
[23:40:55] <tiffany> I guess this is somewhat reasonable to deal with
[23:40:56] <tiffany> but still
[23:41:02] <tiffany> you need to setup a Direct2D device context
[23:41:04] <eddyb> whyyyyy am I fucking with this when I have hours to add tabs and file open/save and whatnot
[23:41:06] <WindowsBunny> yep
[23:41:07] <tiffany> that is really heavyweight
[23:41:23] <WindowsBunny> eddyb: Because of me? :D
[23:41:29] <tiffany> can you draw to a system-memory buffer?
[23:41:35] <tiffany> or does this involve gpu back and forth
[23:41:45] <WindowsBunny> tiffany: It's hardware accelerated
[23:41:52] <tiffany> so that is a yes
[23:41:57] <tiffany> that makes things complicated
[23:41:59] <WindowsBunny> >High-quality, sub-pixel, ClearType text rendering that can use GDI, Direct2D, or application-specific rendering technology. 
[23:42:05] <WindowsBunny> application-specific?
[23:42:08] <WindowsBunny> wut
[23:42:13] <tiffany> what if I don't want to draw to a window?
[23:42:20] <tiffany> what if I want to draw to an in-game surface inside of a GL context?
[23:43:35] <WindowsBunny> tiffany: use IDWriteBitmapRenderTarget
[23:44:08] <tiffany> this seems like an awful lot of work
[23:45:12] <eddyb> oh, hey :D
[23:45:46] <WindowsBunny> and then you'd call GetMemoryDC on that to get to the pixel data
[23:45:51] <WindowsBunny> which you can then push to OpenGL
[23:46:46] <WindowsBunny> You can also use a Direct2D render target
[23:46:51] <WindowsBunny> and then get the pixels from that
[23:47:48] <tiffany> can you transfer an on-GPU buffer from D2D to GL?
[23:48:01] <eddyb> tiffany: with Vulkan, of course
[23:48:59] <WindowsBunny> xD
[23:48:59] <eddyb> WindowsBunny: btw, what does it mean that this doesn't work on windows? https://github.com/tomaka/glutin/blob/master/src/api/win32/callback.rs#L112
[23:49:14] <eddyb> WindowsBunny: anything obviously wrong with the implementation?
[23:49:23] <eddyb> (doesn't work == no events received)
[23:49:30] <tiffany> also, subpixel rendering doesn't make sense if you're drawing to a texture which will be rendered in 3D
[23:49:51] <tiffany> which my GUI library is partially designed for
[23:50:40] <WindowsBunny> eddyb: no events received? That's weird
[23:51:47] <eddyb> WindowsBunny: I mean, everything other than the damn scroll
[23:51:57] <WindowsBunny> eddyb: That's weird
[23:52:01] <eddyb> and I'm not sure I want to spend time adding a scrollbar
[23:52:57] <WindowsBunny> one sec, I'm testing whether the issue occurs for me as well
[23:53:05] <tiffany> I disabled my scrollbar in emacs
[23:53:09] <tiffany> and urxvt
[23:53:27] <eddyb> do you have line numbers?
[23:53:40] <tiffany> they are disabled by default and I never bothered to turn them on
