[00:28:55] <larsberg> sounds good. I'm reluctant to use the "insert a strut" approach described in the spec because I don't really want to worry about inserting a GenericBox into each new line on linebreaks.
[00:29:07] <larsberg> (or a new StrutBox, etc.)
[00:31:10] <larsberg> It seems ungood in the presence of resizing w/ re-linebreaking since I either have to remove them or we could end up continuing to grow the number of these empty boxes over time

[00:37:51] <SimonSapin> larsberg, pcwalton: I don’t think the strut needs to be an actual "box", it’s just a minimum on the height of the line box
[00:37:56] <SimonSapin> … more or less
[00:38:13] <pcwalton> does anyone really mind if I just remove the scissor code?
[00:38:25] <SimonSapin> scissor code?
[00:38:26] <pcwalton> glScissor is inappropriate anyway for doing clipping since it doesn't work in the presence of transforms
[00:38:48] <pcwalton> it's what makes iframes only able to draw in their bounds
[00:39:15] <pcwalton> the current code makes a half-hearted attempt at making it work with transforms but… it's wrong
[00:39:20] <larsberg> pcwalton: +1 for removing anything in layers and compositorlayers/quadtree code, with the goal of simplifying it later
[00:39:28] <pcwalton> and can't be made to work because the approach just doesn't work
[00:39:34] <pcwalton> I could try to patch it up or I could just remove it
[00:39:43] <pcwalton> btw, that is my fault, glScissor was a stupid idea :)
[00:39:57] <larsberg> SimonSapin: That seems to be how Gecko works as well, from what I can tell in http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/layout/generic/nsLineLayout.cpp#1399 (use the line-height to set a lower bound on the line size)
[00:40:20] <pcwalton> ok, I'll just nuke the scissor code
[00:40:39] <pcwalton> glScissor doesn't work with transforms so the whole thing will be busted if you transform an iframe and needs to be rewritten
[00:40:39] <larsberg> pcwalton: no worries; it served its purpose for our earlier iframe demos. I suspect we will rewrite a lot of the layers code in the next quarter or two
[00:40:51] <pcwalton> ok, time to nuke it :)

[00:51:34] <pcwalton> deokjinkim: almost. the ThreadSafeLayoutNode code looks good. what I would like to see is the .children() iterator also returning pseudo-elements
[00:51:56] <pcwalton> so when you call .children() on a ThreadSafeLayoutNode, it returns an iterator that returns (pseudo before), (real children), (pseudo after)
[00:52:24] <pcwalton> that way the code in layout/construct.rs doesn't have to check for pseudos
[00:52:35] <pcwalton> (except in swap_out_construction_result(), but the way you wrote it there is fine)

[00:54:44] <deokjinkim> Actually we tried to add pseudo element to first_child() for children() iterator. Adding "before" is easy, but when we add "after", it has problem.
[00:55:48] <pcwalton> what was the problem?
[00:56:36] *** Joins: luisbg (luisbg@moz-C54443AD.baconseed.org)
[00:56:43] <deokjinkim> To add "after", accessing to parent is needed, but it is not allowed for ThreadSafeLayoutNode.
[00:57:11] <pcwalton> could the "after" be looked up at the start of iteration and stored inside the iterator?
[00:57:20] <pcwalton> that way when you exhaust the iterator, it looks to see if it has an after
[00:57:31] <pcwalton> let me look at the data structure
[00:58:06] <pcwalton> pub struct ThreadSafeLayoutNodeChildrenIterator<'a> {
[00:58:07] <pcwalton>     priv current_node: Option<ThreadSafeLayoutNode<'a>>,
[00:58:07] <pcwalton> }
[00:58:09] <pcwalton> this could become
[00:58:34] <pcwalton> pub struct ThreadSafeLayoutNodeChildrenIterator<'a> {
[00:58:34] <pcwalton>     priv current_node: Option<ThreadSafeLayoutNode<'a>>,
[00:58:35] <pcwalton>     priv parent_node: Option<ThreadSafeLayoutNode<'a>>,
[00:58:37] <pcwalton> }
[00:59:01] <pcwalton> then at the end of iteration you could check the parent for an "after" pseudo-element
[00:59:13] <pcwalton> this should be safe because you had to have access to a parent to iterate over its children anyway

[17:54:31] <pcwalton> jdm: that works for me
[17:54:38] <jdm> good, good
[17:54:49] <pcwalton> I don't really mind a few dynamic failures since they're much rarer in Rust than in C++
[17:55:14] <jdm> the advantage of my prototype is that the scope in which they can occur is quite small, so it shouldn't be difficult to resolve
[17:55:24] <pcwalton> yup
[17:55:32] <pcwalton> and they should only happen if you do weird stuff like moving stuff around anyhow
[17:55:35] <jdm> exactly
[17:55:37] <pcwalton> plus it's more flexible
[17:55:41] <pcwalton> you *can* move around if you want

[17:56:55] <jdm> this is what rooting looks like now
[17:56:57] <pcwalton> cute!
[17:57:00] <pcwalton> jdm++
[17:57:01] <jdm> call new_root(), then init

[17:58:33] <pcwalton> well, I just mean a macro block that automatically makes the RootCollection for you

[18:29:02] <pcwalton> heh, if you count IE8 parity as done ;)
[18:29:06] <pcwalton> IE8 parity on this
[18:29:21] <pcwalton> it's a massive milestone though.
[18:29:44] <mbrubeck> servo is the new ie8
[18:29:45] <pcwalton> supporting CSS 2.1 means that most of the web is reasonably viewable
[18:29:55] <pcwalton> or, Firefox 3

[18:32:10] <pcwalton> I also suggest a moratorium on new layers features until CompositorLayer and ContainerLayer have been merged and rust-layers has been refactored to modern Rust style
[18:32:20] <jgraham> Well as long as none of the web uses scripting or the DOM, we should be just fine :)
[18:33:06] <pcwalton> that's also part of it -- our layout is in reasonable shape and the biggest gaping holes in Servo after Acid2 are not really layout or gfx related
[18:33:15] <pcwalton> they're DOM related
[18:33:35] <pcwalton> which is not a slight on jdm or Ms2ger or anyone else by any means! it's a whole lot of work and it's amazing that we've come so far in such a short time

[18:34:46] * Ms2ger glares at pcwalton 
[18:34:50] <pcwalton> the "basic Web" doesn't need that many more layout features -- inline-block and incremental reflow, as well as merging float layout with block layout (right now float just implements a small subset)
[18:34:51] <larsberg> pcwalton: I'm in support of both of those restrictions, though I'd also like to hear SimonSapin's input (e.g., do we need fragments more than pagination)
[18:34:56] <pcwalton> yes
[18:35:14] <pcwalton> well, AIUI fragments ⊆ pagination
[18:35:28] <larsberg> +1 on incremental reflow. I want to stop working on keeping android and other stuff on life support and get that going
[18:35:54] <pcwalton> also parallel display list building. I did a little work on that by moving function arguments into DisplayListBuildingInfo
[18:36:03] <pcwalton> so that that can eventually just be thrown into a DOM node
[18:36:06] <larsberg> at the very least being incremental would make our hover events no longer bring servo to a reflow-induced crawl
[18:36:09] <pcwalton> and then display list building can be done in parallel
[18:36:11] <pcwalton> yeah :)
[18:36:28] <jdm> it looks like q2 for me will consist of enabling proper SM rooting in the current engine, then upgrading SM
[18:36:42] <SimonSapin> pcwalton: the tables PR is a good first step but it’s missing a lot of things for IE8 parity
[18:36:49] <jdm> so if we can allocate resources to start looking into the LLVM-related stuff for C++, that would be good
[18:36:54] <pcwalton> SimonSapin: sure, there's also forms
[18:37:03] <SimonSapin> I mean just for table
[18:37:06] <pcwalton> and frames
[18:37:15] <SimonSapin> eg. colspan, percentages, border-collapse, ...
[18:37:23] <jgraham> istr that there are also internal bits that are currently layout-driven that ought not to be. It may or may not be a good idea to sort that out before you figure out incremental reflow (I don't actually know how it works at the moment so I don't know if you will end up rewriting code that has to change again)
[18:37:37] <pcwalton> but let us bask in the glory of the Acid2 smiley for a little bit ;)
[18:37:50] <pcwalton> there's also z-index
[18:37:57] <pcwalton> I didn't implement it since it's not necessary for the smiley
[18:38:08] <pcwalton> it shouldn't be hard though
[18:38:14] <pcwalton> the StackingContext abstraction that I have is designed to support it
[18:38:32] <pcwalton> I just didn't do the last 20% necessary to actually support z-index
[18:38:49] <pcwalton> (though negative z-indices may be harder when floats are involved because of layerization, ugh)
[18:39:12] <pcwalton> though WebKit doesn't really handle floats right anyway
[18:39:20] <pcwalton> so maybe we can get away with cheating a little bit
[18:39:36] <pcwalton> err, fixed
[18:39:46] <pcwalton> WebKit doesn't handle fixed right when it comes to stacking contexts
[18:40:22] <SimonSapin> larsberg: what do you mean? Pagination is one kind of fragmentation

[19:51:12] <mbrubeck> jdm: Out of curiousity, why did we end up rolling our own vtable in #1688 instead of using language-level dynamic dispatch?
[19:51:12] <crowbot> Issue #1688: Implement vtables for DOM nodes. - https://github.com/mozilla/servo/pull/1688
[19:52:04] <jdm> mbrubeck: we are using language-level dispatch, but the language doesn't allow calling overridden methods
[19:52:37] <jdm> we don't actually roll our own, per se - we use traits, which provide dynamic dispatch.
[19:53:17] <jdm> mbrubeck: also, it's complicated by the fact that to Rust, a Node is an unrelated type to an Element
[19:53:34] <jdm> hence why we end up with the method that returns the "correct" vtable for a concrete type
[19:53:44] *** Joins: erickt (etryzelaar@8C9ECD8F.3A598286.F12515B4.IP)
[19:53:47] <mbrubeck> jdm: Oh, so if you have a default method implementation like trait X { fn f(self) {} }; then calling a f on a ~X value will always call the default implementation, never an overridden one?
[19:54:29] <jdm> mbrubeck: no, that's not what I meant. It's that Rust has no ability to do the equivalent of C++'s Base::overridden() from Derived::overridden
[19:54:46] <mbrubeck> jdm: Ah, got it
[19:55:12] <mbrubeck> I think :)
[19:55:28] <jdm> the problem is we lack inheritance in Rust, except for traits
[19:55:33] <jdm> but trait inheritance is not enough for us
[19:56:06] *** Joins: brendan (brendaneic@moz-D9B414AF.hfc.comcastbusiness.net)

[19:57:37] <jdm> but that won't let us call INode's implementation from IElement
[19:57:52] <mbrubeck> okay, thanks

[23:52:55] <deokjinkim> larsberg: I'm sorry for late response. Would you let me know status of build-bot? As I know, PR for pseudo element(https://github.com/mozilla/servo/pull/1974) is not merged yet.
[23:53:42] <larsberg> deokjinkim: It appears that there is a merge conflict between #1974 and master that will have to be resolved before the buildbot can process it
[23:53:42] <crowbot> Issue #1974: Implement pseudo-element(before and after) - https://github.com/mozilla/servo/pull/1974
[23:54:10] <larsberg> To get his sample image of ACID2, pcwalton manually merged in your changes and june0cho's to his branch
[23:56:30] <deokjinkim> larsberg: Do you mean #1974 needs rebase? Is it right?
[23:56:30] <crowbot> Issue #1974: Implement pseudo-element(before and after) - https://github.com/mozilla/servo/pull/1974
[23:56:43] <larsberg> deokjinkim: That is correct.
[23:57:12] <deokjinkim> I see. Thank your for kind explanation ^^.
