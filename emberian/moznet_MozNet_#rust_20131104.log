[00:19:10] <sam113101> but you don't need to specify a type?
[00:19:37] <mcarberry> sam113101, http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/master/std/vec/index.html
[00:19:42] <strcat> sam113101: rust has type inference
[00:20:00] <strcat> it will infer types based on any hints given in the function
[00:20:22] <strcat> let mut xs = std::hashmap::HashSet::new(); xs.insert(5)
[00:20:32] <strcat> it infers that it's a HashSet<int> from the insert method call
[00:20:52] <sam113101> the line is
[00:20:54] <sam113101> let mut accumulator = ~[];
[00:21:06] <strcat> it can infer the type from later usage
[00:21:11] <sam113101> I thought it wouldn't go as far as looking everywhere else inside the function
[00:21:13] <strcat> like accumulator.push(x)

[00:22:02] <strcat> rust's is not 100% solid yet and will fail to infer in some cases where it could
[00:22:22] <sam113101> yeah I tihnk I've seen that

[00:23:51] <strcat> type inference stops being easy to understand when it's not just local to functions
[00:24:27] <strcat> inferring the return type of a function from how it gets used can end up having a pretty huge cascading error

[00:57:36] <bodie> Rust dynamically scales to cores, yes?
[00:57:57] <strcat> hm?
[00:58:04] <bodie> I mean, takes advantage of CPU cores if they're available
[00:58:26] <bodie> i.e. do Rust programs themselves run on a single core, or do they automatically generate OS threads, or....
[00:58:37] <strcat> tasks are mapped to OS threads
[00:58:42] <ChrisMorgan> The number of threads is, by default, the number of cores available.
[00:58:43] <strcat> M:N threading

[00:59:53] <bodie> I see.  Thanks

[01:00:39] <sfackler> mletterle: np :)
[01:00:59] <Sharp> strcat: What provisions are there for writing a threading implementation in Rust?  e.g. for kernel code?
[01:01:00] <ChrisMorgan> It used to be able to be done at startup time with the RUST_THREADS environment variable, not certain on the situation now.
[01:01:02] <mletterle> it's annoying though since NSS is /supposed/ to be multithreaded.. or NSPR.. 
[01:01:26] <ChrisMorgan> But you can also spawn new tasks on different scheduler and with a "single thread" option which, I believe, gives it a thread of its own.

[05:04:00] <tikue_> leaper: you can't really use rust without pointers
[05:04:05] <mark_edward> performance is supposed to be abig one
[05:04:08] <SiegeLord> Yeah... that's kind of the point
[05:04:08] <tikue_> leaper: the advantage, of course, is performance
[05:04:09] <tautologico> if you don't want/need better control over resources, or a better concurrent model, you may not "need" to use rust
[05:04:17] <tautologico> performance
[05:04:56] <tikue_> leaper: afaik most functional languages don't have very good concurrency primitives either, so if that's important to you then rust comes out in front
[05:04:59] <tautologico> concurrency model I mean
[05:05:18] <leaper> I heard a lot of people like me do not like so many pointers in rust, but the others are attractive.
[05:05:21] <benh> I wouldn't really bet on rust against the jvm for performance/concurrency right now
[05:05:31] <strcat> benh: um, why not?
[05:05:57] <benh> strcat: they've had a lot more time to come up with all kinds of cool concurrency features!
[05:05:57] <strcat> rust as a language isn't slower than C++, rustc itself doesn't do anything seriously wrong
[05:06:00] <tautologico> ocaml does not have a good concurrency story… scala kinda has one with Akka actors, Haskell has many libs but I don't know how well they're used
[05:06:09] <strcat> benh: rust performs fine already
[05:06:15] <benh> we have libuv and some heroic efforts by a handful of engineers
[05:06:22] <tikue_> benh: the jvm doesnt' have support for any good concurrency other than basic threading
[05:06:38] <strcat> benh: so now you're only talking about I/O?
[05:06:39] <tikue_> benh: they have good concurrent data structures but not a concurrency model 
[05:06:57] <tikue_> tautologico: Akka is uglyyyyyy
[05:07:49] <tautologico> Akka is about the actor model, is more than just concurrency and includes distributed computing 
[05:08:03] <tikue_> benh: jvm also forces garbage collection on you, which isn't acceptable in many performance-critical scenarios
[05:08:30] <tautologico> I don't know about it being ugly, unless you mean the inherited ugliness from scala :)
[05:08:32] <strcat> all I can say is that there are only minor things to fix at a language level in relation to C++
[05:08:33] <benh> strcat: no, i just mentioned libuv because afaict the runtime/schedulers is/are kinda wired into it

[05:09:25] <strcat> benh: it's not going to
[05:09:42] <strcat> there isn't anything fundamentally wrong with rust's implementation
[05:09:45] <tikue_> benh: based on what? all numbers i've seen thus far point to the contrary at this point
[05:09:49] <strcat> it is not slower than the same code written in C++
[05:10:09] <benh> tikue_: ok, i don't have any numbers and i'm happy to take that back
[05:10:58] <Sharp> strcat: Maybe in situations where GCC optimizes better.
[05:11:02] <Sharp> Of which there are some.
[05:11:36] <tikue_> benh: jvm is of course very well engineered, but it's still a virtual machine running bytecode, which by itself means it won't be able to compete with optimized binaries. when you consider that everything is GC'd on top of that, ir eally think we're looking at different performance profiles completely
[05:12:06] <strcat> Sharp: and there are situations where LLVM optimizes better
[05:12:10] <Sharp> Yeah, of course :)
[05:12:39] <benh> tikue_: i'm probably overestimating how well the jit works, and i vaguely had the notion in my head that a GC doesn't hurt you much while your working set is small relative to available memory
[05:13:22] <tautologico> java people used to say that a JIT can dynamically optimize code better than a compiler can :)
[05:13:27] <leaper> so far I have learned that the advantage of rust rests in safe pointers, and if people do not want to use pointers, the concurrency model is the second but scala and haskell have counterparts, right?
[05:13:27] <strcat> java doesn't have value types beyond the primitive data types and other issues like that
[05:13:34] <tikue_> benh: i think you are probably right about the latter. imo the biggest problem is that it's unpredictable. if you need guarantees then GC won't give that to you
[05:13:49] <strcat> leaper: there is no 'do not want to use pointers'
[05:13:52] <tikue_> leaper: what do you mean by "people do not want to use pointers" ?
[05:13:56] <strcat> when you use python or java, every object is a "pointer"
[05:13:58] <Sharp> tautologico: To be fair, there *are* cases where you can make optimizations at runtime that you can't during compilation.  Mostly thinking about databases here.
[05:14:03] <SiegeLord> Maybe it means just using GC everywhere?
[05:14:37] <tautologico> leaper: in scala you don't have pointers but you have to deal with a LOT more complexity in the type system… I wouldn't say you'd get a great deal if you're looking to minimize complexity
[05:14:53] <strcat> scala still has reference types, they're pointers in all but name
[05:14:55] <dbaupp> leaper: the point of using Rust is the precise memory control, i.e. using pointers/using not-pointers (putting this on the stack) where appropriate. so yes, if someone wants to avoid that, then Haskell/whatever is more appropriate
[05:15:05] <Sharp> Are there any languages that don't have pointers?  I honestly can't think of any.
[05:15:18] <Sharp> Maybe some toy language?
[05:15:28] <dbaupp> depends what you mean by "pointers"
[05:15:30] <strcat> Sharp: well when a language uses mostly immutable data it's basically an implementation detail
[05:15:32] <tikue_> i mean, rust doesn't allow you to do pointer arithmetic even in unsafe blocks right?
[05:15:55] <Sharp> strcat: I don't think so, e.g. closures can't live on the stack.
[05:15:59] <strcat> but in for example python, it's transparent that every object is a pointer type
[05:16:16] <strcat> Sharp: haskell doesn't have a call stack
[05:16:24] <dbaupp> tikue_: yes it does
[05:16:30] <tautologico> yes, if the language allows free mutability and aliasing you can always observe the nature of references as pointers
[05:16:31] <tikue_> dbaupp: don't you have to cast to an int first?
[05:16:37] <benh> tikue_: in unsafe blocks you can work with raw pointers and use std::ptr::offset or something

[05:17:42] <benh> just parrotting what i've been told when i asked about it a while back ;)
[05:17:43] <dbaupp> Sharp: on the heap
[05:18:01] <benh> recursion is kinda weird in Haskell anyway with lazy evaluation

[05:18:11] <Sharp> dbaupp: If you store stuff on the heap, and you allow arbitrary recursion, you kind of need pointers...
[05:18:16] <strcat> Sharp: environment frames and a call stack don't really make much sense when you're talking about a lazy language

[05:18:57] <tautologico> Sharp: I think the idea is that the implementation  uses pointers, but as user you can't observe it if you're dealing only with immutable data
[05:19:03] <Sharp> I do see what you guys are getting at

[05:29:16] <Sharp> tautologico: Hm.  So I guess even Haskell has "real" pointers then.
[05:29:43] <tautologico> Sharp: sure… in any non-trivial case
[05:29:56] <tautologico> unsafePerformIO still is used a lot
[05:30:12] <dbaupp> tautologico: that's implementation-specific unsafe ops though, right?
[05:30:38] <tautologico> if you want to have a bit of fun take a look at the Haskell programs in the computer language shootout, they're completely unrecognizable as haskell programs, so low-level 
[05:30:52] <dbaupp> (i.e. you can say "GHC has real pointers", but you can't say Haskell has them, in general.)
[05:31:01] <Sharp> As far as I can tell, every program designed to win a performance benchmark looks like C
[05:31:08] <tautologico> so Haskell people can point to the shootout results and say haskell has good performance… yeah you can, but if you write haskell as if it were C :)
[05:31:17] <benh> Are we pretending the FFI bits still aren't part of the Haskell report ;)
[05:31:39] <strcat> it has them in the same sense that rust has data races, buffer overflows, and so on
[05:31:57] <Sharp> Which is why I think benchmarks on not-real programs are kind of silly, unless you are absolutely determined or required for some reason to do everything in one language
[05:32:13] <tautologico> yeah, technically FFI and unsafePerformIO are not part of the core, standard language

[05:50:00] <tikue_> Sharp: that's not what I was arguing.
[05:50:16] <sanxiyn> Sharp: But the question of what is a natural easy to read human understandable way to write something, is not silly

[05:51:08] <Sharp> That's an opinion :P  It may well be correct, of course, but it's just an opinion.
[05:51:35] <Sharp> Mutation makes analyzing code difficult in many cases.
[05:51:40] <sanxiyn> Sharp: Sure, our understanding of human-computer interface research is insufficient to argue one way or the other in complete confidence
[05:51:55] <sanxiyn> Sharp: But that doesn't mean only theory-of-computation argument is relevant for PL
[05:52:01] <Sharp> That's something I can say factually.  That's why LLVM puts code in SSA.
[05:52:06] <sanxiyn> human-computer-interface argument is equally relevant
[05:52:14] <tautologico> it's also dangerous to say that such style is more "natural"… it may be so, but it may be only a product of how programmers are trained
[05:52:21] <leaper> the path for mine is that first, fast development, then optimized for performance and maintain the code and add more code, in this long course, I prefer one lanuage to switching. my question is：is Rust designed for this? what is the disadvantage of Rust?
[05:52:25] <sanxiyn> Sharp: LLVM is not really human friendly UI
[05:52:28] <tautologico> OO people especially like to say that OO is more "natural" to the human mind

[05:52:49] <sanxiyn> tautologico: That doesn't mean you can ignore UI aspect of PL in discussion of PL
[05:52:52] <sanxiyn> That is also very dangerous
[05:53:05] <Sharp> But I *have* found that very young programmers get very confused by variable reassignment, and that if you only do it when it's necessary it can result in clearer code.

[05:57:16] <tikue_> i just don't see why we're being so black and white about this >_<
[05:57:21] <Sharp> As far as ease of reading goes?  HCI stuff?  I don't think there's any evidence either way.
[05:57:21] <tikue_> it's nonsense all of it
[05:57:24] <sanxiyn> (This also seems to be the result of HTDP authors)
[05:57:57] <Sharp> I could be wrong of course, I just don't get the sense that people even have meaningful measures of productivity in software engineering
[05:58:02] <Sharp> Which makes analysis of this nature difficult.
[05:58:13] <sanxiyn> Sharp: Difficult but necessary
[05:58:46] <sanxiyn> I try to follow research on how to measure PL's effect on software engineering
[05:59:12] <sanxiyn> Sharp: For example, it seems to be possible to assert that subroutine is a good idea in HCI way
[05:59:41] <Sharp> Subroutine in what sense?  In the sense of "don't make your entire program a nested mass of jumps and labels"?
[06:00:10] <sanxiyn> yes
[06:00:15] <sanxiyn> Also GC seems to help productivity
[06:00:23] <sanxiyn> Let me dredge up the reference on that
[06:00:32] <Sharp> Sure, I'll buy that.  Those programs are easier to analyze as well, though :P
[06:01:03] <Sharp> GC could easily help productivity, but how much of it is GC and how much of it is the removal of boilerplate?
[06:01:34] <Sharp> I tend to find that HCI studies are underpowered or fail to adjust for relatively simple things (how much is the feature, how much the implementation).

[06:13:05] <tautologico> the theory yes, mostly
[06:13:25] <Sharp> But yes, there is nonmath, and most of it ties back to the fact that there are actual people writing the programs as well as physical machines running them.
[06:13:44] <tautologico> but software development is definitely an engineering activity, even if our current soft.eng. methods aren't up to par with the "engineering" label
[06:14:05] <Sharp> And the former in particular has not received nearly enough real scientific study.
[06:14:12] <tikue_> math cannot be reduces to logic.
[06:14:31] <Sharp> To be clear, I like math.  A lot :)  But it's not science.
[06:14:36] <Sharp> Nor is it trying to be.
[06:14:41] <tikue_> if not science, then what, Sharp?
[06:14:52] <tautologico> you can argue about that, but it doesn't need to be a science
[06:15:07] <tikue_> like the other sciences, math has theories
[06:15:08] <dbaupp> tikue_: "math cannot be reduced to logic" ... isn't that exactly what maths is, fundamentally?
[06:15:12] <Sharp> Science is about testing out models in the real world.  You form a hypothesis, test it, and then use the data to refine your model or propose a new one that fits the new data.
[06:15:13] <tikue_> dbaupp: no
[06:15:16] <Sharp> That's not how math works, at all.
[06:15:19] <tikue_> godel's incompleteness theorem would say otherwise
[06:15:19] <Sharp> It's completely different.

[06:15:43] <tikue_> heh
[06:16:06] <Sharp> But science really is fairly well-defined and it isn't math.  That doesn't make math bad.  Math can give us absolute truths (usually :P) which science never can.

[06:19:30] <Sharp> Right, which means either there are true but unprovable statements in that system, or there are statements in that system that are both true and false.  So, there's an element of faith in trusting anything in that system :P
[06:19:38] <tautologico> considering we don't want inconsistent theories, you'd have to accept that there are truths out there you can't prove… and that there are more "unprovable" things than provable things

[06:52:01] <Sharp> You mentioned the LHC...
[06:52:04] <tautologico> the LHC itself is engineering… the experiments performed on it are science
[06:52:05] <tikue_> yes....
[06:52:08] <Sharp> I have to imagine you were talking about building the LHC.
[06:52:11] <Sharp> Yes, exactly, tautologico
[06:52:20] <Sharp> I'm suspecting that tautologico and I are in vigorous agreement.
[06:52:34] <sanxiyn> I thought building LHC would include designing LHC?
[06:52:37] <Sharp> sanxiyn: Experiments usually include a section called methods which describes the process needed to collect the data
[06:52:47] <tikue_> i really don't understand what point you both are trying to make. it seems abundantly obvious that the LHC serves a scientific purpose.
[06:53:01] <Sharp> But it's usually done by different people than those doing the science.  There are even subdivisions in the lab--you have your lab technicians and your researchers.
[06:53:25] <tikue_> the whole of it is a scientific endeavor. you seem opposed to looking at things holistically?

[06:56:11] <Sharp> Because I acknowledged that some things have multiple parts?  I'm lost here.
[06:56:25] <tikue_> you're categorizing all of machine learning as not done rigorously 
[06:56:32] <Sharp> "Often."
[06:56:37] <Sharp> Not always.
[06:56:49] <tikue_> you're filing a complaint on machine learning in general.
[06:57:02] <Sharp> I think machine learning is a fantastic idea that is often poorly implemented.
[06:57:11] <Sharp> I do not think it's an unfixable problem.
[06:57:12] <tikue_> can you be more specific?
[06:57:17] <Sharp> I was specific several times before.
[06:57:25] <Sharp> I find that great statistical techniques are used inappropriately.
[06:57:36] <tikue_> that's not specific
[06:57:40] <Sharp> That people do not set up their experiments in ways that are likely to yield them accurate results.
[06:57:44] <tikue_> that's not specific
[06:58:09] <tikue_> really, I want to know what led to you forming this opinion. I understand what your opinion is quite clearly
[06:58:11] <Sharp> …That people will greatly underpower their experiments and then try hundreds of different models until one fits, not realizing that statistical significance is not meaningful in that situation.
[06:58:12] <Sharp> I mean
[06:58:20] <Sharp> I can keep getting more and more specific if you like
[06:58:51] <tautologico> what do you think about epidemiology then? :)
[06:58:56] <Sharp> I think it's mostly terrible.
[06:58:57] <tikue_> i'm asking for specific examples of this, because that's really what matters. I can tell you that I've had quite a different experience from you, but without specifics what does it matter?
[06:59:35] <tautologico> http://www.niss.org/sites/default/files/Young_Safety_June_2008.pdf
[07:00:41] <Sharp> I have seen 80 variables applied in different combinations to a sample of about 10,000 data points drawn as a heavily biased sample from the general public. Without adjusting for the multivariate effect, a model was created on the basis of trying to use every single model to predict the behavior of a single binary variable using logistic regression.
[07:00:49] <Sharp> Is that specific enough for you?
[07:02:02] <Sharp> *every single variable
[07:02:34] <tikue_> Sharp: so are you taking issue with logistic regression?
[07:02:44] <Sharp> No, I'm taking issue with the inappropriate use of logistic regression.
[07:02:44] <tikue_> that sounds like badly applied machine learning, but not at all the science of machine learning
[07:02:55] <Sharp> …Correct.
[07:03:04] <tikue_> but we're talking about machine learning as a science
[07:03:07] <Sharp> Are you perhaps arguing with something I didn't say?  I never said there was anything inherently wrong with machine learning techniques
[07:03:16] <Sharp> I said that I felt they were poorly applied.
[07:03:20] <tikue_> you took issue with the "science" side of computer science, so i'm trying to get down to the science aspects
[07:03:41] <Sharp> …I take issue with the "science" side for the same reasons I take issue with, say, evolutionary psychology.
[07:03:57] <tikue_> i'm not sure i follow
[07:04:03] <Sharp> Because I don't think it's done rigorously and therefore many of the conclusions are questionable.
[07:04:09] <Sharp> Not because I think science is bad.
[07:04:14] <tautologico> ew, evolutionary psychology :)
[07:04:29] <tikue_> Sharp: right, so I've asked you to explain what you don't think is done rigorously when it comes to the science.
[07:04:39] <sanxiyn> Sharp: Well some of evolutionary psychology is well done :)
[07:04:42] <Sharp> …I just did.  I really have no idea what you're asking for.
[07:04:48] <tikue_> and you gave an example of logistic logression being applied badly
[07:04:56] <tikue_> that doesn't really seem to be answering what i'm asking
[07:05:17] <tikue_> the science part is the research part...the papers, etc.
[07:05:29] <tikue_> what's done with the science is of no consequence to the science itself
[07:05:32] <Sharp> ...
[07:05:36] <Sharp> Most of the papers are completely mathematical.
[07:05:53] <tikue_> Sharp: so then what do you categorize as the science side of computer science?
[07:06:24] <Sharp> The actual experiments.  For example, a study of how people *actually* call functions in practice is science, not math.

[07:08:35] <Sharp> Nah.  A lot of practical performance-related stuff is empirical.

[07:09:34] <Sharp> But no attempt at further analysis.
[07:09:47] <Sharp> The only reason I consider it is because it actually informs a lot of engineering decisions.
[07:09:54] <tikue_> does it?
[07:09:57] <Sharp> We certainly use our benchmark results to inform decisions in Rust.
[07:10:02] <sanxiyn> tikue_: Yes
[07:10:14] <tikue_> fair enough.
[07:10:40] <tikue_> at the same time, publication is something the rust team has been interested in, afaik

[07:11:34] <Sharp> I'm glad.  I hope they succeed.  And like I said--I don't think there's any fundamental reason *why* the science can't be just as good as the math.  I just think that in practice, it often isn't, which is disappointing.

[07:38:49] <tikue_> sure
[07:38:52] <tikue_> :)
[07:39:36] <ski>   The term "flexibility" is usually used to denote the existence of a range of choices available to a programmer or implementor -- the more choices, the greater the flexibility.  Flexibility is sometimes referred to as "generality".
[07:39:59] <ski>   Because it is frequently presented in the desirable terms, "delaying binding of virtual objects to their realizations", increased flexibility has generally been considered a fatted calf of great succulence, sought voraciously and in the hope that the increased complexity that invariably attends it can be kept under control.
[07:40:12] <ski>   In recent years, the wisdom of this quest has been called into question, for flexibility without discipline appears contrary to the plans of the god of reliability.
[07:40:19] <ski>   (An automobile with independent steering mechanisms for both front wheels is more flexible but less disciplined than an ordinary one.  It is mainly of metaphysical interest. offensive to the god of safe highways.)

[07:43:44] <Sharp> Or just reliability?  Or safety?
[07:44:26] <ski> (by which i mean the ease by which one can (*locally*) *reason* about code, deducing properties (such as preserving invariants), or refactoring it)
[07:44:53] <tikue_> i would agree with that
[07:45:07] <Sharp> I think anyone in #rust probably agrees that this is a reasonable ask :P
[07:45:08] <tikue_> was that really what he was arguing for though?
[07:45:28] <ski> not directly
[07:46:45] <Sharp> I would probably use reliability more in a sysop sense, e.g. database constraints guarantee referential integrity.  Actually databases have a lot of great examples of situations where flexibility is sacrificed for strong safety guarantees.

[10:07:35] <hoelzro> I'm writing a blog post about my experiences with Rust, and I wanted to point to another blog post I read a while ago but can't seem to find =(
[10:08:09] <hoelzro> it had something in it about why contributing to Rust itself was a fun task, because you are constantly keeping up with the latest revision of the language
[10:08:18] <hoelzro> if that rings any bells with anyone, please send me a link =)
[10:08:30] <dbaupp> do you happen to remember who wrote it? (cmr?)
[10:08:41] <hoelzro> that sounds right

[19:02:34] <kmc> sfackler: yeah that's what we want for Servo, and I might start implementing it, but I was wondering if someone else has already done it or what else is out there
[19:02:46] <kmc> it's only about 500 lines of C code: https://github.com/efficient/libcuckoo
[19:02:55] <kmc> so I think reimplementing in Rust rather than binding to this library is probably the way to go
[19:03:19] <jason_> i'll check it out. i've been implementing some concurrent data structures in Rust
[19:03:27] <kmc> cool
[19:04:00] <jason_> i was thinking about doing a java style stripped lock concurent hash map also, but this looks more interesting
[19:04:20] <kmc> striped locks? yeah this has those too

[19:11:11] <kmc> that's a good question

[23:18:35] <jdm> right

[23:20:02] <acrichto> jdm: so https://github.com/joyent/libuv/blob/master/include/uv.h#L1376 is that libuv provides us

[23:20:20] <acrichto> do you want both of these to go to the same pipe?
[23:20:30] <jdm> right
[23:20:36] <acrichto> but you don't want the pipe to be the terminal stdout
[23:20:37] <jdm> it's like 2>&1
[23:20:39] <acrichto> you want it to be a libuv pipe
[23:20:45] <acrichto> or rather you want to read the contents in rust
[23:20:49] <jdm> yes
[23:20:58] <acrichto> hm, so you are correct in that there is no way to do that tonday
[23:21:00] <acrichto> today*
[23:21:12] <acrichto> it can be done with libuv, we can't express that in rust

[23:21:35] <acrichto> I was having difficulty exposing a safe interface to creating stdout handles for the child, and I think that what I came up with is a bit limiting
[23:21:55] <acrichto> I initially had the idea of an "unbound pipe" which you would then pass in, but that wouldn't quite work here because two slots need to own it
[23:22:14] <acrichto> jdm: perhaps another StdioContainer could be "PipeTo(int idx)"
[23:22:30] <acrichto> which means that the output should be piped to the previous pipe defined at I/O slot N

[23:26:05] <acrichto> that would be 100000000 times useful in testing
[23:26:41] <acrichto> dbaupp: you'd basically give ownership of a Writer to the task, and then somehow you'd get that back out at some point

[23:27:01] <acrichto> eh, we can live with stdout for now

[23:27:16] <dbaupp> (hence the use of prefect :P )

[23:27:24] <dbaupp> *perfect
[23:27:31] <dbaupp> doesn't that require stderr?
[23:27:47] <acrichto> it would require capturing both println and the logger output

[23:28:06] <dbaupp> but, yeah, also, having a twosided writer/reader stream so you can read as the capture output as the other task executes would be cool.
[23:28:08] <acrichto> but normal usage of logging macros and print/println should go to the same sink in testing
[23:28:15] <dbaupp> don't the fail!() messages go to stderr?
[23:28:27] <acrichto> right now yes, but that's kinda a separate bug
[23:28:31] <acrichto> they should go to the task's logger
[23:28:37] <acrichto> and in theory the logger and stdout handle should be the same thing
[23:28:42] <acrichto> not quite sure...
