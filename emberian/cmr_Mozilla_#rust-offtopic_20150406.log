[02:14:38] <XMPPwocky> so
[02:15:25] <XMPPwocky> http://codon.com/images/consider-static-typing/region-of-abysmal-pain
[02:16:01] <XMPPwocky> there's another region of abysmal pain, though: the set of programs that the programmer *thinks* should type-check, but actually don't
[02:17:17] <XMPPwocky> in other words, it may be acceptable to accept fewer working programs (or more non-working programs), IF it makes the typechecker simpler to think about
[02:17:57] <XMPPwocky> this is my concern with something like Nim, where there's like this whole automated theorem proving system going on for thread safety
[02:18:33] <XMPPwocky> thinking about Rust's borrow checker is already sort of tricky, i can't imagine trying to guess what an ATP would accept
[02:19:05] <tiffany> oh
[02:19:30] <tiffany> I guess that's the main reason high level languages don't run into this issue as often
[02:19:41] <tiffany> well no
[02:19:52] <tiffany> they push more things into slow magic, and that probably accounts for most of it
[02:20:07] <tiffany> I don't have to think about lifetimes or allocations or even time cost when writing haskell
[02:20:20] <Yurume> and that always bites you
[02:20:21] <tiffany> I just accept that this code will be abysmally inefficient

[02:21:51] <XMPPwocky> the extreme case of this is a language that magically knows which programs "work", but rejects programs at random based on a hash of their contents and the phase of the moon

[02:26:53] <Yurume> <off-off-topic> I'm tired of opinions that dot-completion in C++ is good (no matter what it actually claims); in my codebase, VC++ messes up with its internal database (approximately) every day.

[05:29:12] <lahwran> for instance, line wrapping only just barely made it into gnome-terminal
[05:29:18] <cmr> mm
[05:29:20] <lahwran> and I only know this because I looked up the bug
[05:29:23] <Kingsquee> Yurume: how about program that strings together unix applications to do repetitive tasks that you demonstrate a few times? :D
[05:29:23] <lahwran> err
[05:29:24] <hoverbear> cmr:  Console
[05:29:25] <lahwran> rewrapping
[05:29:27] <hoverbear> cmr: Konsole*
[05:29:28] <geofft> someone once ranted on debian-devel about how the JVM was bad for security because Java applets keep having sandbox escapes 
[05:29:40] <geofft> I'm not sure anyone managed to convey the distinction to them 
[05:29:50] <Yurume> Kingsquee: that makes me sour...
[05:29:59] <lahwran> Yurume++
[05:30:03] <Kingsquee> pls
[05:30:06] <lahwran> the unix tools work, but we can improve on them
[05:30:12] <lahwran> they really kind of suck
[05:30:15] <lahwran> they haven't gotten worse
[05:30:15] <Yurume> I *can* do that, but I feel that's ridiculously contrived way to do things
[05:30:18] <lahwran> the bar has gotten higher
[05:30:20] <Yurume> yeah
[05:30:33] <Kingsquee> you could even have it auto-detect when we're doing something repetitive and suggest a way to help! 
[05:30:37] <Kingsquee> give it a cute penguin gui!
[05:30:41] <Yurume> lol
[05:30:47] <XMPPwocky> i think part of it is that unix tools are a local maximum of goodness, thanks to various network effects
[05:30:54] <XMPPwocky> i.e. almost all small deviations make things worse
[05:30:57] <lahwran> hahahaha that's a realm of AI we haven't touched yet, Kingsquee
[05:31:03] <lahwran> XMPPwocky: somewhat
[05:31:05] <scott> that's MS clippy
[05:31:10] <lahwran> no
[05:31:12] <Kingsquee> lahwran: touched once, never to touch again
[05:31:14] <Yurume> yeah, a particularly good local maximum created in the era of stupid machines.
[05:31:18] <Kingsquee> like eugenics
[05:31:20] <scott> aka the best idea ever
[05:31:21] <lahwran> ms clippy didn't have anything like what it'd take
[05:31:34] <Yurume> now we have much more smart machines...
[05:31:39] <lahwran> ms clippy was a failure because it was too simple and triggered too easily and didn't have semantic understanding of what you were doing
[05:31:48] <lahwran> you could probably do ms clippy now, with modern ML
[05:31:53] <lahwran> but you couldn't do what Kingsquee proposed
[05:31:57] <lahwran> that's too deep
[05:32:01] <Kingsquee> lahwran: I dunno
[05:32:08] *** Joins: johnsoft (johnsoft@moz-69mrig.res.rr.com)
[05:32:09] <Kingsquee> it's the descriptive part that's hard
[05:32:15] <lahwran> and eugenics is a stupid variation on a good idea: let's take control of our genetics
[05:32:33] <Kingsquee> but I think it could be done
[05:32:34] <lahwran> which is kind of what I'm saying, we need non-stupid variations on good ideas
[05:32:44] <Kingsquee> yes
[05:32:48] <lahwran> I've heard an urban legend that clippy started with better ml
[05:32:55] <lahwran> and was ruined by someone wanting it to trigger more
[05:32:57] <Kingsquee> but everyone remembers the stupid variation and never want to touch it again
[05:32:58] <scott> if it's not clear, my 'aka the best idea ever' wasn't about eugenics. my internet dropped and I'm not sure where that message landed :P
[05:33:14] <lahwran> scott: it was extremely unclear
[05:33:20] <lahwran> 4-5 11:31.14pm <Yurume> yeah, a particularly good local maximum created in the era of stupid machines.
[05:33:20] <lahwran> 4-5 11:31.18pm <Kingsquee> like eugenics
[05:33:20] <lahwran> 4-5 11:31.20pm <scott> aka the best idea ever
[05:33:28] <lahwran> oops, didn't mean to copy Yurume's message
[05:33:29] <scott> ow
[05:33:37] <Kingsquee> hahaha
[05:33:50] <lahwran> the timing was plausible, too
[05:33:56] <Yurume> oh lol
[05:34:03] <lahwran> if it had been a half-second, I would have assumed it was for something before
[05:34:05] <lahwran> but as it was I wasn't sure

[11:59:43] <bombless> I guess normally I should implement Debug ... but sometimes it's not totally an error, but some info. In that case Debug output should be different from the default formatting method, I guess.

[16:12:51] <tiffany> mrmonday: that's a pattern found in aviation systems, having a single huge function
[16:13:31] <tiffany> it actually does have benefits, like there being forward-only control flow which is somewhat easier to reason about, and the only state you have is that which is put on the stack before the start of the loop
[16:13:50] <mrmonday> sure, I did a safety critical systems course, it's super interesting
[16:14:04] *** Joins: Rym (y@moz-u53hjs.range86-189.btcentralplus.com)
[16:14:09] <tiffany> yeah, it is interesting
[16:14:22] <tiffany> also sillesta, that's what graydon said
[16:14:43] <mrmonday> they also typically disallow most of the functionality I've used in that rather large function ;)
[16:14:47] <tiffany> it is possible it's not the original reason for the name, or the only one
[16:15:04] <mrmonday> nearly finished my huge refactoring of it now, it's looking far nicer
[16:15:27] <tiffany> I think I got to 6 indent levels once in rust
[16:15:30] <tiffany> no, 7
[16:15:43] <mrmonday> it's really easy to do if you're writing functional code with pattern matching
[16:15:48] <tiffany> yeah
[16:16:04] <mrmonday> 2 match statements in a function and you're already at 5 levels of indentation
[16:16:11] <tiffany> I also deal with a codebase which has these 2000 line long procedures which indent so many times that the original developers started indenting backwards
[16:16:59] <mrmonday> ahaha
[16:17:00] <mrmonday> wow
[16:17:16] <tiffany> they did not have sincere aviation goals while writing those procedures, I can assure you
[16:17:21] <mrmonday> my rule of thumb is that it's too long if I can't see the whole function without scrolling
[16:17:58] <mrmonday> which is obviously highly dependent on the number of vertical pixels on whatever screen I'm using at that time
[16:18:26] *** Quits: Rym (y@moz-u53hjs.range86-189.btcentralplus.com) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[16:18:30] <tiffany> and font size
[16:18:34] <tiffany> and editor margins
[16:18:50] <tiffany> I don't really have a rule of thumb
[16:19:00] <tiffany> if it gets too far rightwardly indented I might make a new function
[16:19:53] <tiffany> there are two main reasons why this codebase has 2000 long line procedures, neither of which I would succumb to in a new codebase: they have a huge amount of boilerplate, as well as a huge amount of copy and pasted segments
[16:20:07] <tiffany> new functions are kind of an ordeal to add if you don't have goto definition
[16:20:14] <tiffany> since it makes it spaghetti to navigate
[16:20:22] <tiffany> most of the files are around 10 000 lines long
[16:20:40] <GaryOak_> once you have to use a find to move around between methods
[16:21:38] <mrmonday> most decent editors have a primitive goto definition which I've found good enough for working my way around a codebase
[16:21:48] <tiffany> emacs uses M-. which looks up from a tags file
[16:22:10] <mrmonday> does that not do the trick?
[16:22:18] <tiffany> it's what I use

[16:46:08] <Astrum|Lap> let the language wars begin!
[16:46:25] <proc> Astrum|Lap: not another one
[16:46:49] <Astrum|Lap> actually that's more likely to spawn lots of corrections from experts in each language
[16:46:51] <proc> yet another useless benchmark
[16:46:54] <Astrum|Lap> there's already a java complaint
[16:47:20] <proc> java does perform quite well
[16:47:21] <Astrum|Lap> but benchmarks are so fun!
[16:47:23] <proc> as backend
[16:48:27] <proc> I'll not use go because of GC & google & I want real lowcode in the end, java: I'm already using it as backend, like twitter does
[16:48:39] <proc> but rust does provide things like stdout reading per line etc..
[16:50:04] <Astrum|Lap> I don't really care about the benchmark tbh
[16:50:25] <Astrum|Lap> I just enjoy when they come up
[16:50:34] <Astrum|Lap> I've done similar things
[16:50:49] <Astrum|Lap> do X in language Y idiomatically
[16:51:33] <proc> let's say I like the benchmark, rust wins & C# looses ;D
[16:53:07] <Astrum|Lap> some day I might learn D... but I'm just so underwhelmed by it
[16:54:37] <proc> Astrum|Lap: I'm missing the handcraftet assembler example, for a generic cpu ^^
[16:54:55] <proc> It would be very interesting how much could be gained through that

[19:18:19] <sillesta> i don't eat bacon :p
[19:18:28] <tiffany> infinite bacon kind of implies a universe where there is some law of physics that allows you to summon bacon from the æther
[19:18:31] <fmtq> I don't eat tyres and I still know where rubber comes from.
[19:18:34] <fmtq> so.
[19:18:40] <tiffany> and does not necessarily imply being made from pigs

[19:19:13] <tiffany> unless, of course
[19:19:16] <fmtq> holy shit though I could just cook some of the bacon I own in the mean time.
[19:19:21] <tiffany> the bacon is summoned from a parallel universe consisting entirely of pigs
[19:19:25] <tiffany> which is a kind of horrifying thought
[19:19:32] <fmtq> oh my god I enjoy that 
[19:19:40] <sillesta> well, i'm not really sure what animal beef comes from
[19:19:44] <fmtq> it is just infinitely densely packed pigs
[19:19:55] <fmtq> sillesta: surely you are just trolling.

[19:20:31] <sillesta> swedish
[19:20:34] <tiffany> sillesta: beef comes from cows
[19:20:39] <fmtq> nötkott 
[19:20:52] <tiffany> english kind of took multiple loan words for different animals, and they took on different meanings
[19:21:05] <tiffany> beef usually specifically refers to the meat of a cow, or to a cow which will be used for its meat
[19:21:14] <fmtq> missed an umlaut but getting there
[19:21:21] <fmtq> nötkött 
[19:21:26] <tiffany> oh, I forgot about that too
[19:21:31] <tiffany> cow is the female, bull is the male
[19:21:32] <fmtq> chicken = kyckling, bacon = bacon
[19:21:42] <tiffany> and bovine is the actual animal, but usually cow is used as a synonym for bovine
[19:21:44] <tiffany> I might be wrong
[19:21:55] <sillesta> well, chicken is a 1:1 of animal/meat
[19:22:37] <fmtq> tiffany: the reason it's french in origin for the "food" variant of an animal is because the French were the only ones who could afford it.
[19:22:47] <fmtq> so the produce is germanic, and the food is romance.
[19:23:00] <fmtq> the class divide exists in English to this day 
[19:23:06] <fmtq> chicken = poultry 
[19:23:35] <tiffany> I wonder if this means that americans have a higher than average tendency to forget that meat comes from animals that are being killed
[19:23:42] <tiffany> well, and other english speakers
[19:24:17] <fmtq> ahha that's a really interesting thought

[19:25:56] <tiffany> a universe made of pigs would rapidly condense into a sort of really fucked up star, I think

[19:28:43] <fmtq> oh god

[19:28:56] <tiffany> not very delicious, no
[19:28:56] <fmtq> why am I doing this to myself haha
[19:29:15] <fmtq> deliciousness is subjective, tiffany
[19:29:23] <fmtq> and the highly dense pork star is going into my belly.
[19:29:28] <tiffany> the very center would rapidly start fusion reactions and very strange things would happen to the dead pigs
[19:29:49] <tiffany> also, assuming there is actually an infinite number of pigs, the star would never stop growing

[19:33:43] * fmtq actually had to study rocks once.
[19:33:54] <fmtq> nope.jpg
[19:34:07] <Astrum|Lap> a friend of mine took a lot of geology courses in uni
[19:34:15] <tiffany> it's rather interesting to me that by far the most common element in the earth's crust is oxygen
[19:34:26] <Astrum|Lap> he'll talk about it endlessly if you bring it up
[19:34:28] <tiffany> people are always arguing over how water managed to be a thing but like
[19:34:34] <Astrum|Lap> kind of like how I'll talk about math endlessly if someone brings it up
[19:34:37] <tiffany> oxygen is extremely common in the rocky parts of our solar system
[19:34:42] <tiffany> and hydrogen is the most common element in the universe
[19:34:49] <tiffany> and water naturally precipitates from mixing the two
[19:34:58] <tiffany> afaik, anyway
[19:35:14] <Astrum|Lap> speaking of, my niece doesn't like math anymore
[19:35:37] <fmtq> ahah

[19:36:17] <tiffany> oh
[19:36:25] <fmtq> I do not like it because it does not like me
[19:36:29] <tiffany> so all she knows about is having arithmetic skills drilled into her brain
[19:36:33] <tiffany> like addition
[19:36:35] <fmtq> the standard notations don't work well with my brain so I struggle.
[19:36:39] <tiffany> and nobody has told her that negative numbers exist yet
[19:36:58] <tiffany> I remember when I was in first grade and I realised that negative numbers were a thing, and my teacher told me to not mention them to not scare the students
[19:37:00] <Astrum|Lap> to some extent, though I tried to get her excited about it when I was living in vegas
[19:37:15] <Astrum|Lap> you remember first grade? wow
[19:37:23] <fmtq> I remember first grade
[19:37:24] <reem> tiffany: haha something very similar happened to me
[19:37:25] <Astrum|Lap> but anyway, I taught her various shapes
[19:37:29] <fmtq> but not second to 12th

[19:38:42] <fmtq> there has never been an answer
[19:38:45] <fmtq> I don't think anybody knows why 
[19:38:50] <Astrum|Lap> I have some vague memories of the first grade
[19:38:53] <fmtq> it's a conspiracy against the children 
[19:38:56] <tiffany> I liked the keyboarding class I took in high school
[19:38:58] <fmtq> to make us hate the arts
[19:39:52] <Astrum|Lap> I do remember my dad was teaching me algebra in the 3rd/4th grade
[19:40:27] <tiffany> so it looks like hydrogen and oxygen do actually bond into water if you put them together
