[01:28:58] <tiffany> the equivalent in xml is making a schema with a new tag type for everything
[01:29:23] <tiffany> sqlite is nice, you can't corrupt your data files by crashing/power failure mid-save
[01:29:50] <kmcguire> right i remember reading nosql suffers right now from not having that kind of transaction reversal/commit type thing
[01:29:51] <tiffany> sql databases force you to normalise your data though, and that puts people off
[01:29:53] <tiffany> but it's usually a good thing
[01:30:11] <kmcguire> yea the normalization of my data is a problem
[01:30:25] <tiffany> why is that?
[01:31:07] <kmcguire> well i have a sort depth graph for each thing i need to store, where each node of the graph has parameters and then links to other nodes, the parameters each have a normalized structure of fields low, high, value, precision though
[01:31:17] <kmcguire> i dunno.. maybe it is normalizable
[01:31:54] <kmcguire> obviously it is.. just the work
[01:31:54] <tiffany> store each node in a table with a unique ID, store the links as IDs to other nodes
[01:32:24] <tiffany> if each parameter is truly independently optional, that will be problematic, but you can just let the fields be null if you want
[01:32:40] <tiffany> but it seems more likely that you can accumulate parameters into groups, and store each group as its own table, with references into the node table
[01:33:24] <tiffany> were you eyeing nosql as in something like mongodb, then? rather than something like redis
[01:34:38] <kmcguire> i seen redis, but do not know about mongodb, and im really thinking i would be wasting the power of nosql
[01:34:53] <tiffany> there is not much power to be had

[01:35:41] <tiffany> you can get equivalent functionality to redis by just making a table of keys to values, with the keys being arbitrary data types and the values being blobs

[01:36:08] <tiffany> all of the parameters have those exact 3 fields?
[01:36:12] <kmcguire> yes

[07:10:41] <Amaranth> "A marker trait indicates a type that can be reflected over. This trait is implemented for all types."
[07:10:51] <eddyb> except you can opt out of it :P

[07:11:44] <Amaranth> I could see not implementing it because it doesn't make sense but if it's automatically implemented for _every_ type then it seems to make sense for every type to have it

[07:12:42] <eddyb> but really, the trick is that the bound propagates to wherever you've got a concrete type
[07:12:47] <tomaka> Why does fixing "image" require changing "trait Pixel" to "trait Pixel: Reflect"?
[07:12:48] <eddyb> preserving some parametricity
[07:12:54] <tomaka> even though "image" doesn't use TypeOf or anything
[07:12:58] <eddyb> tomaka: that's weird
[07:13:00] <Amaranth> I'm just confused as to why part of the language was shoved out to a marker type when every type still implements it by default and there is no point to not implementing it
[07:13:04] <eddyb> tomaka: does it use Any?
[07:13:19] <tomaka> a search in the source code doesn't find anything for Any or TypeOf
[07:13:24] <eddyb> Amaranth: so you can't use Any behind the scenes

[07:14:11] <eddyb> lel
[07:14:21] <tomaka> yeah it seems to use TypeId >_>
[07:14:34] <eddyb> someone was proposing bounding size_of and align_of in such a way
[07:14:59] <eddyb> at least the former is just stupid: you can obtain the value through pointer arithmetic

[08:24:50] <rsaarelm> I wonder if 30 years from now we're going to have a few fragmentary Rust projects around, and no way for crazy retroists to build them because the third party crate infrastructure bitrotted to oblivion long ago and some of the required packages are lost. A proper archival copy of a project should probably include snapshots of all the dependencies too somehow.
[08:25:18] <cha0s> Moz could (possibly) host a read-only copy of all the stuff that's needed on gh, and it's just a mirror for when gh dies for whatever reason
[08:25:44] <rsaarelm> Of course everything from pre-1.0 era is going to be utterly unbuildable anyway unless the rustc version history is available somewhere so that you can build old compiler versions.
[08:25:45] <cha0s> and the tools, like cargo, could use it as a backup as well
[08:26:07] <cha0s> then fallback to local if that fails too (e.g. no internet)

[22:46:41] <XMPPwocky> tomaka: so i can't build glium on windows and it's very confusing why. i think rust ships some library named "kernel32" with it now
[22:46:54] <XMPPwocky> and that clashes with the winapi-rs crate of the same name
