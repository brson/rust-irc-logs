[01:20:18] <bjz_> make a new channel?
[01:20:19] <cmr> You join a channel and if it doesn't exist it's created.
[01:20:23] <bjz_> ohh
[01:20:25] <bjz_> hehe
[01:20:40] <benh> but then you gotta talk to a bot to cement your claim to the channel!!
[01:20:49] <bjz_> ahh
[01:20:52] <cmr> I'm going to be writing pong and asteroids as demos for the open source labs here.
[01:21:04] <JesseH> I'm thinking along the lines more of an engine.
[01:21:11] <cmr> I also have a cool game idea that I don't have solid enough to talk about yet.
[01:21:13] <JesseH> Like the LÖVE framework for Lua
[01:21:25] <bjz_> I need to ge some procedural mountains working
[01:21:25] <cmr> JesseH: tiffany wants to port her intenselogic engine to rust
[01:21:37] <bjz_> http://voyager3.tumblr.com/image/17368756941
[01:21:39] <cmr> it's modular, so it'd be piece by piece.
[01:21:41] <Luqman> JesseH: i'm thinking of starting out with a simple tileengine
[01:21:54] <cmr> but it has a full deferred rendering engine right now.
[01:22:04] <bjz_> noice
[01:22:05] <dbaupp> cmr: it's on github?
[01:22:11] <JesseH> Oh yeah I've seen tiffany on freenode

[01:22:24] <cmr> ##codelab on freenode
[01:22:36] <cmr> she's a pretty cool person
[01:22:41] -concrete.mozilla.org- cmr invited tiffany into the channel.
[01:22:55] -concrete.mozilla.org- cmr invited doomlord_ into the channel.

[01:22:57] -concrete.mozilla.org- cmr invited jeaye into the channel.
[01:23:10] * dbaupp thought people only used C++ and Rust for game dev :P
[01:23:18] <bjz_> yeah
[01:23:19] <Luqman> it also seems to have lua scripting :D
[01:23:19] <benh> lua!
[01:23:22] <JesseH> \o/
[01:23:22] <bjz_> that's cool
[01:23:24] <JesseH> Lua <3
[01:23:24] *** Joins: tiffany (kawaii@moz-EB8B0C08.dhcp.embarqhsd.net)
[01:23:25] <benh> also at this point, javascript
[01:23:30] <bjz_> that's cool 75% C I mean
[01:23:33] <cmr> also <3 lua
[01:23:39] <cmr> lua is my secret love affair
[01:23:43] <JesseH> So its settled, we all like rust and lua :P
[01:23:55] <Luqman> angelscript is kinda nice too
[01:23:58] <tiffany> I've started rewriting the main binary of my engine in lua
[01:24:03] <tiffany> and found this: https://github.com/katis/apollo
[01:24:16] <tiffany> er, in rust*
[01:24:21] <JesseH> Neat
[01:24:22] <dbaupp> https://github.com/doy/rust-lua
[01:24:29] <JesseH> neat again
[01:24:30] <tiffany> I don't really love lua
[01:24:41] <tiffany> dbaupp: 6 months ago though?
[01:24:58] * bjz_ is not so sure about lua
[01:25:07] <benh> Kinda sad that everything that doesn't have a few "changed 2 days ago" or so entries on github is automatically out of date :)
[01:25:07] <dbaupp> tiffany: that was just the first result on google
[01:25:13] * dbaupp shoulda checked the date
[01:25:18] <tiffany> I could spend like an hour ranting about how awful it is
[01:25:24] <JesseH> lol
[01:25:27] <bjz_> :P
[01:25:31] <benh> two kinds of languages, etc 
[01:25:32] <JesseH> I could to, but we could do that about every language
[01:25:35] <tiffany> but there aren't really good alternatives
[01:25:41] <bjz_> mm
[01:25:47] <dbaupp> JesseH: pretty sure it's impossible to rant about Rust :P
[01:25:56] <tiffany> I have nothing bad to say about rust
[01:25:57] <JesseH> Oh yeah, forgot how perfect it is :P
[01:25:59] <benh> Clearly the thing to do is to embed javascript to piggyback on the servo efforts
[01:26:03] * bjz_ has a not so secret love affair with meta languages
[01:26:04] <Luqman> bjz_: weren't you writing a scheme like thing?
[01:26:11] <cmr> rusp!
[01:26:14] <bjz_> yeah
[01:26:29] <Luqman> should obviously use that instead :P
[01:26:29] <bjz_> kinda deadended when I got distracted though
[01:26:31] <JesseH> too many ()s sorry
[01:26:41] <JesseH> uncomfortable to type
[01:26:48] * bjz_ apologises to dbaupp
[01:26:56] <tiffany> I'm writing a lisp-like programming language
[01:27:02] <tiffany> I plan on having syntax frontends to avoid the ()s
[01:27:10] <bjz_> tiffany: yeah
[01:27:16] <Luqman> JesseH: hehe, i've kinda grown to like it after racket
[01:27:38] <JesseH> tiffany, I wrote a couple languages...they suck something major :D
[01:27:39] <bjz_> tiffany: that's what John Mcarthy was talking about, how he thought sexprs were unfinished :P
[01:27:51] * bjz_ thinks this is interesting: http://kittenlang.org/
[01:28:47] <JesseH> Gotta love that python-like syntax
[01:29:04] <JesseH> but two space tabs >:)
[01:29:04] <bjz_> JesseH: stack based ftw

[01:31:07] <bjz_> but yeah, need to get my graphics going first :)
[01:31:43] <bjz_> too much yak shaving
[01:34:02] <JesseH> Off topic: We need a 3d text editor
[01:34:17] <Luqman> how would that work?
[01:34:46] <JesseH> Error on line 1:5
[01:35:00] <JesseH> Line 1, 5th item in the "stack"
[01:35:07] * bjz_ thinks we need a 4d paint program
[01:35:30] <JesseH> I like
[01:40:51] <tiffany> bjz_, do you know if you can embed that easily?
[01:41:00] <bjz_> which
[01:41:04] <tiffany> kitten
[01:41:23] <bjz_> no
[01:41:29] <bjz_> you'd have to ask
[01:42:00] <bjz_> would be neat to have a go doing it in rust though, but I doubt they'd appreaciate a fork at this stage

[02:53:22] <cmr> I'm looking to build a pong and asteroids tech demo, and want the absolute simplest thing I can use for graphics.
[02:53:30] <cmr> (and windowing and input, of course)
[02:53:58] <cmr> tiffany suggest cairo, but the rust bindings are currently in a state of need-rewriting, and I can't get bindgen to play nice.
[02:54:26] <tiffany> also cairo does't do windowing
[02:54:27] <tiffany> pretty sure
[02:54:32] <cmr> it can render to an x window
[02:54:35] <tiffany> oh
[02:54:46] <cmr> would probably need to *get* the x window first, I imagine
[02:54:52] <Luqman> if it's just pong i don't think using straight opengl would be that bad :P

[04:54:32] <JesseH> I've been using things like the LOVE framework, throughout my game development history.

[04:55:44] <JesseH> Nope, never been on that side of murica before.
[04:55:53] <jeaye> Ohh, where are you?
[04:55:55] <JesseH> Might move down there one day

[04:56:28] <jeaye> Haven't spent much time in Georgia.
[04:56:33] <jeaye> Florida though
[04:57:05] <JesseH> Lots of old folks there.
[04:57:20] <jeaye> JesseH: You might have good luck with that kiss3d lib in the works.
[04:57:43] <jeaye> Looks like it'll make some game dev aspects a bit lighter weight.
[04:58:02] <jeaye> Though I wonder... what about some Lua bindings for Rust?
[04:58:03] <JesseH> Awesome
[04:58:10] <cmr> jeaye: already exist!
[04:58:11] <JesseH> There are some i think

[04:58:28] <jeaye> Nifty
[04:58:29] <cmr> https://github.com/katis/apollo
[04:58:37] <JesseH> Which one is the best, in your opinion cmr?
[04:58:59] <cmr> JesseH: no idea, only used the older one, but it'd need porting.
[04:59:04] <cmr> And this was months ago
[04:59:05] <cmr> So
[04:59:46] <jeaye> cmr: This channel was a brilliant idea.
[04:59:55] <cmr> It wasn't even my idea

[05:10:39] <jeaye> Saurbraten (sp?), tiffany?
[05:10:41] <JesseH> I think I've seen your nick on there.
[05:10:55] <JesseH> I used to play a long time ago ...
[05:11:14] <tiffany> I've played it ocassionally over the years
[05:11:17] <tiffany> yeah jeaye
[05:11:20] <tiffany> it's a really nice engine
[05:11:23] <jeaye> I didn't find Saurbraten to be very twitchy, compared to Q3A (or even UT04).
[05:11:47] <jeaye> Agreed. Very nifty engine.
[05:12:05] <jeaye> The way they handle volumes is clever.
[05:12:12] <cmr> we play xonotic in minstagib mode with grapple hooks
[05:12:14] <tiffany> I was hosting a server for a while but there were so many derps

[05:13:23] <jeaye> cmr: I'll check it out.
[05:13:27] <tiffany> ioquake3 is a pretty widely used engine for open source games
[05:13:40] <tiffany> which is surprising, given how geared it is towards fps games
[05:13:54] <jeaye> Ooh, xonotic is in the Arch repos.
[05:13:56] * jeaye installs
[05:14:14] <tiffany> I considered using it at one point but I didn't want to have to deal with a giant, ancient, alien codebase
[05:14:24] <jeaye> Yeah. :|
[05:14:58] <jeaye> I'll have to dig through it eventually to find how they implement proper Q3A strafe jumping.
[05:16:05] <JesseH> <3 strafe jumping
[05:16:11] <jeaye> ^
[05:16:32] <jeaye> QuakeLive took Q3A strafing to another level
[05:16:52] <JesseH> I havent played quakelive much, I have a horrible machine.
[05:17:01] <JesseH> I think that was the reason...I forget.
[05:17:03] <jeaye> ah
[05:17:31] <jeaye> QL has absolutely died in the past months.
[05:17:41] <jeaye> id made some terrible decisions
[05:18:18] <jeaye> They started limiting maps. Free players used to have a ton of maps to choose from. They changed it to something like 3-5 maps per month.
[05:18:23] <jeaye> Then it cycles each month

[21:32:45] * JesseH wants to do what cmr is doing in school, but most likely wont get to :(
[21:33:02] <jeaye> What's that?
[21:33:16] <JesseH> whats what
[21:33:23] <JesseH> computer science 
[21:33:28] <jeaye> ah
[21:33:37] <jeaye> Why won't you get to?
[21:34:25] <JesseH> Had to make some tough decisions earlier in life, and just....money is virtual non-existent around here
[21:34:58] <JesseH> I think I might could start at a community college, and then transfer
[21:35:04] <jeaye> That's a good route.
[21:35:44] <JesseH> Gotta figure out living arranges too, but yeah...going to try ^_^
[21:35:46] <jeaye> I know how you feel. I dropped out of my BS half way through due to money problems.
[21:35:58] <JesseH> :(
[21:36:11] <jeaye> But that doesn't mean you're stuck, mate.
[21:36:22] <jeaye> My suggestion would be to put all the code you can onto Github.
[21:36:41] <JesseH> I do, except for the stuff I write with my buddies game dev startup :P
[21:36:44] <jeaye> Recruiters are constantly looking for people (especially game dev)
[21:37:04] <JesseH> I need to start messing around with other platforms though, like Android and IOS
[21:37:09] <JesseH> Those are popular
[21:37:11] <jeaye> aye
[21:37:36] <jeaye> The same week I dropped out of college, a nice offer came in from a company that found me on Github. 
[21:37:39] <jeaye> Just keep at it. :)
[21:38:08] <JesseH> Do you know if people are looking for specific things?
[21:38:41] <jeaye> If you just need a job, I'd try mobile.
[21:39:04] <jeaye> Java, iOS, or C++ will get you into a mobile job.
[21:39:25] <cmr> C++?
[21:39:36] <jeaye> iOS/Objc
[21:39:53] <JesseH> I need to get over my shyness of C++ :P
[21:39:53] <jeaye> cmr: I work for a mobile game studio. 90% of the work is done in C++
[21:40:00] <cmr> Interesting!
[21:40:26] <jeaye> Our cross platform engine is in C++ (which I maintain), with some platform-specific Java and ObjC
[21:40:47] <jeaye> We write in C++, it works on Android and iOS
[21:41:21] <JesseH> I need to get over my shyness of a new language...actually
[21:41:26] <jeaye> :P
[21:41:27] <JesseH> Anyone else feel my pain?
[21:41:32] <jeaye> New languages are tough, man.
[21:41:37] <JesseH> I use Lua for everything, and its hard to stick to anything else P
[21:41:38] <JesseH> :P
[21:41:39] <cmr> C++ is a huge hurdle.
[21:41:45] <cmr> Such a large, daunting language.
[21:41:46] <jeaye> I still struggle with writing Rust like I write C++
[21:42:41] <JesseH> It's not really learning and using it, its just....I get so bored and tired of wanting to use it
[21:42:58] <jeaye> You need to find inspiration then.
[21:43:48] * JesseH thinks
[21:43:55] <JesseH> I have a Java book here....
[21:43:55] <cmr> Motivation is hard to find.
[21:44:15] <jeaye> cmr: Very true.
[21:45:16] <JesseH> I think I will do some research, and see what sorts of motivation I can find. :p
[21:47:02] <JesseH> My main issue i think, is being in love with Lua/Python 
[21:47:15] <jeaye> You can do a lot with Python
[21:47:32] <jeaye> While I'm not a fan of it, you can score a steady job if you know Python well.
[21:47:51] <jeaye> Our backend (all of our server work for the mobile games) is entirely Python
[21:48:05] <JesseH> That's my logic, but then I get into a waiting period where I'm trying to find out what to work on 
[21:48:34] <Luqman> yea, the place i'm currently working at is basically all python
[21:48:44] <JesseH> Python it is :P
[21:49:22] <JesseH> brb

[21:49:44] <Luqman> according to Github i seem to mostly do Rust, C, Python
[21:50:05] <JesseH> back
[21:50:22] <tiffany> I have no problem programming in rust, it's just time consuming
[21:50:36] <tiffany> I have a lot of experience with C though
[21:50:38] <JesseH> My github says I do "Lua, Python, Ruby "
[21:50:58] <tiffany> mine says I do shell, lua, and C++
[21:51:02] <tiffany> which is blatantly wrong
[21:51:07] <JesseH> lol
[21:51:13] <cmr> Mine says shell, c, and js
[21:51:17] <cmr> which is also blatently wrong.
[21:51:19] <tiffany> I don't have any C++ code on my github
[21:51:32] <jeaye> C, C++, Rust
[21:51:39] <jeaye> not sure why C would go first
[21:51:43] <tiffany> my irc bot registers as shell because github doesn't recognise the programming language it's written in
[21:51:51] <jeaye> heh
[21:51:53] <tiffany> but I don't know why C doesn't show up high
[21:51:54] <tiffany> or rust
[21:52:09] <tiffany> I've only written C, rust, and lua in the past year+
[21:52:20] <tiffany> well I wrote a small amount of C++ recently
[21:52:22] <Luqman> perhaps it's most recent
[21:52:42] <tiffany> https://github.com/TheCodeLab/IntenseLogic/blob/master/demos/bouncing-lights/bouncinglights.cpp
[21:53:10] <jeaye> Aww, not C++11. :(
[21:53:12] <tiffany> bullet forced my hand
[21:53:27] <tiffany> why would I need any C++11 features in there
[21:53:36] <jeaye> RAII
[21:53:56] <jeaye> You're calling 'new' like it's Java.
[21:54:02] <tiffany> no
[21:54:06] <tiffany> I'm calling 'new' like it's malloc()
[21:54:53] <cmr> I think he means prevalence
[21:55:16] <tiffany> it's some code that handles bullet for me because I can't do it from C++ or lua
[21:55:18] <tiffany> er, from C*
[21:55:23] <jeaye> http://klmr.me/slides/modern-cpp.pdf
[21:55:38] <tiffany> I duct taped it together for the demo it's part of
[21:56:44] <JesseH> If anyone wants to write an implementation of Insertion Sort with Rust, go right ahead ^_^ https://github.com/jessehorne/algorithms
[21:57:13] <tiffany> so the key to writing good C++ is "don't use anything from the C subset"
[21:57:17] <JesseH> I think Merge Sort is next on the list
[21:58:45] <JesseH> Someone needs to create a site, with just flat out programming challenges.
[21:58:55] <JesseH> So that we can focus on code, without focusing on what-to-code
[21:59:03] <cmr> rosetta code?
[21:59:06] <cmr> project euler?
[21:59:15] <JesseH> I was thinking of project euler
[21:59:20] <JesseH> Havent tried to do any of the problems in a while
[21:59:24] <JesseH> Perhaps I should use that
[22:00:06] <tiffany> I should also note that I literally hadn't written a single line of C++ since 2011 or 2010 before writing this
[22:02:54] <jeaye> tiffany: Yeah, sorry for picking it apart so much. (it's my job)
[22:03:46] <jeaye> I imagine most anyone could find a dozen things in each Rust function I write that aren't proper Rust. :P Fortunately nobody dares to dive into the q3 code.
[22:04:04] <cmr> I looked at your logging code.
[22:04:14] <jeaye> Ah, I remember thar.
[22:04:16] <jeaye> that
[22:04:37] <tiffany> I don't think anyone has looked at my rust code
[22:04:44] <cmr> tiffany: is it on github?
[22:04:47] <tiffany> yeah
[22:04:51] <jeaye> Link!
[22:04:55] <tiffany> https://github.com/tiffany352/frscript
[22:05:01] <cmr> Oh, frscript.
[22:05:05] <cmr> Yes, I looked at that as well.
[22:05:35] <tiffany> do I do anything obviously bad?
[22:06:41] * jeaye wouldn't know.
[22:06:46] <jeaye> Looks like Rust to me.
[22:07:03] <cmr> tiffany: Not that I noticed
[22:07:11] <cmr> You used @ but it looked like it had a good reason :p
[22:07:22] <tiffany> yeah I use @ for type signatures
[22:07:27] <tiffany> I might change that later
[22:07:31] <cmr> Looking at it again, I am curious why you used ~extern fn
[22:07:44] <tiffany> because the only way to use closures, so said #rust, is using borrowed pointers
[22:08:04] <tiffany> and borrowed pointers in data structures are pretty ugly
[22:08:09] <cmr> Well you have a pointer to a function pointer there.
[22:08:12] <cmr> `extern fn` is a type.
[22:08:15] <tiffany> oh
