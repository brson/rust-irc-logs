[15:14:44] <edunham> SimonSapin: on personal machines, the value of having access to my data in several years outweighs the secrecy benefits of encryption. for work i'm currently relying on physical security + local encryption of sensitive files + unique keys with strong passphrases... i'm going to set up full-disk encryption before traveling with my work laptop, though.
[15:18:01] <SimonSapin> edunham: I’m using ecryptfs (a stacked filesystem) on ~, I’m gonna try full-disk encryption. (This is a work laptop I’m regularly travelling with)
[15:19:36] <edunham> have you noticed decreased performance from ecryptfs? 
[15:20:10] * edunham has read that it's single-threaded but not sure how much that matters in real life
[15:21:03] <SimonSapin> I haven’t really measured it, but when copying multi-GB files I see the CPU working after the copy is "finished"
[15:21:38] <SimonSapin> there seems to be infinite variations of how to do full-disk encryption, I was wondering if you had tried it already
[15:22:58] <SimonSapin> I think I tried compiling Servo both with and without ecryptfs and didn’t see a difference
[15:24:29] <edunham> yeah i've kept encrypted homedirs on distros that have "check box, get encrypton" set up, then lost passphrases and been sad
[15:25:14] <edunham> fortunately i've since learned to manage passwords :)
[15:26:27] <jack> I use full disk encryption (i think it's called luks in linux)
[15:26:44] <jack> I use the OS X built in one on OS X.
[15:26:45] <brson> I also encrypt ~ but keep my dev work on a non-encrypted drive
[15:27:12] <jack> Having had one breakin where my laptop was stolen, I have never regretted it, even if it did cost me noticeable performance.
[15:27:32] <jack> (And I haven't noticed any performance issues at all)

[18:40:58] <brson> cmr: ok, do you mind emailing me that thread to and cc'ing aturon?
[18:41:15] <brson> oh lol by cc you probably meant email anyway
[18:41:30] <brson> sorry i expect everything to be on reddit now
[18:41:44] <cmr> heh
[18:42:05] <cmr> didn't think to cc aturon. is he starting to take over some of the administrivial duties?
[18:42:23] <brson> surely there's a way to email twir that doesn't require corporate sponsorship...
[18:42:48] <aturon> cmr: i am adminis-trivializing, yes ;-)
[18:43:21] <aturon> FWIW, we're trying to get together a "prospectus" for people that want to sponsor rustcamp
[18:43:36] <cmr> brson: yeah, there are plenty of ways, and I'd be happy to pay for it myself too.
[18:43:54] <cmr> but at the same time, it seems beneficial to add to our list of companies that like rust
[18:43:57] <brson> does discourse email just not work or something?

[19:58:00] <nrc> stopping early is fine by me, I don't think I have much to discuss
[19:58:42] <brson> edunham: it's mostly just curating links, but i'd like to have more editorial content

[20:02:43] <nmatsakis> does anybody here use irssi?
[20:02:51] <edunham> yep
[20:02:57] <nmatsakis> is there an easy way for it to save the current set of channels as channels that should be re-joined the next time it starts?
[20:03:10] <nmatsakis> "/config save" doesn't seem to have that effect
[20:03:19] <nmatsakis> but maybe I need to twiddle some bits here and there?
[20:03:35] <edunham> "easy", debatably, but i wrote this stuff down... 
[20:03:36] * edunham finds it
[20:03:56] <edunham> http://edunham.net/2015/02/16/automating_irssi.html was my notes to self on all that
[20:04:36] <edunham> you set network autojoin, channel autojoin, and window position in separate places in the config, because irssi
[20:12:23] <Manishearth> nmatsakis: the problem with autojoin is that if you have multiple networks tyou can't interleave them
[20:12:27] <Manishearth> use the window position stuff
[20:12:31] <Manishearth> you need to touch the config
[20:12:33] <Manishearth> but it's not hard
[20:15:14] <edunham> aturon: should we also be promoting the rustcamp CFP on the rust subreddit?
[20:16:02] <Manishearth> edunham: it's pinned, right?
[20:16:15] <Manishearth> edunham: big green on top http://www.reddit.com/r/rust/
[20:16:19] <Manishearth> perhaps too green
[20:16:24] * Manishearth contemplates the green
[20:20:20] <nmatsakis> edunham: thanks
[20:29:41] <edunham> Manishearth: heh, that's where other subreddits stick ads, and I was grepping for CFP
[20:29:50] * edunham blames having been paying attention to meeting
[20:32:33] <Manishearth> heh

[20:51:08] <jack> TIL: if you edit yoru reports deliverable in workday, it sends it to you for approval.
[20:51:15] <jack> You get to do it twice!
[20:57:13] <larsberg> jack: at least it isn't like most expense systems, which are smart enough to realize that's a huge loophole and instead sends it to your manager :-)
[21:17:30] <edunham> maybe it's to make sure you manager doesn't change the deliverable without the report noticing :)

[22:17:43] <jack> That would be reasonable, but it doesn't send it to them, but to me :)

[22:21:34] <edunham> words
[22:21:53] <edunham> it does seem silly not to notify both the manager and the manage-ee, though
