[05:57:04] <whipsch> it is inconsiderate to assume all tuples contain 2 elements, clearly n-ple is hte most respectful choice

[07:34:35] <scott> clang is a one-syllable word (but the project name is based off the "C lang(uage)" pun

[07:34:54] <barosl> Yeah, that was my guess to the pronunciation
[07:35:01] <barosl> (The latter)
[07:36:54] <scott> it's fascinating to me how some people can't distinguish r and l (and likewise I know from my linguistics class of some different sounds in Indian languages that I would find extremely difficult to tell apart)
[07:37:54] <scott> I guess it's all about what details of the sounds your ears were trained to focus on and ignore as you grew up
[07:38:10] <barosl> Yeah, it is also interesting to me. In general, when I heard "r" and "l" at the same time, I can see there is *some* difference
[07:38:35] <barosl> But that doesn't mean I can distinguish them when only one of them is pronounced

[11:03:01] <mrmonday> I'm thinking just a simple FCFS kinda thing, so I have more memory available for actual compliments rather than dealing with the algorithm for scheduling

[11:10:18] <libfud> yay
[11:10:26] <libfud> I finally see the change in the documentation that I made
[11:10:29] <libfud> even if it was tiny
[11:10:54] <mrmonday> don't suppose any of you have experience cleaning laptop keyboards? I was sat outside the other day, and the wind blew my beverage over my laptop's keyboard, and half the keys are sticky/don't press properly now :L
[11:10:57] <libfud> seeing that is def. worth more to me than some negligible amount of a cryptocurrency
[11:11:00] <scott> compliment4commit.com would be a way better thing for rust contributors to get emails from
[11:11:16] <libfud> mrmonday: the last time I did it I lost some screws :(
[11:11:24] <mrmonday> awwh :(
[11:11:50] <mrmonday> I was kinda hoping it'd kill my laptop so I could get a new one on my insurance, it still works fine though
[11:12:48] <libfud> mrmonday: what kind of cup were you drinking from
[11:13:12] <mrmonday> less of a cup, more of a can
[11:13:13] <libfud> if it was that windy I'd think I'd rather do it from an enclosed porch or a well lit room with a window cracked or something
[11:13:41] <libfud> I've been paranoid about drinks near electronics ever since an incident involving tequila and my macbook
[11:13:42] <mrmonday> it didn't occur to me that the tin should be downwind of the laptop, it's the first time I've ever actually used a laptop outside
[11:13:44] <libfud> :(
[11:13:53] <sillesta> libfud: how drunk did it get?
[11:14:02] <mrmonday> eek, that can't have been fun
[11:14:08] <libfud> so drunk it never worked again
[11:14:20] <libfud> I also don't drink booze anymore
[11:14:22] <sillesta> i've heard electronics have a low tolerance for alcohol
[11:14:27] <mrmonday> it's the first time I've ever spilled anything on my laptop, and it wasn't my fault it happened (well, I guess it was a little...)
[11:14:36] <libfud> they're also typically underage
[11:15:03] <scott> with multiple cores, time passes much more quickly for them than it does for us
[11:15:07] <mrmonday> libfud: is the reason you don't drink because of the tequila spillage, or is that unrelated?

[11:16:12] <libfud> when I was at work last night I was thinking it'd be nice if I had a method for my struct that could take a method of an underlying struct as an argument
[11:16:17] <libfud> is there a good way to do that?

[11:18:52] <libfud> ah, I guess it's hard to explain
[11:18:58] <mrmonday> I mean, you can always use fn foo<F>(f: F) where F : FnMut(<args>)
[11:19:11] <mrmonday> or FnOnce or Fn, depending on what you're wanting to do
[11:19:24] <libfud> and it'd probably be better to use a mutable reference to it and then call the appropriate method (after seeing if it's Some or None if applicable)
[11:20:17] <mrmonday> that's another option, if you know which method you want to call
[11:20:28] <libfud> yeah
[11:20:43] <libfud> it's all kind of messy since I have to rewrite stuff in a way that's friendly to C/C++
[11:21:05] <mrmonday> hmm, it just occured to me that I know far less about higher order functions in Rust than I do in basically any other language I know... perhaps I should brush up a bit
[11:21:24] *** Joins: psd (psd@moz-acc.mpg.78.202.IP)
[11:21:50] <libfud> I think the only other language which I've really used higher order functions in has been scheme

[11:22:27] <libfud> <3 Lisp/Scheme and SExprs
[11:22:28] <mrmonday> Scheme's a lisp, right?
[11:22:31] <libfud> yes
[11:22:46] <mrmonday> ha, said literally a second before I asked :p
[11:23:05] <mrmonday> I might have tried scheme at some point, it may have been some other lisp though
[11:23:16] <sillesta> all the times i tried scheme i got lost in my parens
[11:23:16] <libfud> scheme is relatively small compared to the hugeness of common lisp

[11:23:25] <sillesta> mrmonday: ditto..
[11:23:27] <mrmonday> sillesta: yeah, same problem :D
[11:24:03] <mrmonday> I mean, my editor highlights them and I tried formatting them like {} in most languages, and I can usually keep track there.... nay luck though
[11:24:06] <libfud> If I got confused by them I'd write them on a new line to match up with the opening one
[11:24:52] <mrmonday> I still wanna try again at some point, just because I'm curious about the meta programming stuff everyone seems to rave about
[11:25:05] <libfud> I think I just like the complete regularity of it a lot more
[11:25:19] <libfud> I don't care about that as much as it just seems like I can say exactly what I want to say in it
[11:25:55] <mrmonday> have you tried many other functional languages?
[11:26:00] <libfud> plus as a serialization format it's so much better than the ass that's xml
[11:26:04] <mrmonday> I feel the same way about Haskell
[11:26:06] <libfud> mrmonday: I tried to learn some haskell once
[11:26:08] <libfud> but
[11:26:12] <libfud> i got confused
[11:26:27] <libfud> I think I'll give it another go since I didn't give it much of a shot

[11:27:11] <libfud> what's fairly easy to do

[11:27:24] <mrmonday> getting confused
[11:27:26] <libfud> and when I said serialization format, I meant S Expressions, of course
[11:27:34] <libfud> oh
[11:27:52] <libfud> I think it's because on the surface it looks very, very different from C style syntax
[11:28:01] <libfud> personally I love rust's function signatures
[11:28:22] <libfud> since in my mind it gets the order of importance of things right... or maybe not importance, but what should be said first and last
[11:28:44] <libfud> like, this is a function, this is it's name, these are its paramaters and their types, and here's what it returns (if anything)
[11:28:59] <mrmonday> I know that monads/functors/etc scare a lot of people off, they're no way near as scary/complicated as people seem to make out though
[11:29:09] <libfud> rather than saying void foo(int bar)
[11:29:10] <mrmonday> libfud: Haskell uses the exact same order
[11:30:00] <mrmonday> some_func :: Int -> String -> String # Something like fn some_func(int, String) -> String in Rust

[11:30:40] <mrmonday> you get used to that
[11:30:43] <libfud> why does it use arrows instead of a comma?
[11:30:52] <libfud> I think that *is* confusing?
[11:31:00] <libfud> since it's parameters and the return type
[11:31:28] <mrmonday> that is a little confusing, unless you're familiar with mathematical functions (though that isn't actually a requirement)
[11:31:39] <mrmonday> basically function types are written a -> b
[11:31:47] <mrmonday> as in the function takes type a and returns type b
[11:31:59] <Hannibal_Smith> libfud, if I remember correctly, all Haskell function are unray
[11:32:00] <mrmonday> if you want two parameters you can write a -> b -> c
[11:32:14] <libfud> unary?
[11:32:20] <mrmonday> which is exactly the same as (a -> b) -> c and a -> (b -> c) in Haskell
[11:33:14] <mrmonday> as in, a function which takes a and b, then returns c, is the same as a function which takes a function which takes a and returns b, and... wait, I'm explaining this terribly
[11:33:27] <mrmonday> libfud: unary means it only takes one argument
[11:33:44] <libfud> he said unray
[11:33:49] <libfud> I just wondered if he meant unary
[11:33:51] <mrmonday> I suspect that's a typo
[11:34:04] <mrmonday> since all Haskell functions are technically unary
[11:34:34] <Hannibal_Smith> Sorry libfud, yes a type
[11:34:39] <huon> mrmonday: a -> b -> c isn't the same as (a -> b) -> c
[11:34:53] <mrmonday> it's probably easier to get a proper explanation from LYAH
[11:35:03] <mrmonday> huon: oops :L
[11:35:55] <mrmonday> yeah, that makes sense
[11:36:02] <mrmonday> been a while since I wrote any Haskell
[11:36:04] <libfud> let's leave it to 'read LYAH'
[11:36:09] <libfud> since this is all just losing me
[11:36:43] <libfud> other than all functions in Haskell are unary (but that seems like a contradiction if you can use shorthand for it anyway...)
[11:37:09] <mrmonday> yeah, I did a terrible job of explaining, sorry
[11:37:21] <Hannibal_Smith> libfud, x -> y -> z means a function that take x and return y -> z
[11:37:35] <mrmonday> and as huon pointed out, I made a mistake anyway

[11:44:15] <Hannibal_Smith> libfud, as the really good number of people here and on #rust 
[11:44:22] <Hannibal_Smith> You are not the only one to think this way
[11:44:34] <libfud> I started with C and python, but certain concepts were really eluding me at that point (not that many don't still, but I just encounter them much less frequently and they don't seem like things that a beginner needs to know)
[11:45:27] <Hannibal_Smith> At least about Rust, I don't know about Scheme :-P

[11:46:52] <libfud> using C now feels like I'm trying to swing around an oversized chainsaw that's vibrating in a threatening manner

[11:49:22] <scott> libfud: tagged unions++++
[11:49:27] <scott> far too few languages have them
[11:49:53] <libfud> you can write a hack with structs, but it's really just not the same, nor as powerful
[11:50:01] <libfud> and obv. you can implement them in C
[11:50:03] <libfud> much more dangerously
[11:50:07] <scott> right
[11:50:13] <mrmonday> I dunno, I personally don't think tagged unions on its own is enough
[11:50:23] <libfud> pattern matching though
[11:50:28] <Hannibal_Smith> Is not that hard to fake them using OOP pattern like visitor, and at least things like boost variant actually works well
[11:50:29] <mrmonday> if you've got them, you probably also want pattern matching
[11:50:39] <scott> yeah, I assumed pattern matching would be included
[11:50:40] <mrmonday> and if you've got pattern matching you probably want do notation
[11:50:42] <Hannibal_Smith> But yes for sure having them builtin make them more easy to use
[11:50:46] <mrmonday> and if you want do notation you need HKTs
[11:50:51] <Hannibal_Smith> And in theory, the compiler can optimize them better
[11:50:55] <scott> I don't see the connection between pattern matching and do notation
[11:50:56] <libfud> really I guess I should say ADTs and pattern matching
[11:51:00] <mrmonday> which is the primary reason the Rust I write is kind of awkward imo
[11:51:01] <huon> why pattern matching => do notation?
[11:51:32] <libfud> also <3 traits
[11:51:41] <libfud> they were so hard to get at first, especially stuff like trait objects
[11:52:10] <mrmonday> huon: I guess the Maybe monad is the easiest example, you get a huge amount of rightward drift with pattern matching, and you can often make it disappear with do notation
[11:52:38] <mrmonday> or Option<T>, I guess, since this is #rust-offtopic
[11:52:45] <libfud> but writing custom iterators which can also be zipped and mapped and folded... it's almost like it's too convenient :P
[11:53:15] <scott> Option is the main reason I've wanted do notation so far
[11:53:19] <libfud> if lets can help with the rightward drifting
[11:53:20] <scott> that or a try_opt! macro for now

[15:32:27] *** Quits: larhat (Adium@moz-iu8.ic8.220.83.IP) (Connection closed)
[15:32:29] <libfud> of course you won't be able to understand it at that level, you want a higher level of abstraction for yourself
[15:32:41] <Astrum|Lap> in either case
[15:32:52] <Astrum|Lap> don't hate the past, it's what got us to the present
[15:33:58] <libfud> the present is not necessarily the best situation either. Emulating terminals designed in the 70s is not what I'd consider good, for example
[15:34:44] <Astrum|Lap> I agree
[15:35:19] <Astrum|Lap> so fix it =)
[15:35:32] <libfud> there have been good things, or at least better things
[15:35:35] <libfud> they haven't caught on
[15:35:48] <libfud> right now I'm just whining cause I'm feeling particularly salty
[15:36:02] <sillesta> tried salmiakki?
[15:36:59] <libfud> What people did in the 70s and 80s in terms of implementing this stuff is pretty incredible, I just wish that as the times changed, we'd have made things much better than what happened
[15:37:16] <libfud> plan9 seems really interesting
[15:38:27] <mrmonday> I discovered recently that you can display images in the terminal
[15:38:30] <mrmonday> my mind was blown
[15:38:40] <libfud> you talking about caca?
[15:38:48] <mrmonday> but then I was a little bit disappointed that more things didn't take advantage of it
[15:38:50] <libfud> you can even watch videos
[15:38:57] <mrmonday> libfud: no, I mean proper, true colour images
[15:39:02] <libfud> what?
[15:39:07] <libfud> I've never heard of this
[15:39:23] <libfud> I knew about stuff like graphing terminals
[15:39:35] <mrmonday> http://ranger.nongnu.org/screenshots.html
[15:40:00] <mrmonday> most of those previews don't do the true colour image thing
[15:40:11] <mrmonday> http://ranger.nongnu.org/screenshots/w3mimgpreview.png that one does though
[15:40:48] <mrmonday> it upsets me that, eg, vim doesn't use it to give proper squiggly lines like gvim does

[17:26:05] <Lurkin> So I've been reading about embedded systems, and I just had a great lightbulb moment I think.

[17:26:49] <cmr> no, not at all.
[17:27:17] <Lurkin> Alright, I'll go back to reading.
[17:27:28] <tiffany> what do you mean by secure mode?
[17:27:30] <cmr> It's (usually) very difficult to get code to execute at a higher privilege level, hardware-wise.
[17:27:38] <tiffany> ring 0 / real mode? or the TPM?
[17:28:04] <Lurkin> I need to keep reading you kill -9's my assumption which is very helpful.
[17:29:10] <Lurkin> I'm thinking about a real time kernel on ARMv7 (Rpi2) in rust that's all.

[17:43:15] <c74d3> I'm somewhat disturbed by how this “basic” Lojban course on Memrise feels it necessary to teach me the words for “Communism”, “manifesto”, “revolution”, and “conquer” before things like “hello”, “goodbye”, and “thanks”.
[17:43:32] <tiffany> what the hell
[17:44:36] <tiffany> I mostly avoided the lojban community when trying to learn it
[17:49:22] <proc> for what is lojban being used ?
[17:49:34] *** Quits: pczarn (piotr@moz-9un7t9.izacom.pl) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[17:50:28] <c74d3> My only exposure to the Lojban community is occasionally looking at their IRC channel, but I'd not think them particularly… agitproppy… from that.
[17:50:36] <c74d3> Hm. Apparently this course is from a university.
[17:51:27] <c74d3> proc: I've not heard of it seeing use outside its community.
[17:52:36] <c74d3> I don't expect I'd actually use it, and I find some of its design decisions… odd, despite that I'm learning it anyway.
[17:54:22] <tiffany> proc: one of its proposed usecases is for human-computer interaction but nobody has actually done anything in that field
[17:54:39] <proc> :D
[17:54:43] <tiffany> all of the work which is actually getting funded is pattern matching english
[17:55:12] <tiffany> even though it's really obvious that beyond basic questions like "find the nearest restaurant" that tools like siri and cortana are not very smart
[17:55:26] <tiffany> i.e. they have domain knowledge, but no deep understanding
[17:55:35] <proc> prob. because nobody would like to love learning lojban to interact with siri..
[17:56:09] <proc> ( for example, while I'm still avoiding any smartphone voice-input )
[17:56:09] <tiffany> people would probably learn lojban if it meant using the world's most powerful workflow software, though
[17:56:16] <proc> yeah
[17:56:24] <tiffany> lojban isn't much harder to learn than any application-specific language in any case
[17:56:48] <tiffany> it's not like natural languages where they have lots of rules and exceptions that you have to keep in mind
[17:57:18] <tiffany> the grammar isn't even noun/verb/adjective-based, the idea of SVO order doesn't really even apply
[18:00:15] <c74d3> proc: I didn't need to learn much beyond English to use Google Now. Are Siri/Cortana significantly more difficult to use?
[18:01:40] <tiffany> they're all the same low barrier to entry impossible to do anything complex
[18:02:00] <tiffany> clearly designed to appeal in consumerist ways
[18:02:17] <tiffany> it's not much more than a gimmick
[18:02:30] <tiffany> speaking is faster than typing, I guess
[18:02:53] <tiffany> but why is "what is the weather?" so much better than "!weather <zipcode>"
[18:02:59] <tiffany> which I can put right into duckduckgo
[18:03:11] <tiffany> well, faster than typing on a phone
[18:03:34] <c74d3> What about hands-free usage?
[18:03:55] <tiffany> like when you're driving?
[18:04:21] <c74d3> yes, I suppose that's the only example that comes to mind for me
[18:04:38] <tiffany> I can't remember where, but I believe I saw a study which showed that stuff like that is almost as bad as a distraction as taking your eyes off the road entirely
[18:05:08] <tiffany> and we are currently far enough along that I can actually say the better solution is to just have cars drive themselves
[18:05:22] <tiffany> leaving you free to fiddle with your phone
[18:05:30] <c74d3> I don't think one would be distracted for as long as one would be typing in queries
[18:05:51] <c74d3> also, I rarely bother asking Google Now questions like “what is the weather?”; I'd just say “weather”.
[18:06:16] <tiffany> I suppose
[18:06:47] <c74d3> Though I don't know whether that would work with Siri/Cortana.

[18:09:11] <c74d3> (hm, there was one time at a Thanksgiving party that I played it, sort of, in that I was handed a thing with buttons and levers and pushed them repeatedly and got some poor military person killed repeatedly)
[18:10:38] <tiffany> I've never played halo
[18:11:00] <tiffany> I would be interested in the series if I didn't have to buy two versions of xbox in order to play it

[19:13:19] <scott> there have been a handful of meetups already
[19:13:32] <scott> not sure at what point a meetup becomes a conference
[19:18:03] <barosl> I'd love to just see hundreds of people using Rust gathered at the same place!
[19:19:23] <lahwran__> tiffany: hands-free usage is where you want that, yes
[19:19:30] <lahwran__> that, or social reasons
[19:19:44] <lahwran__> and my experience has been that anything you could type as words, you can say and it'll understand
[19:19:56] <lahwran__> use of bangs in duckduckgo is rather tacky
[19:20:18] <tiffany> well yeah you'd want something other than a !
[19:20:31] <lahwran__> a different trigger phrase, perhaps
[19:21:09] <lahwran__> I also frequently use voice search when I'm in a group and want to look something up on my phone
[19:21:15] <lahwran__> but I don't want to disengage from the conversation
[19:21:17] <scott> I use really shortened sentences with voice recognition, e.g. just "weather" instead of "what is the weather?"
[19:21:24] <lahwran__> so I'll set my phone on the table and then trigger the search
[19:21:26] <scott> "timer 5 minutes"
[19:21:38] <lahwran__> yeah, same
[19:21:46] <lahwran__> I might say "<city> weather"
[19:21:51] <lahwran__> or "current weather"
[19:21:54] <scott> I used to have trouble with "timer for 5 minutes" coming out as "timer 45 minutes"...
[19:22:13] <lahwran__> but omg I love being able to just pull it out, say "ok google, navigate home", and then set it down and listen to directions
[19:22:17] <scott> for and 4 don't even sound the same in my accent, at least in rapid speech
[19:22:26] <scott> for sounds like fer
[19:22:56] <lahwran__> I gave up on hiding from google when I got an android phone in the first place :p
[19:23:02] <scott> lahwran__: yeah, I use navigate home a lot
[19:23:24] <lahwran__> though I still don't want to turn google now on. I can't set timers or have it call people, because I haven't authorized search integration with contacts
[19:23:24] <scott> probably the most important reason for me to have a phone
[19:24:19] <lahwran__> also I have my own location tracker
[19:24:21] <lahwran__> lol
[19:24:33] <lahwran__> I mean, not "my own", I didn't write it, I run the open source app "gpslogger"
[19:25:05] <lahwran__> but of course google tracks your location, if nothing else then for the wifi geolocation tracking system
[19:25:24] <scott> I usually have GPS disabled, so it's mostly inaccurate data from cell phone tower locations and wifi, but my google location history is fascinating
[19:25:48] <scott> I can sometimes look at a day in the past and see where in the city I drove and remember exactly what happened from that
[19:26:12] <lahwran__> google location history has a lot of bogus data for me
[19:26:20] <lahwran__> the gpslogger data is much cleanr
[19:26:23] <lahwran__> cleaner(
[19:26:26] <lahwran__> bah I can't type
[19:26:30] <scott> there are some days it shows me leaping from here to India and back a few times a day
[19:26:49] <lahwran__> I suspect this is because google's thing doesn't have the same strictness of filters that gpslogger does
[19:26:53] <scott> as far I know I haven't been pwned by Indian hackers
[19:27:09] <lahwran__> maybe you get near a wifi that was last seen in india
[19:27:27] <lahwran__> someone moved from india, perhaps
[19:28:12] <lahwran__> the unfortunate thing is that while there are heuristics they could use to be more accurate with wifi stuff - for instance, sudden jumps usually indicate bad data - there are some pretty notable times when they *don't*, like getting on an airplane and then getting off
[19:28:27] <lahwran__> so they can't just blindly filter it
[19:29:56] <lahwran__> I'm moving to the bay area soon
[19:29:59] <lahwran__> and am going to be driving
[19:30:18] <lahwran__> I'm going to make sure to keep gpslogger on, and my phone plugged in often enough
[19:30:33] <lahwran__> I'm looking forward to seeing what that looks like

[19:32:28] <sillesta> no mountains!
[19:32:31] <scott> that's a long drive, but I have to one-up you with my Saskatchewan -> Toronto 1833.67 mile drive :P
[19:32:47] <scott> which I'm repeating in the other directing at the end of August
[19:32:48] <lahwran__> surely you stopped at least once @_@
[19:32:53] <scott> it was 3 days
[19:32:56] <lahwran__> okay
[19:33:03] <scott> you can maybe do it in 2 if you don't sleep much
[19:33:13] <lahwran__> yeah that was kind of how we did the california trip last time
[19:33:24] <lahwran__> 13 hours straight of just ... driving
[19:33:54] <lahwran__> it was kind of awesome in one sense - it allowed me to get a feel for the fact that the world really does connect continuously

[20:03:13] <niconii> geez, i don't know why, but for some reason i've never really been able to wrap my mind around how powerful modern computers are
[20:03:22] <niconii> i feel like i'm still rooted in the early 90s
[20:03:42] <niconii> 640K of RAM still ought to be enough for everyone... right?
[20:04:33] <tiffany> 640K of RAM is enough memory for a single 1024x160 RGBA framebuffer
[20:05:25] <tiffany> it's 8.1 mibibytes for a 1920x1080 RGBA framebuffer, and most games require more than that, for example a depth buffer
[20:06:00] <tiffany> you could argue that we don't need such large framebuffers
[20:06:33] <tiffany> and that is to some extent true - many applications do not require large amounts of memory for their core logic, but merely for conveniences like large framebuffers
[20:07:25] <tiffany> after all, people got along just fine with 160 pixel resolution videos back in the day
[20:07:42] <tiffany> we could certainly do better than in the 90s if we were constrained to that hardware, though
[20:07:50] <tiffany> we have much faster, efficient compression algorithms, now
[20:08:13] <lahwran__> it's easy to feel like only hardware is getting better and software is just expanding to fill the available space
[20:08:19] <tiffany> that too
[20:08:22] <lahwran__> and while to some extend that's true, there have been many advances
[20:08:32] <tiffany> software does always expand to fill the available space
[20:08:38] <tiffany> and we are currently on a really ugly path right now
[20:08:44] <tiffany> javascript is so many layers separated from the real hardware
[20:08:46] <niconii> yeah, i think that's part of it
[20:08:56] <tiffany> many things in javascript are a hundred times slower to do than they are natively
[20:09:10] <tiffany> and computers are a thousand times faster than they were 20 years ago
[20:09:20] <niconii> my impressions have never really evolved much because software hasn't really been speeding up to match
[20:09:40] <tiffany> if you really want to see something impressive you could go watch some demoscene stuff
[20:09:43] <cmr> Oh yeah? Go run firefox on a raspberry pi
[20:09:47] <niconii> but then i'll write a program which i think is reasonably complex, and it just executes instantly
[20:09:50] <lahwran__> but that's because a lot of it is bottlenecked
[20:10:00] <tiffany> they often constrain themselves to under a hundred kilobyte binaries
[20:10:03] <tiffany> everything has to be procedural
[20:10:06] <tiffany> and most stuff is done on the GPU
[20:10:11] <lahwran__> you do network? that's still gotta go across the world
[20:10:45] <tiffany> the way everything is centralised does not help the network problem one bit
[20:11:51] <lahwran__> niconii: I have a program in rust that is a genetic algorithm with 300 population and 100 iterations, at the moment, and how long does it take to execute?
[20:11:56] <lahwran__> 90ms.
[20:12:06] <niconii> crazy
[20:12:30] <lahwran__> it's also interesting, because the same code run on the same clock-speed arm chip takes 10x as long
[20:12:40] <lahwran__> the same rust code, that is
[20:12:59] <niconii> anyway, my impressions have kinda been an issue because i end up being a lot more prone to doing premature optimization
[20:13:03] <tiffany> I have an implementation of quickheap which can insert 5 million elements in 90 milliseconds and extract-min every single one in 2500 milliseconds
[20:13:34] <niconii> ...but only in compiled languages, i just realized
[20:13:38] <proc> tiffany: that's impressive
[20:13:48] <niconii> back when i was programming in ruby i didn't care about performance at all, what the heck
[20:14:08] <lahwran__> it doesn't feel like you *can* make it fast there
[20:14:10] <tiffany> that's an average of 500 nanoseconds per element, apparently
[20:14:19] <cmr> niconii: once you have machine sympathy, it's hard to surpress it i find.
[20:14:32] <lahwran__> yeah, it hurts to go back to python now
[20:14:42] <lahwran__> I see something that's forking for every op and just cringe
[20:14:46] <sillesta> even pypy?
[20:14:50] <lahwran__> well ok no
[20:14:55] <lahwran__> lol pypy is still awesome
[20:14:57] <sillesta> :p
[20:14:59] <tiffany> I am okay with python if I'm not doing anything cpu intensive
[20:15:09] <lahwran__> same
[20:15:15] <tiffany> but I am intricately aware of how important cache performance is
[20:15:54] <tiffany> I redesigned my render pipeline to be more data oriented (which had other benefits than performance, mind) and it ended up being 5x faster
[20:16:07] <lahwran__> what do you mean by "data oriented"?
[20:16:11] <tiffany> data oriented design
[20:16:21] <lahwran__> yes, I've heard that as a buzzword before
[20:16:24] <lahwran__> what does it actually mean
[20:16:25] <cmr> lahwran__: have some links: https://github.com/gfx-rs/gfx-rs/blob/master/wiki/research.md#data-oriented-design
[20:16:32] <tiffany> a programming paradigm in which you think in terms of relational algebra and transformations of data
[20:16:42] <tiffany> http://www.dataorienteddesign.com/dodmain/
[20:16:55] <tiffany> you might be confusing it with data driven design lahwran
[20:17:12] <tiffany> that's just where you don't hardcode game logic into your engine code
[20:17:33] <tiffany> that one is definitely a buzzword
[20:17:39] <tiffany> there's an entire company named after that buzzword
[20:17:45] <tiffany> they make shovelware wii games
[20:20:52] <fmtq> lahwran__: show me nvim ui

[20:23:19] <niconii> (turns out it's a good idea to actually remember to plug in your laptop, whoops)
[20:23:23] <barosl> Oh my god, we got nico nico nii!
[20:23:44] <barosl> Greetings, my fellow nico friend
[20:23:47] <tiffany> lahwran: the main thing is an emphasis on using the right data structures and thinking of things in terms of data structures instead of isolated objects
[20:23:56] <lahwran__> ah
[20:24:04] <tiffany> like, it's really easy to accidentally make O(N) algorithms in OOP because you accidentally think per-object, and there's N objects
[20:24:08] <niconii> barosl: yo
[20:24:26] <tiffany> when you could have just as easily used something like a tree or other kind of index
[20:24:58] <barosl> Regarding Python, I hated that it could not optimize even the most obvious things out there
[20:24:59] <tiffany> in order to structure your data this way, it's often helpful to examine how it's done in relational databases, through normalisation
[20:25:15] <JustAPerson> barosl: like what
[20:25:23] <barosl> e.g. hello.world.blahblah.method(); hello.world.blahblah.another_method()
[20:25:35] <barosl> If you cache the result of hello.world.blahblah, it literally runs faster
[20:25:43] <bluss> Python doen't have an optimizer, that's just that :)
[20:25:52] <lahwran__> python is a language
[20:26:02] <bluss> ok true, CPython
[20:26:09] <scott> I'm pretty sure CPython has an optimizer
[20:26:09] <lahwran__> pypy *does* have an optimizer
[20:26:16] <lahwran__> not anything worth talking about
[20:26:29] <JustAPerson> barosl: that would be extremely difficult to guarantee in python. method() could change one of those parent structures
[20:26:38] <scott> dynamic language optimization is a much harder problem, though
[20:26:44] <JustAPerson> you'd need a shit load of analysis to guarantee the invariants
[20:26:44] <lahwran__> yeah
[20:26:52] <tiffany> barosl: that is a distressingly common pattern in dynamic languages
[20:26:53] <JustAPerson> or just a tracing JIT
[20:26:56] <tiffany> member access has runtime overhead
[20:27:00] <JustAPerson> like PyPy / LuaJIT
[20:27:01] <barosl> And I think there is also a problem in the language itself. I believe Python's over-dynamism prevents such optimizations that are obvious by humans but cannot be proven statistically
[20:27:03] <bluss> any function can introspect back up the calling frame and change it..
[20:27:09] <lahwran__> barosl: agreed
[20:27:22] <scott> yep, the dynamism kills a ton of possibilities for optimization
[20:27:36] <JustAPerson> barosl: to be fair, it's nice at time when writing code. Makes things easy
[20:27:39] <lahwran__> you can actually statically analyze python enough to guarantee the invariants, but then what ends up happening is that it's easy to accidentally break them and not know why
[20:27:43] <scott> the less things that could possibly happen, the most the optimizer can play with your code
[20:27:43] <JustAPerson> takes a very nice JIT to fix it though
[20:27:47] <lahwran__> so you might as well start out restricted
[20:27:48] <scott> the more*
[20:27:56] <lahwran__> especially if it's like rust and the restrictions feel nice and are convenient
[20:28:03] <tiffany> I don't really like the idea of a tracing JIT
[20:28:10] <lahwran__> you don't seem to like anything though
[20:28:14] <JustAPerson> lmao
[20:28:16] <barosl> JustAPerson, Yeah, I had loved that for so long time (~10 years), but now I changed my mind. Maybe I'll change my mind again in anotehr 10 years? :P
[20:28:17] <tiffany> my code being able to dramatically change in performance based on where the fenceposts of traces start and end
[20:28:22] <lahwran__> oh for sure
[20:28:32] <lahwran__> yeah, tracing jits are a really really impressive hack
[20:28:34] <tiffany> there's no point in profiling when runtime conditions can cause 10x speed differences
[20:28:35] <JustAPerson> barosl: yea I used to love Lua which suffered the same problems
[20:29:07] <barosl> JustAPerson, But Lua's JIT is truly amazing! Too sad that it doesn't incorporate with the "official" Lua language specification
[20:29:13] <tiffany> I do like things lahwran, just not dynamic languages
[20:29:25] <tiffany> barosl: you mean lua 5.2/5.3?
[20:29:26] <fmtq> barosl: how so
[20:29:27] <barosl> I heard LuaJIT's author decided not to support Lua 5.4
[20:29:28] <lahwran__> just poking fun 'cause you complain a lot
[20:29:31] <barosl> (Or 5.3?)
[20:29:35] <barosl> I don't remember the exact number
[20:29:37] <JustAPerson> Mike Pall won't even fully support 5.2
[20:29:38] <tiffany> 5.2 added changes that mike paul really hated
[20:29:39] <barosl> 5.3 is the latest, right?
[20:29:41] <tiffany> he won't fully support them
[20:29:41] <bluss> yes
[20:29:46] <tiffany> lua 5.3 is the most recent of the actual language
[20:29:50] <JustAPerson> he hates _ENV and none of his clients want 5.2
[20:29:54] <JustAPerson> so LuaJIT stays 5.1 mainly
[20:29:58] <tiffany> 5.3 added integer types
[20:30:03] <lahwran__> wait what
[20:30:12] <lahwran__> is lua javascript
[20:30:16] <tiffany> there are implicit casts between floats and ints
[20:30:17] <fmtq> yes
[20:30:18] <scott> basically
[20:30:19] <tiffany> it's horrifying
[20:30:19] <barosl> He seems to hate the integer type too
[20:30:26] <Havvy> Lua and JavaScript are *very* similar.
[20:30:33] <fmtq> but awful
[20:30:40] <tiffany> they are annoying to audit in C/C++, but this is just ridiculous
[20:30:46] <JustAPerson> no javascripts casts are really dumb
[20:30:54] <JustAPerson> from that "Wat" talk iirc
[20:31:04] <fmtq> {}+[]
[20:31:05] <lahwran__> they're not as bad as "wat" in everyday life
[20:31:08] <tiffany> does javascript make typos an error?
[20:31:12] <tiffany> or do they just resolve to undefined
[20:31:17] <lahwran__> tiffany: often undefined
[20:31:20] <lahwran__> sometimes they're errors
[20:31:21] <fmtq> no
[20:31:24] <lahwran__> it depends on whether the moon is out
[20:31:26] <fmtq> it depends but usually errors.
[20:31:29] <Havvy> fmtq:  `{}+[];` evaluates differently than `({}+[]);`.
[20:31:34] <bluss> lua is better than javascript in that regard
[20:31:35] <fmtq> Havvy: I know.
[20:31:36] <tiffany> I'm going to hazard a guess
[20:31:39] <fmtq> let us not talk about it 
[20:31:43] <tiffany> typos for variable names are errors
[20:31:46] <bluss> but lua allows 2 + "2" = 4
[20:31:48] <fmtq> yes.
[20:31:50] <tiffany> but typos for field names are undefined
[20:31:50] <lahwran__> tiffany: yep.
[20:31:54] <fmtq> yes.
[20:31:58] <tiffany> just like strict.lua
[20:32:02] <barosl> JustAPerson, Regarding Lua, all the things I had known about Lua were that it used some weird object-accessing operator (`:`)
[20:32:06] <lahwran__> tiffany: unless the variable is undefined, in which case they're errors.
[20:32:18] <JustAPerson> barosl: v:name() == v.name(v)
[20:32:18] <lahwran__> var x = {}; var y = x.z;
[20:32:20] <JustAPerson> that's it
[20:32:22] <lahwran__> that will work
[20:32:25] <tiffany> barosl: a:b(c) -> a.b(a, c)
[20:32:28] <barosl> JustAPerson, But after taking some benchmarks, I found LuaJIT's performance is even better than V8
[20:32:32] <lahwran__> but var a = y.z;
[20:32:35] <lahwran__> that will error
[20:32:36] <tiffany> function a:b(c) -> function a.b(self, c)
[20:32:44] <JustAPerson> it's not quiet sugar because that method call convention has it's own VM instruction
[20:32:51] <JustAPerson> but semantics are the same
[20:32:55] <lahwran__> it's loud sugar
[20:32:58] <JustAPerson> unless you define the function differently
[20:33:10] <barosl> That changed my mind a bit. From now I'll seriously consider it as my next embedded script language
[20:33:15] <JustAPerson> function data:method() end defines an implicit "self" variable
[20:33:31] <tiffany> barosl: the lua embedding API is pretty much unrivaled
[20:33:41] <sillesta> lua is magnitudes faster than js (v8/spidermonkey) last i checked
[20:33:56] <barosl> Just for fun, here is the benchmark: https://github.com/barosl/ws-bench
[20:33:58] <JustAPerson> barosl: Mike Pall's work on LuaJIT is fucking insane. The core VM (not the JIT) is entirely assembly in for like 4 different architectures
[20:34:04] <tiffany> it's the only one which doesn't require you to manually manage GC pointers
[20:34:07] <tiffany> which I suppose isn't as bad in rust
[20:34:10] <barosl> I posted this on this channel several times, don't blame on me for its awkward results!
[20:34:14] <tiffany> since smart pointers
[20:34:20] <tiffany> lua's API is stack-based
[20:34:57] <tiffany> justaperson: do you think anyone will be daring enough to fund his plans for updating the GC?
[20:35:15] <JustAPerson> tiffany: it's been like two years, and he wants nearly $100,000
[20:35:19] <JustAPerson> idk, but I await the day
[20:35:21] <JustAPerson> ;__;
[20:35:21] <barosl> What will happen if I post the benchmark results to /r/programming...
[20:35:38] <lahwran__> they'll point out how bad you are at benchmarking
[20:35:43] <barosl> lol
[20:35:47] <tiffany> they will?
[20:35:48] <sillesta> barosl: "useless results, does he even know how to write in language X?"
[20:35:51] <barosl> That's true, I'll accept that
[20:36:03] <tiffany> my experience with /r/programming has been of a... much lower calibre
[20:36:09] <sillesta> ditto
[20:36:11] <JustAPerson> tiffany: probably not just because the performance gains are so unclear for such an investment. If only Pall would start work on it, but he doesn't work on LuaJIT anymore
[20:36:22] <Havvy> /r/programming is of lower quality than Hacker News.
[20:36:40] <tiffany> /r/programming is, from my experience, full of smug C# programmers
[20:36:45] <scott> I find /r/programming and HN more or less equally unbearable
[20:36:48] <barosl> Havvy, While that may be true, I think the primary concerns of those two are a bit different
[20:36:50] <tiffany> same scott
[20:36:51] <cmr> I agree with scott.
[20:37:05] <barosl> HN is generally so much sympathetic(?) to newly forming languages
[20:37:18] <barosl> (I cannot think of a good word)
[20:37:26] <tiffany> enthusiastic?
[20:37:28] <sillesta> tolerant?
[20:37:31] <barosl> Yeah, probably
[20:37:37] <barosl> /r/proramming is much more skepticdal
[20:38:37] <tiffany> that haskell version did pretty well considering that it doesn't even contain any visible performance hacks
[20:38:41] <tiffany> like unsafePerformIO
[20:39:12] <scott> do people actually use unsafePerformIO for perf?
[20:39:19] <tiffany> it prevents time and space leaks
[20:39:24] <cmr> "The test was done using a virtual machine, which gives the test results even more credibility." that's a self-deprecating joke right?
[20:39:25] <tiffany> not sure how common they actually are
[20:39:30] <tiffany> especially in an IO-heavy application such as this
[20:39:38] <barosl> cmr, Yup :P
[20:39:47] <barosl> I should emphasize that even more!
[20:39:48] <cmr> ouch, poor twisted.
[20:39:52] <scott> my impression of performance-tuned Haskell is strictness annotations everywhere and a switch to totally different data structures
[20:40:13] <tiffany> yeah
[20:40:13] <JustAPerson> tiffany: haskell is horrible to optimize, see one of the top posts of /r/haskell, someone fixing invisible O(N^2) behavior in the haskell package manager https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/1sh67u/the_reason_why_cabal_update_takes_so_long/
[20:40:25] <JustAPerson> they'd been searching for this for months
[20:40:53] <tiffany> ouch
[20:41:18] <JustAPerson> >The reverse was taking 79s, now it takes 0.01s.
[20:41:34] <barosl> I did the benchmark before implementing a game server dedicated for this year's April Fool joke
[20:41:57] <barosl> One of the sites I'm maintaining transformed itself to a game
[20:42:34] *** Quits: erickt (erickt@moz-njt.vqi.14.76.IP) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[20:42:59] <barosl> http://barosl.com/up/raw/339/pgr21-online-2.png
[20:43:29] <barosl> So I wanted to check if Python can be used for that purpose
[20:43:56] <barosl> Last year I tried to implement chat server in Python which should have handled ~2000 concurrent connections, but it was... too slow
[20:44:16] <barosl> Did I demand too much for Python?
[20:44:27] <barosl> For a single server?
[20:47:08] <tiffany> why did you make a custom chat server?
[20:47:17] <tiffany> couldn't you have just thrown up inspircd?
[20:48:33] <barosl> tiffany, How did you know that! That's the way I had finally reached for :D
[20:48:57] <barosl> The actual method I used was to implement WebSocket plugin for inspircd
[20:49:09] <barosl> That is... hmm,
[20:49:12] <barosl> https://github.com/barosl/inspircd-m_websocket
[20:49:21] <tiffany> mainly that inspircd is my preferred ircd
[20:49:43] <tiffany> interesting
[20:49:52] <barosl> I talked about this with the inspircd devs, but the implementation is currently almost abandoned...
[20:49:58] <barosl> I'll revive it someday
[20:50:32] <tiffany> ah yeah
[20:50:46] <tiffany> is websocket just a raw tcp stream that is accessed from an http Upgrade?
[20:50:52] <barosl> Nope
[20:50:56] <barosl> It is message-based
[20:51:03] <tiffany> huh
[20:51:20] <barosl> There are two types of a payload - text and bytes
[20:51:29] <barosl> Even in the latter form, it is also a message
[20:51:34] <tiffany> there is going to be that one person
[20:51:59] <tiffany> who implements a stream protocol over websocket, which itself is datagrams over tcp streams, which is streams over IP datagrams...
[20:52:20] <barosl> Hmm, I just regarded each line of the IRC protocol as a message in WebSocket
[20:52:31] <tiffany> that's fair
[20:52:46] <tiffany> is there a message size limit?
[20:52:51] <barosl> I guess not
[20:53:03] <barosl> Well, there's one
[20:53:09] <barosl> But it's consideralby large
[20:53:19] <barosl> I guess that was at least >hunders of MBs
[20:53:23] <tiffany> I guess that's one benefit of datagramming over a stream protocol
[20:53:27] <tiffany> it does fragmentation for you
[20:53:46] <barosl> Ah, the WebSocket protocol itself has a fragmentation feature
[20:54:07] <barosl> It also has a concept of frame...
[20:54:20] <barosl> WebSocket is a fairly complex protocol
[20:54:30] *** Joins: swgillespie (swgillespie@moz-rn1.vmq.232.104.IP)
[20:54:40] <barosl> So my inspircd protocol only implements a very small part of it
[20:54:56] <barosl> (It doesn't support fragmentation, for example)
[20:55:08] <barosl> s/protocol/plugin
[20:56:01] <barosl> There were also some subtle disturbances
[20:57:05] <barosl> For example, if a "real" IRC clients send an invalid UTF-8 text, WebSocket-based ones disconnect immediately
[20:57:19] <tiffany> what
[20:57:33] <tiffany> why would websocket have its own fragmentation feature if tcp does that for you
[20:57:34] <tiffany> aughhh
[20:57:45] <barosl> So the server needs to check if the message is valid UTF-8 before handing it to WebSocket clients
[20:58:08] <tiffany> wait what?
[20:58:14] <tiffany> does websocket mandate that payloads be valid UTF-8?
[20:58:19] <tiffany> or just the clients
[20:58:37] <barosl> As I said above, there are two kinds of payload: text and bytes
[20:58:41] <barosl> The former mandates UTF-8
[20:58:42] <tiffany> oh, sorry
[20:59:04] <tiffany> is there any reasoning for making websocket this overcomplicated?
[21:00:02] <barosl> I think that was due to help(?) the application writers, not caring about manual byte handling (e.g. spliting the byte stream with line breaks)
[21:00:27] <barosl> They would just be happy if they could send/receive some JSON
[21:01:57] <tiffany> I'm guessing this was specified by the WHATWG
[21:02:12] <barosl> However for that reason the existing TCP servers cannot be connected from WebSocket clients directly
[21:02:12] <tiffany> so of course it was designed to be easy to use instead of extensible or composable
[21:02:20] <barosl> So I'm not sure that was a compelling reason
[21:03:05] <tiffany> at least it's better than polling, I suppose
[21:03:12] <barosl> Sure it is :P
[21:04:12] <tiffany> ugh I shouldn't have read the comments on that haskell post
[21:04:20] <tiffany> people trying to defend an O(N^2) algorithm
[21:05:33] <barosl> I didn't see it, but let me guess... Didn't they say the famous "a sophiscated compiler could have optimized it"?
[21:05:41] *** Quits: Astrum|Lap (Astrum|Lap@moz-7enfbr.co.comcast.net) (Client exited)
[21:06:33] <barosl> For better or worse, I see that phrasing a lot of times talking with genuine Haskellers...
[21:06:34] <tiffany> no, someone was just talking about how it's better for an algorithm to work with types that don't implement Ord than to scale beyond 100 element lists
[21:06:57] <tiffany> because nobody should ever need a list with more than 100 elements

[21:07:40] <tiffany> I hope that this is only a vocal minority of haskell's user base
[21:07:44] <tiffany> the language itself is pretty fun to program in

[21:12:29] <barosl> That cabal bug reminds me of this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20769183/cabal-update-failed-due-to-out-of-memory
[21:12:55] <barosl> `cabal update` also requires a lot of memory...
[21:12:58] <tiffany> the biggest problem I have while writing haskell is where it gets caught in some kind of loop and keeps building a thunk until it OOMs

[21:14:53] <barosl> My friend told me that if I'm used to Haskell, I could easily solve such space leaks
[21:15:04] <tiffany> your friend is probably not used to haskell
[21:15:18] <barosl> But is that really true? If that was real, how could even cabal make such a mistake?
[21:15:29] <barosl> So I'm pretty skeptical to it
[21:15:35] <tiffany> it's funny
[21:15:46] <barosl> Of course there's a possibility that cabal itself is not a good program ;)
[21:15:47] <tiffany> people tout haskell as being some sort of utopia of type safety
[21:15:50] <barosl> I heard a lot of complaint on it
[21:16:13] <tiffany> but when pattern matching, it doesn't check at compile time that at least one pattern is always reached
[21:16:18] <tiffany> it raises an exception at runtime
[21:16:31] <tiffany> it also doesn't catch any kind of infinite recursion
[21:16:34] <scott> that's one of the silliest things
[21:16:43] <barosl> What?
[21:16:45] <scott> I think -Wall or something catches missing patterns though
[21:16:47] <tiffany> it feels almost like writing a dynamic language when working in haskell
[21:16:51] <barosl> Doesn't it require exhaustive matching?
[21:16:54] <tiffany> because pattern matching is so flimsy
[21:17:12] <cmr> barosl: no.
[21:17:18] <barosl> Wait
[21:17:21] <scott> also too many partial functions in the prelude
[21:17:28] <barosl> Rust's `match` is exhaustive, isn't it?
[21:17:31] <cmr> yes
[21:17:31] <scott> yes
[21:17:34] <barosl> ???
[21:17:47] <barosl> Really? Haskell's `case` doesn't work like `match`?

[21:18:28] <tiffany> oh, scott's example is shorter than mine
[21:18:38] <barosl> Does -Wall catch that?
[21:18:48] <scott> yes
[21:18:52] <tiffany> ah
[21:18:53] <tiffany> yeah, it does

[21:20:06] <scott> "Patterns not matched: Nothing" has great possibilities for misunderstandings from beginners
[21:20:18] <cmr> lol
[21:20:41] <barosl> Huh, That's a warning in OCaml, too
[21:20:43] <cmr> rustc's error messages around exhaustivity are much nicer since jakub added witness printing.
[21:21:03] <cmr> iirc it's an NP-complete computation though
[21:21:14] <cmr> although that may have only been in the face of slice/range patterns, I can't remember
[21:21:28] <barosl> In Scala too!
[21:21:43] <barosl> Wow, so non-exhaustive-as-an-error is pretty rare in this field
[21:22:24] <barosl> That's... uncomfortable. I've always thought match should be exhaustive
[21:22:31] <barosl> Am I too Rust-biased?
[21:22:49] <JustAPerson> you don't have to be exhaustive, but Rust requires you to explicitly ignore other cases
[21:22:55] <JustAPerson> which in a sense is exhaustive

[21:47:40] <niconii> c74d3: yeah, i dunno, my sense of when to optimize is just weird in general
[21:48:36] <JustAPerson> c74d3: yea I would worry about caching intermediates because luac won't do common sub-expression elimination. I think the parser did constant folding though
[21:49:30] <c74d3> I think Lua does fold constants, but that's an extremely trivial optimization.
[21:49:37] <niconii> actually though, i went from ruby to forth to rust, so maybe it's just forth's fault...
[21:49:43] <JustAPerson> yea lol
[21:50:03] <barosl> niconii, Don't worry, I sometimes feel similar when I do some low-level programming. When I do C, I sometimes try to do some esoteric pointer handling to squeeze the last bits of the performance, which I never try to do in Python (which is, in fact, I can't!)
[21:50:34] <c74d3> Also I think it can't constant-fold things like `1 + x + 2`.
[21:51:07] <JustAPerson> c74d3: to be fair, a lot of that type of stuff is undefined for IEEE floats

[22:02:57] <barosl> Hmm, I think Python could do a similar thing
[22:03:29] <scott> WD-40: generally someone returns null meaning "no value" from a function and then someone using that function later on forgets to check if the return was null and tries using it
