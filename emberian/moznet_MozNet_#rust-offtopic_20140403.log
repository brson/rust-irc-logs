[05:02:27] <cmr> This HKT thread is the most fun I've had in a while
[05:02:31] * cmr has a pathetic existence
[05:10:23] <cmr> ChrisMorgan: sorry for the downvote btw, I still feel bad about it :(
[05:10:47] <ChrisMorgan> :D
[05:10:56] <ChrisMorgan> I'm quite serious about the marketing angle.
[05:11:02] <cmr> as is bstrie
[05:11:08] <cmr> I can't wait for him to step in and lay down the law
[05:11:13] <ChrisMorgan> Yep. ☺
[05:11:22] <cmr> and I agree with it for some things, but for this I just don't see it as an issue.
[05:11:53] <ChrisMorgan> It's not an issue yet in this direction, but it might become so. Not sure yet.
[05:12:19] * ChrisMorgan still doesn't understand the HKT problem and doesn't have time to dedicate to really trying to understand it for a few hours.
[05:12:45] <cmr> I think the biggest worry is that once we *have* the tools for HKT, the stdlib will start using them to be maximally useful, at which point it becomes part of the type signatures of commonly used things.
[05:16:03] <ChrisMorgan> Precisely.
[05:16:21] <cmr> but this still is not marketing :p
[05:17:04] <ChrisMorgan> Rejecting a feature on the grounds of "it's not good for marketing" would be an interesting situation to be in.
[05:17:48] <cmr> I mean... there's marketing, and then there is controlling language complexity.
[05:17:54] <cmr> Typestate clearly had to go.
[05:17:57] <cmr> As did modes.
[05:18:13] * cmr actually misses typestate sometimes
[05:18:27] <cmr> I think we're a better language without it though
[05:20:29] <cmr> I feel a trend that I think will continue until it's complete.
[05:20:37] <cmr> And that is Rust gaining Haskell's type system
[05:20:41] <cmr> not ghc's, but haskell's
[05:21:09] <cmr> it's well designed and has a lot of power.
[05:21:30] <cmr> and specifically it has a lot of type-level, zero-overhead power.
[05:21:34] <cmr> which is the best kind
[05:23:58] <Havvy> Maybe somebody can bolt typestate back onto Rust at some point?
[05:24:04] <cmr> doubt it
[05:24:09] <cmr> but maybe.
[05:25:26] <cmr> One thing I am coming to love, and I didn't realize this early in my formative years: I can study programming languages until I die and never run out of good material.
[05:26:37] <tiffany> what does typestate add over phantom types?
[05:28:02] *** Joins: alan_and_ (alan_andra@moz-B2C44770.car1.sanfrancisco1.level3.net)
[05:28:38] <cmr> I *believe* you can express typestate with phantom types, though I'd need to read the paper to be sure.

[05:30:21] <cmr> they were a lot easier to reach for though.
[05:30:30] <cmr> like assertions but in the type system.
[05:30:37] <cmr> (in terms of ease-of-use)
[05:31:41] <cmr> http://pcwalton.github.io/blog/2012/12/26/typestate-is-dead/
[05:37:50] <cmr> I believe but am not sure that what we have today is the subset of typestate which was in practice useful.
[05:38:09] <cmr> massaged into different forms.
[05:38:44] <cmr> (borrow checking, move checking, phantom types, and initialization checking)
[05:41:29] <ChrisMorgan> Typestate was removed before I started *using* Rust, but it had actually been one of the features that had attracted me to Rust initially.
[05:42:04] <cmr> it was both removed and unknown to me until I accidentally read old docs.
[05:42:17] <cmr> (which was hilariously common 0.5 ~ 0.7)
[05:42:23] <ChrisMorgan> I often wish that it was around.
[05:42:57] <ChrisMorgan> It was certainly well and truly dead by the time I started using Rust, in mid-2013.
[05:43:12] <cmr> I think they had to go for Rust to meet the niche it's aiming for -- systems.
[05:43:21] <cmr> it requires runtime assertions that aren't easily optimized.
[05:43:36] <cmr> and llvm certainly doesn't take advantage of or propagate conditions beyond null checks :\
[05:43:50] <cmr> (and some loop vectorization)
[05:57:28] <cmr> https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/rust-dev/2010-July/000001.html
[05:57:30] <cmr> super interesting
