[00:03:44] <kimundi> jmmk: Ah, well something defined locally in function is not visible outside of it - either move CardType outside of main, or fn get_company() into main()
[00:03:50] <jmmk> I'm just using Rust instead of C
[00:04:23] <jmmk> so the function should be declared inside the main block?

[01:46:20] <speckle> Sorry, I didn't mean C interoperability, FreeFull.  I had the idea that managing large quantities of homogenous objects could be done extremely fast, by using a "pool" of them in an array.  This could avoid memory fragmentation issues, but only if the memory is actually allocated continguously.
[01:47:03] <speckle> It's also relatively safe and simple, compared to some other ways of managing memory, I think.
[01:47:25] <speckle> Biggest obstacle is fulfilling the homogenousness requirement, I believe.

[05:27:01] <wycats> so weird
[05:27:06] <erickt> what's especially fun is when it expects a variable to be there, but then it doesn't use it, which triggers rustc's unused variable warning

[05:28:35] <wycats> say more
[05:28:53] <erickt> regarding what happens if we declare them in init, you can actually override a couple of these symbols

[09:05:35] <eddyb> (you're making me curious)
[09:05:44] <jeebus> well its about Types

[09:06:08] <jeebus> http://pastebin.com/bkxWWtPc
[09:06:25] <jeebus> and I'm trying to get my head around pointers but this problem seems to be with types
[09:06:43] <eddyb> Iterator<T> is a trait
[09:06:53] <jeebus> and the <T> where you can like pass in a type.. the commented out line in my paste works fine.. thats where I was a few days ago
[09:06:59] <jeebus> ok.. I kind of get that
[09:07:15] <jeebus> I get I could have done <T: Clone> and it then makes sure the thing I pass in has Clone trait?
[09:07:59] <eddyb> in your case, I think you want fn get_val<'a, I: Iterator<&'a [int]>>(chunks: &I) -> ~[int] { ... }
[09:08:09] <eddyb> but I think lifetimes like that are broken atm
[09:08:16] <jeebus> yeah thats what it says when I did that

[09:10:15] <jeebus> I tried <T: ChunkIter> initially but it didn't like that
[09:10:16] <eddyb> find the method in the docs and looks at its return type

[14:50:55] <rgomes> Couldn't the compiler decide whether a variable should be passed by value or reference automatically? I mean, since the callee defined whether it expect a variable by value or reference, the caller does not have any choice, correct? Since I have to pass by ref what is expected by ref, the usage of "&" is absolutely required (and even redundant). For this reason, it could be implicit. I mean, if I pass "a" instead of "&a", the compiler knows 
[14:50:57] <rgomes> that I should pass "&a". So the compiler would implicitly assume "&a" in any case. Does it make sense?

[14:53:34] <benh> Yes, there's no technical reason not to do that. But there's not a consensus that we want the & to be implicit. Also consider the &mut case, we likely don't want that implicit.
[14:53:49] <eddyb> rgomes: are you making an overly complicated case for auto-ref?
[14:53:54] <rgomes> I mean: the decision (possibly involving performance issues) would always be of the library designer (who whote the callee). If the library designer decides that it should be by ref instead of by value (possibly due to performance reasons), the caller code obviously needs to be recompiled, but no changes in the source code would be required. Does it make sense?
[14:53:59] <eddyb> I agree with implicit & and explicit &mut

[15:00:48] <rgomes> eddyb: again... I guess that the callee is ultimately responsible to tell whether a parameter must be mut. Then the caller simply pass "a", whatever circumstance it is. If the library writer changes the method signature, it may eventually does not compile anymore because a mut become a requirement. Does it make sense?

[15:07:14] <rgomes> eddyb: yes, I'm reading the stuff about lifetime, so this is why I asked... because most of the fime (if not always!) the compiler knows what are the "real intentions" of the developer. So, instead of throwing a confused error message (confused for newbies), why not assuming what is obviously the only choice?

[19:02:44] <mib_kww8hi> eddyb: i thought too but i tried to print something else after and the program never reachs this instruction

[19:57:33] <eddyb> I'm just saying that you could just use ~Tween (without the colon) if you weren't packing borrowed references
[19:57:45] <eddyb> though, hmm
[19:57:56] <eddyb> you can also construct the entire thing on the stack
[19:58:06] <flan3002> Because I want to change a value "from the background". The user (programmer) should not be aware that the Tween is modifying his values in the background. (Don't cry at me)

[19:59:58] <eddyb> why the two pointers?

[20:01:43] <Eridius> jroweboy: what function is it?
[20:01:58] <jroweboy> Yep. As I said, the c function takes a *mut *mut *c_char, so I was thinking I needed to allocate a *c_char and pass in a pointer to that buffer
[20:02:11] <rgomes> I guess I found a bug. Could someone confirm? http://paste.ubuntu.com/6978080/
[20:02:11] <eddyb> *mut c_char you mean :P

[20:04:24] <Eridius> jroweboy: ok, found the docs. No it doesn't
[20:04:32] <Eridius> you need to pass in a pointer to a "suitable variable"

It basically implements Java Collections Framework (JCF) but employing primitive types instead of Objects. The interesting bit is that it has a code generation tool which does the hard work of repeating basically the same thing for all combinations of datatypes involved. Maybe this would help you guys speed up the development of your collections library.

[23:42:27] <rgomes> huon btw : it is not explained in the reference manual of the language.
[23:42:31] <gmjosack> i guess the latter is appealing because it's a oneliner but that's not a compelling reason :)
[23:42:35] <sfackler> TaskBuilder iirc has a bunch of methods that take self by value and return the modified version
[23:43:10] <sfackler> but you could also do a more traditional java-style builder with methods like this:
[23:43:34] <sfackler> fn set_i<'a>(&'a mut self, i: int) -> &'a mut Foo { self.i = i; self }
[23:43:37] <huon> rgomes: yes, unfortunately it's not complete

[23:44:26] <rgomes> huon not a problem... I'm having a nice time with Rust (my first day). The only trouble Rust is causing me is that I'm not willing to go back to Scala anymore.
[23:44:40] <huon> (the language changes too fast for it to be feasible (and worth the effort) to keep the manual up-to-date, which is very bad for people trying to learn the language; but it will be getting better quickly as we approach 1.0.)
[23:44:44] <huon> rgomes: hahaha :)
[23:45:07] * huon has that problem too

[23:45:20] <gmjosack> rgomes: this explains it where the ref/tut don't: http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/master/guide-lifetimes.html
[23:45:25] <doomlord> i see somethign on the web claiming rustc -Z debug-info foo.rs  will compile with debug info... is this true?
[23:45:36] <huon> doomlord: it used to be the flag, yes
[23:45:44] <huon> it's been upgraded to `-g`
[23:45:58] <doomlord> awesome
[23:46:11] <rgomes> gmjosack thanks a lot :)
[23:46:39] <gmjosack> thanks sfackler, that helps. is the builder pattern the general solution to default params would you say or just having a lot of methods with different names
[23:46:49] <gmjosack> or something else i can't imagine right now :)

[23:48:26] <huon> the docs
[23:48:52] <sfackler> gmjosack: I think it depends. If it's just a couple of different options, I'll just use separate functions, but any more than that and it makes sense to switch to a builder
[23:49:07] <bjz> huon: ahh xD
[23:49:14] <gmjosack> makes sense. thanks

[23:51:10] <huon> bjz: (and macros too)
[23:51:10] <jroweboy> cpst: Are you supposed to return a A<'a, T> there?

[23:51:47] <SiegeLord> I changed the order of my mod statements and it went away
