[00:02:16] <barosl> jack, I think I should change Homu not to make the `homu-tmp` branch if the repo is configured with Travis
[00:02:23] <barosl> Because with Travis that behavior doesn't have meanings
[00:02:30] <barosl> It is Buildbot-specific

[01:10:46] <jack> raph: what license do you propose?
[01:10:55] <jack> anything that is MPL compatible is probably usable by servo.
[01:11:32] <raph> jack: apache 2 is the default here, the easiest for me
[01:11:34] <jack> We tend to use dual MIT / Apache-2.0 simply because that is the community norm in Rust, although servo itself is licensed under the MPL
[01:11:41] <jack> raph: that is totally fine.
[01:11:49] <raph> excellent
[01:12:05] <jack> Is the rejection of MIT because it lacks patent language?
[01:12:09] <jack> (just curious)
[01:12:29] <raph> mit is not rejected, i ended up using that for the markdown parser
[01:12:40] <raph> but i believe apache 2 is preferred for that reason
[01:13:05] <raph> dual licensing is, however, rejected
[01:13:24] <raph> i do not speak for my employer, this is just my interpretation
[01:14:03] <raph> i make no claims for how _useful_ my font renderer will be (it doesn't do hinting), but i think it's good that such a thing will exist in pure rust
[01:14:15] <jack> I'm super happy such a thing will exist :)
[01:14:42] <raph> plus i want to experiment with using simd in it - right now i have a c intrinsics module i link in
[01:14:51] <jack> You teased me with it before, but said it was unlikely to get into a usable state. I'm happy to see otherwise :)
[01:15:27] <jack> raph: is hinting needed on retina displays?
[01:15:47] <raph> jack: it is not

[09:37:29] <jgraham> (well we get the event and then bail early in handle_load_complete)
[09:37:43] <jgraham> Sorry load_complete_msg
[09:38:28] <gw> jgraham: hmmm I did account for that (I think) when refactoring all that code, but I would have to revisit the code to remember how
[09:38:38] <gw> let me take a look

[09:40:14] <jgraham> gw: At least at first glance I don't see where we send CompositorMsg::LoadComplete, and I didn't account for this so we never send webdriver_msg::LoadComplete
[09:41:19] *** Joins: FreeFull (freefull@moz-s98r58.range5-81.btcentralplus.com)
[09:42:25] <gw> jgraham: oh wait, I think that LoadComplete msg is not what you are wanting to use - it's not really useful for determining if a page is loaded, and I don't rely on it when checking if a screenshot is ready to output (if I'm looking at the right thing that you are talking about)
[09:45:27] <gw> jgraham: yea. that LoadComplete message is sent after the script task has loaded the resources, but before the DOM onload event has actually been fired. and so, that can often change the DOM state and resulting output. So I think you need to not do things for webdriver in that load_complete event. Does that make sense? Or am I completely misunderstanding
[09:45:27] <gw> what you're asking?
[09:46:12] <jgraham> gw: That makes sense, but it does rather make me wonder a) what the point of that message is, and b) what I should use instead

[09:47:47] <jgraham> Ms2ger: Well since I've now written a large fraction of the spec…
[09:47:57] <Ms2ger> Good point
[09:48:23] <gw> jgraham: I'm not entirely sure what the point of that message was for - I contemplated removing it as it didn't actually seem useful, but I left it since the CEF build was using it for something, and the patch was already big enough. Just looking now into what you can use
[09:48:40] *** Quits: Viewtiful (Viewtiful@moz-eub.afi.30.89.IP) (Quit: Leaving...)
[09:49:11] <jgraham> Ms2ger: I want the load event, I think
[09:50:04] <jgraham> gw: I suspect the CEF has the same race condition? It looks like something is trying to use that event to determine whether it's possible to navigate back or forward in history from the current position
[09:51:05] <jgraham> Ms2ger: (well I mean, I do want the load event, but actually I think it doesn't *really* matter if I got DOMContentLoaded instead for the tests, because there is another layer that will check that the load event fired before doing anything)
[09:51:38] <gw> jgraham: I think in CEF it is only used for some UI display stuff (maybe saving a history url item?) or something like that, so it doesn't matter that it's not technically correct
[09:51:43] *** Joins: gandalf (zbraniecki@moz-bhj4fq.dyn.optonline.net)
[09:52:00] <gw> jgraham: but yes, it could be a race there too
[09:52:41] <gw> jgraham: so, what is it that you actually need to know? when the load event has fired? or safe to output an image? (can you directly use is_ready_to_paint_image_output in the compositor?)
[09:52:55] <jgraham> Allegedely users care if the UI is buggy. Fortunately we don't actually have any users!
[09:53:17] <jgraham> gw: Here I just want the load event, not the extra is-it-safe-to-paint gubbins
[09:54:41] <gw> jgraham: ok. so, see how in handle_loads_complete it pushes a DocumentProgressTask::Load msg to the script task?
[09:55:33] <gw> jgraham: at some point later in time, the script task's event loop picks that up and calls dispatch_load() (see the runnable impl at the bottom of document.rs)
[09:55:58] <jgraham> The latter part I found, the former not yet. Which file?
[09:56:19] <gw> jgraham: if you then hook into document::dispatch_load(), that's after the onload event has actually been fired, and a reflow gets triggered. I think that should handle what you want?
[09:56:55] <jgraham> Yeah, that makes sense
[09:57:19] <jgraham> Just add another compositor message so it gets notified about the document load event?
[09:57:21] <gw> jgraham: so I imagine the race you're seeing is that your webdriver msg gets sent before the script task's event loop gets to do the actual onload event dispatch
[09:57:50] <gw> jgraham: sure, that sounds reasonable if you need to know in the compositor? or do you mean constellation perhaps?
[09:58:07] <jgraham> constellation
[09:58:12] <gw> yep, cool
[09:58:28] * gw had almost purged all that race condition work from his memory :)
[09:59:02] * jgraham finds it very confusing that constellation and compositor and long words beginning with c and both live under compositing :)
[09:59:20] <jgraham> *are
[09:59:35] <jgraham> gw: Thanks
[10:00:03] <gw> no probs :)

[13:32:14] <larsberg> Ms2ger: Thanks - I appreciate it! I'm happy to share the blame :-) FWIW, I think we need to spend a *lot* more time thinking about script/layout interactions. The whole "we'll send a message unless that's too slow and then we'll just take some locks and read raw memory" makes my skin crawl (though I haven't checked if that survived the smup, tbh).
[13:32:47] <Ms2ger> Do we have projects for our research assistants yet? :)
[13:34:09] <larsberg> Ms2ger: cimes will be starting out working on hooking up some nifty tuning libraries. The general idea is that it reads the browser perf (e.g., are we hitting 60fps?) and some other metrics to determine if we can do things like turning off aggressive JIT, overeager work-stealing intervals, etc. to save power without impacting the experience.

[18:31:49] <pcwalton> jgraham: yeah
[18:31:55] <pcwalton> I'm kind of sad that we're quickly growing technical debt that is making it harder and harder to move to e10s
[18:32:02] <pcwalton> we need to do the big e10s move Real Soon

[18:32:09] <pcwalton> well, it's not e10s safe
[18:32:19] <jgraham> So what's the replacement pattern?
[18:32:20] <pcwalton> I have a Server abstraction in my e10s patch
[18:32:23] <pcwalton> that is the replacement
[18:32:36] <pcwalton> we're making the same mistake Gecko did
[18:32:50] <pcwalton> so I think we need multiprocess really soon

[18:34:46] <zmike_> Savago: see above
[18:35:53] <Savago> zmike_: yeah, after my experiments on rpi2, it became clear that we will need a linux egl surface in rust-layers (just like I’ve asked yesterday in this channel).
[18:36:04] <Savago> As a result, I’m planning to start working on this next.
[18:36:12] <zmike_> ah, so you are actively going to work on that?
[18:36:33] *** Joins: eagen (eagen@moz-n89.v87.246.198.IP)
[18:36:45] <Savago> zmike_: define ‘actively’? I thought working was a binary state: work, don’t work. :-)
[18:37:06] <aturon> Savago: hey there -- by the time i was ready to give some feedback on your proposal, I think you'd left the channel. I definitely think you should submit something. I'd encourage you to focus on bits that will be applicable to the widest Rust audience possible
[18:37:55] <aturon> also, to anyone in this channel: we'd love to have a RustCamp talk (or maybe more) about Servo, especially if it can shed some interesting/reusable light on Rust
[18:38:20] <jgraham> pcwalton: I would just prefer a situation where the webdriver could be rewritten asap rather than turning it off today and blocking on e10s landing to start working on the required changes
[18:38:30] <aturon> (send 'em here: http://cfp.rustcamp.com/events/rustcamp-2015 -- only a few days left, and the earlier you submit, the better your chance of getting feedback/iterating before we settle the program)
[18:38:30] <pcwalton> sure, that makes sense
[18:38:57] <Savago> aturon: coolio, I may extend the section where the servo deps (e.g. rust-layers, glutin, rust-clipboard, rust-offscreen, etc) had to be changed to make them work on rpi2.
[18:39:56] <Savago> aturon: besides that, you think the first draft is ok for being submitted?
[18:40:23] <aturon> Savago: sure! better to get something in quickly and get feedback from the whole staff
[18:40:36] <Savago> Coolio, will do it ATM.
[18:44:06] <tomaka> Savago: by the way, glutin already supports EGL on linux
[18:44:26] <tomaka> Savago: but I have a problem, in that I don't know if it should choose EGL or GLX
[18:44:38] <tomaka> some proprietary drivers don't support EGL, so GLX would be preferred
[18:44:48] <tomaka> but on the raspi, EGL is preferred because GLX is not accelerated
[18:44:49] <pcwalton> tomaka: yeah, it's an interesting problem. I'm not sure how to detect at runtime
[18:44:50] <Savago> tomaka: interesting!
[18:45:02] <pcwalton> it's even worse, on some devices like ODROID it depends on how the system is set up
[18:45:13] <pcwalton> ARM supplies two libMali.so drivers, one for EGL, one for GLX
[18:45:21] <pcwalton> the local libMali.so will either be one or the other
[18:45:28] <pcwalton> I'm not sure how to tell at runtime
[18:45:35] <Savago> pcwalton: is the GLX accelerated?
[18:45:46] <pcwalton> yes… IF your libMali.so is the GLX one :)
[18:45:51] <pcwalton> if it's the EGL one, then it won't be accelerated
[18:45:56] <Savago> oh, I see.
[18:45:57] <zmike_> tomaka: mixing egl+glx can lead to an xlib deadlock at present, so I think it's unlikely that we'd want to use egl until layers also has egl support
[18:45:57] <pcwalton> (isn't it fun?) :)
[18:46:16] <tomaka> :-/
[18:46:18] <zmike_> though I have seen some activity on the issue recently, so perhaps it will be fixed
[18:46:49] <zmike_> (and by "can lead to..." I mean it deadlocks immediately)

[18:50:48] <tomaka> Savago: yes but I noticed it was very slow
[18:50:49] <cmr> Why would glutin impact performance?

[18:51:18] <tomaka> I don't know
[18:51:49] <Savago> I can check it out. Is there any example/standalone app included in glutin?

[19:09:47] <crowbot> PR #12: Fix build in Raspberry Pi2. - https://github.com/servo/libfreetype2/pull/12
[19:10:55] <Savago> tomaka: I was talking with derek (from our team @Open Source Group). It seems that the default propertary gles driver in rpi2 has its quirkies.
[19:11:19] <Savago> But there is an opensource driver that is being developed and has some advantages.
[19:11:44] <Savago> I think it makes sense to check what is the status of glutin on both drivers (close, open).
[19:12:11] <Savago> I would rather not have to write workarounds in glutin for a bOrKeD driver if there is a better one available. :-)

[20:51:26] <pcwalton> better to ask forgiveness than permission
[20:51:52] <mwu> yeah I think in this case, we just have to hope tests and asserts cover the things we care about

[20:52:01] <jack> +1
[20:52:01] <pcwalton> being lawyerly about review procedures isn't a good idea
[20:52:02] <mwu> because there are just too many changes to really review
[20:52:31] <jack> pcwalton: one way to interpret it is being lawyerly. another is that we're passive aggressively trying to get someone to volunteer to review that code now :)
[20:52:40] <pcwalton> I can review it right now

[21:35:04] <jack> gw: the root crate depends on gleam from github apparently
[21:35:48] <jack> gw: https://github.com/servo/servo/blob/master/ports/gonk/Cargo.toml#L54-L55
[21:35:57] <gw> jack: oh wait, it worked this time.
[21:36:00] <jack> Change that and your problem should get fixed :)
[21:36:00] <gw> jack: pushing update
[21:36:04] <mwu> jack: hmm, the travis config actually tries to build mozjs?
[21:36:23] <jack> mwu: via cargo, yes
[21:36:27] <mwu> jack: I have to add a hack to the travis config to install a newer gcc then..
[21:36:35] <jack> it's a thin crate wrapper on a native library.
[21:36:51] <gw> jack: ok, that should be better now
[21:37:44] <mwu> the hack is on the bindings side, but we didn't have a travis config before to run it on mozjs-sys
[21:38:32] <jack> servo is 75% off in the steam summer sale :) haha

[21:43:03] <jack> i wonder how rust-mozjs built, or did it already have this hack?
[21:43:28] <mwu> it already had that hack. but I have no idea how it built without the new sm landing first
[21:43:42] <mwu> I guess nothing was actually trying to link against the new sm symbols
[21:44:45] <pcwalton> 67 errors in gfx :(
[21:44:47] <mwu> oh it's probably a combo. without the new sm, you don't need the hack. and the bindings probably don't actually look for the symbols at this point
[21:46:03] <mwu> oh, nope, it failed to build

[23:50:21] <emiliocobos> pcwalton: Just a question about what you have just sent to the mailing list, how should values be retrieved from the canvas task from now on, for example? I guess we should start using another kind of IPC approach? Just curious :)
[23:50:41] <pcwalton> so I need to get the Server abstraction ready
[23:50:58] <pcwalton> which will allow this sort of thing to be done in an IPC-safe way
[23:51:06] <pcwalton> I'm working on porting over all code to use it right now
[23:51:12] <pcwalton> (well, I'm first getting things to compile)
[23:52:15] <gw> ahh, the same tests have failed in other PRs today
[23:52:22] * gw hits retry again
[23:52:34] <emiliocobos> Oh nice, I think I understand what kind of model you do have on your head, thanks! :P

[23:53:33] <emiliocobos> gw: I think you added an extra colon in #6423
[23:53:33] <crowbot> Issue #6423: Use euclid from crates.io - https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/6423
[23:54:39] <gw> emiliocobos: I normally use a colon - did you force push to that branch perhaps? it probably needs a new r+ if that's the case
[23:55:37] <emiliocobos> yep, that's it then
[23:56:03] <gw> cool, added an r+

[23:59:31] <pcwalton> maybe I should land multiprocess behind a flag even though it's broken, to allow everyone time to fix everything
[23:59:54] <pcwalton> although actually I dunno, maintaining two paths may be more work than just fixing it
