[02:42:10] <Seldaek> search now sort of works: http://seld.be/rustdoc/std/index.html
[02:42:39] <Seldaek> probably not perfect, and don't pay attention to the result styling, but it gives back results and is pretty fast so that's nice
[02:43:20] <Seldaek> and the whole std index is 25kb gzipped, that's quite alright
[12:47:04] <cmr> Seldaek: thanks for the PR <3
[12:47:16] <Seldaek> eh no problem, I got sick of seeing these wildcards everywhere ;)
[12:47:36] <Seldaek> then I had a minor heart attack  when I realized there's no regex module in rust yet
[12:47:44] <Seldaek> but then ti turns out match is pretty awesome
[12:47:56] <cmr> yeah, match is really nice for state machines
[12:48:04] <Seldaek> if you do improve this stuff though I'd be curious to see what you do to it
[12:48:26] <cmr> The "ideal" thing to be would find the greatest common prefix on all the lines and removing it
[12:48:35] <Seldaek> it's a bit messy because you have two comment cleaning functions now, but I didn't see the previous one before I was done :)
[12:48:47] <cmr> That... isn't cheap though, the naive way I can think of is O(n^3)
[12:49:30] <Seldaek> ah yeah, well it's also not really needed I think.. I made sure it only ever strips one space after * though
[12:49:34] <dbaupp> cmr: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8578349/longest-common-prefix-for-n-string
[12:49:44] <Seldaek> should cover 99% of sane docblocks
[12:49:59] <cmr> dbaupp: hah, nice!
[12:51:12] <cmr> Seldaek: right, I'm not very motivated on improving it anymore
[12:51:18] <dbaupp> cmr: also, http://discuss.leetcode.com/questions/196/longest-common-prefix appears to be O(n^2)
[12:51:42] <Seldaek> cmr: anyway with that and search working,  Ijust need to apply markdown rendering and once we have impls it'll be looking really good :)
[12:52:00] <dbaupp> Seldaek: the search is awesome!
[12:52:23] <cmr> dbaupp: you're right, I don't know where I got O(n^3) from
[12:52:40] <dbaupp> cmr: checking each prefix in turn?
[12:52:45] <cmr> Yes, the search is *very* awesome
[12:53:00] <cmr> dbaupp: maybe
[12:53:06] * cmr just woke  up, hasn't had caffeine yet
[12:53:38] <Seldaek> I was worried about the search when I tried it at first it took 5 min to "tokenize" the index
[12:53:57] <Seldaek> but it's because by default this lib stores the index in a websql db in the browser
[12:54:17] <Seldaek> once I switched to in-memory index it takes half a second or something now
[12:54:20] <cmr> websql? didn't that die for indexeddb?
[12:54:29] <Seldaek> yeah indexeddb 
[12:54:42] <Seldaek> it's kinda dead too though
[12:54:46] <Seldaek> and apparently slow as fuck
[12:54:58] <cmr> I don't know about the first but the second is definitely true
[12:55:14] <cmr> I evaluated it for the persistent store of a browser game and it's not really suitable
[12:55:19] <Seldaek> anyway.. working well now, I'll also need to refactor my code a bit to support building multiple crates at once
[12:55:51] <Seldaek> then if we can search over extra and std at once, that'll make my day
[12:56:21] <cmr> dbp, the author of rustle, contacted me about reviving it based on rustdoc_ng
[12:56:44] <cmr> I told him to make it a plugin, so maybe rustdoc_web can integrate a rustle-like search
[12:56:56] <dbaupp> that'd be awesome!
[12:56:56] <cmr> (it's a search based on type signature, a-la  hoogle, whatever that is)
[12:57:06] * dbaupp misses hoogle
[12:57:11] <Seldaek> yeah I saw hoogle, but didn't quite get the point 
[12:57:48] <Seldaek> I guess I haven't done enough with statically typed languages to get the problem it solves
[12:58:00] <dbaupp> generic functions + parameteric polymorphism + search by type = find the function that solves your problem
[12:58:24] <Seldaek> but sure we could integrate it as an advanced search thing I guess
[12:59:04] <dbaupp> as an example, remove duplicate from a list, http://www.haskell.org/hoogle/?hoogle=Eq%20a%20%3D%3E%20[a]%20-%3E%20[a] (`nub` is the appropriate function.)
[13:00:00] <cmr> How does one read that type signature?
[13:00:36] <dbaupp> that type signature is equivalent to `<a: Eq>(_: [a]) -> [a]`
[13:00:40] <cmr> Ah
[13:00:45] <cmr> Yes, that makes sense
[13:00:51] <cmr> that's nice syntax
