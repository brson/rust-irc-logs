[03:03:33] <dbaupp> fwiw, I thought of a way to get in-comment links, ignoring the syntax, something like [`foo`]<std::bar::foo> or [`baz`]<self::baz> would just add `use auto_gen_1 = std::bar::foo; use auto_gen_2 = self::baz` to the view items of the current module, and then after running resolve, it would go in and fetch out the resolved target of the auto_gen_xxx names, and perform the appropriate linking
[04:07:31] <dbaupp> cmr, acrichto, etc: ^ does that seem infeasible/have any of you experimented with something similar?

[13:30:16] <acrichto> dbaupp: that's an interesting idea
[13:30:50] <acrichto> I suppose integrating the docs with the build process could get interesting
[13:31:00] <acrichto> b/c you'll start getting successful builds an failed doc builds
[13:31:14] <acrichto> I do like the idea of supporting a syntax for linking names in documentation though
[13:34:18] <dbaupp> ah, yeah, because resolve may fail
[13:34:50] <acrichto> that's not necessarily a bad thing
[13:34:56] <acrichto> but we may want to start integrating it into the bot builders
[13:35:42] <dbaupp> don't they just run make (which builds the docs at the end)?
[13:36:45] <acrichto> I think the normal bots all have docs disabled
[13:36:51] <acrichto> building docs requires the explicit 'make docs' target
[13:36:55] <acrichto> (what the doc builders run)
[13:37:50] <dbaupp> This is pdfTeX, Version 3.1415926-2.5-1.40.14 (TeX Live 2013/Debian)
[13:37:50] <dbaupp>  restricted \write18 enabled.
[13:37:51] <dbaupp> entering extended mode
[13:37:51] <dbaupp> rustdoc: doc/std/index.html
[13:37:51] <dbaupp> rustdoc: doc/extra/index.html
[13:37:56] <dbaupp> (at the end of a `make` invocation)
[13:38:00] <acrichto> really?
[13:38:04] <acrichto> wow, nevermind then
[13:38:08] <dbaupp> that's what I see yeah
[13:38:10] <acrichto> awesome
[13:38:28] <acrichto> I'd also absolutely love to get test extraction working
[13:38:40] <acrichto> but that's hard :(
[13:38:44] <dbaupp> we're starting to be really markdown specific...
[13:39:08] <dbaupp> (not that that's a bad thing, per se)
[13:39:21] <acrichto> hm that is definitely something to consider
[13:40:26] <dbaupp> I don't know how we can do anything other than be format-language-specific though
[13:40:50] <dbaupp> (... presumably we can have more than one supported format though)
[13:41:24] <acrichto> I don't think that it's too bad, but I don't have a whole lot of experience in the area
[13:41:33] * dbaupp doesn't either
[14:14:19] <cmr> I don't think it's possible to have a good doc experience independant of formatting language.
[14:14:54] <cmr> That said, it's not inconceivable that someone might integrate a different formatting language with the same amount of support.
[14:15:26] <cmr> dbaupp: I think it's a very good idea, though it does have the problem of hard failure if a link doesn't resolve.
[14:15:53] <dbaupp> cmr: well it's invalid "source", so that's fine (from my perspective)
[14:16:25] <cmr> Actually it doesn't have that problem at all, you're right.
[14:16:33] <cmr> It's a "problem" but it's good: links can't go stale
[14:16:50] <cmr> Where would the `use` get injected though? Into the body of the item?
[14:17:16] <dbaupp> the only place they can go: the view items of the enclosing module
[14:17:46] <dbaupp> (can sensibly go)
[14:19:20] <dbaupp> I'm thinking we might want to change the syntax slighly so that a intramodule/submodule link to `foo` is just [text]<foo> or [text]<bar::foo> (for foo in the bar submodule of the current module) since I imagine these will be the most common and [text]<::std::foo> would be from the crate root
[14:19:45] <dbaupp> (the former would currently hvae to be `self::foo` which isn't so nice?)
[14:21:45] <cmr> Automatically add self:: unless it starts with a `::`, like non-use paths work?
[14:22:33] <dbaupp> something like that
[14:23:03] <dbaupp> (do self::super::foo and self::self::bar work? well, if not, we can just make them work for consistency)
[14:24:18] <cmr> no idea

[20:15:03] <Seldaek> slow replacement laptop is slow
[20:15:09] <Seldaek> been compiling rust since this morning :p
[20:29:38] <cmr> Seldaek: Linux?
[21:53:38] <Seldaek> cmr: yup
[21:54:50] <cmr> Seldaek: There are nightlies for arch and ubuntu
[21:55:02] <cmr> The arch packages are just tarballs that work on most any recent distro
[21:56:04] <Seldaek> yeah I realize butI wanted to build it once so I can then try to patch some stuff 
[21:56:13] <cmr> mmm
[21:56:34] <Seldaek> didn't realize it'd take so long
[21:56:58] <Seldaek> well anyway it's done by now
[21:57:51] <Seldaek> interesting, it installed rustc but rust can't be found
[21:58:17] <Seldaek> is it gone?
[21:58:42] <cmr> yes
[22:01:23] <Seldaek> wut
[22:01:27] <Seldaek> why :(
[22:01:56] <Seldaek> you look away for 5min and boom
[22:01:58] <cmr> unmaintained, occasionally buggy, not prioritized
[22:02:05] <cmr> discussed in the most recent meeting
[22:02:42] <Seldaek> eh well, sad. IMO "rust run ..." is a very important feature 
[22:02:47] <Seldaek> for new users
[22:03:04] <Seldaek> core devs shouldn't be allowed to make decisions like that
[22:03:21] <Seldaek> they're too detached from the peons 
[22:03:33] <cmr> If someone steps up to maintain it, it can be added back.
[22:04:00] <Seldaek> was there so much to maintain?
[22:04:14] <cmr> It was segfaulty, especially on mac
[22:04:21] <Seldaek> maybe I'll just PR a rustc run 
[22:04:25] <cmr> yeah
[22:04:33] <cmr> engla mentioned that in #rust-internals
[22:05:01] <Seldaek> ok there is hope yet :p
