[00:17:51] <Ilari> If things like the recent MS certificate misissuance happen, wonder how hardened the thing actually is against attacks (seems like if you can hijack DNS, you can get false certs)...

[04:52:20] <bascule> Ilari: from what I've just heard, the OpenSSL "high" severity attack only applies to OpenSSL 1.0.2
[04:52:31] <bascule> in which case, IDGAF :D
[04:52:46] <bascule> we have not approved OpenSSL 1.0.2 for use at Square yet
[04:53:05] <bascule> also I was just trading SSL Labs reports with some people from Uber
[04:53:12] <bascule> they get a B, we get an A :D

[17:40:30] <Ilari> Also, how the heck one gets important data like private keys into the same buffer containing reply data or somesuch?
[17:56:28] <Ilari> There should be TLS implementation that is 1) Secure. 2) Not academic excercise. :-/
[17:57:23] <bascule> Ilari: because OpenSSL had some sort of wacky allocator that violates your assumptions about how things should be laid out
[17:57:59] <bascule> that reminds me of one of my favorite questions / quotes
[17:58:11] <bascule> "Full stack developer eh? Do you know what direction the stack grows?"
[17:58:20] <cmr> lol
[17:59:21] <Ilari> amd64 call stack or software stack?
[17:59:27] <bascule> hahaha
[17:59:35] <bascule> I'll accept the call stack for any ISA ;)
[17:59:49] <bascule> doesn't Solaris/SPARC have some sort of crazy circular insanity?
[18:02:23] <sfackler> doesn't mips or something let you configure the stack to grow up or down?
[18:03:14] <Ilari> Oh, also, Super NES and Gameboy call stacks grow down (and Super NES is also little-endian)... Needed to deal with that not too many months ago. :->
[18:04:16] <cmr> sfackler: ARM, too.
[18:04:28] <tiffany> The mill's stack is supposed to grow upwards
[18:04:48] <Ilari> Also, some archs have flag that sets if words are little endian or big endian.
[18:05:17] <Ilari> I think at least one arch Linux runs on (PA-RISC?) had grow-up stacks. 
[18:07:19] <Ilari> Also, doesn't i386 protected mode have segments with minimum instead of maximum valid address?
[18:11:53] <Ilari> Oh yup, it has expand-down data segments (but not code segments).

[19:05:24] <eternaleye> "Just think, if we keep deploying DNSSEC, we can start taking TV networks offline IN REAL TIME."
[19:06:28] <bascule> yeah lolololololol
[19:06:47] <eternaleye> Heh. tptacek has a way with words; I really enjoyed his old "Dowd's Inhuman Flash Exploit" post
[19:07:36] <eternaleye> (http://chargen.matasano.com/chargen/2007/7/27/this-new-vulnerability-dowds-inhuman-flash-exploit.html)
[19:07:53] <eternaleye> >> So that’s pretty bad-ass. But that’s not why the fate of humanity demands that we hunt down Dowd and dissolve him in molten steel.
[19:09:05] <bascule> heh
[19:11:26] <eternaleye> >> Ok actually there’s no catch. Dowd’s exploit uses a NULL pointer write32 to knock the locks off the bytecode interpreter in Flash, sothat his SWF file can run bytecode that will rewrite the system stack.
[19:11:33] <eternaleye> >> But, just to rub it in, or because this stuff just comes natural toyou when you are manufactured by a malicious cluster of supercomputers inside SkyNet instead of nurtured by loving human parents, Dowd /gives himself additional constraints./

[21:01:37] <eternaleye> Mm

[23:03:01] <Ilari> Hmm... Does there exist an polynomial-time algorithm that takes e.g. SAT problem and converts it to set of X.509 certificates that are valid iff the original SAT was satisfiable?
[23:03:15] <mcpherrin> Ilari: lol
[23:03:19] <cmr> lol, that sounds fun
[23:05:37] <eternaleye> Ilari: ...are you actually trying to prove that certificate validity is NP-hard?

[23:08:21] <Ilari> Also, is there family of set of DNSSEC zones such that arbitrary domains can't be validated in LOGSPACE (the validation is definitely in P)? :-)
[23:09:13] <Ilari> eternaleye: It could very well be something worse than NP-complete. E.g. PSPACE-complete or something even harder.
[23:11:44] <Ilari> eternaleye: The problem is that X.509 in presence of cross-certification can go really wild, and need to evaluate each certificate multiple times...
[23:11:50] <eternaleye> I can see it now: An asymmetric cryptosystem based on the hardness of certificate validity.

[23:55:47] <Ilari> Quality of X.509 code: Two different products both could be made to attempt to encrypt using DSA, leading to bluescreen or internal error.
[23:56:32] <Ilari> Application crashing I could understand (e.g. try to call NULL method), but bluescreen?
[23:58:11] <bascule> Ilari: did you check out trevp's Noise 2.0 proposal?
[23:58:21] <Ilari> bascule: Not really.
[23:58:25] <bascule> heh
[23:58:45] <bascule> he wants to make Noise into a more general framework for D-H key exchanges
