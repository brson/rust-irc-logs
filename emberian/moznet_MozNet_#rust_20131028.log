[00:02:13] <sanxiyn> http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Graphite-4.8 suggests Graphite's main developer moved to LLVM

[03:44:48] <jdavis> what does "impl<'self>" mean? I've seen that a few places, but I don't know which document to look in and it's not a very google-able term.
[03:45:05] <strcat> jdavis: defines lifetime/type parameters for the impl
[03:45:09] <strcat> that's a lifetime parameter
[03:45:17] <strcat> impl<T> Foo for Bar<T> {}
[03:45:21] <jdavis> OK. Is there a document where I can read more?
[03:45:27] <strcat> impl<'self, T> Foo for &'self [T] {}

[03:47:33] <strcat> jdavis: there is a naming restriction atm (must be called 'self) but it's no different than a regular lifetime parameter
[03:47:44] <strcat> have you read the borrowed pointer tutorial?
[03:47:58] <strcat> it doesn't cover impl lifetimes specifically, but it does cover lifetimes and named lifetimes (for functions)
[03:49:04] <jdavis> OK. I will try re-reading that doc. Thank you.

[08:10:22] <kimundi> Yeah, the type inside the HashMap is ~str, and the access functions give you references to that, so you get &~str
[08:11:04] <kimundi> You need to either look up with a ~str, or use the access methods that are generic over Equiv

[08:16:07] <dbaupp> jstevans: the problem with your original code is .split_str_iter() iterates over substrings (i.e. sharing the same memory), so they have type &str linked to the parent string, so the vectors are ~[&str], which means you can't assign a ~str, because (1) mismatched types, and (2) matching types by making a &str will make a &str with a different lifetime (i.e. it's not part of the original string)

[09:26:09] <kimundi> Maybe, but it's not a high priority right now. If it is possible to bind to a safe C implementation right now, then there is no reason to put work into right now.

[09:39:29] <geal> HollyRain: the problem with crypto code is that you often need constant time algorithms. It is already quite hard to do in C. With Rust's compiler changing often, it would be hard to write constant time code

[11:51:04] <bjz> I'd like to do this: let xs = [1, 2, 3]; xs.mut_iter().map(|x| *x += 1); xs
[11:51:13] <bjz> I thought map was lazy though?
[11:51:20] <engla> you need something to drain the iterator yeah
[11:51:24] <engla> for example .len()
[11:51:47] <engla> or just a for loop

[11:53:01] <bjz> let xs = [1, 2, 3]; for x in xs.mut_iter().filter(|x| *x > 1) { *x += 1; } xs
[11:53:13] <engla> I'm not sure if there are situations where an expression like .apply(|x| *x += 1)  is better than a for loop. Apply would be something like .map().len()

[12:51:18] <geal> there were a lot of functional language fans at scala.io, as you could expect. But they had no problems with doing some trampolines from time to time

[15:05:51] <SimonSapin> I need to recursively traverse a tree, and maintaining an explicit stack for an external iterator is just a pain (and I’m getting it wrong.) I’d like to switch to an "old-style" internal iterator with a callback
[15:06:19] <SimonSapin> But I’m getting this: error: use of moved value, note: `callback` moved here because it has type `&fn<no-bounds>(&stylesheets::StyleRule)`, which is a non-copyable stack closure (capture it in a new closure, e.g. `|x| f(x)`, to override)
[15:07:32] <SimonSapin> A new closure like this seems silly, and they would chain with depth of the tree
[15:07:33] <eddyb> hmm, I implemented a tree once, and I had no stack, just parent pointers on nodes. but that was in C++, I guess it's harder to do in Rust
[15:07:58] <SimonSapin> the depth-firt traversal has a stack
[15:09:13] <bodie_> perhaps there is a stackless way of doing it.
[15:09:17] <SimonSapin> A simplification of my tree is struct T { stuff: Foo, children: ~[T] }
[15:09:24] <Sharp> Isn't Rust like, really good at recursing trees?
[15:09:33] <SimonSapin> with a recursive function I can use the call stack

[15:10:01] <SimonSapin> no
[15:10:14] <SimonSapin> but the type system wants we to do silly no-op closures at each depth level
[15:10:20] <eddyb> SimonSapin: is a parent pointer out of the question?
[15:10:41] <SimonSapin> eddyb: how would that help?
[15:11:00] <SimonSapin> I can use @-pointers, the whole thing has to be Send-able

[15:11:24] <eddyb> SimonSapin: I'm not sure if it applies for that specific case, but you can build stackless iterators if you have parent pointers

[15:13:46] *** jorendorff is now known as jorendorff_away
[15:13:52] <bodie_> if anyone has any input on this question, it would be welcome: I'm trying to implement a Redis interface for Rust.  I am new to Rust but a great learner and familiar with C.  Redis is a database engine that uses a simple TCP access protocol.  Should I: a) Write it from scratch.  b) Wrap the existing C client.  c) Write a small C library to encapsulate the simple and well-defined set of requests my application will be making to Redis, and 
[15:13:52] <bodie_> wrap that
[15:14:06] <Sharp> SimonSapin: Seems likely, Rust doesn't really do closures that well.
[15:14:11] <Sharp> AFAICT.
[15:14:32] <cmr> SimonSapin: At the moment, unfortunately yes.

[15:14:47] <cmr> SimonSapin: it's quite silly :( Hopefully closure reform will kill that one.
[15:15:02] <bodie_> (and what might the performance penalties of wrapping look like)
[15:15:07] <SimonSapin> cmr: so it’s a limitation of the current implementation, not a fundamental one?
[15:15:22] <eddyb> cmr: does that have anything to do with a Fn trait (needing variadic generics)?
[15:15:26] <bstrie> bodie_: wrapping is probably the best initial course of action, although I'm not certain how difficult it will be to generate
[15:15:32] <cmr> SimonSapin: yeah
[15:15:48] <denus> I recall a blog post that recursive closures are unsafe, and they were going to remove that functionality.
[15:15:48] <bstrie> bodie_: we have a tool to automatically generate C bindings, but it doesn't handle macros or unions or varargs
[15:16:13] <Seldaek> bodie_: you may be interested in https://github.com/seldaek/deris my very incomplete redis server impl, it does support parsing the protocol though, I guess what you need for a client would be similar, maybe they could even share code but the protocol is so simple I don't know if that makes sense
[15:16:16] <cmr> bstrie: it does handle unions!
[15:16:24] <Sharp> Haha
[15:16:31] <bstrie> cmr: what, since when?!
[15:16:39] <bstrie> bindgen handles unions?
[15:16:40] <cmr> bstrie: the code it generates for them will make you cry though

[15:17:04] <cmr> I was equally surprised when I learned that too
[15:17:25] <Sharp> I thought we handled varargs too now
[15:17:27] <Sharp> Or soon
[15:17:52] <bstrie> I don't even know how C handles varargs
[15:18:00] <cmr> bstrie: it uses alignof and offsetof from the C side and transmute and [u8, ..sizeof] from the Rust side
[15:18:10] <cmr> (the C sizeof)
[15:18:25] <cmr> Sharp: We'll have it in the FFI soon, yeah.
[15:18:35] <bstrie> cmr: what, since when?!
[15:18:37] <bstrie> I
[15:18:46] <bstrie> have heard nothing about adding vararg support to the FFI
[15:18:51] <eddyb> bstrie: C varargs are just pushing more arguments on the stack
[15:18:59] <cmr> bstrie: https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/10064
[15:19:04] <bstrie> but they're all allowed to be different sizes, yeah?
[15:19:12] <bstrie> so you have to also pass along type info somehow?
[15:19:13] <cmr> bstrie: yes, entirely unsafe in every way.

[15:19:46] <eddyb> since they're pushed last to first, there's no problem having more arguments than required, as long as the caller cleans up
[15:19:50] <cmr> we won't have varargs in rust, just the ability to call it.
[15:20:18] <eddyb> va_args is just a pointer on the stack or something, abstracted away as a compiler builtin

[18:18:01] <jason_> i'm not sure why brson merged that commit without all of the fixes he asked for in the review.
[18:18:05] <eddyb> strcat: about that... you can use the "count leading zeroes intrinsic" instead of a loop, in next_power_of_two - is the constant execution time of that loop desired?
[18:18:10] <Jesse> tjc: 49 right now
[18:18:16] <tjc> Jesse: just you wait!!

[18:18:21] <thewonderidiot> agh crap, I better decide soon if I want to get up to SF for that
[18:18:22] <brson> tjc: our event organizer suggested 50. catering cost is a consideration
[18:18:26] <eddyb> (i.e. does anyone care for timing attacks?)
[18:18:28] <strcat> eddyb: you can use clz
[18:18:39] <strcat> loops aren't safe against timing attacks
[18:18:45] <strcat> LLVM is free to replace the loop with clz
[18:18:45] <brson> i also don't think i can remember 50 names
[18:18:52] <tjc> brson: Yeah, totally. Part of me thinks that if catering is going to be the limiting factor it's better to let more people in than to serve food, but then again, maybe it's better to keep it small...
[18:19:03] <eddyb> strcat: oh heh, I wonder if it actually does that
[18:19:07] <tjc> and limiting the size of the event makes other people more excited about going to the next one. things that are hard to get into seem more desirable ;-)
[18:19:16] <thewonderidiot> oh man, it's already at 50
[18:19:17] <strcat> eddyb: it doesn't, but it could
[18:19:20] <tjc> hahaha
[18:19:23] <thewonderidiot> poo
[18:19:37] <tjc> I tweeted the link *one* minute ago
[18:19:43] <thewonderidiot> haha, wow
[18:19:43] <tjc> well, there's a waiting list :-)
[18:19:51] <tjc> in my experience, waiting lists tend to work pretty well for Meetup events
[18:19:59] <tjc> with an event of that size, a few people at least will cancel beforehand
[18:20:40] <Jesse> some people might not sign up because they see there's a waiting list
[18:20:45] <Jesse> so it depends on what you mean by "work"

[18:21:32] <tjc> Jesse: well, in the past, I've wait-listed myself for Meetup events, and ended up getting in

[23:05:36] <skoizza> \We are wrapping a RWArc around a priority queue.  After some testing we have realized that our code locks the queue, adds a request, unlocks the queue, the serve thread then locks the queue, serves the file, and unlocks the queue.  So our queue never get any longer than 1 request.  Should we try to sleep the thread so more requests can accumulate?

[23:52:32] <ktt3ja> if I want to use rust-http in Rust 0.8, do I download the source from github, put it in my project folder, and call `extern mod http;` at the beginning?
[23:52:58] <cmr> ktt3ja: rust-http never worked with rust 0.8
[23:53:54] <ah3da> according to http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14154753/how-do-i-make-an-http-request-from-rust , " it'll work in the just-released Rust 0.8"
[23:54:53] <cmr> Hm
[23:54:53] <mletterle> You're better off using trunk anyway
[23:55:07] <mletterle> rust-http head works with rust head.. or at least did recently
[23:55:11] <dbaupp> ah3da: read the full sentence: "rust-http is tracking the master branch of rust. At present it'll work in the just-released Rust 0.8, but there are likely to be breaking changes soon."
[23:55:17] <mletterle> can't make many promises these days
[23:55:19] <cmr> I recall it being broken for 0.8. You'll need to find a working commit.
[23:55:25] <dbaupp> ah3da: those breaking changes have happened (and happened many times)
