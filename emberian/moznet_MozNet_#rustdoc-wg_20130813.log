[00:49:57] <Seldaek> thanks
[00:50:47] <Seldaek> some of this feedback is a bit depressing, but I guess it's "just" styling issues at this point which isn't so hard comparatively

[07:52:52] <dbaupp> cmr: why'd you remove it? :'(
[07:52:54] <dbaupp> :P
[07:54:43] <cmr> [3:25:43]~/benches> ls | wc -l
[07:54:45] <cmr> 277
[07:54:55] <cmr> dbaupp: delicious data!
[07:55:55] <dbaupp> oh, it's running! :)
[07:56:03] <cmr> mhm
[07:56:07] <cmr> just memory for the time being
[07:56:50] <dbaupp> is it being uploaded?
[07:56:56] <cmr> no
[07:57:15] <dbaupp> ok, good; explains why I don't see it. :)
[07:57:28] * dbaupp was wondering if there was yet another bug in his scripts
[07:57:45] * cmr shoots off the upload script
[07:58:04] <dbaupp> (i take it time.txt will be missing for all of them?)
[07:58:07] <cmr> (yes)
[07:58:14] <dbaupp> ah
[07:58:45] <cmr> oh, also, all the old data is being deleted
[07:58:55] <dbaupp> Then, I guess I won't be able to plot it immediately
[07:59:08] <cmr> (sorry!)
[07:59:26] <dbaupp> no problems; it's not like I have to put effort into waiting :P
[07:59:36] <cmr> heh
[07:59:46] <dbaupp> what's the reason for no time.txt?
[07:59:55] <dbaupp> and, can I help to rectify that?
[08:00:18] <cmr> nah, just wanted to be able to do stuff on my computer without skewing the timings
[08:00:26] <dbaupp> right
[08:00:27] <cmr> probably shouldn't have waited so long to run the benchers..
[08:00:34] * dbaupp agrees ;)
[08:00:51] <dbaupp> yeah, that's a good reason. are you running the new Rusty bencher?
[08:01:03] <cmr> no :(
[08:01:18] <dbaupp> oh
[08:01:38] * dbaupp kicks cmr from #rust back over to #python
[08:01:40] <dbaupp> :P
[08:01:46] <cmr> heh
[08:04:28] <cmr> There's a weird bug in the new bencher, it seems celery isn't queueing up tasks, and is "forgetting" about them, so some builds don't get run
[08:04:41] <cmr> well, new builder
[08:04:50] <cmr> bencher is the same old script, just iterating over a directory rather than git history
[08:05:11] <dbaupp> ah, so more reliable?
[08:05:36] <cmr> well, it would be, if celery wasn't being weird
[08:05:41] <dbaupp> :(
[08:08:51] <cmr> The whole reason I was going to use celery was to avoid having to deal with queueing messages and such, but i f it's going to be a PITA I might as well just write it in rust!
[08:09:30] <dbaupp> use rust, and run in separate tasks, with a shared pipe of some sort!
[08:09:38] * dbaupp wonders if there is such a pipe
[08:09:51] <cmr> there's SharedChan
[08:10:06] <dbaupp> that's the other direction
[08:10:06] <cmr> I was using zmq but using tasks is probably easier
[08:10:16] <dbaupp> many -> one; this needs one -> many
[08:10:17] <cmr> oh
[08:10:23] <cmr> heh
[08:10:51] <cmr> rigt
[08:10:56] <cmr> *right
[08:13:11] <cmr> Meh, it's trivial to write a round-robbin job scheduler
[08:14:32] <dbaupp> oh, yeah, i guess you can just have a SharedChan going back to the central scheduler, and each task just requests a job from it

[16:11:40] <Seldaek> cmr: is rustdoc something to be discussed in the weekly or is that no question?
[16:12:16] <Seldaek> I'm not sure what the difference is between weekly and just random talks in #rust
[16:13:41] <cmr> Seldaek: do you want it to be?
[16:14:05] <cmr> The weekly meetings are when the core devs get together and discuss design or make decisions that need group consensus
[16:14:43] <Seldaek> well I don't know if there is a need for concensus
[16:15:00] <Seldaek> consensus*.. if everyone agrees the current docs suck then I guess we just move forward
[16:15:23] <Seldaek> well, I mean there is perhaps already consensus. Gee. I'm gonna sleep early tonight :p
