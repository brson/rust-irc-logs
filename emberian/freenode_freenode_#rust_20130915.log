[00:15:53] <antifuchs> oh hi, I'm just starting out with rust; installed it on OS X using homebrew (0.7), and am getting insta-segfaults when running the "hello" tutorial example. I'm trying on HEAD now, but is that expected?
[00:28:49] *** xandy is now known as xAndy
[00:51:57] <antifuchs> okay, yay, HEAD doesn't segfault at least (:
[00:54:37] <antifuchs> so my first project I'm thinking of doing in rust is a thing that can run another program in a pipe, read its output and do stuff based on that output. I see there's a popen function in the posix88 module, but that seems a bit insane. Is http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/core/run.html#function-spawn_process the way to go?
[01:06:09] <antifuchs> (I must say, it's pretty frustrating to see so many non-working examples/incomplete rust files on the web when you're starting out)
[01:06:40] <antifuchs> I was just copy/pasting the "rust for rubyists" examples on stdin usage and most of the "use" statements generate errors /:

[23:27:56] <bjz> inheritance is a difficult beast
[23:28:30] <dandy_> it doesn't stop aything though, I can still make some kind of implementation for a trait
[23:29:00] <bjz> I mean, it's not always a bad thing, but it has a tendency to be overused. Composition is often nicer.
[23:30:52] <bjz> dandy_: btw, we have an official channel on irc.mozilla.org
[23:31:14] <dandy_> I miss something?
[23:31:29] <bjz> hm?
[23:31:42] <dandy_> didn't know that!
[23:31:51] <dandy_> been there forever I take it?
[23:32:17] <bjz> it's in the topic of the IRC, but nobody reads those (myself included)
[23:32:33] <dandy_> nope
[23:32:33] <bjz> of the channel I mean
[23:32:44] <dandy_> I often join a channel and then only later talk in it so I always miss it
[23:33:13] <bjz> So yeah we hover around 270-280 people these days
[23:33:19] <bjz> it's very lively
[23:33:21] <dandy_> If the MOTD is important enough to be required reading the ops are usualy large enough dicks I don't want to be in the channel anyway
[23:34:00] <Araq> nobody ever reads anything and yet everybody nowadays argues how important readablity is
[23:34:28] <dandy_> You wont hear that argument from me :)
[23:34:36] <bjz> Araq: well isn't that the point of readability?
[23:34:51] <dandy_> imgurl all the way!
[23:35:58] <Araq> bjz: readability is vastly overrated and used as an excuse ("I don't get it, so it must be the writer's fault. It's unreadable") ;-)
[23:36:01] <bjz> bstrie: might be good to prefix the notice with something like: THIS IS NOT THE OFFICIAL CHANNEL: ...blah
[23:36:24] <dandy_> uhh, won't do any good
[23:36:33] <dandy_> those lines would have to be on my screen to be read
[23:38:17] <bjz> Araq: I respectfully disagree. Multiple people keep misunderstanding, or not reading something, then there might be something innate that maight be causing it. Aguing otherwise is abit like yelling at the rain.

[23:39:09] <bjz> Araq: far better to mould your writing/interfaces to fit human psycology than to complain whenever we have 'brain failures'
[23:47:09] <bjz> Araq: does tht make sense?
[23:47:30] <Araq> I studied human psycology. You can of course try harder to make people read things. But it doesn't work. Reading is effort so we all avoid it if we can.
[23:47:40] <Araq> especially it's text on a screen
[23:47:52] <Araq> *if it's
[23:49:21] <dandy_> I can confirm this.

[23:49:35] <bjz> Well I guess sometimes it's a more fundamental design problem.
[23:49:45] <dandy_> we are poorly designed
[23:49:59] <bjz> humans have many bugs in them
[23:50:09] <bjz> silly humans
[23:50:18] <bjz> :)
