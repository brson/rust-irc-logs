[00:09:36] <dbp> ping cmr
[00:09:47] <cmr> dbp: pong
[00:10:06] <dbp> hey - is there documentation on what a rustdoc_ng plugin is?
[00:10:32] <cmr> Only https://github.com/cmr/rustdoc_ng/issues/16
[00:12:04] <dbp> Hrm. I'll probably go with rustdoc_ng::core::run_core for now, just because I don't want to play with figuring out dynamic code loading :)
[00:12:42] <cmr> Yup
[00:12:45] <cmr> However
[00:12:49] <cmr> Since the plugin system doesn't really work yet
[00:13:01] <cmr> You could add it to rustdoc_ng in a contrib/ directory
[00:13:05] <cmr> And I can "fake" it
[00:13:32] <dbp> hmm. well, let me write the code first, and then once it works, we can talk about where it should live :)
[00:14:01] <cmr> Sure!
[00:14:14] <cmr> It's the same thing really
[00:14:21] <cmr> a plugin is given a reference to the crate run_core returns
[00:14:21] <dbp> having it have an actual intermediate format, and spit out JSON, is really great, by the way!
[00:14:46] <cmr> Yes, it was the biggest flaw with the old rustdoc I think
[00:15:36] <dbp> I have some code to scrape the html to JSON that I'm really excited to throw out
[00:16:12] <cmr> I just recently quit my job as a web scraper, I know your pain :)
[00:16:50] <Seldaek> dbp: what are you working on?
[00:18:42] <dbp> Seldaek: making this work again https://github.com/dbp/rustle
[00:18:46] <dbp> and making it better
[00:19:59] <Seldaek> oh ok interesting
[00:20:34] <Seldaek> the json of rustdoc_ng should indeed help you quite a bit :)
[01:13:16] <dbp> cmr: I'm getting compile errors with rustdoc_ng - error: unresolved name `phase_1_parse_input`, `phase_2_configure_and_expand`, `phase_3_run_analysis_passes`
[01:13:24] <dbp> is that expected / is there a workaround?
[01:13:28] <cmr> dbp: update your rustc
[01:14:08] <dbp> cmr: hrm. odd. I just did. maybe it's finding old libraries. thanks
[01:16:03] <dbp> oh. duh. nevermind. forgot to make install :)
[01:43:42] <dbp> cmr: I'm putting in things like /usr/local/lib for library paths (ie, as I would use for -L commandline options) - is that correct? 
[01:44:00] <dbp> I'm getting an unwrap error with this simple example. I'm assuming the crate file is the source, right?
[01:44:01] <cmr> dbp: I don't understand the question
[01:44:03] <dbp> http://pastebin.com/NpTygzrg
[01:44:27] <dbp> unwrap of None, I mean
[01:44:48] <dbp> (and I built rustdoc_ng with --lib in that directory)
[01:46:42] <cmr> hm
[01:47:03] <cmr> I'll investigate tomorrow, it's late here
[01:47:52] <cmr> dbp: Not sure /usr/local/lib should be there though
[01:49:06] <dbp> cmr: without that, it said it couldn't find std.
[01:49:08] <dbp> thanks!
[01:49:45] <cmr> ah, I suppose it's not in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH or somesuch?
[01:51:36] <dbp> doesn't appear to be. rustc finds it, but I'm not actually sure where it is looking
[01:51:48] <cmr> neither am I :p
[01:51:58] <cmr> Oh hm
[01:52:07] <cmr> Where are you putting the binary?
[01:52:13] <cmr> It needs to be in the same directory as rustc
[01:52:18] <dbp> ohh.
[01:52:20] <dbp> okay
[01:52:26] <cmr> The compiler assumes anything using its libraries is in the standard compiler prefix
[01:52:32] <cmr> Which is obnoxious, but reasonable
[01:54:50] <dbp> hm. well that let me remove the /usr/local/lib path (it complained about multiple possible libstds), but still I get the same option::unwrap of None error
