[00:49:58] <carter> cmr: did i manage to point you to the ghc exception story?
[00:50:14] <carter> (it has a few subtleties mind you)
[00:50:17] <cmr> carter: you mentioned it but I didn't go looking.
[00:50:29] <carter> it was right before i hopped on a plane or something
[00:50:30] <carter> hangon
[00:51:26] <carter> cmr ghc has a neat way to handle exceptions, though i don't don't if rust can express it (yet)
[00:51:27] <carter> http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.6.0.1/docs/Control-Exception.html
[00:51:44] <dbaupp> looks like std::any::Any
[00:51:55] <dbaupp> a little
[00:51:59] <carter> not quite an Any
[00:52:02] <carter> its an existential
[00:52:17] <dbaupp> an Any trait object
[00:52:31] <carter> i'm not sure if the way Rust traites works can play nice with the approach ghc does
[00:53:08] <carter> dbaupp: its not quite an any
[00:53:41] <carter> its saying "heres a value, and its bundled with a type class instance you can run it on"
[00:53:59] <carter> idk
[00:54:42] <carter> cmr: dbaupp  theres also the subtlety of what exceptions mean in a multithreaded setting
[00:54:56] <dbaupp> Isn't it basically (opaqye data, type id) with -> Option<T> based on comparing the type id?

[00:55:08] <carter> dbaupp: actually nope :)
[00:55:17] <carter> dbaupp: because the way ghc compiles type classes
[00:55:29] <carter> that data type actualy has a filed for the type class dictionary
[00:55:41] <carter> *field
[00:56:09] <carter> dbaupp: but that is one approach rust could do
[00:57:01] <dbaupp> so how does extracting a concrete type work? just check to see if it has the same dictionary?

[01:00:10] <carter> and it actually now works for higher kinded types too
[01:00:20] <carter> does mean 1-2 clever hacks don't work anymore

[01:21:51] <dbaupp> there (Clone is fixed on master)
[01:22:11] <dbaupp> nrc: the reason it doesn't set expn_info on anything else is because nothing else has needed it as of yet
[01:25:02] <nrc> dbaupp: so in your example the exp_info is set on which span?
[01:25:15] <nrc> it points to x: NoEq, right?
[01:26:29] <dbaupp> that deriving expands to impl Eq for Foo { fn eq(&self, other: &Foo) { self.x.eq(&other.x) }
[01:26:52] <dbaupp> and the `self.x` and `other.x` get spans point at the `x: NoEq` line, with expn_info pointing to the #[deriving(Eq)] part
[01:27:18] <dbaupp> essentially all other spans just point straight at the #[deriving(Eq)]
[01:28:04] <nrc> dbaupp: so from looking just at the ast, is there any way to tell that fn eq or impl Eq is generated code?
[01:28:32] <dbaupp> not easily
[01:28:59] <dbaupp> hm
[01:29:46] <dbaupp> would e.g. just setting the expn info to also point to the #[deriving(Eq)] be helpful?
[01:30:12] <nrc> yes, I was thinking about something like that
[01:31:41] <nrc> dbaupp: is it as easy as calling set_expn_info on the spans for the created methods/impls?

[10:16:36] <eddyb> https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/12125 don't mind the morning english
[10:17:03] <eddyb> doener: ^^
[10:18:31] <doener> eddyb: "i can see" in the sense of "I would be great if"?
[10:18:37] <eddyb> doener: yeah
[10:18:43] <doener> s/I would/It would/
[10:18:54] <doener> *sigh* it's morning over here too ;-)
[10:19:03] <eddyb> since we might be translating dependencies first, we might even be able to run module passes on isolated function graphs but that's wishful thinking at this point
[10:20:04] <eddyb> the servo guys might know more about parallelizing workloads, I hear it's running in circles around Blink
[10:21:17] <dbaupp> does LLVM even support running passes on a single function like that?

[10:22:31] <eddyb> dbaupp: function passes are ran on each function
[10:23:01] <eddyb> and they require no module-level information, unlike module passes (which do fancy dependency graphs and whatnot)
[10:24:10] <eddyb> wish strcat were here, he knows more than me
[10:24:47] <dbaupp> eddyb: yes, but my impression was LLVM has a "function pass" pass, that runs the function passes on all the functions at once
[10:24:49] <dbaupp> I could be wrong
[10:25:22] <dbaupp> (e.g. Intel put some (not yet landed) effort into parallelising function passes, which implies that they don't work in parallel atm.)
[10:25:36] <eddyb> yes, but there is no reason why you couldn't run it on an individual function, modulo bad API design
[10:26:09] <dbaupp> bad API design can't be ignored, since it's fundamentally how we interact with LLVM.
[10:26:18] *** Quits: brson (brson@moz-BBE3ABD.mv.mozilla.com) (Quit: leaving)
[10:26:33] <dbaupp> so, even if theoretically they can be run on individual functions; if LLVM doesn't support it now, we cannot do it.
[10:27:41] <eddyb> dbaupp: yeah, I remembered that, so we might not be able to run them in parallel just yet, but they shouldn't require anything global *in theory* - I guess LLVM's custom resource management could be an issue

[10:45:22] <dbaupp> eddyb: really?
[10:47:23] <eddyb> because there is a LLVMRunPassManager that looks like it would... maybe not
[10:48:03] <eddyb> the C++ classes are FunctionPassManager and PassManager, maybe they're the function and module passes, respectively. I don't really know
[10:51:59] <doener> gah, I've introduced a memory leak _somewhere_, valgrind of course only tells me where the malloc is... and the only test case I have so far is librustc
[10:52:24] <dbaupp> that's not too large... should be fine :P
[10:52:46] <dbaupp> (don't you get a stack trace from the malloc?)
[10:53:28] <doener> dbaupp: yeah, tells me that it's in creader::get_meta_items, which isn't that trivial and hands out allocated memory

[12:13:47] * jensnockert hits rustc with a stick for not understanding (large u32 >> 33)
[12:15:43] * dbaupp has hit his head against overlong shifts far too many times
[12:15:48] * jensnockert also hits x86 for doing large shifts the only way that abs. doesn't make sense.
[12:15:53] <dbaupp> and I'll probably keep doing it :'(
[12:16:00] <jensnockert> Yeah…
[12:16:21] <dbaupp> x86 basically does & 0b11111 to the shift, right?
[12:16:59] <jensnockert> Yeah.
[12:17:33] <jensnockert> Always confuses me since SSE shifts make sense, and just shift moar.

[17:55:09] <flaper87> doener: ok, would you mind gisting the test you used?

[17:58:19] <doener> the second one is actually from the post-loop Helper instance, that I added later to test something unrelated

[18:43:08] <doener> flaper87: does the "if"-test actually fail before your change?
[18:43:20] <doener> flaper87: I suppose that it would drop the value, just too late
[18:47:10] <flaper87> doener: no it doesn't. I just moved the assert inside the if body to make it more obvious
[18:47:50] <doener> yeah, was just about to suggest that
[18:47:55] <flaper87> the IR doesn't show the call to glue_drop
[18:48:02] <flaper87> (I mean, without the fix)
[18:48:38] <doener> hu? I tried here, and moving the assertion made the test fail
[18:52:51] <flaper87> doener: yeah, without the fix it does fail
[18:53:16] <doener> flaper87: https://gist.github.com/dotdash/598cca65c76e8b317cf8 -- the drop is on line 49, i.e. right after the whole "if"-block. With your fix it should be around line 27 or so
[18:54:04] <flaper87> doener: correct. That's what I wanted to say w/ "The IR doesn't show the call to glue_drop"
[18:54:23] <flaper87> I should've added "after the condition call"
[18:54:25] <flaper87> :D
[18:54:58] <doener> heh, yeah, I misunderstood that for "the call isn't present at all"
[18:55:19] <doener> so, mystery solved :-)
[18:55:32] <flaper87> w0000t and a bunch of memory freed

[20:18:06] <cgaebel> is there any type with an above 32-byte alignment?
[20:18:59] <Eridius> cgaebel: u64?
[20:19:09] <cgaebel> isn't that 8-byte?
[20:19:13] <Eridius> oh byte
[20:19:15] <Eridius> I read bit
[20:19:19] <Eridius> how about (u64, u64, u64, u64, u64)
[20:19:25] <Eridius> or really [u64, ..5]
[20:19:33] <cgaebel> wouldn't that be aligned to 8-bytes still?
[20:19:47] <Eridius> I guess it's architecture-dependent, isn't it?
[20:20:04] <cgaebel> I guess. I've just never seen anything practical aligned to more than an 8-byte boundary
[20:20:12] <cgaebel> err, 16-byte
[20:20:14] <cgaebel> because of SSE
[20:20:16] <eddyb> it's either 8-byte or 4-byte aligned
[20:20:26] <cgaebel> hmm
[20:20:35] <cgaebel> I also don't want to actually use this information...
[20:20:35] <eddyb> cgaebel: #[simd] might require more alignment than 8
[20:20:49] <cgaebel> yeah but even then I've never seen more than 16-byte alignment
[20:21:06] <cgaebel> ok curiosity satiated.

[21:10:19] <acrichto> eddyb: perhaps, but LLVM isn't threadsafe in a single context so it'd all have to be serial
[21:10:39] <eddyb> sure, that's actually what I thought at first
[21:10:44] <eddyb> then went to dream land
[21:11:39] <eddyb> right now I can't compile rustc again to find out what I did wrong in my refactoring, just because I don't have enough free RAM
[21:13:49] <doener> eddyb: what hardware are you working on?
[21:14:01] <eddyb> a 3yo ASUS laptop
[21:14:30] <eddyb> I guess I could upgrade the RAM to 8GB, I've been delaying that for... actually, I don't have a reason /facepalm
[21:15:01] <eddyb> but the i3 CPU isn't amazing either
[21:15:02] <doener> ah, I guess the "laptop" part explains a bit
