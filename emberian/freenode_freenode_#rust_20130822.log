[08:13:44] <scvrory> bjz_: and do i just call that like f<T>() ?
[08:13:55] <bjz_> f::<T>()
[08:14:13] <bjz_> probably the ugliest thing in rust's grammar
[08:14:58] <bjz_> but if you had a f<T>(t: T) -> T
[08:15:07] <bjz_> and called f(t)
[08:15:16] <bjz_> the T would be inferred
[08:15:39] <bjz_> same with if you did let t: T = f();
[08:16:05] <bjz_> so yeah, you rarely have to do f::<T>()
[08:16:21] <bjz_> only when rust can't infer the type
[08:17:15] <bjz_> so say you had fn g<T>() -> T { f() }
[08:17:33] <bjz_> the type param on f() would be inferred
[08:17:53] <scvrory> ah
[08:17:56] <bjz_> because the it gets it from the return type of g
[08:17:59] <scvrory> yeah the calling syntax was my issue
[08:18:16] <bjz_> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindley-Milner
[08:18:16] <scvrory> since it couldnt be inferred in my case
[08:18:20] <bjz_> yep
[08:18:34] <scvrory> thanks!
[08:18:36] <bjz_> Rust has local HM type inference
[08:18:57] <bjz_> modified to work with regions and affine types
[08:19:46] <bjz_> but you still have to be explicit in function declarations, and with statics
