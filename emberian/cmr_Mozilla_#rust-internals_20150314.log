[03:17:38] <Mutabah> jroesch: new IO isn't yet stable afaik
[03:18:04] <arrrrrrrrr> new io won't have it
[03:18:58] <jroesch> cross platform reasons I assume?
[03:23:33] <jroesch> Mutabah: yeah I was aware but they have migrated enough code into new io that I could rewrite, so I've been trying to actually use the new APIs before they become fully stable 
[03:23:41] <WindowsBunny> jroesch: There's so many kinds of things, and so many platform differences
[03:23:59] <jroesch> thanks for the answer, I figured it was along those lines
[03:24:12] <WindowsBunny> jroesch: So it's staying out of new io until we're able to carefully investigate all those things on all the platforms
[03:25:15] <jroesch> cool, its probably a good idea to err on the conservative side when it comes to things like this
[03:26:13] <reem> The development approach for std::io has been to conservatively stabilize the basic cross-platform abstraction, then backwards-compatibly extend them later as we figure out the best way to do stuff.
[03:26:31] <reem> and/or amend the design backwards incompatibly right now
[03:27:12] <arrrrrrrrr> reem: how do you know that you can extend it backwards compatibly if you haven't done it yet?
[03:27:55] <reem> arrrrrrrrr: *I* don't

[03:28:49] <reem> but I'm under the impression that significant thought has gone into it
[03:28:49] <WindowsBunny> and then comparing it to posix
[03:28:58] <arrrrrrrrr> you're even saying that it will be possible to do it the best way
[03:29:41] <reem> Really all I'm saying is that this is the development approach
[03:29:44] <arrrrrrrrr> WindowsBunny: tell me, what is the plan to extend the seek interface which is currently being discussed
[03:29:54] <WindowsBunny> arrrrrrrrr: I don't know :D
[03:30:05] <arrrrrrrrr> reem: WindowsBunny: I'm convinced now
[03:30:05] <WindowsBunny> Nobody asked me yet about seek on windows
[03:30:35] <jroesch> Yeah that was my impression from Aaron/Alex's talks at the meetup in Feb. but I hadn't been following any of the details, been too busy with finishing school and PhD visits
[03:30:55] <arrrrrrrrr> nobody is doubting that that's the intention
[03:31:06] <reem> arrrrrrrrr: I obviously don't mean that std::io is perfect, and it's important that you and others continue to bring up any deficiencies
[03:31:31] <WindowsBunny> arrrrrrrrr: Please do bring up any deficiencies you see
[03:32:00] <WindowsBunny> we rely on the community to make sure nobody dun goofed
[03:32:06] <jroesch> fwiw I rewrote my file system with the new std::io and a lot of things got cleaner/simpler and I deleted a bunch of custom code 
[03:32:39] <c74d> jroesch: you've written a filesystem in Rust? ó_o
[03:33:14] <jroesch> right now I'm still using fuse, but it was for grad OS the current design is very similar to old school unix file systems 
[03:35:33] <jroesch> I'll be happy to share the code once I finish it up, I'm using a traditional the traditional superblock/inode design, was going to implement a more modern file system design but I haven't had a lot of time 
[03:35:56] <jroesch> err I wrote traditional twice, just delete one of those ;)

[19:31:40] <arrrrrrrrr> ah, I understand
[19:31:43] <simukis> let me show you a few last lines of strace
[19:31:55] <arrrrrrrrr> the segfault happens before but the signal only arrives during a later syscall
[19:32:26] <simukis> that might be a case
[19:33:18] <simukis> either way, I think this is a bug in a kernel because while sigsegv can’t be ignored and uninterruptible sleep can’t be interrupted, doesn’t mean it have to lock up like that
[19:33:19] <arrrrrrrrr> you said something about it only affecting the parent?
[19:33:58] <simukis> arrrrrrrrr: it affects anything that tries to send signal to the D-state process
[19:33:59] <sp3d> 3.19.1-1-ARCH segfaults consistently as well here
[19:34:08] <arrrrrrrrr> fun
[19:34:21] <sp3d> Arch glibc 2.21-2, if that's relevant
[19:34:34] <arrrrrrrrr> simukis: not sure if it has anything to do with sending signals though?

[20:52:46] <Manishearth> that works?
[20:52:58] <Manishearth> I mean yeah, box [T] == Vec<T> for cap = len
[20:53:01] <arrrrrrrrr> Manishearth: that's how custom allocators work. if the type on the left is a vec then we use the vec allocator
[20:53:06] <Manishearth> nice

[23:11:35] <arrrrrrrrr> reem: it's clear from 117 - 127
[23:13:28] <reem> Reasonably, but I still think 138 - 141 should change since it is empirically confusing. The language doesn't currently have an owned slice mode at all outside of Box<[T]>, so the idea of a slice owning its contents is almost novel by itself.
[23:13:59] <reem> since Box<[T]> is more of a type system feature than a practically useful and used type
[23:14:12] <arrrrrrrrr> Vec can be considered as being a slice owner since it can be turned into Box<[T]>
[23:14:30] <reem> Agreed, but that's, for the most part, not how people think about Vec
[23:14:42] <arrrrrrrrr> (and you can in fact write IntoSlice for &mut Vec<T> today, but not for &mut Box<[T]>)

[23:22:46] <arrrrrrrrr> well, it uses placement new
[23:24:40] <reem> Right, but I'm imaging for non-Box types
[23:24:47] <reem> Specifically stack placement
[23:25:08] <arrrrrrrrr> as long as rust doesn't support alloca or something similar I don't think you can put unsized types on the stack
[23:25:43] <arrrrrrrrr> you can have a large [u8; 64k] and the try to allocate into that and panic! if it doesn't work
[23:25:46] <arrrrrrrrr> that would wokr
[23:25:55] <arrrrrrrrr> because you're similating your own heap in that array

[23:26:09] <arrrrrrrrr> ah, that's come to my mind to
[23:26:21] <reem> I've always thought that API was extremely non-rusty
[23:27:05] <arrrrrrrrr> I don't think it can be done. Not with the simple protocol proposed in the other RFC
[23:27:25] <arrrrrrrrr> you'd first have to reserve a large buffer and if a read is short you have to tell the allocator that you didn't mean it
[23:28:03] <arrrrrrrrr> I don't think that can be done by the compiler and at that point the API wouldn't be more safe than the current one
[23:30:33] <reem> yes

[23:34:31] <Manishearth> that works
[23:34:38] <arrrrrrrrr> but if it's about "you have to fill them all" then it doesn't
[23:34:42] <Manishearth> by &out I meant you provide a buffer
[23:34:42] <reem> arrrrrrrrr: I actually find commenting on the file view is better since then I can follow conversation from the main view. If you comment on commits the context of a thread in the changeset is not shown in the main view.
[23:34:45] <Manishearth> in the case of read
[23:35:09] <Manishearth> arrrrrrrrr: I thought the comments disappear when you edit the line that was commented on, otherwies they stick around?
[23:36:04] <arrrrrrrrr> reem: try to follow any "files changed" view in this RFC: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/517
[23:36:43] <arrrrrrrrr> Manishearth: that's how it is for the "files changed" view because the "files changed" view changes with every commit. but commits stay the same so comments on commits stay around
[23:37:14] <reem> arrrrrrrrr: Ok sure, but that's the 0.001% of github prs, as far as length and depth of conversation goes
[23:37:25] <arrrrrrrrr> reem: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/973
[23:37:30] <arrrrrrrrr> the comments on commits are shown
[23:37:34] <arrrrrrrrr> just not the lines
[23:37:37] <reem> arrrrrrrrr: Also on-commit comments get deleted when you rebase --amend
[23:37:45] <reem> Ah, ya, that's what I meant.
[23:37:49] <arrrrrrrrr> reem: don't rebase until the PR is done
[23:37:52] <reem> I like being able to see what sparked the conversation.
[23:38:17] <arrrrrrrrr> reem: click on the first link. it takes you to the correct line
[23:38:30] <reem> Also I have to find the commit in which the change was made
[23:38:37] <arrrrrrrrr> true
[23:38:51] <reem> which in PRs with many commits, especially where later commits change earlier commits, can be confusing
[23:39:14] <reem> you can argue that commits should make sense, but that doesn't stop people from making bad commits
[23:39:19] *** Quits: blaenk (blaenkdenum@moz-em283u.res.rr.com) (Connection closed)
[23:39:35] <arrrrrrrrr> so there is really no good way to comment on github

[23:44:04] <arrrrrrrrr> reem: but it can be implemented with &mut Box<[T]> with mem::replace.
[23:44:06] <arrrrrrrrr> nope
[23:44:30] <arrrrrrrrr> you're going to cause a segfault if you do that (at worst)
[23:45:41] <arrrrrrrrr> well, at worst it's UB
[23:48:20] <reem> Hmm, I guess not without the proposal in question
[23:48:29] * Manishearth initiates the rollup process
[23:51:29] <arrrrrrrrr> reem: I've replied to explain why it doesn't work with &mut
[23:51:52] <reem> oh I edited the comment already to remove that it
