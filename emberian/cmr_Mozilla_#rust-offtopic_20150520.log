[00:53:55] <niconii> hmm, i agree with changing male pronouns in the quote, personally -- if we're not talking about five specific philosophers who happen to all be male (and the original context, we aren't), using male pronouns isn't appropriate
[00:54:14] <niconii> but at the same time... female pronouns are strange for the same reason, imo
[00:54:32] <WindowsBunny> I don't mind what pronouns are used so long as any modifications are clearly marked using []
[00:54:41] <niconii> so personally i would've preferred "they"
[00:55:28] <WindowsBunny> Using only he/she and disregarding they serves injustice to all those with non-binary genders
[00:55:43] <Tiffany> it might be confusing using they
[00:55:54] <Tobba> how about just leaving it
[00:55:55] <Tiffany> since it could easily refer to an individual but also the entire group
[00:55:56] <Tobba> it's a fucking quote
[00:55:59] <Tiffany> I agree tobba
[00:56:19] <WindowsBunny> Tobba: But then people might get offended at Rust for daring to quote things without modifying them!
[00:56:20] <Tobba> it literally does not matter in any way, replace the whole quote if you're unhappy with it
[00:57:01] <Tiffany> the amount of bikeshedding over this one quote is just ridiculous
[00:57:09] <scott> I'm in favour of more gender neutral language in general (and I'm okay with people who choose to use 'she' in their own examples to make a point) but this PR seems a bit out there considering it is, as others stated, a quote
[00:57:18] <Tobba> to be honest, that PR in itself is 10 times more sexist than the original issue
[00:57:36] <scott> problem is it's a touchy subject so I don't know that outright rejecting the PR would have gone over well, I just wish the person hadn't bothered

[00:59:02] <Tiffany> whoever wrote this using he was not going outright one way or the other
[00:59:03] <Yurume> but well, the lack of broadly generic pronouns in the human languages (not just English but many others) is the real culprit
[00:59:09] <Tiffany> they just didn't have a convenient gender-neutral pronoun
[00:59:11] <Tiffany> but this PR
[00:59:14] <Tiffany> goes and changes it to she
[00:59:17] <scott> it's a shame we don't have a pre-existing gender neutral singular pronoun without negative connotations
[00:59:22] <calc0000> they just didn't have a convenient gender-neutral pronoun

[01:04:36] <Yurume> thinking about that, mathematicians have a convenient excuse called "without a loss of generality"...
[01:05:04] <niconii> honestly, though i'd prefer "they", this quote does say "five eminent philosophers", which i guess you could imagine happen to be five men
[01:05:21] <Yurume> how about five friendly monsters?
[01:05:26] <niconii> so i don't actually care *too* much about this quote, it didn't really grate on me the way some other things have
[01:05:44] <scott> niconii: to play devil's advocate, the idea that philosopher = man is exactly the kind of thing which is the issue here
[01:05:53] <Tiffany> you could imagine the philosophers as being of the greek kind
[01:06:02] <awe> scott: that being said, 70% of philosophy PhDs are male.
[01:06:03] <Tobba> scott: even if you randomly picked a pronoun, 50% of all texts would then be somehow sexist
[01:06:05] <Tiffany> and ancient greece was pretty sexist
[01:06:14] <Tobba> (mixed pronouns would be a damn mess in such a text)
[01:06:26] <niconii> scott: yeah, fair enough
[01:06:37] <scott> awe: right, which is the kind of thing people want to change (and it's even worse in CS)
[01:06:56] <awe> but you don't change it by pretending it's not the case.
[01:07:09] <Tobba> quotation doesn't help (the whole reasoning behind this PR is basically quotation logic)
[01:07:14] <Tobba> actually it just makes everything worse
[01:07:21] <scott> to make myself clear, I still think the PR in question is silly
[01:07:24] <WindowsBunny> and modifying a quote without indicating you modified it is wrong
[01:07:30] <Tiffany> also I agree with scott, saying that philosopher -> man is pretty off
[01:07:35] <scott> I'm just arguing the more general case of using different pronouns in hypotheticals
[01:07:42] <WindowsBunny> no matter for what purpose, if you modify a quote, use friggin brackets
[01:07:50] <Tiffany> but seriously, changing all the pronouns to she?
[01:07:53] <niconii> i would support this PR if it used "they"
[01:08:09] <Tiffany> I wouldn't mind if it were they, niconii
[01:08:14] <Tobba> niconii: still violates the quotation policy though, but I wouldn't mind if it were they
[01:08:19] <Tiffany> but I don't feel like it needed a PR
[01:08:23] <Tiffany> it could have just been left as is
[01:08:26] <WindowsBunny> I'd mind so long as they modified a quote without []
[01:08:28] <Tiffany> it was, after all, a quote
[01:08:29] <awe> Everything everywhere should be they.
[01:08:38] <awe> (in technical manuals)
[01:08:43] <awe> It's not a solution to change everything to she.
[01:08:48] <niconii> Tiffany: i also agree that leaving it as-is would not be a big problem
[01:09:07] <niconii> Tiffany: so i think we're basically on the same page here
[01:09:15] <scott> it's funny when I read an article where some scientist uses 'she' to refer to a hypothetical scientist and it stands out to you and you'll see lots of people comment on it. it never stands out when it's 'he'
[01:09:38] <awe> scott: because he has historically been the gender-neutral singular pronoun.
[01:09:46] <Tiffany> if I was referring to a single hypothetical individual, I would use 'they' or 'one'
[01:09:57] <Tiffany> if I was referring to multiple, I would probably alternate assigning genders
[01:10:02] <scott> he has never been gender neutral, positions like scientist have just been presumed male
[01:10:03] <Tiffany> Alice, Bob, Eve, Fred, and so on

[01:10:55] <niconii> WindowsBunny: same

[01:25:33] <XMPPwocky> ah, yeah. at the same time, i can sorta see it
[01:25:44] <awe> I wouldn't care about they (although in general, I think the English language should have a dedicated singular gender-neutral pronoun).
[01:26:00] <awe> I know a few people who use they pronouns, and I get deeply confused when people talk about them sometimes.
[01:26:09] <awe> I often am unsure if they're referring to a group of people or just the one person.
[01:26:10] <scott> english has it, but it has negative connotations
[01:26:19] <awe> scott: what word?
[01:26:25] <Tobba> XMPPwocky: changing it to "she" is basically the same logic used in gender quotation, which is actively harmful to women in this area
[01:26:27] <scott> english has "it", but "it" has negative connotations ;)
[01:26:35] <XMPPwocky> and "made-up" pronouns get constantly mocked, too, so they're not necessarily a good choice
[01:26:36] <awe> It is neuter but it's for objects.
[01:26:48] <scott> that's what I meant by the connotations
[01:26:55] <scott> it's used as an insult applied to people

[02:09:30] <Layl> the problem with loud people is, they're not going to convince anyone
[02:09:33] <Layl> I mean, imagine this
[02:09:43] <aji> why is it so hard to understand that maybe the majority doesn't have all the answers
[02:09:43] <Layl> a teacher in a class is telling people the earth is flat
[02:09:52] <Layl> sure it's not correct, but what then happens is this:
[02:09:53] <aji> that maybe the majority can't understand what it's like to be in the minority
[02:10:04] <Layl> another teacher kicks in the door and starts screaming at the other teacher
[02:10:18] <Layl> about how wrong it is and how that teacher is teaching lies to the children

[02:14:43] <calc0000> i can't believe you didn't hear about it
[02:14:43] <WindowsBunny> Why must hands be associated with jazz only?
[02:14:56] <WindowsBunny> Why can't hands be associated with other genres of music too?
[02:14:59] <awe> Oh, jazz hands instead of clapping?
[02:15:04] <aji> yes that
[02:15:19] <awe> All the loud bigots I know snap.
[02:15:29] <awe> I wasn't aware jazz hands was a thing.

[02:16:47] <calc0000> jazz hands offend me
[02:16:54] <aji> right
[02:17:05] <awe> The justification for jazz hands is weird.
[02:17:08] <awe> "Clapping may cause anxiety."
[02:17:17] <awe> Sudden noises cause anxiety.
[02:17:17] <aji> it's extreme but it's wrong to write off all social justice as ridiculous because of it
[02:17:21] <awe> So does sudden movements.
[02:17:34] <awe> Jazz hands can also cause anxiety.
[02:17:35] <aji> maybe the n word isn't appropriate to use on the internet, but if you try to actually tell somebody that,
[02:17:38] <calc0000> open hands cause anxiety
[02:17:44] <aji> they tell you to tough up, and this is the internet, and the real world isn't a hugbox
[02:17:45] <calc0000> what if someone was slapped as a child
[02:18:00] <scott> the point is virtually no one actually thinks that about clapping, but it became a news story so here we are

[02:19:39] <calc0000> your opinion doesn't count

[02:30:42] <scott> it wouldn't be considered a polite term
[02:30:45] <awe> Layl: generally not, but people choose all sorts of pronouns.
[02:30:50] <aji> when a person's gender is complicated enough that you have to ask that,
[02:30:58] <aji> it's safest to ask them what they prefer
[02:31:03] <scott> "it" is used for gendered things like pets somewhat commonly
[02:31:08] <scott> it's not really for genderless things
[02:31:17] <scott> more like non-person things
[02:31:18] <awe> aji: but asking people makes them feel targeted and uncomfortable!
[02:31:30] <awe> aji: therefore, we all need to declare our pronouns whenever we meet anyone.
[02:31:38] <awe> aji: and we should remind them every time we speak with them.
[02:31:39] <aji> ok so
[02:31:50] <awe> (not your argument, but an argument I've heard)

[02:37:41] <niconii> calc0000: the former
[02:37:47] <aji> well tbh niconii i can understand that afk, but on irc it seems like a very innocent mistake
[02:37:52] <niconii> calc0000: basically, i'm a woman, and i'm trans, so i'm a trans woman
[02:37:53] <Layl> calc0000, you refer to a person by their gender, not sex
[02:37:57] <niconii> calc0000: it's as simple as that
[02:37:58] <Layl> that's the way I remember it at least
[02:38:22] <ChrisMorgan> Seriously, people in that sort of a situation must expect that people will be confused. What they have done to their bodies is not natural and not at this time at least widespread, nor have people been trained in how to deal with such situations.
[02:38:32] <calc0000> i just wasn't sure if the designation referred to the source or destination gender
[02:38:35] <aji> i think the only reason somebody would use "he" when referring to a new acquaintance on irc is because of the assumption that most irc users are men
[02:38:37] <niconii> anyway, when you go your whole life not being able to express your gender, you really get overprotective about your identity
[02:38:39] <Layl> ChrisMorgan, let's not go into the "natural" debate
[02:38:46] <aji> not because the text is particularly mannish or something
[02:38:48] <niconii> ChrisMorgan: yeah, don't go there
[02:39:11] <awe> Well, not natural /= wrong.
[02:39:21] <awe> It is quite literally an artificial process.
[02:39:23] <niconii> anyway, i myself try to be understanding of people who misgender me by accident
[02:39:34] <Layl> awe, it occurs naturally too actually
[02:39:40] <Layl> a really small percentage but still
[02:39:41] <niconii> it cuts pretty deep tbh, but i'm understanding about it
[02:39:46] <ChrisMorgan> Layl: I mean it in the most prosaic manner. It is *not* natural. I did not connect “naturalness” with any sense of goodness.
[02:39:56] <niconii> though i have no tolerance for people who do it intentionally
[02:40:17] <awe> Layl: you're saying that naturally there are human beings that are born as male and then transition into female without human intervention?
[02:40:23] <scott> I've heard some stories of people born intersex who get treated pretty awfully by law/governments which have no idea how to handle them
[02:40:27] <Layl> awe, yes
[02:40:32] <awe> sauce?
[02:40:32] <aji> i had a friend who jokingly used "it" to refer to my trans friends. that is, until one of our friends came out as trans. he put a lid on it real quick after that
[02:40:37] <aji> funny how a little perspective can change a person.
[02:40:52] <scott> awe: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersex may help
[02:41:12] <awe> This is not transitioning.
[02:41:19] <WindowsBunny> I'm okay with people referring to me as either he or bunny
[02:41:25] <scott> awe: it's a related issue
[02:41:40] <awe> Yes, and it's one I'm aware of.
[02:41:41] <WindowsBunny> if someone refers to me with they, I will usually inform them about my gender
[02:41:53] <awe> I was asking for a source on human beings naturally transitioning in sex without human intervention.
[02:42:11] <Layl> awe, I don't have a direct source by hand
[02:42:19] <Layl> I thought it fell under "intersex" though
[02:42:20] <niconii> kind of a moot point either way, isn't it
[02:42:33] <aji> ok "not natural" sounds like "unnatural" sounds like "freakish" sounds like "weird" etc etc
[02:42:40] <aji> it's just a connotations thing
[02:42:57] <awe> Right, I was just pointing out that AFAIK it is literally an artificial process.
[02:42:58] <Layl> I myself like to default to "not vanilla"
[02:43:19] <WindowsBunny> awe: I heard from someone else that there is a remote place where due to genetics, your male hormones don't trigger early on so you start out in life as a girl, and then when puberty hits you get your male parts
[02:43:34] <awe> niconii: definitely a moot point in the discussion of whether someone who tries to conflate something being artificial with something being wrong is an asshole (spoiler alert: they are)
[02:43:37] <WindowsBunny> awe: But I don't have a direct source for that, although I really wish I did have one
[02:44:09] <aji> i just try to be more understanding of people when they share their experiences
[02:44:19] <awe> WindowsBunny: interesting.
[02:44:23] <aji> i used to think the whole trans thing was cut and dry. "just look in your pants, silly! how can you *feel* like a girl?"
[02:44:55] <WindowsBunny> The gender you feel like is a social construct
[02:45:11] <Layl> interestingly there's also entire spectrums of ways trans people have trouble with their bodies that call for different treatments
[02:45:30] <niconii> there's a public perception regarding trans stuff revolving around genitals
[02:45:41] <WindowsBunny> People act and dress differently primarily because they grew up in a society where other males and females acted and dressed differently
[02:46:12] <WindowsBunny> It all starts at an early age with the parents teaching the child what they are
[02:46:23] <awe> In some cultures, homosexuality can be socialized as a gender.
[02:46:43] <WindowsBunny> If someone grows up having difficulties understanding their own gender, its often because their parents raised them up in a way that doesn't conform to society's definition of their gender
[02:46:47] <niconii> and a huge amount of importance placed on gender reassignment surgery, as if that somehow marks you "changing" from one gender to another
[02:47:07] <Layl> yea that's a thing, a lot of trans people from what I hear don't even get a gender reassignment surgery
[02:47:12] <niconii> but it really is not the crux of the matter at all
[02:47:25] <Layl> because it's really invasive and doesn't always have good results
[02:47:30] <WindowsBunny> The only time gender matters is in private areas like locker rooms and bathrooms, and for medical reasons
[02:47:44] <Layl> meaning if the parts down there aren't part of the problem, they're not considered part of the solution either
[02:47:55] <Layl> to avoid the troubles that it may cause otherwise
[02:48:17] <Layl> WindowsBunny, gender isn't physical
[02:48:20] <huon> WindowsBunny: I feel like you are just theorising...
[02:48:38] <WindowsBunny> Layl: Depends on which definition of gender you're using
[02:48:46] <scott> (sex is physical, gender is considered the social/mental idea, usually)
[02:48:46] <Layl> no, the definition of gender is that it isn't physical
[02:48:55] <awe> huon: there's papers on the social construction of gender
[02:49:26] <awe> Layl: one official definition of the word gender is literally sex.
[02:49:34] <aji> saying something is "a social construct" doesn't mean it's not important, though
[02:49:59] <WindowsBunny> Gender can be defined as what your chromosomes say, as what your genitalia say, and what you think you are based on social constructs
[02:50:02] <awe> Layl: another definition (one popularized by sociology and gender studies) is about "femaleness" and "maleness"
[02:50:09] <niconii> i think gender is technically physical, but only in the sense of the brain itself
[02:50:47] <awe> aji: No, of course not. Money is also a social construct.
[02:51:06] <huon> WindowsBunny: it makes sense to choose one definition to be able to talk about things relatively unambiguously, and the most usual ones used in these contexts are what scott said
[02:51:06] <WindowsBunny> The only time that gender matters to me is if I am looking for that significant other in my life, in which case the chromosomes and genitalia must agree with what I am interested in, but the rest I don't care so long as I feel attracted to them
[02:51:07] <awe> (There is no inherent value to the piece of paper you exchange for goods and services.)
[02:51:24] <Layl> WindowsBunny, that's where sex matters, not gender
[02:51:42] <huon> WindowsBunny: i.e. arguing what the word 'gender' means is unuseful and somewhat silly.
[02:51:42] <awe> WindowsBunny: I find it a strange prospect that to be romantically interested in someone they must have a particular set of chromosomes and genitalia.
[02:51:47] <Layl> the general accepted definition is that sex is physical, even if there's other definitions, this is what's generally followed
[02:51:47] <scott> especially in trans culture, gender usually means the social construct, in contrast to sex. maybe they should have invented new words, but here we are
[02:52:15] <awe> Layl: while this is true, it's primarily because that's a fight that loud people have won.
[02:52:25] <huon> does it matter?
[02:52:32] *** Joins: Boscop (me@moz-5ac.5rj.126.98.IP)
[02:52:37] <Layl> awe, I don't see this as a bad result though
[02:52:38] <WindowsBunny> and everytime I see a question on a form asking "sex", I keep thinking of the response "Yes please"
[02:52:41] <huon> (i.e. we need words to talk about these concepts.)
[02:52:45] <awe> No, it's nice to have.
[02:52:59] <awe> For the sake of discussion though, I want to contrast it with the word "racist."
[02:53:17] <awe> The sociological definition of racist/racism includes a component of social power. 
[02:53:18] <Layl> cue xkcd comic, but go ahead
[02:53:28] <Twisol> Layl: Cache miss - which one?
[02:53:41] <WindowsBunny> I prefer the definition of racism which does not include social power
[02:53:51] <awe> This is a language fight that has not been won yet, and you see people frequently get into arguments over whether or not something was racist.
[02:54:02] <awe> Take the Saida Grundy stuff.
[02:54:28] <awe> You get one group of people saying "Racism is prejudice. This is racist." Another going "You don't know what the word racist means because you're using a definition that is not my sociological one."
[02:54:34] *** Quits: Boscop (me@moz-5ac.5rj.126.98.IP) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[02:54:41] <WindowsBunny> awe: It's because people believe that whether the word racism applies affects whether or not the thing that occurred is morally/legally wrong
[02:54:43] <Layl> Twisol, http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/the_sake_of_argument.png
[02:55:00] <Twisol> Ah, that one! Thanks
[02:55:05] <aji> ok this is a touchy subject, lol
[02:55:20] <WindowsBunny> Very touchy :P
[02:55:22] <awe> This case is interesting, I think, because it's not clear that one definition is more useful than the other in talking about an issue.
[02:55:38] <awe> Nuancing gender and sex makes sense because who cares since previously they meant the same thing.
[02:55:42] <WindowsBunny> And yet in all this time, that PR still is accepted Q_Q
[02:55:51] <WindowsBunny> nobody has rejected it yet for breaking quotation rules
[02:55:53] <awe> But this is a related effort that just outright changes the meaning of a word.
[02:55:55] <aji> classifying things as "wrong" and "right" is the whole reason we have a legal system
[02:56:08] <niconii> i think discrimination as a whole is bad, but i also think that incidents of discrimination against white people are not necessarily comparable to racism against minority groups
[02:56:15] <aji> clarifying definitions is only useful to classify things
[02:56:31] <aji> or to have discussions, i suppose
[02:56:35] <aji> (for the purpose of classifying things)
[02:56:43] <Layl> aji, you have to be reaaalllyy careful with bringing morality into a legal system though
[02:56:55] <WindowsBunny> aji: Due to the advent of internet causing information proliferation you only need to be accused of being right or wrong to have ramifications on your life, no need for the legal system
[02:57:27] <awe> Layl: in all fairness by the way, I did say _discussion_, not _argument_.
[02:57:27] <XMPPwocky> what does that have to do with anything?
[02:57:55] <aji> what i mean to say is, why bother deciding if something is "racist" under some definition?
[02:58:14] <Layl> I'm really surprised that PR go through on the argument that sexism in the past is a good reason for opposite sexism right now
[02:58:26] <XMPPwocky> i mean, if you want to taboo the word "racism" go ahead
[02:58:28] <awe> aji: because generally-speaking, our culture has converged on the idea that prejudice is wrong.
[02:58:37] <aji> classifying it as "racist" isn't intrinsically useful, and i think there are concrete things that can be focused on instead
[02:58:42] <aji> like "are people being hurt by this?"
[02:58:56] <WindowsBunny> Anyone classified as racist can be immediately shunned by society
[02:59:19] <XMPPwocky> uh
[02:59:22] <awe> aji: but the sociological definition of racism is being leveraged to try to minimize the ramifications of some instances of prejudice (i.e. when a majority is targeted).
[02:59:25] <XMPPwocky> wait how did we even get onto racism
[02:59:50] <awe> XMPPwocky: comparing it to "arguing what the word 'gender' means is unuseful and somewhat silly."
[02:59:50] <Layl> conversations evolve
[02:59:57] <XMPPwocky> ah
[02:59:59] <huon> XMPPwocky: clarifying that using the conventional split between sex and gender is useful, since racism doesn't have that split in language
[03:01:14] <aji> also, hi XMPPwocky :p

[03:08:38] <XMPPwocky> http://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/american-english/parmesan-cheese?q=Parmesan+%28cheese%29 how to prounounce Parmesan
[03:08:58] <calc0000> parmeeeesian
[03:09:07] <Layl> I belive it's pronounced "throatwobbler mangrove"
[03:09:13] <calc0000> ah yes that's right
[03:09:23] <niconii> oh god
[03:09:31] <niconii> i was not expecting that at all
[03:09:49] <scott> clearly you aren't from the great state of Parmesan
[03:10:30] <calc0000> i always like some pennsylvania cheese on top of my spaghetti
[03:11:30] <awe> this explains so much.
[03:12:19] <niconii> well
[03:12:34] <niconii> clearly i've been pronouncing permesan *horribly* wrong
[03:12:39] <niconii> *parmesan
[03:12:47] <niconii> i can't even spell it
[03:15:31] <ChrisMorgan> niconii: you’ve heard the saying “two wrongs don’t make a right?” Well, with language it’s simply not true. Once enough people get it “wrong”, “right” changes.
[03:16:03] <awe> ChrisMorgan: lol
[03:16:39] <niconii> ChrisMorgan: so, in other words, all we have to do is get everyone to pronounce parmesan "pennsylvania", and then it will be correct
[03:16:57] <ChrisMorgan> niconii: you are correct.
[03:18:21] <aji> parmesan cheese rules
[03:18:26] <aji> the only better cheeses are asiago and gorgonzola
[03:18:52] <ChrisMorgan> Simple cheddar.
[03:19:00] <niconii> i'm sorry, did you say arkansas and georgia
[03:19:14] <scott> if you're going cheddar, extra old cheddar

[07:17:30] <eddyb> the drop glue, size and align could be moved to the library

[10:48:25] <mkpankov> interesting, amount of dismissive ignorant posts about Rust really skyrockets lately. reminds me of Haskell-hate
[10:49:51] <ent> the amount of all Rust posts has skyrocketed
[10:52:34] <fmtq> rust
[10:52:39] <fmtq> I haven't heard of rust
[10:52:40] <fmtq> what is it
[10:53:35] <cmr> it's a thing that gets on your car
[10:54:00] <mkpankov> and turns it into parasitic fungi
[10:54:35] <Layl> help, I'm going to have to teach a group of 3-4 students rust
[10:54:42] *** Joins: Boscop (me@moz-5ac.5rj.126.98.IP)
[10:54:42] <Layl> what do
[10:54:50] <Layl> well, I'm going to have to give a primer on it
[10:55:13] <mkpankov> Layl: get inspired by TRPL and, well, make slides out of it? :)
[10:55:27] <fmtq> Layl: don't?
[10:55:27] <mkpankov> (I kinda did that)
[10:55:38] <fmtq> teach them something useful like Forth
[10:55:45] <Layl> I don't have time to make slides, I just heard it and it's in like 2 hours I think
[10:55:53] <mkpankov> oh
[10:55:59] <fmtq> Layl: do it live
[10:56:05] <Layl> I've got a whiteboard though
[10:56:16] <mkpankov> Layl: fire up your editor and do live coding?
[10:56:52] <fmtq> Layl: no.
[10:56:56] <fmtq> everything about this seems wrong
[10:56:57] <fmtq> you're doing it wrong
[10:56:59] <fmtq> everything is wrong.
[10:57:03] <huon> Layl: cover the whiteboard in apostrophes
[10:57:07] <fmtq> huon: yes
[10:57:08] <fmtq> obvs
[10:57:11] <fmtq> and where clauses
[10:57:22] <huon> Layl: but srsly, what background?
[10:57:30] <Layl> well the thing is the intention was I was going to do some usability testing and UI testing
[10:57:44] <Layl> but then it turned out the UI wasn't done yet
[10:57:51] <mkpankov> > UI > Rust
[10:57:51] <mkpankov> hehe
[10:58:03] <Layl> then it turned out the testers were actually programmers interested in the project
[10:58:08] <Layl> so I decided to turn it into an API test
[10:58:09] <huon> (e.g. are they coming from C/C++/..., or Python/Ruby/JS/...?)
[10:58:16] <Layl> they're coming from C#
[10:58:34] <fmtq> haaha
[10:58:37] * fmtq pulls out gun
[10:58:40] <fmtq> you're going to need this
[10:58:42] <Layl> with a slight sprinkle of mixed Lua/PHP/Basic
[10:59:14] <mkpankov> Layl: spare them of ownership, then, I guess
[10:59:23] <mkpankov> they got used to GC :|
[10:59:53] <huon> Layl: the experience-report of http://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/2tsu9q/a_rusty_whiteboard/ might be helpful?
[10:59:54] <Layl> they're going to run into ownership sooner or later
[11:00:23] <Layl> the thing is, they're apparently... gasp! interested!
[11:00:39] <huon> Layl: since it's such a small group I guess you'll be able to explore in a personalised/"flexible" way
[11:00:42] <Layl> I want to find a way to keep them interested and not crush that interested with overwhelming complexity
[11:01:04] *** Quits: Boscop (me@moz-5ac.5rj.126.98.IP) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[11:01:34] <huon> mkpankov: I suspect ownership may be an interesting thing to sell
[11:02:35] <huon> mkpankov: GC languages still have a concept of ownership of resources e.g. closing resource handles (files etc.) in a timely fashion requires understanding who owns the resource
[11:03:34] <Layl> C# has the concept of IDisposable with using() {}
[11:03:55] <Layl> which is to RAII like margarine is to butter
[11:04:00] <Layl> not quite
[11:04:27] <mkpankov> huon: you might be right, but my experience talking with 2 C# programmers about Rust tells otherwise
[11:04:33] <huon> yeah, explicit ownership/RAII like occurs in quite a few GC languages
[11:04:58] <huon> mkpankov: ah, I've never talked with C# people specifically, but I have with some Java people
[11:05:07] <Layl> I used to be a really involved C# person
[11:05:15] <huon> (obviously it's a personal thing whether that sort of ownership really "matters")
[11:05:17] <Layl> I ditched it because the GC was getting in my way
[11:05:44] <huon> Layl: sounds like you have a good perspective on what these people may be thinking
[11:05:45] <mkpankov> problem is, until you stumble into limitations of GC and understand its' GC which hampers program in some way, you accept it
[11:06:04] <Layl> I've got a whiteboard
[11:06:13] <Layl> that's all I need to explain why a GC is bad in real time programs
[11:07:21] <mkpankov> Layl: but not everyone writes real-time
[11:07:58] <Layl> these people are specifically interested in game programming
[11:08:00] <Layl> so they do
[11:08:07] <mkpankov> oh, cool then
[11:08:29] <mkpankov> hope Unity didn't spoil them with C# and JavaScript yet :P
[11:09:39] <Layl> Unity can do some amazing things with C#

[11:10:21] <Layl> well, nice being a relative word

[11:10:45] <huon> Layl: how long have you got with them?

[11:10:58] <huon> oh, wow

[14:01:41] <imperio> Manishearth: here we go
[14:01:56] <Manishearth> imperio: the F was capital because France is a proper noun
[14:02:13] <Manishearth> Frenchman / French are also proper noun/adjective s
[14:02:33] <imperio> so a derive from a proper noun keeps the capital ?
[14:02:41] <Manishearth> usually yes
[14:03:33] <imperio> I totally ignored that, thanks for the lesson ! ^^
[14:03:42] <imperio> hum
[14:03:50] <Manishearth> np :)
[14:04:01] <imperio> "didn't know that" instead of "ignored" would have been better no ?
[14:04:07] <Manishearth> yes
[14:04:22] <imperio> arf, another fake friend then
[14:04:29] <Manishearth> fake friend?
[14:04:33] <imperio> hum...
[14:04:42] <Manishearth> ignored could have also been correct if you had actually ignored this whilst learning :p
[14:05:06] <imperio> in french we have the expression "faux ami" to say "words which look alike but doesn't have the same meaning between two languages"
[14:05:27] <imperio> yes, that's what I thought on second sight
[14:05:29] <fmtq> false friend in English
[14:05:38] <fmtq> a pseudo-cognate.
[14:05:44] <imperio> cognate ?
[14:05:49] <Manishearth> aha
[14:05:53] <Manishearth> It's called a false cognate
[14:05:55] <Manishearth> yes
[14:06:02] <imperio> what does that mean ?
[14:06:15] <Manishearth> an example is libraire
[14:06:19] <Manishearth> sounds like library
[14:06:35] <Manishearth> but library = bibliotheque = place for lending books
[14:06:45] <Manishearth> libraire = bookstore = place for buying books
[14:06:47] <imperio> the exact word was more librairie
[14:06:52] <Manishearth> yeah
[14:06:55] <imperio> which has the same pronunciation
[14:07:04] <Manishearth> librairie is a false cognate of library
[14:07:07] <imperio> libraire is a person working in a librairie
[14:07:12] <Manishearth> one thinks they mean the same, they don't 
[14:07:14] <Manishearth> aha, thanks!
[14:07:33] <imperio> yea, I sadly knows this because it took me years (yes, years) to know that
[14:08:04] <fmtq> uh, cognate just means common etymological origin 
[14:08:12] <imperio> I always used "lib" as abreviation for librairie and not library, so it took me a while to discover my error
[14:08:13] <Manishearth> so?
[14:08:18] <fmtq> so all of those things were cognates.
[14:08:19] <fmtq> lel
[14:08:25] <imperio> haha
[14:08:26] <Manishearth> oh I see
[14:08:30] <fmtq> the imperio ones I mean.
[14:08:38] <fmtq> livre and book are not cognates.
[14:08:44] <Manishearth> course
[14:08:55] <fmtq> library and libraire 
[14:08:56] <Manishearth> pseudocognate might be more correct
[14:08:58] <fmtq> are technically cognatic 
[14:09:03] <Manishearth> I've seen false cognate used for such words
[14:09:04] <fmtq> but still faux amis 
[14:09:08] <Manishearth> but I know what you mean
[14:09:11] <fmtq> because the _meaning_ changes
[14:09:15] <fmtq> their etymological root is the same 
[14:09:19] <Manishearth> yeah
[14:09:28] <fmtq> the both come from "shit place to put books" 
[14:09:37] <fmtq> they* 
[14:09:38] <imperio> I did learn a lot of things, that's really nice =D

[18:36:37] <Tiffany> I just want to get the 10 highest values out
[18:37:08] <eddyb> cmr: do you happen to know any crate which implements total ordering for floating-point?
[18:37:16] <Tiffany> it's kind of ridiculous that I need 25 lines of code just to be able to make a BinaryHeap out of my dead-simple struct
[18:37:31] <Tiffany> maybe BinaryHeap isn't what I wanted, but I don't know what rust calls all the various collections
[18:37:36] <Tiffany> in C++ I'd have used std::map
[18:38:03] <eddyb> BTreeMap?
[18:38:13] <eddyb> they should both work AFAIK

[18:38:50] <eddyb> one hypothetical magical solution would be #[deriving] modifiers
[18:39:21] <Diggsey> if the type includes both the key and value together then you might want BTreeSet instead
[18:39:30] <Tiffany> it doesn't
[18:39:34] <Tiffany> I want to sort the values by key
[18:39:53] <eddyb> Tiffany: does the key contain a float?
[18:39:59] <Tiffany> the key is a float
[18:40:03] <eddyb> well...
[18:40:03] <Tiffany> f64 to be precise
[18:40:09] <Tiffany> I understand that NaNs don't sort
[18:40:18] <bluss> if you try to use float keys rust will punish you for it
[18:40:30] <Tiffany> ugh
[18:40:35] <Tiffany> I'll just map it to i64
[18:41:25] <bluss> I've used newtypes to use binaryheap in a simple way. Just something to take  (Key, Payload) and sort only on the .0
[18:41:44] <Diggsey> You could just newtype f32, and then implement Ord by calling out to PartialOrd, if you know you're never going to put NaNs in it
[18:41:54] <Diggsey> *f64 in your case
[18:42:22] <Tiffany> the problem with that is that Ord requires the full gamut of other traits
[18:42:27] <Tiffany> PartialOrd, Eq, PartialEq
[18:42:47] <Tiffany> this would be so much easier if there was a nice safe real type
[18:42:57] <Tiffany> like an f64 that errors on NaN
[18:42:59] <Diggsey> PartialOrd/PartialEq are already implemented for f64
[18:43:06] <Tiffany> but for a newtype?
[18:43:10] <Tiffany> do I need to write wrappers?
[18:43:12] <bluss> you can derive those

[18:54:39] <Tiffany> is there a way to get BTreeMap to return largest keys first, instead of smallest?
[18:54:43] <Diggsey> eddyb: That does sound like a good idea, a NonNan<T> which implements Ord/Eq for all floating point T
[18:54:45] <Tiffany> I guess I could negate them
[18:55:05] <eddyb> Tiffany: or... reverse the iterator :P
[18:55:12] <Tiffany> there's no reverse() method though
[18:55:17] <eddyb> it's .rev()
[18:55:21] <lahwran> it's a doubleendediterator
[19:00:54] <Sho> eddyb: I wonder if we can somehow establish a license for the Kate rust hl file
[19:03:29] <eddyb> does it need to be GPL-ified for upstreaming?
[19:04:28] <Sho> eddyb: Some other licenses would work too, but just 'stealing' a file from rust-lang and copying it over to ktexteditor.git would be kind of a no-no at least ... and it has no license info on the repo or in the repo, and 19 contributors, so -> ew
[19:05:25] <Sho> but it seems to have been originally in the main rust repo, so it might have been covered by its license info, not sure
[19:05:47] <Sho> I'll have to ask the licensint hawks at Debian legal or so
[19:05:50] <Sho> *licensing
[19:06:38] <eddyb> Sho: yeah, it was moved without copying the LICENSE

[19:06:55] <eddyb> Sho: feel free to submit a PR with rust-lang/rust's LICENSE
[19:07:42] <Sho> A bit tricky in itself because rust-lang/rust has multiple, so it's on headers in files to disambiguify, etc.
[19:09:09] <Tiffany> is there a way to repeat an iterator forever?
[19:09:20] <eddyb> .cycle()
[19:09:30] <GaryOak_> There's a method for everything!
[19:09:34] <Sho> on the upside, the MIT option would be compatible w/ https://techbase.kde.org/Policies/Licensing_Policy

[19:12:00] <Sho> eddyb: alright, I'll talk to him about maybe doing a PR submitting LICENSE-MIT as LICENSE, and perhaps broaching the topic of whether to move upstream to ktexteditor.git wholesale to avoid having to sync two copies (otoh having the hl file close to the community changing the syntax also has its upsides, so not entirely sure about that)
[19:12:41] <Sho> And to be nice about it, the Kate format is also used by Qt Creator, so the file isn't just useful for Kate ... then again, Creator users may be used to getting files from ktexteditor

[20:53:12] <GaryOak_> plumshark: courier is more of a typewriter font
[20:53:37] <GaryOak_> lahwran: random number lol
[20:53:40] <lahwran> turns out, "generate Gaussian distributions with mean 0 and standard deviation 1" is what randn does. so what are those arguments? ARRAY DIMENSIONS

[20:55:05] <lahwran> nope, turns out it gives you [[num], [num], [num]]

[20:55:38] <fkaa> plumshark: terminus
[20:56:23] <lahwran> all because someone, when designing linear algebra, decided that it was a reasonable thing to make the data itself have orientation, rather than the type
[20:56:30] <eddyb> :|
[20:56:34] <lahwran> it's the same type, it's just ... oriented differently within the type
[20:56:37] <plumshark> ohhh terminus is pretty. guess I just liked the sharper corners, not necessarily pixelly fonts. thank you!
[20:56:38] <lahwran> wat r u smokin

[20:57:23] <lahwran> yes
[20:57:32] <lahwran> how is transpose a newtype
[20:57:41] <eddyb> well
[20:57:48] <eddyb> you can work with it as a newtype, I mean

[20:58:01] <lahwran> orientation-based things are really annoying because then nothing in the symbols actually says they're happening

[20:58:57] <lahwran> "as values"
[20:58:57] <Tiffany> I want to write a function which takes an iterator of u8
[20:59:02] <Tiffany> how do I write the type
[20:59:06] <eddyb> into functions is easy, just make it generic over Iterator<Item=u8>
[20:59:08] <Tiffany> "&Iterator" doesn't say anything about "u8"
[20:59:12] <Tiffany> oh
[20:59:12] <eddyb> returning is hard
[20:59:23] <eddyb> Tiffany: you don't use trait objects, but generics, for this
[20:59:44] <eddyb> unless you want your perf to suck, intentionally
[20:59:48] <lahwran> rust's type system has a lot more implicitness than I originally expected

[21:12:07] <eddyb> that's a nice release :P
[21:12:07] <Tiffany> nth() doesn't do what I was expecting it to
[21:12:20] <eddyb> Tiffany: what did you expect it to do? random access?
[21:12:40] <Tiffany> it only returns a single element after skipping N
[21:12:46] <Tiffany> I want to make an iterator out of every Nth element
[21:13:00] <Tiffany> I don't see an easy way to do this
[21:13:05] <eddyb> oh
[21:13:17] <eddyb> well.........
[21:13:21] <eddyb> Tiffany: there is an easy way
[21:13:24] <Tiffany> I can .enumerate().filter().unzip() I think
[21:13:25] <eddyb> it's not nice though :P
[21:13:35] <eddyb> what's unzip?
[21:13:45] <panicbit> The opposite of zip
[21:13:46] <panicbit> :P
[21:14:03] <eddyb> I was going to suggest .zip((0..n).cycle())
[21:14:36] <pingveno> eddyb: Does that allocate?
[21:14:41] <eddyb> no
[21:14:41] <niconii> eddyb: unzip is [(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)] -> [1, 3, 5] and [2, 4, 6]
[21:14:54] <eddyb> but why would Tiffany need that?
[21:15:43] <niconii> why would she need unzip? to discard the enumerate numbers i assume
[21:15:49] <eddyb> but...
[21:15:54] <eddyb> I've never seen unzip in Rust
[21:16:03] <panicbit> it makes sense
[21:16:07] <eddyb> and I expect it to be impossible in the general case
[21:16:15] <Tiffany>             let (_, transposed) = input.iter().skip(b).cloned().enumerate().filter(|&(i,_)| i%b == 0).unzip();
[21:16:24] <eddyb> as you'd have two heads
[21:16:28] <eddyb> using the same iterator
[21:16:34] <panicbit> But it might be more performant to map it instead of unzipping
[21:16:59] <eddyb> Loops through the entire iterator, collecting the first component of each item into one new container, and the second component into another.
[21:17:03] <panicbit> (to discard the enumeration isntead of collecting it into a Vec or something similar)
[21:17:08] <eddyb> oh
[21:17:11] <eddyb> it's a collect
[21:17:15] <panicbit> basically yes
[21:17:18] <niconii> yeah, unzip takes an iterator and returns two collections, basically
[21:17:20] <eddyb> Tiffany: don't use unzip
[21:17:23] <Tiffany> okay
[21:17:26] <Tiffany> I used .map instead
[21:17:31] <eddyb> who thought unzip was a good idea in the first place?!
[21:17:55] <panicbit> I think it's intersting to have
[21:17:58] <eddyb> I guess a more general solution might require VG
[21:18:16] <niconii> what does VG stand for
[21:18:22] <panicbit> ^
[21:18:38] <eddyb> wait, it uses Extend... how
[21:18:44] <bluss> unzip is magic
[21:18:47] <eddyb> I need to read the implementation now, this might be a perf trap
[21:18:50] <bluss> oh and some sleight of hand
[21:19:15] <panicbit> How is unzip magic? It's basically folding tuples into to collections...
[21:19:20] <panicbit> two*
[21:19:26] <fmtq> mm.
[21:19:30] <fmtq> I just realised I have classes tomorrow
[21:19:34] <bluss> it uses a funky trick to pre-size the collection
[21:19:36] <fmtq> both of which require ACTIVE ATTENTION
[21:19:41] <eddyb> panicbit: it's less efficient than collect but it doesn't waste allocations
[21:19:44] <bluss> that's the only part that's a bit sleight of hand and borderline
[21:19:47] <panicbit> There should be unzip3 though :P
[21:19:53] <eddyb> panicbit: NO
[21:19:55] <panicbit> ;P

[23:11:47] <Tiffany> http://sprunge.us/AcTj?rust
[23:11:59] <Tiffany> 	key 254, score 99.262003: %E5%C9%C9%CD%CF%C8%C1%86%EB%E5%81%D5%86%CA%CF%CD%C3%86%C7%86%D6%C9%D3%C8%C2%86%C9%C0%86%C4%C7%C5%C9%C8
[23:12:12] <Tiffany> a string consisting entirely of unprintables should not be scoring this high
[23:12:19] <mrmonday> I like being just out of tune
[23:12:25] <mrmonday> so it sounds like aliens are talking
[23:12:58] <fmtq> aliens are probably smarter than you
[23:13:02] <fmtq> your interpretation of them is wrong
[23:13:04] <fmtq> AMERICAN
[23:13:08] * fmtq slaps your ethnocentrism
[23:13:23] <mrmonday> who are you calling American?
[23:14:04] <niconii> i'm noticing a lot of these entries read "Japanese Slot Machine"
[23:14:26] <niconii> what, do slot machines in japan just make broadcasts on random frequencies or what
[23:14:50] <Tobba> have you seen japanese slot machines?
[23:14:54] <Tobba> those things are fucking insane
[23:15:39] <huon> Tiffany: you may be interest in http://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/collections/struct.HashMap.html#method.entry btw
[23:15:59] <huon> Tiffany: `*ct.entry(c).or_insert(0) += 1`
[23:16:31] <fmtq> pachinko
[23:17:04] <niconii> ahh, it doesn't literally mean a slot machine
[23:17:13] <niconii> the name "slot machine" just describes how it sounds
[23:17:21] <Tiffany> another thing it came up with is
[23:17:22] <Tiffany> key 95, score 99.230136: Dhhlni`'JD t'knlb'f'whric'ha'efdhi
[23:17:26] <Tiffany> which is fascinating
[23:17:52] <huon> Tiffany: I think I know the problem with unprintables
[23:18:00] <Tiffany> xoring english text seems like a really easy way to quickly make faux alien languages
[23:18:23] <huon> Tiffany: v1 == 0, v2 == -0.1 so the difference squared is 0.01
[23:18:44] <Tiffany> oh
[23:18:47] <huon> (although that doesn't quite match 99.262)
[23:20:02] <Tiffany> so it's ranking up strings with as many values as possible
[23:20:03] <Tiffany> weird
[23:20:11] <Tiffany> I added a continue statement when v1 is zero
[23:20:38] <Tiffany> tobba: how often does the station say things in russian?
[23:20:56] <Tiffany> also, SDR is amazing
[23:21:40] <Tobba> Tiffany: it's pretty rare
[23:21:46] <Tiffany> hmm

[23:25:20] <Tobba> I wonder if thats still broadcasting
[23:27:44] <niconii> hmmm
[23:27:53] <niconii> i found something at 3630 kHz LSB

[23:29:09] <barosl> https://gist.github.com/tylertreat/604c5c465204a9be22c5#file-map_lookup-go
[23:29:11] <barosl> Waaaaat
[23:29:38] <cmr> what?
[23:29:55] <cmr> that's, like, the most common error handling pattern in go.
[23:30:00] <bstrie> ChrisMorgan: I can neither confirm nor deny the provenance of horse-based twitter shenanigans
[23:30:05] <barosl> I knew Go's builtin types are blessed, but isn't that too extreme?
[23:30:22] <barosl> Changing the return semantics?
[23:30:27] <ChrisMorgan> bstrie: I’ve retracted my belief it was you, anyway.
[23:30:56] <scott> barosl: isn't it just a case of ignoring the second value?
[23:31:10] <barosl> scott, No, in that case value should have been a slice
[23:31:20] <barosl> I don't know what it is called in Go, though
[23:31:35] <scott> not sure what you mean
[23:31:42] <scott> value := intMap["foo"]
[23:31:45] <bstrie> barosl: is the implication that go lets you do `value :=` instead of `value, _ :=` ?
[23:31:49] <scott> I think of this like value, _ := intMap["foo"]
[23:31:51] <scott> am I wrong?
[23:32:02] <bstrie> but only for indexing?
[23:32:18] <barosl> scott, Uh, is it? I thought Go generally emits errors if the programmer doesn't handle the second value
[23:32:25] <scott> I don't know Go
[23:32:40] <bstrie> Manishearth: ping, we have go questions
[23:32:55] <barosl> bstrie, Yes, I think so, though it doesn't happen in "normal" functions defined by us
[23:33:02] <Tiffany> it's nard to navigate this
[23:33:04] <barosl> Go's builtin types are absolutely blessed
[23:33:15] <ChrisMorgan> My recollection is that indexing in Go can produce one or two values, depending on how you use it.
[23:33:50] <scott> that's pretty interesting if so
[23:34:06] <ChrisMorgan> That f(a[b]) will be single-value, not sure what happens if it’s missing, and c := a[b] ditto, but c, d := a[b] is the value, err thing.
[23:34:21] <ChrisMorgan> But it’s a few years since I learned go and I haven’t touched it for a couple of years now.
[23:34:24] <scott> and this can't be true of user-defined functions?
[23:34:36] <ChrisMorgan> No, lots of magic stuff in Go.
[23:34:51] <barosl> Huh, you're right
[23:34:53] <ChrisMorgan> Go is the antithesis of Rust in this way. Rust strives to take things out of the language, Go does the opposite.
[23:35:06] <barosl> If a[b] always returns two values, it cannot be used in a situation like f(a[b]) ...
[23:35:09] <ChrisMorgan> barosl: what happens if the value is missing? Just nil or null or whatever?
[23:35:18] <barosl> Well, let's try out
[23:35:35] <huon> http://play.golang.org/p/32QR3234Gz
[23:35:53] <barosl> 0
[23:35:55] <barosl> 0?!
[23:36:11] <barosl> Seriously? 0?
[23:36:13] <huon> http://play.golang.org/p/kDAIKbRJUl
[23:36:15] <scott> if you make it a string map it's empty string :D
[23:36:37] <huon> a very different philosophy to rust!
[23:37:06] <barosl> It reminds of Nim, which has an implicit `result` local variable that is returned when a function ends, *which has a default value of 0*
[23:37:25] <barosl> Or whatever a type's default is
[23:37:34] <barosl> e.g. empty string for the string type
[23:37:49] <barosl> I'm surprised this behavior is common in mainstream languages!
[23:38:02] *** Joins: dpc_ (dpc@moz-7gui97.nvidia.com)
[23:38:08] <cmr> Neither go nor nim are mainstream yet.
[23:38:13] *** Joins: dpc__ (dpc@moz-7gui97.nvidia.com)
[23:38:17] <scott> particularly nim
[23:38:27] <barosl> Well, I would call Go semi-mainstream, though
[23:38:35] <barosl> secondstream?
[23:38:50] <pingveno> I'm seeing Go pop up quite a bit in DevOps.
[23:38:57] <scott> Go is being used extensively by at least one large company
[23:39:02] <barosl> lol
[23:39:13] <barosl> That company seems to be too large :P
[23:39:19] <Tiffany> atmospheric noise at the wide bands sounds interesting
[23:39:34] <ChrisMorgan> Things like maps are built into the language in Go and you definitely can’t implement anything like them yourself.
[23:40:23] <fmtq> ew
[23:40:26] <fmtq> fuck go
[23:40:35] <barosl> /tmp/sandbox890202949/main.go:7: multiple-value os.Open() in single-value context
[23:40:54] <barosl> This is the error when I ignore the second value for "normal" functions
[23:41:06] <scott> I read on a blog somewhere that a function returning 2 values can be passed to one taking 2 arguments as in foo(bar())
[23:41:14] <scott> where foo takes 2 arguments
[23:41:31] <fmtq> hah what
[23:41:32] <barosl> (Welp, I thought Go's multiple return values is a form of tuple like Python and Rust do, but it seems not)
[23:41:40] <niconii> sounds confusing...
[23:41:46] <fmtq> can we not 
[23:41:51] <barosl> scott, Let me test it
[23:41:55] <fmtq> this is rust-offtopic, not go-offtopic
[23:41:59] <GaryOak_> haha
[23:42:01] <fmtq> we're meant to talk about rust here
[23:42:02] <ChrisMorgan> barosl: they’re magic, not tuples.
[23:42:03] <Gankro> scott: I believe Lua does that too
[23:42:04] <scott> barosl: looks more like Common Lisp's multiple return values, which I always found more confusing than they needed to be
[23:42:16] <niconii> fmtq: but what's more offtopic from rust than go?
[23:42:28] <Gankro> Although iirc lua lets you inject a multi-return in any comma-sperated-list
[23:42:29] <fmtq> haemorrhoids 
[23:42:45] <scott> Gankro: I have vague recollections of that
[23:42:46] <fmtq> yes lua does
[23:42:58] <fmtq> but python does too 
[23:43:01] <fmtq> return x, y
[23:43:02] <barosl> scott, No, it doesn't. But is has an interesting behavior
[23:43:05] <barosl> http://play.golang.org/p/TzBBFFqUMx
[23:43:06] <fmtq> it returns a tuple.
[23:43:31] <barosl> It seems that if you pass the result of a function that returns two values, the receiving function should also take two values
[23:43:42] <fmtq> looks like JS
[23:43:44] <fmtq> in a bad way.
[23:43:44] <barosl> If I omit "err error" in hello, it errors
[23:43:55] <barosl> /tmp/sandbox452132840/main.go:13: too many arguments in call to hello
[23:44:15] <scott> well, good to know, I guess
[23:44:30] *** Quits: Sho (sho@moz-o6e.jgh.28.5.IP) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[23:44:35] <barosl> Yeah, at least it doesn't implicitly skip the error value
[23:44:42] <barosl> Which is a good thing, I think
[23:44:47] <lahwran> yeah, at least it's not go
[23:44:56] <lahwran> go would, like, just skip the error value, implicitly
[23:45:03] <scott> typical go
[23:47:22] <Manishearth> barosl nah, it tries to cojtinue ajdbsometies doea a nullptrderef

[23:48:07] * lahwran strokes Manishearth's keyboard
[23:48:17] <niconii> hmm, you can just do `fp, _ := os.Open("test.txt")`? so what happens if it actually did fail
[23:49:06] <scott> then fp is probably 0 or something
[23:49:35] <niconii> like it seems to be in this example, yes
