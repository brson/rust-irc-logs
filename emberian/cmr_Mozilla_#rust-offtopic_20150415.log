[00:04:58] <barosl> Wut
[00:05:21] <barosl> I've always read `niche` as [nichi], but I've just heard that someone pronounces it as [nishi]
[00:08:14] <niconii> isn't it just "nitch"
[00:08:56] <niconii> http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/niche
[00:09:29] <barosl> niconii, Sorry, I can't pronounce a consonant without any vowels following!
[00:09:51] <niconii> barosl: ahh
[00:10:18] <barosl> The fact that "strike" is a one-syllable-word made me shocked!
[00:10:29] <barosl> I've always thought it was a 5-syllable-word!
[00:11:27] <niconii> barosl: are you japanese by chance? i know in japanese it'd be su-to-ra-i-ku
[00:11:56] <barosl> niconii, Korean. It is similarly pronounced in Korean, [seu-teu-ra-i-keu]

[00:13:01] *** Joins: kini (kini@moz-c0fl5n.members.linode.com)
[00:13:28] <niconii> barosl: anyway, it seems like there's two pronunciations for "niche"
[00:14:05] <niconii> barosl: one uses a short i sound (like in "hit") and ends with a ch sound
[00:14:09] <barosl> Yup. I wonder which pronouncation is more popular
[00:14:26] <niconii> barosl: and the other uses a long i sound (like the ee in "bee") and ends with a sh sound
[00:14:35] <barosl> Huh, what?
[00:14:50] <c74d> Wiktionary lists four English pronunciations of “niche”.
[00:15:13] <barosl> That's really frustrating, why does the pronunciation of 'i' change in the very same word!
[00:15:22] <barosl> :(
[00:15:57] <c74d> /nɪt͡ʃ/, /niʃ/, and /nɪʃ/ in US English and /niːʃ/ in Commonwealth/Irish English.

[00:17:20] <c74d> barosl: <https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ghoti>
[00:17:30] <barosl> c74d, Ah, I know the joke
[00:17:49] <barosl> ...But I didn't expect to see it from Wiktionary
[00:18:10] <barosl> And it even has an audio file

[00:18:47] <barosl> Absolutely :P
[00:20:41] <niconii> barosl: okay, after looking into it, seems like "niche" was borrowed from french
[00:21:07] <niconii> barosl: so the ones with an ee sound and sh are closer to the original french pronunciation
[00:21:21] <barosl> I see
[00:21:38] <niconii> barosl: but to a native english speaker who doesn't know the pronunciation, nitch would be the first thing that came to mind
[00:24:15] <c74d> niconii: Eh? I'd think that a “default” native pronunciation would use a vowel other than /ɪ/ (I'm assuming that's what you mean), given the presence of the final ‘e’.
[00:25:25] <c74d> Maybe that's regional, though.
[00:26:30] <niconii> c74d: sure, but niche is probably the only word i can think of that ends in -iche
[00:27:05] <niconii> c74d: you could follow the example of size or nine, but it'd sound pretty bizarre
[00:29:23] <niconii> c74d: so when i say /nɪt͡ʃ/ would be the first thing that comes to mind, i'm also talking about "what's natural to say out loud"
[00:30:13] <niconii> c74d: after all, "weirdly-spelled words that sound normal" are a lot more common in english than "regularly-spelled words that sound weird"
[00:35:13] <barosl> If is funny to see that whenever someone claims some language XX is slower than C...
[00:35:31] <barosl> ...Some other guy pops up and says C is slower than Fortran
[00:36:20] <barosl> As a Python programmer it's like a meaningless battle
[00:36:40] <barosl> Why are they even arguing for speed

[11:28:04] <libfud> so
[11:28:14] <libfud> I have determined that the reason my program looks the way it does
[11:28:20] <libfud> is unrelated to my libary
[11:28:28] <libfud> since I've removed all references to it
[11:30:16] <libfud> actually I lied
[11:30:31] <libfud> and it really was related. But at least I've finally isolated it
[11:31:08] <libfud> I thought that if I didn't construct my class which has a struct from my lib as a field, and didn't have that class as a field of the mainwindow class
[11:31:11] <libfud> then it wouldn't matter
[11:31:16] <libfud> but apparently it does

[13:19:37] <WindowsBunny> Once there's a high quality GUI library for Rust, I'm sure developers will flock to Rust
[13:20:17] <libfud> hm
[13:26:53] <libfud> it looks like my minimal example runs
[13:27:00] <libfud> so obviously something else is wrong here
[13:27:05] <libfud> somthing that's probably much harder to find
[13:32:20] <libfud> who knows when you throw C++ into the mix
[13:32:36] <libfud> I guess I should try excluding more and more stuff
[13:35:03] <sillesta> WindowsBunny: thinking Qt-like or more like swing?
[13:35:39] <sillesta> i'm still amazed we have objc support for rust :)
[13:36:09] <barosl> Hmm, what differentiates Qt from Swing?
[13:36:17] <barosl> Both don't use native APIs
[13:37:02] <barosl> I thought they were roughly similar, except Swing's native look-and-feel mimicking is much worse...
[13:37:09] <sillesta> haven't really used qt, but i'd guess its more customizable?
[13:37:16] <libfud> this is the most incredibly elusive bug
[13:37:17] <barosl> Probably
[13:37:19] <sillesta> haven't really seen any highquality stuff made with swing
[13:37:36] <barosl> Frankly I even don't like JetBrain's usage of Swing
[13:38:01] <barosl> IntelliJ*
[13:38:27] <WindowsBunny> sillesta: When I see a GUI made with Qt, it is nearly indistinguishable from native on Windows
[13:38:49] <barosl> If I'm to choose, I'll be more fond of the one using real native APIs
[13:39:04] <WindowsBunny> sillesta: When I see a GUI made with Swing, there's typically a significant difference
[13:39:35] <barosl> WindowsBunny, Yeah, but I still feel some differences in Qt... That makes me uncomfortable
[13:39:42] <libfud> "undefined reference to `vtable for App::XBTVEditorq
[13:39:44] <WindowsBunny> barosl: Qt borrows the style directly from native APIs on Windows, but renders it itself
[13:39:47] <libfud> s/q/`
[13:40:02] <barosl> e.g. The buttons in Qt look a bit different from the native ones
[13:40:14] <WindowsBunny> barosl: On Windows or something else?
[13:40:26] <barosl> On Windows
[13:40:42] <sillesta> the spotify client is made in qt i think
[13:40:50] <barosl> On Linux... Well, there's no such thing that can be called as "native look and fell" :P
[13:40:52] <sillesta> looks nothing like native, in a good way :p
[13:41:07] <barosl> Qt *is* native in Linux
[13:41:20] <barosl> (If you're primarily using KDE)
[13:41:31] <tiffany> barosl: there is something you could call "native look and feel" on linux
[13:41:35] <tiffany> X11 core toolkit
[13:41:47] <barosl> Is that the one used in xterm?
[13:42:20] <barosl> Then... I beg for every GUI widget not to follow the native look and feel!
[13:42:25] <WindowsBunny> barosl: One of the biggest differences between Qt and native I noticed
[13:42:38] <WindowsBunny> is the right click menu on the scrollbar has slightly different capitalization

[13:48:28] <barosl> Did wxWidgets use the native API directly?
[13:48:59] <barosl> And SWT?
[13:49:16] <WindowsBunny> >unlike other cross-platform toolkits,         wxWidgets gives applications a truly native look and feel because it         uses the platform's native API rather than emulating the GUI.
[13:49:22] <barosl> Yeah
[13:49:29] <barosl> I've found SWT was very very native-looking except its tab navigation
[13:49:33] <WindowsBunny> oh neat
[13:49:41] <WindowsBunny> wxwidgets just switched to git and github
[13:49:53] <tiffany> oh
[13:49:58] <tiffany> I think I was wrong
[13:50:09] <tiffany> it looks like there's no GUI stuff built into X, just drawing primitives

[13:52:55] <barosl> Or two

[13:55:03] <libfud> I can not over emphasize just how much I dislike C++

[13:56:55] <barosl> Especially the glorious wxBEGIN_EVENT_TABLE

[14:03:05] <barosl> Nope
[14:03:17] <barosl> We should just write Windows 8 apps
[14:03:38] <barosl> To do that we first need emscripten to transform Rust code to JS code
[14:05:47] <WindowsBunny> barosl: wut
[14:05:58] <WindowsBunny> barosl: We can write windows 8 apps with Rust just fine
[14:06:03] <WindowsBunny> We don't need to compile to JS
[14:06:09] <barosl> Really?
[14:06:21] <barosl> I thought it only accepted JS/C#/VB
[14:06:28] <WindowsBunny> It accepts native C++ code

[14:06:44] <WindowsBunny> So that means, assuming we get the msvc toolchain working with Rust
[14:06:48] <WindowsBunny> that we can make Rust also work
[14:07:10] <WindowsBunny> The standard library would need to be audited though...
[14:07:30] <WindowsBunny> We use a lot of APIs that aren't allowed on windows store apps

[19:11:15] <Astrum|Lap> so why rethinkdb and not sql or mongo?
[19:11:22] <Astrum|Lap> or <name another db>
[19:11:38] <reem> I’m considering it for this because it has this rather cool feature where you can subscribe to be notified of changes to the data

[19:12:45] <Astrum|Lap> yeah, there are triggers in postgres and oplog tailing in mongo

[19:17:52] <Astrum|Lap> what do you mean, GaryOak_ ?
[19:18:29] <GaryOak_> Like DB design has heavy math concepts involved so it's usual PHDs doing DB design
[19:18:39] <Astrum|Lap> ah
[19:18:49] <Astrum|Lap> shame the math is mostly boring
[19:19:29] <GaryOak_> Maybe to you :P

[19:20:31] <Astrum|Lap> GaryOak_: to be fair I'm weird when it comes to math. algebraic topology is what generally interests me
[19:21:12] <Astrum|Lap> reem: there's no one solution to efficient schema design, it kind of depends on what you're doing
[19:21:27] <reem> Right, but there have to be some basic principles
[19:21:35] <reem> There can’t just be absolutely no guiding rules
[19:22:01] <reem> Honestly I’d watch an entire lecture series if it just covered a bunch of different non-insane ways to design schemas

[19:25:27] <reem> I’ve talked about this with lots of other non-cs-degree programmers who’ve had a similar experience and mostly I’ve heard that the only way is to deal with an actual database because toy examples don’t actually force you to cover any of the real issues
[19:25:58] <GaryOak_> so you have to get into the quicksand before you can actually start testing concepts

[19:27:30] <Astrum|Lap> if you want to learn this stuff then there are plenty of good books on the subject (I'm assuming anyway, I couldn't recommend one)
[19:27:36] <Astrum|Lap> but you should also make a project
[19:28:28] <Astrum|Lap> you'll suffer through the "I have no idea if this is a good design" phase

[19:28:43] <reem> that I’m familiar with :P
[19:28:44] <Astrum|Lap> and you'll iterate on it
[19:29:37] <GaryOak_> databases seem like the theory is a lot closer to the code than in other areas
[19:29:51] <GaryOak_> same with programming language design

[23:23:43] <Lurkin> And 8:22, probably 9:22 as well.
[23:23:45] <bstrie> gnu hurd 0.6 released today. think it's too late in development to convince them to throw it all out and start over in rust?
[23:23:47] <scott> proc: I've never paid attention :p
[23:24:03] <proc> scott: ah, better so for you, spared you time ^^
[23:24:08] <eddyb> hurd? really?
[23:24:25] <niconii> bstrie: well, what's a few extra years for gnu hurd
[23:24:27] <eddyb> I wonder how it compares to pedigree
[23:24:35] <scott> is hurd more or less ridiculous than reactos?
[23:24:43] <proc> bstrie: don't you dare, you would destroy their new fond fuzzing tool ^^
[23:24:48] <bstrie> niconii: just thirty years, give or take
[23:24:49] <proc> *found

[23:25:33] <scott> ReactOS is the one going for something like Windows 95 or 2000 compatibility and is starting to get there in the past couple years
[23:25:35] <bstrie> proc: kmc has afl working for rust :)
[23:25:35] <eddyb> is there a list of capabilities?
[23:25:45] <eddyb> for hurd
[23:25:51] <bstrie> eddyb: features include: 1) not linux
[23:25:51] <scott> oh, it's Windows Server 2003 they're targeting
[23:25:53] <proc> bstrie: oh, okay
[23:26:54] <eddyb> bstrie: seriously though
[23:27:23] <eddyb> pedigree had the start of an nvidia driver at some point
[23:27:52] <proc> scott: wasn't 2003 be deprecated from microsoft in the sense of no sec. updates ?
[23:28:01] <proc> *being
[23:28:02] <scott> proc: probably
[23:28:07] <eddyb> and accelerated vmware gfx stuff
[23:28:24] <bstrie> eddyb: honestly all that I know about it is that it's a microkernel rather than a monolith, and that its perpetual vaporware status is what allowed linux to eat its lunch in the 90s
[23:28:45] <bstrie> when I say the feature is that "it's not linux", that's literally the main feature
[23:29:24] <bstrie> wondering if debian still has a hurd-based release
[23:29:29] <scott> that reminds me of Gtk+'s purpose being "it's not Qt" when Qt was still restrictively licensed
[23:29:29] <eddyb> I was going to compare it to a certain hobby OS
[23:29:45] <scott> Hurd ought to count as a hobby OS
[23:29:45] <eddyb> but it seems there's nothing to compare
[23:30:03] <Lurkin> Wasn't there that one guy who wrote his OS in C somewhat recently?
[23:30:11] <Lurkin> Kind of a holier than thou fellow.

[23:30:23] <eddyb> just one guy?
[23:30:27] <scott> are you talking about TempleOS?
[23:30:28] <niconii> Lurkin: it's been around for a while
[23:30:44] <scott> he's actually a more-schizophrenic-than-thou fellow FYI
[23:31:02] <bstrie> templeOS is a work of art, not of technology
[23:31:09] <scott> indeed
[23:31:49] <niconii> i wonder if anyone, like
[23:31:53] <niconii> uses templeos
[23:32:02] <proc> when someone asks why I'm looking so tired: rust irc is too interesting..
[23:32:18] <scott> niconii: I think people use it for fun like they used to use commodore64 or whatever
[23:32:27] <scott> I think even the creator still uses linux primarily

[23:33:22] <niconii> scott: he sure seems to have it readily handy to paste large lists of random words in his comments, though...
[23:34:06] <niconii> maybe he has that part of it as a separate linux program too

[23:35:06] <Lurkin> I'm not sure that's the guy.
[23:35:53] <niconii> terry a. davis made losethos aka templeos aka sparrowos
