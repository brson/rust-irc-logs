[01:21:38] <Peach> in git terminology,
[01:21:44] <Peach> what is "staging an index"
[01:22:39] <Peach> and a separate question - when I do git pull - does that update my local copy and keep my changes?
[01:23:09] <Sho> pull = fetch+merge
[01:23:24] <Sho> you almost always want pull --rebase (fetch+rebase) instead

[01:36:17] <Peach> Sho: why would I not want to pull(fetch+merge)
[01:36:29] <Peach> why is fetch+rebase better?
[01:36:55] <whipsch> Peach: if you have uncommited changes, you will need to either commit or stash them before a pull
[01:37:09] <Peach> OH
[01:37:19] <whipsch> additionally if the changes conflict, you will have to merge
[01:37:27] <whipsch> you will still have to fix conflicts when you rebase
[01:37:41] <whipsch> but it typicall goes a lot smoother, because it will replay your changes on top of the new commits you just received
[01:39:14] <c74d> Peach: this is what the two kinds pull do to your commit history: <https://bpaste.net/show/32c1def5eb37>
[01:39:56] <c74d> Peach: (whipsch's warning about uncommitted changes applies for rebasing as well)

[01:40:59] <Peach> Ok, so,
[01:41:07] <Peach> The "main" repo updated,
[01:41:17] <Peach> and my local repo just adds a new file

[01:41:24] <whipsch> yup
[01:41:27] <Peach> which can I do?
[01:41:32] <c74d> Peach: both!
[01:41:36] <c74d> well, either.
[01:42:12] <c74d> You can use either if you have conflicts, too. You'll need to resolve the conflicts, but that's part of using Git.

[01:42:55] <Peach> pull first?
[01:43:16] <Peach> *local is 2 commits behind master
[01:43:20] <whipsch> if it's uncommited, commit it or stash it (stashing is sort of like a temporary commit that you can unstash later)
[01:43:29] <c74d> mm... Peach: please pastebin (e.g. <https://bpaste.net>) the result of `git status`.
[01:43:55] <c74d> ...or follow other people who are more willing to guess at your situation :)
[01:44:00] <whipsch> heh
[01:45:03] <Peach> I HATE HATE HATE HATE docs that don't give you an example of how to use commands
[01:45:05] <whipsch> Peach: if you're up to it, i recommend https://progit.org/ for learning about git in general
[01:45:20] <Peach> the docs for git status is:           'git status' [<options>...] [--] [<pathspec>...]
[01:45:31] <Peach> That does not help me know what to put into the command line
[01:45:32] <whipsch> `git help status`
[01:45:38] <Peach> it needs to give me an example
[01:46:00] <Peach> without that [<whatdoipud>] stuff I don't get
[01:46:07] <whipsch> `git status` on its own is pretty much all you will need anyway, imo
[01:46:23] <Peach> ho do I use it
[01:46:24] <c74d> Peach: hm, I think all the major Git commands' help pages do have examples?
[01:46:45] <Peach> git status computer/repofolder    doesn't work
[01:46:46] <c74d> ...not `status` though.
[01:46:57] <c74d> Peach: it's just `git status`, usually.
[01:46:57] <Peach> What do I type int Terminal?
[01:47:03] <whipsch> Peach: you have to be within the repository
[01:47:08] <Peach> OH
[01:47:12] <whipsch> eg `cd my/repo && git status`
[01:47:22] <Peach> See, that's totally not explained in the docs
[01:47:37] <c74d> Within the *working tree*, which is the directory that contains the `.git` directory (which is the actual repository).
[01:47:37] <Peach> When you're new you can't always know what to look for
[01:47:57] <whipsch> c74d is much better with terminology than i am :)
[01:48:23] <c74d> Peach: it should be explained in the official Git book that I linked before (which is the same as the Pro Git book that whipsch linked), or in that gitref.org.
[01:48:30] <c74d> If it's not, you could suggest it!
[01:49:14] <Peach> Ok,
[01:49:15] <Peach> https://bpaste.net/show/799204a43eb2
[01:50:02] <Peach> So now how do I update local copy and keep my local changes so THEN I can update the master origin 
[01:50:54] <Peach> Has git no "update local copy to origin" so aptly named? :P
[01:51:21] <c74d> Okay.. you have the new file 'staged' into your 'index' (a list of changes to be committed). You can commit the new file (`git commit -v`) then pull, or 'stash' the change, pull, then unstash and commit the change.
[01:51:44] *** Joins: aatch (james@moz-i1k1ks.tlms.2o1v.e006.2406.IP)
[01:52:04] <c74d> (You don't *need* to use `-v` with `commit`, but I recommend it -- it shows you what you're committing (which is good for not mistakenly committing the wrong thing).
[01:52:18] <c74d> s/$/)/
[01:53:11] <Peach> Ok so: commit to local (and don't push that commit to origin), then pull, then push to origin?
[01:53:56] <Peach> Will git require that a local copy is update before you can try to push to origin?
[01:55:23] <c74d> Peach: yes, though you can 'force' a 'non-fast-forward' push, overwriting the target repo's history with your own (dangerous!).
[01:55:54] <Peach> ack
[01:56:01] <Peach> Does reset delete new files I added/changed
[01:57:01] <aatch> Peach, not sure if it deletes new files, but `reset` doesn't actually make any changes unless you add the `--hard` flag.
[01:57:25] <aatch> Peach, (by that first bit, I mean I'm not sure if it deletes files when using `--hard`)
[01:58:15] <c74d> Peach: `git reset` alone wipes your index but doesn't harm your working tree (the files that you can edit).
[01:58:38] <Havvy> So, how do we get Github to make `gists.github.com` an alias for `gist.github.com`?
[01:58:41] <c74d> `git reset --hard` would erase unsaved changes in the working tree.
[01:59:57] <aatch> c74d, you seem more knowledgable than me about git, does `get reset --hard` work with a target ref?
[02:00:47] <c74d> it does.
[02:01:18] <c74d> (as do `--soft` and (the default) `--mixed`)
[02:01:19] <aatch> c74d, so `git reset --hard <ref>` is like a super-aggressive `git checkout`?

[02:08:21] <Havvy> Peach:  It might create a merge commit if it cannot just fast-forward.
[02:08:33] <c74d> Pulling is generally safe, but not always. Note that unless you cull your 'reflog', you can use it to undo Git operations.
[02:08:33] <Havvy> But otherwise, it's generally safe.
[02:09:08] <c74d> How is creating a merge commit a safety issue? :s
[02:09:13] <Havvy> You can also do `git checkout -b test-branch && git fetch origin/master && git merge FETCH_HEAD
[02:09:27] <Peach> how do I "fast forward" ?
[02:09:50] <Peach> AAAAAA,

[02:11:16] <Peach> "commit change to origin" ?
[02:11:20] <c74d> Peach: a 'fast-forward' merge is a merge that leaves no trace of itself in the history, and can happen when there is no divergence in the commit histories that you're merging.
[02:12:05] <c74d> Peach: uh? commit to your local repository. that's the only "commit" operation that should exist in a Git interface.
[02:12:23] <Peach> oh
[02:12:27] <Peach> OH
[02:13:46] <Peach> Ok so commit(save my changes in git's history), then pull(update with origin), then push to origin (push my local commit to the origin)
[02:13:50] <Peach> is that correct?
[02:13:53] <c74d> yes
[02:14:10] <Sho> except you want to pull --rebase
[02:14:20] <Peach> @_@
[02:14:21] <c74d> not necessarily
[02:14:34] <Sho> why make the unnecessary merge commit
[02:14:52] <Sho> i honestly think defaulting pull to fetch+merge is a git fuckup
[02:15:25] <c74d> Peach: try normal-pull for a while, try rebase-pull for a while, decide which you prefer (and then be prepared to interoperate with repository owners who prefer the other one).
[02:15:57] <Peach> pull --rebase is better why again Sho?
[02:16:14] <c74d> Peach: it doesn't create merge commits, which some people dislike.
[02:16:19] <Havvy> Peach:  Because it keeps the number of machine generated commits low.
[02:16:41] * Havvy gets so annoyed reading the nixpkgs git history and every two or three entries in the commit log are "Merge from user/nixpkgs"

[02:16:48] *** Quits: RC9 (RCIX@moz-7omm6s.ph.cox.net) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[02:16:52] <c74d> However, you don't need to see merge commits if you don't want to -- `git log --no-merges`.
[02:16:55] <Sho> Peach: let's take a step back for a second
[02:17:30] <Havvy> c74d:  Only if you view the log locally. That's no option on the Github interface.
[02:17:46] <Sho> Peach: simplified, a git commit object may contain pointers to one or more parent commit objects
[02:18:05] <Peach> mm hmmm
[02:18:18] <Sho> Peach: so the simplest arrangement is a linear chain of commits each pointing to the preceding (parent) commit
[02:18:30] <Peach> that's what I want
[02:18:51] <c74d> Havvy: ah, yes. but nixpkgs history is so large, that seems... impractical?
[02:19:07] <Sho> Peach: pull is a combo of fetch+merge that produces a 'merge commit', which is a commit object pointing at *two* parents: the head of the remote line of work, and your line of work, thereby bringing it together
[02:19:08] <Havvy> c74d:  I only care about the last few days generally.
[02:19:17] <Havvy> Since I read it once a week.
[02:19:24] <Sho> Peach: that means now you don't have that linear arrangement anymore, but there's a fork in the road
[02:19:32] <Havvy> (For awhile, I actually kept it in a perma-tab)
[02:20:14] <Peach> PULL MAKES AN UNNECESSARY MERGE COMMIT
[02:20:17] <Sho> Peach: pull --rebase instead finds the last common commit between the remote line and your local one to identify what commits were new from you, and then replays them on top of the head of the remote line
[02:20:25] <Sho> Peach: thus you're back to a simple linear chain
[02:20:45] <Peach> pull's default behavior is dumb : <
[02:20:45] <Sho> Peach: and avoid the extra merge commit
[02:20:57] <Peach> So https://bpaste.net/show/799204a43eb2
[02:21:27] <Havvy> Can be fast-forwarded means that `git pull` won't create a merge commit.
[02:21:31] <c74d> Peach: `git pull` may make an unnecessary and useless merge commit. it may make an unnecessary but informative merge commit. it may make a necessary merge commit. it may make no merge commit at all (if it 'fast-forwards')!
[02:21:51] <Peach> pull --rebase updates my local copy right? and then when I make my new commit it'll be the only commit message that shows up
[02:21:59] <Sho> Havvy: which is never the case when he's made a local commit already
[02:22:34] <Havvy> Sho:  Right. Just saying that for this specific case, `--rebase` won't do anything because there's nothing to rebase.
[02:22:42] <Mutabah> Peach: It replays the local changes you've made atop the current remote state (is that right?)
[02:22:46] <Sho> Havvy: his specific case was [04:13] <Peach> Ok so commit(save my changes in git's history), then pull(update with origin), then push to origin (push my local commit to the origin)
[02:22:48] <c74d> Personally, I embrace non-linear history in Git, but I'm not faulting people who don't.
[02:23:01] <Mutabah> Yeah, I just use pull all the time
[02:23:02] <Peach> Sho: can you help tell me what commands to type for: https://bpaste.net/show/799204a43eb2
[02:23:04] <Sho> i respect the "don't fear merges!" stance c74d has
[02:23:10] <Sho> there is merit to it
[02:23:13] <Mutabah> But I often do dev on multiple machines, which sometimes collides
[02:23:19] <Sho> but i'll admit pragmatically i prefer to keep things simple
[02:23:52] <Peach> I like the idea of "all commit messages are meaningful"
[02:23:55] <Sho> Peach: git add your file, git commit, pull --rebase
[02:24:09] <Sho> Peach: or you can unstage it and stash it and pull and then stash pop
[02:24:17] <c74d> I also don't do development on the master branch in "real" repositories, but I'm not expecting you to go there at this point.
[02:24:50] <Sho> i'll add that getting comfortable with rebase is useful regardless of this, because it can e.g. be used to edit/squash/reorder/split up commits before a push
[02:24:53] <c74d> Peach: they are meaningful! just unwanted, in your case.
[02:24:56] <Sho> which i personally like to do now and then
[02:25:15] <Peach> So it's better to -  pull first, then stage, then commit, then push to origin ?
[02:25:45] <Peach> should I unstage my changes before commiting?
[02:25:45] <Sho> you can't pull with unstaged changes to affected files
[02:25:54] <Peach> Oh
[02:25:57] <Sho> if there's nothing staged you can't commit
[02:26:00] <Sho> you're confused somewhere
[02:26:04] <c74d> Peach: that would have the same effect as rebase-pull
[02:26:09] <Peach> git is confusing
[02:26:11] <aatch> I think it depends on the project as well. Something like Rust works a lot better with rebasing, but an in-house project with a relatively small team probably can use better merge-based workflows.
[02:26:21] <Sho> git is dirt simple, the ui is just horrible
[02:26:25] <Sho> really the way to learn git
[02:26:28] <c74d> Peach: (and you'd need to stash before the pull and unstash afterward)
[02:26:31] <Sho> is just to learn the underlying data structures
[02:26:37] <Sho> because it's a very very simple filing system
[02:26:45] <Sho> and all of the ui is just ways to manipulate it
[02:26:58] <Peach> git ui is confusing
[02:26:58] <Sho> the motivation behind them and their utilitiy is a lot clearer when you know how the data is stored
[02:27:24] <Peach> (Is mercurial easier :P )
[02:27:51] <Sho> yes and no
[02:27:56] <Sho> mercurial has a more noob-friendly ui
[02:28:08] <Sho> but as a filing system it's complex and quirkly
[02:28:13] <Peach> aww
[02:28:18] <Sho> i think the underlying simplicity of git is a win in the end
[02:28:24] <aatch> Knowing the underlying stuff also helps you understand some of the weird quirks like the fact that you can't commit an empty folder.
[02:28:35] <c74d> Peach: maybe... but on my Mac OS 10.6 system, every Mercurial command that used the network hung seemingly forever
[02:28:47] <Sho> aatch: right
[02:29:02] <Peach> So wait, I can't pull if I have unstaged files in my working tree?
[02:29:03] <Sho> Peach: go read this: http://tom.preston-werner.com/2009/05/19/the-git-parable.html

[02:29:54] <c74d> Peach: you can't pull if you have *uncommitted changes*, regardless of whether they're staged (marked for commit).
[02:30:02] <aatch> I found that it was way, way easier to use git once I learn the basics of the implementation. Like knowing that branches are just references to a specific commit, and that ref just gets updated.
[02:32:13] <Peach> Oh cool this GUI says "Rebase instead of merge"
[02:32:17] <Peach> that's prob what I want
[02:34:12] <Peach> c74d: I can pull if I have untracked files though right?
[02:34:21] <Sho> yes
[02:34:26] <Peach> Can I *rebase* if I have uncommited changes?
[02:34:36] <Sho> no
[02:36:04] <Peach> So if I wanna rebase with uncommited changes, do I "stage files in index", then "stash", then "rebase", then "unstash" then "commit", then "push to origin" ?
[02:37:28] <Sho> you stash
[02:37:38] <Sho> then you rebase
[02:37:45] <Sho> pull --rebase that is
[02:37:50] <Sho> then you stash pop, commit, and push

[03:36:57] <Peach> '
[03:37:06] <Peach> and can I possible access it?
[03:38:43] <c74d> you can access by using C floating-point numbers on a platform that doesn't implement them in hardware (a 'soft-float platform')
[03:39:06] <Havvy> Peach:  Compile to MIPS and looks at the generated assembly.

[03:54:39] <Peach> alright fair enough
[03:55:04] <Peach> So for me, I'm all about smart compilers of the future that do extensive static analysis
[03:55:57] <Peach> I'd love for a compiler to be deeply integrated with an IDE and highlight a line and say: "Your code is suboptimal, would you like to try this version: <shows code>"
[03:56:25] <Peach> "Data heuristics show a 90% increase in speed with this optimized version"
[03:56:30] <mbrubeck> Peach: The normal practice for compilers is just to optimize the generated code.
[03:56:49] <mbrubeck> Why bother the programmer when you can just silently output the optimal version?
[03:56:59] <Peach> "conditional branching reduced, code simplified from 20 ASM instructs to 5"
[03:57:30] <Peach> No mbrubeck I mean code that the compiler shouldn't silently replace
[03:57:48] <aatch> Sounds like the most passive aggressive compiler ever lol. "I could make this code faster, but I'm not going to"

[04:21:39] <Peach> it's all about performance
[04:21:59] <Peach> and no undefined behavior or runtime crashes
[04:23:12] <Peach> Applications in this domain are heavy number crunches and do a lot of allocations ***and** the programmer doesn't require obscure data structures
[04:23:34] <Peach> so for a specific use case, I think you can make a decent high level analyzer
[04:24:34] <Peach> Please show me links and papers so I can learn, don't just assume the goal is impossible for my use domain :P
[04:24:40] <aatch> Peach, so you don't want a programming language, you want a theorem prover usable by normal human beings.
[04:25:39] <Peach> heh, kinda sorta :P
[04:25:59] <aatch> Peach, basically you can't have a language that is provably 100% free of runtime errors *and* capable of implementing any computer program.
[04:26:20] <aatch> Peach, doing so requires solving the Halting Problem, which is literally impossible.
[04:27:05] <Peach> I don't need to necessarily implement "any computer program", and no I don't need to trace an entire program's possible callstack to verify things don't crash at runtime
[04:27:37] <aatch> Peach, you can restrict the language such that it isn't capable of expressing all possible programs, at which point you *can* prove it never crashes.
[04:28:33] <aatch> Peach, which is what most theorem provers do.
[04:29:00] <Peach> Yes aatch , you're a bit far into pure theory though, don't you want to ask what my use case is that I may not require all possible programs to be fully statically checked?
[04:29:27] <Peach> or rather, just what my use case is

[04:31:02] <aatch> Peach, doesn't really matter. Either your use case is expressible with a restricted language and we can continue the discussion, or it isn't and you're asking the impossible.

[04:37:30] <aatch> c74d, yeah, I've played around Agda (I think it was Agda anyway) and found it pretty cool.
[04:37:31] <Peach> I think "doesn't crash at runtime" is a reasonable goal for a high level language
[04:37:56] <c74d> Peach: to my perception, Turing-completeness in a programming language is worth only bragging rights, particularly given that Turing-complete computers are impossible to physically construct.
[04:39:16] <Havvy> c74d:  Do you mean the infinite memory part?
[04:39:24] <c74d> yes
[04:39:58] <Havvy> Most of us assume a more practical version of Turing complete with limited memory.

[04:44:15] <Peach> aatch: proving it doesn't crash is pretty easy - you have a high level static analyzer that tracks all variables for purity and requires the programmer put explicit checks to satisfy that nothing gets used which is null or would make an out of range operation

[05:00:33] <aatch> Peach, I'm saying that just saying "I use the same/similar backing as Whiley" isn't enough, since you're claiming a much stronger property than Whiley is.
[05:01:58] <aatch> Whiley also is designed to prevent programming errors that can lead to incorrect behaviour, not prevent the program from terminating unexpectedly.
[05:03:10] <Peach> aatch: is there a point you want to say, are you trying to tell me or ask me something?
[05:03:17] <Peach> You seem to be making statements
[05:03:23] <Peach> about a language you've never seen
[05:03:33] <aatch> Peach, I'
[05:05:07] <aatch> Peach, I'm trying to get a direct answer out of you. How have you proven that a given program will not terminate unexpectedly. Pointing at a language that emphatically *doesn't* have that feature isn't an answer.
[05:05:34] <aatch> (That middle sentence is a question)
[05:06:49] <Havvy> Whoo, I confused a channel because I was talking about Rust-lang and they only know of Rust-game.
[05:09:19] *** Quits: johnsoft (johnsoft@moz-69mrig.res.rr.com) (Quit: Leaving)
[05:10:43] <Peach> aatch: how direct of answer do you want - I already answered that The language enforces range limits and null checking and is aware of the AST of the language so you can't write code within the language itself that crashes
[05:11:02] <Peach> and I don't use runtime checks that fail
[05:11:21] <Peach> please be more specific aatch, I don't get how you want me to answer
[05:11:58] *** Joins: pcwalton (pcwalton@moz-6kjabm.ca.comcast.net)
[05:11:59] <Peach> and I can't say much more than it passes all the unit tests and actual code I've written in it
[05:12:28] <aatch> Peach, you're using a garbage collector, right?
[05:12:32] <Peach> no
[05:12:48] <aatch> Peach, reference counting?
[05:12:56] <Peach> yeah with cycle detection
[05:13:18] <Peach> and the user can't create structures that would cause a leak
[05:13:39] <Peach> or a ref "cycle"
[05:17:43] <aatch> Peach, ok, then I accept that you (probably) can't crash. However, you have to consider that you've placed an upper limit on the performance characteristics of the language. This isn't a bad thing, but you've cited "performance" as a primary concern.
[05:18:06] <Peach> Yup
[05:18:09] <Peach> So basically,
[05:18:40] <Peach> the compiler only puts in checks when a variable's range cannot be evaluated at compile time
[05:18:59] <Peach> so it's not like every   x + op generates a clamp function call
[05:19:31] <Peach> only ones where x is an impure variable that has no definite range
[05:19:47] <Peach> so that would be something that comes from user input, a file being read etc.
[05:25:05] <aatch> Peach, sure, but you'll find that in a real program, those checks won't be eliminatable a lot of the time. also, by disallowing "crashing" (which I assuming includes unwinding), you have imposed a fairly high burden on the programmer to figure out how to handle errors.
[05:25:48] <Peach> Where do your comments come from aatch ? What papers and research are you drawing your conclusions from?
[05:27:06] <Peach> Well, a better question would be have you worked on anything similar to this before? 
[05:27:07] <Mutabah> To be honest - I see a question like that as weak
[05:27:13] <Mutabah> Much better
[05:28:05] <aatch> Peach, mostly just experience. Though whole-program analysis may prove my first point incorrect, as I tend to think in function-at-a-time terms.
[05:28:29] <Peach> Oh, aatch it's *whole program* analysis
[05:29:03] <Peach> Like everything, nothing is "only local"
[05:29:31] <Peach> function call checks are generated based on instantiation 
[05:29:41] <Peach> and range and type constraints are all context sensitive
[05:30:34] <Peach> functions have a lot more meta data than just their function declaration too, there's a lot of meta data generated that the compiler uses to check proofs throughout the user's entire program
[05:31:44] <aatch> Peach, the second point is based on my experience with a variety of languages, from languages like Python and Ruby where they require no "proof" of correctness from me in the source, up to Agda, which requires that prove pretty much everything about the program.
[05:32:59] <aatch> Peach, with Rust, ML and Java floating around the middle.
[05:34:02] <aatch> Peach, and it's pretty common to see newer Rust programmers struggle with the increased upfront cost of getting something working because of all the work needed to satisfy the compiler.
[05:34:29] <aatch> Peach, you may only require those assertions on an as-needed basis, but you still require them.
[05:35:43] <Peach> Yeah, the language is unobtrusive with assertion, a programmer is only aware of them when there's a problem
[05:36:09] <Peach> the language is designed to have basically no upfront cost to get something working for newcomers
[05:36:37] <Peach> It's funny, I don't know if I should say anything cause I'm afraid to be met with skeptism
[05:36:39] <aatch> Peach, but if you can't abort in some way, then you've shifted the cost to later-stage programming as failure needs to be encoded in the return value.
[05:37:42] <Peach> encoded in the return value? not with the way I do it
[05:37:57] <Peach> functions can have a separate fail clause
[05:38:24] <Peach> that, from an end user perspective, just means you have to if () a function for failure when used
[05:38:44] <Peach> but really that's an api and style guidline to make such things unobtrusive
[05:39:10] <aatch> Peach, so you've re-invented checked exceptions?
[05:39:43] <Peach> uh..... is that an insult? :P
[05:40:09] <aatch> Peach, no, just a statement, what you just described is pretty much checked exceptions from Java.
[05:40:10] <Peach> No the language doesn't use try / throw
[05:40:15] <Layl> isn't that the same as Result<> returning stuff?
[05:40:21] <Layl> didn't read the full conversation
[05:40:53] <Peach> the language doesn't have exceptions
[05:40:54] <aatch> Peach, I mean, it's not identical, but thats the first thing that came to mind when I saw that.
[05:40:58] <Peach> oh
[05:41:35] <aatch> "this might fail, you have to account for it" combined with "it's not part of the return type".
[05:42:10] <Peach> it works well for something like a find function
[05:42:26] <Peach> if (find(x)) { } else {}
[05:42:42] <Peach> instead of the typical  -1 index style
[05:42:58] <aatch> Peach, well how do I get the result out there?
[05:43:04] <Peach> let
[05:43:25] <aatch> Peach, where?
[05:43:47] <Peach> if (let index = find(x)) { } else {}
[05:44:23] <Peach> the example was just pseudocode XD
[05:44:27] <aatch> Peach, and can you bump the failure up the callstack automatically?
[05:44:33] <Peach> I was also thinking of
[05:44:50] <Peach> if (find(x)) { int index = result; } else {}
[05:45:16] <Peach> and result would be the value of find
[05:45:30] <Peach> result would work like an implicit this
[05:45:42] <Peach> but just for the return value of that if branch
[05:46:25] <Peach> but result is prob too common of an identifier
[05:47:18] <aatch> Peach, honestly, the first way is much better. Magic variables are weird.
[05:48:18] <Peach> yeah
[05:48:32] <Peach> if (let index = find(x))    
[05:49:21] <aatch> Peach, but anyway, if you *can* bump failure up the callstack automatically, you have something that is, in practice, very similar to checked exceptions. The main difference being that you don't have regular exceptions.
[05:49:44] <Peach> You can't bump failure up the callstack - if you mean unwind the stack
[05:50:01] <Peach> failure is direct and obvious at every call
[05:50:12] <aatch> Peach, I mean more "If this fails, I don't care, let my caller deal with it as if I failed".
[05:50:46] <Peach> Yeah, I'm not doing that because it propagates too many errors cause a lot of programmers never handle the errors otherwise
[05:51:21] <Peach> I kinda wish I could do a "deep return" for errors
[05:51:30] <Peach> but I think it's too much complexity for the language
[05:51:49] <aatch> Fair enough, still, from the sounds of it, whether or not you need to handle failure isn't going to be obvious from the definition of the function.
[05:52:03] <Peach> I dislike how C++11 and later have nothrow all over the palce for the langauge
[05:52:08] <Peach> not obvious?
[05:52:13] <Peach> functions have a fails if clause
[05:52:23] <Peach> how is that not obvious :P
[05:53:05] <aatch> Peach, is that part of the function signature? What I mean is that I shouldn't have to read the body of the function to know how to use it.
[05:53:41] <Peach> function find(x) fails if (condition)  { function body }
[05:54:09] <Layl> Peach, that's really because they tried to find a way to have a static gurentuee that a function will not throw without breaking backwards compatibility
[05:54:19] <Layl> backwards compatibility - ruining languages since 1995
[05:54:40] <Peach> Yeah Layl - I want to make a language that doesn't have syntax litter like C++ has :P
[05:55:13] <c74d> Peach: it's not obvious because you haven't shown us what your programming language looks like. you say you already have it implemented, with a test suite even? if we looked at it, then we'd see the 'fails if' clauses.
[05:55:34] <Peach> aatch: it's not part of the "signature" but it's defined with the function and its parameters
[05:55:50] <aatch> Peach, I'd say that counts as the signature, for my purposes anyway.
[05:56:54] <Peach> Oh alright, it's not the signature in the truest technical sense but yeah, it'd be the part you'd see when browsing documentation
[05:56:57] <aatch> Peach, I'm mostly trying to get you to understand that every forced requirement on the programmer lowers it usability. Again, this isn't a criticism, Rust requires tons of annotation!
[05:57:39] <Peach> aatch: Typically that's true, but if you're careful it isn't so
[05:58:04] <Peach> the language really stays out the programmers way and doesn't have even half as much annotation as rust
[05:58:41] <Peach> you can tell me more specific cases of lowering usability aatch 
[05:59:04] <Peach> so I can see if my language does or doesn't have the cases you're thinking of
[05:59:20] <Peach> I want it to be as usable as possible with minimal annotation
[06:01:04] <aatch> Peach, it's not really a specific case. It's more just what I imagine working with it to be like. If I make a change somewhere, some other part of the program might break because now the compiler can't infer some range.
[06:04:09] <aatch> Peach, maybe this doesn't matter for your expected use-case, but you need to be aware of that kind of stuff. I'm much, much less skeptical of your language now that I've gotten details about it. When you started talkng about it, it went against everything I knew about programming languages.
[06:04:30] <Peach> Oh of course that's understandable

[06:08:40] <aatch> Peach, I'm not accusing you of deliberately being misleading, but hopefully now you see why I may have been a little suspicious.
[06:10:12] <Peach> nearly all the computer science people I've meet are often quite suspicious of nearly everything :P 
[06:11:11] <benh> computer science people get lied to by abstractions all the time, no wonder they're paranoid
[06:11:22] <Havvy> Are you two *still* talking?
[06:13:10] <aatch> Peach, force of habit, plenty of people claim to have acheived the best of both worlds and then neglect to mention some important condition.
[06:15:08] <aatch> Peach, good example is an operation common in compilers, there's an algorithm for it that has really good asymtotic complexity compared to the other common solution. However the "better" algorithm needs an impractically large dataset before the asymtotic advantage takes effect.
[06:16:37] <Havvy> aatch:  Which operation is that?
[06:16:47] <aatch> Havvy, dom-tree construction.
[06:17:16] <Havvy> DOMs in compilers?
[06:17:24] <Havvy> Or do you mean ASTs?
[06:17:41] <aatch> Havvy, dominator tree. It's a control-flow thing.
[06:17:54] <Havvy> Oh. I've never heard of that.
[06:18:10] <Layl> damn it seriously
[06:18:26] <Havvy> This is the point I'd normally go look at Wikipedia, but I don't think I can trust it for something like that.
[06:18:26] <Layl> why can't computer screens just get rid of all the bullshit settings that no one wants
[06:18:27] <aatch> Havvy, basically node A dominates node B if control always flows through A to reach B
[06:18:44] <Havvy> aatch:  Ah.
[06:18:54] <Layl> I accidentally reset my screen settings and now everything is blurry and I don't know why
[06:19:20] <Layl> what the hell is "Black Equalizer"
[06:19:25] <Layl> and why does it make text awful
[06:20:01] <aatch> Havvy, I think the simple algorithm is like O(n^2), but the not-quadratic one needs like 100 basic blocks before it starts pulling ahead.
[06:20:46] *** Quits: Diggsey (diggsey@moz-6o0tnh.dsl.pipex.com) (Quit: Nettalk6 - www.ntalk.de)
[06:20:51] <Havvy> aatch:  So would the optimal algorithm predicate which actual algorithm to use on the number of basic blocks?
[06:20:55] <aatch> Havvy, even a large function isn't likely to have more than 20-30 basic blocks, so it not that useful for use in a regular compiler.
[06:21:41] <aatch> Havvy, nope, the other one is super complex to implement compared to the simple one.
[06:22:07] <Manishearth> Havvy: c74d Yeah, I have sort of been working on an XSS thing
[06:22:11] <Manishearth> no code yet
[06:22:25] <Manishearth> basically, use html5ever for a templating engine
[06:22:33] <Manishearth> replace all {{}}s with types strings
[06:22:37] <Manishearth> *typed
[06:22:52] <Manishearth> not String, but Url, HTMLSafe, etc
[06:23:05] <Manishearth> where each type can only be substituted in the right positions
[06:23:28] <Manishearth> (Url in href, HTMLString in html positions, etc)
[06:23:51] <c74d> Manishearth: I didn't know about that; I was referring to rust-clippy, which at the time I thought was like what Peach was talking about.
[06:25:50] <aatch> Havvy, just looked it up, the direct solution is O(n^2), and the other algorithm is Lengaue and Tarjan which is almost-linear, but needs several hundred nodes to actually be efficient.
[06:27:01] <Peach> Apple is terrible at language specs
[06:27:07] <Peach> Swift won't sit still
[06:27:16] <Manishearth> c74d: oh, clippy can catch things like bad use of linkedlist
[06:27:27] <Manishearth> clippys solution is to warn on any use of linkedlists actually
[06:27:34] <Peach> There continue to be a bunch of backward incompatible breaking changes made with nearly every Swift update
[06:27:43] <Peach> Swift 1.0 means nothing
[06:27:59] <Peach> there's no consistency of the standard lib
[06:28:08] <Peach> everything feels so broken and shaky
[06:28:13] <Manishearth> Peach: to be fair, there still are some breaking changes post 1.0, but most are obscure things

[13:29:05] <niconii> so no cops coming after me for pirating 20-30 year old software for hardware no one uses anymore...
[13:29:48] <Tiffany> how is it legitimate emulation?
[13:30:22] <niconii> amiga forever has the copyright to the amiga software they're selling, basically
[13:30:46] <niconii> so it's not pirated, i have the license for all this stuff

[19:59:24] <Peach> What's the point of C having struct in a struct
[19:59:30] <Peach> why no just disallow that
[20:01:51] <niconii> as in, declaring a kind of struct in a struct?
[20:06:33] <mbrubeck> Peach: (1) a struct contains a list of fields, and the programmer chooses the type of each field.  Why limit the type?  Isn't it surprising if some types can be used for struct fields and some can't?
[20:07:23] <mbrubeck> Peach: (2) Composition is one of the main methods of code re-use.  If several structs have the a common sub-structure, the programmer should be able to define that sub-structure once and use it in multiple places.
[20:07:33] <eddyb> mbrubeck: I think Peach means unnamed structs
[20:08:04] <eddyb> mostly used with unions
[20:08:19] <niconii> yeah, i'm thinking Peach was more talking about something like: struct A { struct B { ... } data; }
[20:08:21] <eddyb> (they can both be unnamed/anonymous, right? I forget)
[20:08:28] <eddyb> niconii: A and B are optional :P
[20:08:28] <niconii> where you can just declare a new kind of struct inside another one
[20:08:32] <niconii> eddyb: right
[20:08:40] <mbrubeck> ah, right
[20:08:45] <eddyb> I was going to say... this was fun https://gist.github.com/eddyb/7e5c3ca6d667dad63c15
[20:08:48] <eddyb> haven't written C in ages
[20:09:03] <eddyb> this is a median filter on greyscale PGM images
[20:09:27] <eddyb> someone's homework for last year
[20:09:49] <eddyb> the quick-sort took the longest
[20:09:55] <eddyb> that and debugging
[20:10:08] <niconii> i can't code in C anymore
[20:10:13] <niconii> it just feels too fragile
[20:10:19] <eddyb> I forgot to add -Wall to my compilation line
[20:10:26] <niconii> like it'll just crumble to pieces in my hands
[20:10:28] <eddyb> so what would be an error in Rust was entirely silent
[20:10:30] <eddyb> unsigned window_pixels = window_pixels * window_pixels;
[20:10:45] <eddyb> thing is, for small values it would work
[20:11:01] <eddyb> for larger values, it would overwrite heap metadata
[20:11:45] <eddyb> I love Rust's let scoping (ML-family, right?)
[20:12:17] <eddyb> (small values of window_size, which was mistakenly unused in the computation of window_pixels)
[20:13:03] <eddyb> and what it does is https://i.imgur.com/KbWFqxH.png
[20:14:23] <niconii> wait, so why is that line broken exactly? it's been too long
[20:14:35] <Peach> niconii is right
[20:15:14] <Peach> Right now I'm refactoring code because it used so many structs in structs,
[20:15:27] <niconii> eddyb: i take it it doesn't just create a new window_pixels variable like rust would, but what exactly *does* it do
[20:15:43] <Peach> that there's a tangled web that makes me question why people don't just have code as one nice separate set of structures
[20:15:52] <eddyb> niconii: T x = f(x); in C is T x; x = f(x);
[20:16:12] <niconii> ah.
[20:16:40] <niconii> so it just creates an uninitialized variable, and then multiplies it with itself?
[20:17:53] <niconii> or... something
[20:18:48] <eddyb> niconii: yes
[20:19:06] <eddyb> the result does not have to be the square of anything
[20:19:31] <eddyb> it's mem::uninitialized::<u32>() * mem::uninitialized::<u32>()
[20:21:14] <niconii> lovely
[20:21:31] <niconii> and not only is that *not* an error, it's not even a warning that's enabled by default

[20:36:20] <huon> types are just normal identifiers
[20:36:30] <Peach> that KILLS all ability to search code easily

[20:36:44] <huon> you're exaggerating
[20:36:54] <huon> barely anyone actually writes code like that
[20:37:03] <Peach> it shouldn't be allowed in the first place
[20:37:08] <huon> why not?
[20:37:26] <Peach> are you serious? It makes code unintuitive 
[20:37:28] <huon> can't impose that restriction for arbitrary user defined types
[20:37:50] *** Joins: genbattle (genbattle@moz-4v0.gkd.16.182.IP)
[20:37:53] <huon> yes,it makes code unintuitive if the code is written like that, but it's always possible to write unintuitive code
[20:38:15] <huon> whether or not some type names are illegal as variables
[20:39:22] <Peach> it's kind of like the same reason that letting arbitrary code be identifiers
[20:39:29] <Peach> like    let } = 5;
[20:39:33] <Peach> would be even more evil
[20:39:59] <huon> that would be crazy unworkable, at a parsing level
[20:40:18] <mbrubeck> not even Haskell will let you define a `}` operator :)
[20:40:19] <Peach> It's not just a matter of parsing, I'm talking about the end user understanding code
[20:40:45] <Peach> You could technically make a langauge that supports things like that,
[20:40:51] <huon> I'm saying that a proposal like letting } be a variable doesn't work fnudamentally
[20:40:54] <Peach> but to me it's just as evil as allowing int int
[20:41:02] <huon> i.e. one can't really write a compiler that works like that
[20:41:25] <eddyb> fkaa: not a simple a.iter().zip(b.iter())?
[20:41:39] <Peach> does rust have first class type inspection?
[20:41:47] <huon> there's no reason like that for simple type identifiers
[20:41:48] <fkaa> uh, not sure eddyb 
[20:41:52] <eddyb> Peach: there's a good reason
[20:41:56] <fkaa> i'm not experienced in that stuff
[20:41:57] <eddyb> Peach: struct Foo;
[20:41:59] <kimundi> Peach: There are a lot of things in any language that can be combined in evil ways. The question is, is it worth the effort to build prevention against all of them?
[20:42:03] <fkaa> zipping and dipping
[20:42:08] <eddyb> Peach: Foo is both a type and a value
[20:42:27] <eddyb> Peach: you'd need to use Foo {} if you wanted Foo to be only a type
[20:42:35] <eddyb> or something like that
[20:42:47] <Peach> kimundi: my statement is for human readability's sake: "don't allow everything just because the compiler can parse it"
[20:42:52] <eddyb> also struct Foo(A, B, C); Foo is a function

[20:43:44] <eddyb> I guess those cases are manageable, but still
[20:43:59] <huon> Peach: what happens when a library defines a type `struct foo ...` and uses it a lot... should `foo` then become an illegal variable name in that library and anything that uses it?
[20:44:14] <Peach> huon: only within the scope
[20:44:23] <huon> maybe it even uses that type more than some of the primitives
[20:44:45] <huon> in any case, this only helps textual code analysis, which is not all robust
[20:44:52] <Peach> I think identifer names shouldn't conflict within the same scope
[20:44:53] <mbrubeck> Some languages are stricter than Rust about "types have Capitalized names; variables have lowercase names"
[20:44:54] <huon> and shouldn't pretend to be
[20:45:11] <mbrubeck> which avoids conflicts and adds some extra at-a-glance information when reading code

[20:47:35] <fkaa> Peach: i think the shadowing stuff in rust works pretty fine

[20:48:08] <kimundi> Peach: I agree with you in principle btw, and am finding the fact that this ^ compiles even worse. But its also true that Rust explicitly has two sperate namespaces AND allows arbitrary shadowing with let statements and blocks
[20:48:32] <Peach> int x = 0; float x = 0.0; would be bad
[20:48:49] <Peach> and the example kimundi listed
[20:48:51] <kimundi> Peach: Ah, but let int: int = 0; is netiehr the samer scope nor the same namespace

[20:51:15] <kimundi> because you can shadow anything with a "let"

[21:56:14] <dfockler> isn't swift still in beta or something?
[21:56:59] <dfockler> lol nope swift 2 is already out
[21:57:00] <Astraea> no
[21:57:04] <Astraea> yeah
[21:57:34] <dfockler> apple probably doesn't make that much money off of apps
[21:57:48] <Astraea> directly or indirectly?
[21:57:55] <Astraea> apps pull in customers
[21:57:56] <dfockler> both
[21:58:02] <Astraea> who buy their hardware which is where they make money
[21:58:12] <snow> I thought they got 30% of all app purchases?
[21:59:10] <dfockler> most of the apps that have a lot of downloads are free
[21:59:26] <Astraea> I'm sure they make quite a bit of money directly
[21:59:36] <Astraea> but again, I'm sure they make a metric ton indirectly
[22:00:55] <Astraea> actually, I'm more than sure, their bank account is overflowing
[22:01:03] <dfockler> it definitely is
[22:01:22] <dfockler> they had so much money they had to store some of it off-shore :P

[22:10:09] <Peach> Anyone know OpenGL? is binding an element buffer in the context of the entire program or just the VBO?
[22:10:55] <Peach> glBindBuffer(GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER
[22:12:06] <wrl> Peach: ask in #rust-gamedev
[22:41:43] <Peach> anyone ever had a legit math nightmare?
[22:42:17] <Peach> I had a dream that my first college math class was taught by my high school math teacher
[22:42:34] <Astraea> I've... dreamt of math before
[22:42:37] <Astraea> never a nightmare though
[22:43:03] <Peach> Astraea: probably because you're good at math
[22:43:12] <Peach> so you have no math fear
[22:43:41] <Astraea> nothing to fear from math tbh
[22:43:58] <dfockler> A mathmare
[22:44:34] <Astraea> also, I'm not good at math anymore, I graduated uni quite a while ago and don't get to use it often =(
[22:45:05] <fkaa> Peach: neither?
[22:45:20] <fkaa> not sure what you mean by `context` here

[22:57:30] <bstrie> Astraea: if you consider logic a branch of math, then plenty of people fear math via roko's basilisk :P
[22:58:44] <Astraea> I have not heard of that before
[22:58:55] <Astraea> I'll have to read up on it when I get home

[23:08:29] <fkaa> but yeah, anyone else want to hound eddyb for generators?
[23:08:33] <fkaa> :-)
[23:08:39] <eddyb> fak u
[23:08:58] <eddyb> for a second there I thought I was highlighted for something important
[23:09:56] <fkaa> could point me to in a direction to be of help too
[23:10:01] <fkaa> -to
[23:10:51] <fkaa> not sure what the process is for adding new stuff to the language
[23:13:58] <Peach> fkaa: glBindBuffer(GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, x); if the bind effects the global state or only a specific VBO
[23:14:16] <fkaa> global state
[23:14:27] <Peach> you sure?
[23:14:46] <Peach> how have you worked with OpenGL?
[23:14:55] <fkaa> the GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER binding only affects glBufferData stuff and glDraw*Elements
[23:15:22] <fkaa> well, it doesn't affect the BufferData actually
[23:15:32] <eddyb> fkaa: we need to wait on the MIR anyways
[23:15:55] <fkaa> Much Important Rust?
[23:15:59] <eddyb> the prospect of having the MIR merged in the following months is why I started sketching things

[23:55:34] <Peach> :'(
[23:55:39] <huon> it has iterators, but doesn't have sugar for creating them
[23:56:23] <Peach> I like langauges to be sugary
