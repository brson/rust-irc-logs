[00:00:02] <XMPPwocky> idk how Go deals with GC rooting
[00:00:04] <XMPPwocky> but other than that
[00:00:14] <lahwran> I was thinking something like, the go code calls rust main
[00:00:17] <lahwran> or ... no
[00:00:26] <lahwran> yes
[00:00:27] <lahwran> yes, that
[00:00:38] <lahwran> and then provide a rust api for launching goroutines
[00:01:04] <lahwran> make it look just like the rust threading api

[00:01:16] <niconii> and claim we now have goroutines, so we are superior to go?
[00:01:29] <GaryOak_> If I build an interpreter in Rust, would my language be memory-safe if I didn't use unsafe Rust code?
[00:01:41] <XMPPwocky> yes
[00:01:46] <XMPPwocky> modulo rustc bugs, as always
[00:01:52] <lahwran> GaryOak_: define "memory safe"
[00:01:56] *** Joins: swgillespie (swgillespie@moz-1i5.3un.220.167.IP)
[00:02:04] <GaryOak_> the same way Rust is memory-safe
[00:02:09] <lahwran> do you mean would the interpreter be memory safe?
[00:02:16] <lahwran> or would the interpreted program be memory-safe?
[00:02:19] <lahwran> the first one is easy: yes
[00:02:34] <lahwran> the second one is still pretty easy, but depends on whether your interpreted language allows raw memory access
[00:02:47] <XMPPwocky> how would you do that without unsafe rust code?
[00:02:52] <XMPPwocky> assuming you use "actual" memory
[00:02:59] <lahwran> if it allows raw memory access, and you don't use unsafe code, then it can't be on "actual" memory
[00:03:05] <lahwran> but could still be interpretedly memory unsafe
[00:03:09] <Manishearth> niconii++
[00:03:11] <lahwran> I mean, you can run memory-unsafe code on emscripten
[00:03:17] <XMPPwocky> right
[00:03:21] <XMPPwocky> that's what i was going at
[00:03:37] <XMPPwocky> I guess that really just means you can break type-safety in your interpreted language
[00:03:54] <fmtq> I don't like emscripten 
[00:03:58] <fmtq> it makes JS worse
[00:04:16] <GaryOak_> If you only allow memory access through rust, it would be safe?
[00:04:25] <lahwran> right. what I'm getting at is that implementing an interpreter in rust doesn't give you any guarantees about the in-interpreter memory safety, it just means you can be confident that it won't be memory-unsafe on *raw* memory
[00:04:27] *** Quits: ogham (rally@moz-91e3hp.cable.virginm.net) (Quit: My Mac has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[00:04:32] <XMPPwocky> right
[00:04:43] <lahwran> which doesn't mean that much if you're interpreting C :)
[00:04:44] <XMPPwocky> you can, like, run old openssl in emscripten
[00:04:49] <fmtq> like TempleOS
[00:04:50] <XMPPwocky> and be vulnerable to heartbleed
[00:05:11] <aji> this sounds insanely philosophical lol
[00:05:34] <lahwran> I'm not sure what you mean by that
[00:05:37] <fmtq> I shut one eye and lose all depth perception. Discuss.
[00:05:38] <aji> not sure how emscripten works but i'm pretty sure it's constrained to what browser js can do
[00:05:42] <GaryOak_> but in Ruby or Python you never access raw memory, right? It's always through a C interface
[00:05:56] <fmtq> Carreact
[00:05:59] <lahwran> GaryOak_: the language doesn't give you any way directly, no
[00:06:04] <lahwran> ctypes does
[00:06:10] <lahwran> but that's not really what you're asking
[00:06:11] <fmtq> ctypes is a c module
[00:06:15] <lahwran> ctypes would be unsafe code
[00:06:15] <fmtq> it is hacks
[00:06:25] <GaryOak_> Interesting
[00:06:40] <niconii> incidentally, when you talk about "actual" or raw memory, i assume you're contrasting that with, say, a giant array of bytes or something, right?
[00:06:44] <lahwran> in general, if you implement something in rust, then you get memory safety against "actual" memory
[00:06:46] <lahwran> niconii: yep
[00:07:01] <lahwran> GaryOak_: but *you do not get correctness*
[00:07:08] <GaryOak_> sure
[00:07:42] <GaryOak_> but rust doesn't guarantee correctness either
[00:07:53] <lahwran> ...
[00:07:57] <lahwran> that's what I just got done saying
[00:07:59] <lahwran> .-.

[03:31:05] <Havvy> Pong.
[03:31:12] <whipsch> https://github.com/whipsch/tennu-rust-help/tree/bang-rustdoc
[03:31:55] <whipsch> Havvy: the only real question i have is, where should that json file actually be stored?
[03:32:03] <whipsch> rather, it should be wherever the bot's config is i suppose
[03:32:14] <whipsch> but i'm not sure how to get that directory (in the plugin)
[03:32:18] <Havvy> The location should be a config value.
[03:32:21] <whipsch> granted, i havent checked your docs for it yet
[03:32:37] <Havvy> It's not guaranteed that there's a location for the config file.
[03:32:57] <whipsch> right, but the config allows for configuring plugins?
[03:33:09] <whipsch> (so the user could specify the path)
[03:33:44] <Havvy> Yes. `client.config("rust-help-%NAME%")`
[03:33:50] <Havvy> Where %NAME% is something that makes sense.
[03:34:00] <whipsch> ok, makes sense
[03:34:51] <Havvy> (And if it's undefined, don't save it?)
[03:35:10] <whipsch> well, currently, the index is meant to be processed ahead of time
[03:35:15] <whipsch> but that's not a requirement, just how i wrote it
[03:35:34] <whipsch> it just converts search-index.js to actual json
[03:35:51] <Havvy> Ah. The bash script actually keeps the plugin from running on Windows too.
[03:36:01] <whipsch> oh good point
[03:36:03] <whipsch> haha
[03:36:14] <whipsch> i'll redo it in js then
[03:36:48] <whipsch> would fetching + processing on plugin init make more sense in general then?
[03:37:10] <Havvy> It could.
[03:38:35] <Havvy> If you translate the bash into a JS module, I could probably do the integration work.
[03:39:21] <Havvy> Might as well call !rustdoc just !doc for now.
[03:39:26] <whipsch> okay
[03:39:34] <whipsch> oh yeah, that was another question of preference
[03:39:38] <Havvy> I have command aliasing on my todo list.
[03:39:43] <whipsch> i figured since the plugin is already rust-help it should just be !doc
[03:41:10] <whipsch> i'll go convert that awk hackery to a js module then
[03:41:46] <Havvy> Though you don't /have/ to do this, `levenshtein` should probably be it's own package on npm.
[03:41:52] <Havvy> If it's not already.
[03:42:15] <whipsch> sure, for that portion.  but the rest of it takes care of sorting/matching appropriately
[03:42:26] <whipsch> (i just took it from rustdoc/main.js)
[03:43:35] <Havvy> https://www.npmjs.com/package/levenshtein does actually exist.

[03:49:05] <Havvy> Ah, search.js is from another project. Okay.
[03:49:35] <Havvy> I'd remove the jslint comments from it though, and add a comment saying that `tennu-rust-help` is using it under the `MIT` license.
[03:49:58] <whipsch> yeah i wasnt sure what to do about the license, and oops @ jslint

[03:50:35] <whipsch> maybe the search code could be rewritten, but it'd be mostly the same anyway

[03:51:18] <Havvy> Eh, don't modify somebody else's code. That's just asking for a maintenance nightmare.

[03:56:03] <whipsch> the maintenance issue is a good point
[03:56:14] <Havvy> That binary name is really long. Could be called "update-rustdoc" instead. ;)

[03:57:57] <whipsch> i'm done with it for the night, though.  have some things to research before i start work
[03:58:15] <whipsch> as an aside though, i had a fun bug with the preprocessing script earlier
[03:58:32] <whipsch> i was trying to match each json blob with = ([^;]+);$

[03:59:10] <whipsch> so the regex didnt match, which made the entries for std and core get removed from the index
[03:59:15] <whipsch> i was very confused for a while :)

[04:40:51] <ChrisMorgan> XMPPwocky: now figure out which of those 64,000 weren’t talking about Rust 1.0 but rather a float literal.
[04:42:56] <XMPPwocky> my guess is under a thousand, actually
[04:43:18] <XMPPwocky> there's 217 "1.0f", 50-ish "1
[04:43:31] <XMPPwocky> 54 "1.0;",  and 77 "= 1.0"
[04:43:43] <XMPPwocky> and 138 : 1.0

[05:51:05] <niconii> seems like it might only happen if you're directly linked to a channel?
[05:51:19] <Havvy> Okay...that list was a lot longer than I thought it was.
[05:51:42] <Havvy> And yeah, only with direct links. There's a semi-modal dialogue with an option to change your nickname too.
[05:54:05] <Havvy> And now if you refresh that page, the list is somewhat more readable.
[05:55:00] <Havvy> Unfortunately, I don't know how to make columns with pure MediaWiki markup, or else I'd have done that.

[19:02:17] <eddyb> Astrum|Lap: as dumb as I feel sometimes, I have to agree

[19:02:33] <lahwran> not just my opinion
[19:02:39] <lahwran> that's a pretty common way of talking about it
[19:02:51] <eddyb> the oppposite of specialization?
[19:02:52] <lahwran> generality is a task of reductionism
[19:03:02] <lahwran> eddyb: not exactly
[19:03:07] <GaryOak_> like the theory of general relativity
[19:03:13] <GaryOak_> it covers more cases

[19:04:56] <Astrum|Lap> anyway
[19:04:58] <lahwran> generalizing to large classes of unseen data is a task of generating models that are as close as can be managed to an accurate description of the data
[19:05:11] <Astrum|Lap> it seems to be hard for us to see past our biases
[19:05:31] <GaryOak_> once a computer tells me it doesn't like pizza, then I'll know it's a real person
[19:05:39] <lahwran> one can generalize to gigantic amounts of new data by handwritten models, for some kinds of data, that has particularly reduceable shapes

[20:20:22] <Sho> Go with chicken

[20:47:02] <lahwran> no no no

[20:47:38] <lahwran> it's amazing that humans do it at all
[20:47:48] <fmtq> not really
[20:47:52] <fmtq> our brains are plastic
