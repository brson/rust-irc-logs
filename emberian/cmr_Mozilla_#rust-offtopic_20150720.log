[00:00:14] <mbrubeck> Peach: Then you get a compile error, just like if you had specified a type for v.
[00:00:31] <Peach> But what about readability for the programmer?
[00:00:43] <Peach> what happens when there's a lot of code between the v.push()
[00:00:55] <mbrubeck> You can always add the annotation as a form of documentation
[00:01:04] <blueridanus> ^ the way it's done in Haskell
[00:01:07] <scott> Peach: Then inference or not is irrelevant.
[00:01:27] <scott> Peach: Having a type on the declaration doesn't help you when the v.push is far away from it.
[00:01:57] <blueridanus> scott: I think he's worried if the v.push("hello") is far away from it
[00:02:14] <blueridanus> Which is basically what specifies the type
[00:02:19] <scott> Oh, the first one. I would consider a type annotation in that case.
[00:02:25] <mbrubeck> Anyway, don't just take our word for it... there are a ton of languages that use inference heavily (Scala, Haskell, OCaml...) that are worth learning for other reasons
[00:02:32] <scott> I wouldn't recommend writing Rust with no annotations ever.
[00:02:34] <mbrubeck> and it's quite easy to do some work in them, learn how inference works in practice
[00:02:37] <mbrubeck> and make up your own mind
[00:03:12] <mbrubeck> also `auto x = f();` in C++ has the same problem if the definition of `f` is far away...
[00:03:40] <blueridanus> What may help is an IDE that gives you the type of the variable when you hover.
[00:03:41] <mbrubeck> or `x = anything` in Python :)
[00:03:47] <Peach> mbrubeck: - the difference is - you can have an IDE that shows you the type
[00:04:10] <Peach> OH OH
[00:04:13] <Peach> what about
[00:04:14] <mbrubeck> Peach: The same is true in the languages I named
[00:04:19] <mbrubeck> You can have an IDE that shows you the type
[00:04:20] <Peach> watch:
[00:04:23] <mbrubeck> The type is statically known

[00:08:08] <Peach> scott: for my case, I want to make a language where the compiler can actually tell you how to fix your code easily, and how to reason about the semantics of code
[00:08:27] <Peach> conditional type inference seems so complex for beginner programmers
[00:08:34] <Peach> or even intermediate
[00:08:36] <scott> What is conditional type inference?
[00:09:12] <Peach> Well: "Type inference that depends on how a variable is later used"
[00:09:40] <Peach> cause it could be ambigous for the programmer, not talking about making a compiler that handles it
[00:10:19] <Peach> Really, I just need to see examples of good code scott , that specifically uses "specify later" type inference
[00:10:34] <mbrubeck> Learn Rust.  :)
[00:10:37] <Peach> I don't know if there's a name for a "specify later" practice of type inference
[00:10:42] <mbrubeck> (or Haskell, SML, OCaml, Scala...)
[00:10:57] <mbrubeck> It's usually just referred to as "type inference"
[00:11:11] <mbrubeck> though the C++11 flavor confuses things a bit these days
[00:11:21] <mbrubeck> Hindley-Milner-style type inference, maybe
[00:12:37] <blueridanus> "Hindley-Milner" sounds like I'm trying to learn something pretty complicated in physics or math.
[00:13:07] <scott> It's is math pretty much.
[00:13:22] <mbrubeck> We should turn it into a verb, like "currying", so it doesn't sound like it's named after anyone :)
[00:13:26] <Peach> Hindley Milner is like all logic though scott 
[00:13:32] <blueridanus> Well, that explains it. 
[00:13:38] <mbrubeck> "The compiler just hindles the type for you."
[00:13:39] <blueridanus> mbrubeck: We definitely should.
[00:13:40] <Peach> I don't use any +- /* power of :P
[00:13:42] <scott> Peach: That doesn't contradict what I said.
[00:14:05] <blueridanus> Things named after people make me frustrated.
[00:14:23] <Peach> You right but as a larger question - Math should be numeric, why is logic part of math?

[00:14:47] <mbrubeck> "Math should be numeric"... as a math major, I have some issues with this.  :P

[00:15:16] <blueridanus> ^ 
[00:15:16] <Peach> Logic is Math or is math a subset of logic?

[00:17:04] <scott> Logic is an essential tool for mathematicians (and computer scientists). I don't know if I'd say anything about one being a subset of the other.

[00:43:04] <Peach> <blueridanus> "Computer science is more math than computers, though"   < In practice CS should be about logic and preventing human error :P
[00:43:28] <Peach> programming languages are notorious for being excessively terse cryptic and user-Unfriendly
[00:43:45] <Layl> Astraea, this explains it well enough https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUvBcpDPYbw
[00:44:43] <Layl> slightly oversimplified of course
[00:44:47] <Peach> fopen, atof, so cryptic : (
[00:45:20] <Astraea> Layl: I... have no idea what is going on in that video
[00:45:21] <Astraea> lol
[00:45:37] <Layl> for real though I'm trying to find something that explains it a lot better but it's so hard
[00:45:55] <blueridanus> Peach: Computer science is more than programming languages
[00:46:06] <Layl> perhaps it's better explained in text
[00:46:07] <blueridanus> The whole field of computer science seems much more like mathematics to me.
[00:46:10] <Peach> fine fine "theory of computation"
[00:46:11] <Astraea> Peach: don't mix CS and software engineering/development
[00:46:19] <blueridanus> ^ this
[00:46:22] <blueridanus> Take Machine Learning
[00:46:29] <Peach> CS should be called Theory of Computation
[00:46:36] <blueridanus> Or Computation Science.
[00:46:40] <Peach> Yes
[00:46:42] <Astraea> and CS is definitely an offshoot of mathematics
[00:47:01] <fkaa_> how should integer masks be represented in rust?
[00:47:10] <Peach> but wait, why can't CS be mixed with software engineering/development?
[00:47:20] <fkaa_> mod SomeMode { const a = 0x0; ... }?
[00:47:26] <blueridanus> That's like mixing physics and engineering
[00:47:34] <Astraea> Peach: think of it like the difference between physics and structural engineering
[00:47:43] <Astraea> gah
[00:47:45] <Astraea> you beat me to it
[00:47:50] <blueridanus> :p
[00:48:49] <blueridanus> Mathematics has lots of abstract stuff which can't be used in anything yet
[00:49:09] <Layl> Astraea, if you're interested, it's a bit of a long clip but this actually (for real this time) explains what it is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMhM2ZXN4Lg
[00:49:10] <blueridanus> (emphasis in "yet")
[00:49:38] <Peach> In college, can you take only software engineering /development? :P
[00:49:57] <scott> My department has a separate Software Engineering degree.
[00:50:01] <Layl> Peach, I took a study "Application Development"
[00:50:12] <Layl> which was more "how to use ASP.NET" than anything else
[00:50:31] <scott> Universities generally are bad at teaching software development / programming, though.
[00:50:54] <Layl> keep in mind that the dutch education system is different though and this specific school is somewhere between high school and college
[00:51:02] <blueridanus> I think programming is better taught by yourself, honestly.
[00:51:22] <Layl> I disagree on that, for me it helped a lot to actually have a teacher
[00:51:57] <scott> Programming is better taught by yourself than from a CS prof who isn't good at programming. But if you have a good teacher, that's better.
[00:52:05] <Peach> Oh cool Layl is from de Nederlands 
[00:52:11] <blueridanus> Well, it helps to have a teacher, as long as the teacher does not try to take the role of a book
[00:52:11] <Layl> I had a really amazing teacher though
[00:52:15] <blueridanus> Which too many teachers do.
[00:52:21] <blueridanus> So I guess I agree with scott
[00:52:34] <Astraea> personally I prefer theory over application
[00:52:37] <Peach> "CS prof who isn't good at programming"
[00:52:38] <Astraea> I should go back to school
[00:52:41] <Layl> My teacher came from a background of game development and brought a lot of that into the study

[00:52:59] <Peach> Astraea: "prefer theory over application"      0_0
[00:53:02] <scott> Peach: Most academics aren't good programmers, from what I've seen.
[00:53:05] <Layl> past tense because I graduated a month ago
[00:53:14] <Astraea> but I doubt I could do well on the GRE math at this point...
[00:53:43] <Astraea> and scott is correct
[00:53:50] <Peach> Theory is useless without application, cause people just make stuff up that can't get used in practice
[00:53:53] <Astraea> because CS professors do theory, not programming =P
[00:54:06] <Peach> That's evil
[00:54:11] <Peach> Pure evil D:
[00:54:15] <Astraea> theory is the foundation for application
[00:54:16] <blueridanus> If you're only interested in theory, application can be a nice way to teach theory
[00:54:28] <Peach> but a theory needs to be testable
[00:54:33] <Peach> otherwise it isn't scientific
[00:54:39] <scott> Peach: A lot of advances have come from pure math research that previously had no clear applications.
[00:54:40] <blueridanus> Math is not scientific.
[00:54:42] <Astraea> keep in mind I'm much more of a mathematician than anything else
[00:54:50] <scott> Peach: We're talking math theory here, not science.
[00:54:58] <blueridanus> There's the scientific method
[00:55:01] <scott> You can prove a theorem. No need for testing if it's proven.
[00:55:10] <blueridanus> And there's math's way of "build over stuff that has been proven by *logic*"
[00:55:11] <Layl> studies software development here seem to be very based on projects
[00:55:15] <Layl> you have to actually develop something
[00:55:17] <Peach> But what happened to "math is science" : <
[00:55:17] <blueridanus> Or "built over axioms"
[00:55:24] <blueridanus> Math is not science!
[00:55:29] <scott> Who said math is science?
[00:55:40] <Layl> cue link to the "but I've proven it to work" daily wtf article
[00:55:45] <scott> Computer science is mostly not science either, by the way.
[00:55:54] <blueridanus> Computer science is an horrible name.
[00:55:58] <Astraea> what about political science?
[00:56:02] <blueridanus> I've argued that way too much times before.
[00:56:12] <scott> Political science even less so. :p
[00:56:16] <Astraea> heh
[00:56:35] <Astraea> anyway, I have trouble with application
[00:56:40] <blueridanus> Computer science: not about computers, and not science
[00:56:43] <Astraea> exploring math is much more interesting
[00:56:44] <blueridanus> Wow. :p
[00:56:46] <Peach> The education/math/science world is so backwards
[00:56:58] <Peach> ok, simple question
[00:57:04] <Peach> Goal of learning theory is:
[00:57:09] <Astraea> (for me personally I should say)
[00:57:10] <scott> blueridanus: Rename it to compumath. :p
[00:57:44] <Peach> "To use as practical application" ? Cause that's MY goal of learning theory is to use it as practical application
[00:57:44] <Astraea> Peach: to know
[00:57:58] <blueridanus> scott: The academics would prefer something a bit more formal :p
[00:58:00] <Peach> To know to and then do what with that knowledge Astraea 
[00:58:13] <Astraea> build upon it and know more
[00:58:17] <Astraea> the acquisition of knowledge
[00:58:21] <Peach> :(
[00:58:34] <blueridanus> Peach: You can learn theory for it's own sake.
[00:58:51] <blueridanus> That's done in math often because... it's beautiful
[00:58:52] <Peach> Of course, but it needs action and/or application though
[00:58:58] <blueridanus> No, it does not.
[00:59:02] <Astraea> nah
[00:59:06] <blueridanus> It may have, eventually, though.
[00:59:16] <Peach> What that isn't the *goal*
[00:59:18] <Peach> D:
[00:59:21] <blueridanus> Nope
[00:59:27] <Astraea> the goal is just to learn
[00:59:29] <blueridanus> The goal is to do maths for math's sake
[00:59:40] <blueridanus> The consequences are, sometimes, cool applications
[00:59:45] <Astraea> to discover the beauty hidden within the system
[00:59:51] <Peach> Then no wonder stuff is so inefficient in today's world.....
[00:59:55] <Peach> Of course,
[00:59:57] <Peach> it's pretty
[01:00:03] <Peach> but like.....
[01:00:09] <blueridanus> "hey guys, look at this, I discovered how to calculate the area under a curve!"
[01:00:10] <scott> It's not like everyone is doing it that way.
[01:00:14] <blueridanus> "hah, nice trick!"
[01:00:30] <Astraea> other people are interesting in application, I never have been
[01:00:32] <Peach> if the background goal isn't to produce or create or make human life / work easier then.........
[01:00:35] <scott> Plenty of people are researching stuff to apply it, or applying stuff other people figured out.
[01:00:37] <blueridanus> Obviously Calculus was born way too close to physics, but still.
[01:00:40] <scott> Some people just focus on the theory.
[01:00:43] <scott> There's a mix.
[01:01:05] <Peach> I'm always thinking "learn more to apply and work better"
[01:01:10] <scott> Peach: What if the goal is to produce and create good mathematics?
[01:01:25] <Astraea> someone needs to push the boundaries of mathematics
[01:01:43] <Astraea> Einstein's stuff depended heavily on differential geometry
[01:01:48] <Peach> Well scott , we'd want to know that the knowledge has a use and is true in application as theorized, otherwise it's just "made up"
[01:02:04] <scott> Peach: You seem to be mixing up science and math again.
[01:02:07] <Astraea> which was being formulated by experts in mathematics prior to his application
[01:02:24] <Astraea> and how do you know if something will have an application or not?
[01:03:01] <blueridanus> You don't.
[01:03:08] <Peach> You can
[01:03:09] <scott> Even in the sciences, theoretical results have been produced that weren't confirmed for decades or longer.
[01:03:11] <Peach> but not always
[01:03:25] <Astraea> it takes brilliant people to come up with the theory, and brilliant people to realize that the theories model something in real life
[01:03:53] <Astraea> as I mentioned before, Einstein's work on relativity
[01:04:04] <blueridanus> I once read an article about funding for purely theoretical research.
[01:04:16] <scott> If 100% of people were only focused on what we can create right here and right now, then no one is focused on advancing the theory.
[01:04:19] <blueridanus> The author explained the question of "what the heck is it useful for" with a very nice example.
[01:04:22] <scott> Like I said before, we have a mix.
[01:05:03] <blueridanus> He said the guy who discovered how to make radio waves said, "I don't think this will ever have an application but it's nice" or something like that.
[01:05:10] <Astraea> there's some lighting techniques in computer graphics that rely on spherical harmonics, Peach 
[01:05:31] <Astraea> no one developed spherical harmonics for those lighting techniques, rather someone figured out they could be used for that purpose
[01:05:38] <blueridanus> I'm trying to find the link so I don't comment stuff I'm ignorant about, though
[01:06:14] <Astraea> though sometimes it goes the other way
[01:06:15] <Peach> I know about that Astraea, it's cool
[01:06:29] <Peach> the spherical harmonics
[01:06:38] *** Joins: dpc (dpc@moz-t6gr4b.ca.comcast.net)
[01:06:50] <Astraea> also, spherical harmonics has applications in plenty of other areas
[01:06:54] <Astraea> so... theory is great
[01:08:13] <Astraea> an old professor of mine was using some crazy subfield of non-linear dynamics to model the spread of disease in livestock
[01:09:45] <blueridanus> And often, not only that
[01:10:08] <blueridanus> Some area of mathematics that has lots of applications can benefit from some other area that has almost no applications
[01:10:32] <Peach> scott: "If 100% of people were only focused on what we can create right here and right now, then no one is focused on advancing the theory."   Naw that's not always true, especially with computers cause there are cases you can't really think about outside programming and finding them'
[01:11:40] <scott> I said you can't have /no one/ focused on theory. I didn't say you should have /everyone/ focused on it.
[01:11:49] <scott> Both are good.
[01:13:55] <scott> Even within programming language design there's a spectrum from practical to theoretical/experimental and both ends are valuable.
[01:14:14] <Peach> Here's a philosophical question - can you effectively understand something mostly from theory?
[01:14:28] <Peach> cause I think theory is good, but I think there's too much focus on it
[01:14:39] <scott> I think that's way too abstract to answer.
[01:14:53] <Peach> And I say this because I read dozens of research publications (mostly about computer graphics)
[01:15:08] <Peach> and many of them are theoretical, without much practical code used
[01:15:24] <Peach> and they say lots of words, but mean almost nothing
[01:15:48] <blueridanus> "they say lots of words and mean almost nothing" is another problem, actually.
[01:16:21] <Peach> It's funny - Math and computer science languages tend to be very terse; yet academic papers have SO MUCH BLOAT
[01:16:25] <blueridanus> Some of it is needed terminology
[01:16:51] <blueridanus> The other part is language which is unecessarily obfuscated, so I in part agree with you.
[01:17:01] <Peach> yay
[01:17:02] <scott> One of the biggest problems I see is not enough collaboration between theorists and non-theorists (in both directions), not that there's too much focus on one or the other.
[01:17:12] <Peach> ^
[01:17:19] <Peach> I like that idea
[01:17:25] <scott> Theorists ignoring non-theorists and non-theorists ignoring theorists is really common.
[01:17:33] <blueridanus> Peach: I read Einstein's paper on relativity and it was surprisingly clear. Take a look

[01:18:17] <Peach> Einstein is *Einstein*, so maybe he was better at communicating than most people :P
[01:18:34] <blueridanus> Yes. That's why I said it's another problem
[01:18:46] <Peach> Also to answer: can you effectively understand something mostly from theory?    -   Take for example learning a new human language. Could I really teach you Dutch or German from me just teaching you about semantics, grammar, and vocab?
[01:19:05] <blueridanus> No, you can't, but only because of the nature of the human brain
[01:19:12] <Peach> This is my point
[01:19:17] <blueridanus> Not for some deep epistemological reason.
[01:19:22] <Peach> I think after a certain point, abstract becomes to abstract
[01:19:33] <Peach> and information retention gets lost
[01:19:42] <scott> Application is often necessary for learning theory, especially if you're not a great mathematician like me.
[01:19:44] <Peach> Which is why I think so many people are bad at math
[01:19:49] <blueridanus> Well... for learning, sure, which is why I said you probably need to see application to learn theory
[01:19:54] <scott> Some people are scary good at just grasping math without examples.
[01:20:32] <scott> And the nature of research is that there is no application of your new idea yet.
[01:20:37] <Astraea> I mean... I had examples... in math
[01:20:42] <Diggsey> Not just because of the human brain: languages are ambiguous in a way that requires lots of examples to learn from
[01:20:54] <Layl> I would probably have been much better at math if early on I was shown the practical applications
[01:20:58] <blueridanus> Oh, indeed. You are right.
[01:21:09] <Astraea> I never had any "And this is how a 2D H2 topological surface can be used to model <something it can model>"
[01:21:31] <Layl> this comes back to that amazing teacher I had, who helped me catch up on algebra for an application to followup education
[01:21:33] <Peach> For me, I need 80% practical application and then 20% theory to fill in the gaps for why something makes sense
[01:21:41] <Peach> I think theory should explain practical use
[01:21:49] <scott> I think those percentages vary from person to person.
[01:21:54] <Layl> and as examples, we used collision detection and orbital mechanics
[01:22:33] <blueridanus> Peach: do you like math and why?

[01:23:48] <Layl> it really feels to me like a great way to teach math would be through AI programming in an online AI battle game
[01:23:50] <Peach> blueridanus -  I like math because it allows me to do efficient computations for my programming projects; I would encounter problems, try to develop an inefficient solution, then a learned higher level theory and became able to calculate much more efficicently
[01:23:55] <Astraea> also, if you're judging math from your high school or basic college courses... stop
[01:24:00] <Astraea> math is fantastic later on
[01:24:00] <blueridanus> ^ please do
[01:24:10] <Peach> I could not understand the math I needed BEFORE I reached my problems
[01:24:31] <scott> Learning a bit of type theory let me understand a bunch of things in Rust, Haskell, and elsewhere in a much more interesting way.
[01:24:41] <Peach> I'm talking about matrix transformations, projection transforms
[01:24:48] <Peach> vector math
[01:24:52] <scott> I'm definitely much more interested in math/CS that I can play with inside a programming language.
[01:25:11] <Layl> I only learned what cross multiplication was when I needed to calculate normals on voxels
[01:25:38] <scott> But I appreciate that other people are pushing the boundaries of the theory all the time. I hope to see their results become something I can mess with eventually.
[01:25:45] <Astraea> to be fair, everyone always says I'm weird for being such a theorist
[01:25:50] <blueridanus> I feel teaching math would be 500% easier with programming
[01:26:02] <blueridanus> Teach high school kids a bit of Processing
[01:26:03] <blueridanus> Boom
[01:26:23] <scott> Figuring out group theory, type theory, and category theory stuff was only really possible to me because I could actually look at it inside a programming language.
[01:26:24] <Astraea> perhaps it's because I see this world as ephemeral and I'm selfishly learning for my own sake
[01:26:26] <Layl> Really I think a lot of stuff can be taught through an online AI programming game
[01:26:26] * Astraea shrugs
[01:26:29] <scott> Otherwise I would just lose interest mostly.
[01:27:09] <Peach> Theory should lose interest if it has no applicable use, for most people anyway
[01:27:23] <Peach> I don't get "pure theory" people
[01:27:34] <Astraea> and I don't get application at all
[01:27:39] <Astraea> seems boring
[01:28:17] <blueridanus> You haven't seen the "beauty" of math, for example.
[01:28:20] <scott> I get both. They're both interesting and depend on each other.
[01:28:28] <blueridanus> Which I can see is an enigmatic concept.
[01:28:39] <blueridanus> You find programming interesting, for example
[01:28:50] <blueridanus> And you appreciate math's applications in programming
[01:29:43] <Peach> Astraea: what do you learn specifically that has a boring application
[01:29:55] <Peach> Can you give actual names of stuff in your mind?
[01:30:15] <Astraea> I don't even know the application of tons of stuff I've learned
[01:30:49] <Peach> @_@
[01:31:02] <scott> I've encountered lots of strange things that may or may not ever have applications. But if we never think about them, we'll never know if they do.
[01:31:16] <scott> So you can't just throw out pure theory or you'll throw out all that potential.
[01:31:18] <Astraea> I mean, if you can give me an obvious application of homotopy theory I'll give you a cookie

[01:57:58] <scott> Well, in fact, no language has made memory management easy, safe, and zero overhead.
[01:58:26] <Astraea> memory management is very hard tbh
[01:58:35] <Peach> "zero overhead" meaning no slower than if you were to manually track and call malloc/free
[01:58:43] <Peach> and uses the stack
[01:58:47] <Peach> whereever possible

[01:59:30] <Peach> Memory management is really only hard when you want something to exist outside of scope in  a global manner
[01:59:41] <Peach> but otherwise it's quite simple
[01:59:51] <Peach> Show me the corner cases though please
[01:59:52] <scott> Everything is tradeoffs in programming language design. That's why no one has made "the perfect language" like you were describing above.
[02:00:08] <Peach> show me cases of "memory management being difficult"
[02:00:12] <scott> The details will show themselves as you start to create something more concrete.
[02:00:22] <blueridanus> Multithreading

[02:00:58] <Peach> multithreading yes
[02:01:04] <Peach> but outside of threading,
[02:01:12] <Peach> what cases is memory managing difficult?
[02:01:28] <Peach> suppose I have smart pointers and dynamic lists already
[02:01:40] <blueridanus> How do you deal with dangling pointers?
[02:01:46] <scott> Rust gives you more control so you can get better performance, for example. But it requires a lot of complexity to do that.

[02:01:59] <blueridanus> And a kinda steep learning curve.
[02:02:08] <scott> Some languages give you less control which makes it way easier to use, but you can't get better performance when you need it.
[02:02:21] <Peach> blueridanus: when a value uses a pointer, it gets tracked in the application and automatically set to null when the data source gets deleted
[02:02:36] <blueridanus> That's not zero overhead.
[02:02:45] <Astraea> scott: like GC in a lot of languages that makes managing memory easier, but at a cost
[02:03:00] <Astraea> vs something like C/C++ where you have a lot of power, but you can shoot yourself in the foot... repeatedly
[02:03:33] <blueridanus> Peach: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_counting#Advantages_and_disadvantages
[02:03:44] <scott> Yeah. Easiness, control, and safety are all at odds with each other in memory management.
[02:03:59] <scott> Rust gives you control and safety but definitely not easiness compared to most languages.
[02:04:07] <Astraea> yup
[02:04:24] <Peach> I want "Rust with easiness"
[02:04:25] <Diggsey> Also, you can forget "fully statically analyzable" if you want turing completeness :P
[02:04:32] <scott> If someone found a way to make Rust's system way easier to use, that would be a great way to work toward perfect memory management.
[02:04:48] <scott> It's a really hard problem, though.
[02:04:57] <Astraea> very much so

[02:07:00] <Peach> How are you sure?
[02:07:11] <scott> Because everything in programming language design is tradeoffs.

[02:07:21] <scott> But if you have a good idea, absolutely go for it.
[02:07:22] <Astraea> and it's not a solved problem
[02:07:47] <Peach> Also - does it count as reference counting if you still have to manually call delete? I'm just making it so the "new/delete" system doesn't allow dangling pointers

[02:08:37] <Peach> everything that uses a pointer gets added to a list of "address to set to null" when delete is used on a memory address
[02:08:54] <Peach> *this is only for a very specific "global new"
[02:09:04] <Peach> it just prevents dangling pointers
[02:09:17] <Layl> there's a dangerous deficiency of donuts right now here

[02:10:28] <Peach> int* data = new int[20];   var* x = data;  delete data; print(x);   // upon delete, "x" gets set to null
[02:10:38] <Peach> so no dangling pointers
[02:11:00] <Layl> how do you manage to make something not turing complete
[02:11:17] <Diggsey> simplest is just to require bounds on loops
[02:11:37] <scott> Most languages where you can prove theorems are non-turing complete.
[02:11:51] <scott> They have specific restrictions on recursion and such.
[02:11:55] <Astraea> so... how does print(x) behave
[02:12:20] <Peach> print is a generic function,
[02:12:22] <Diggsey> alternatively, just add a termination prover, and then say that any program for which the termination prover cannot prove a result is not a valid program :P:
[02:12:40] <Peach> it calls a   x.string   conversion
[02:12:47] <Peach> Really, print is like a template function
[02:12:51] <blueridanus> Peach: do you delete x if I delete data?
[02:12:59] <Astraea> so it tries to convert a null pointer?
[02:13:03] <Peach> blueridanus:  no, x gets set to null
[02:13:11] <Peach> data gets deleted once
[02:13:25] <blueridanus> I see.
[02:13:32] <blueridanus> Well, it seems to me you're doing reference counting
[02:13:52] <Peach> Not exactly, it's just new/delete that doesn't allow dangling pointers
[02:14:12] <Peach> so you can't delete twice or read garbage data
[02:14:38] <Layl> I should make an esoteric language
[02:14:57] <Peach> no Layl , make something useful that has good productivity ideas
[02:15:00] <Layl> that's forcefully object oriented by default
[02:15:15] <Peach> there isn't enough end user programmer friendliness in programming language
[02:15:22] <Layl> to implement anything, you need to create an interface for it
[02:15:24] <Diggsey> Peach: how does the compiler know that 'x' and 'data' are aliased (necessary for it to clear 'x' when you delete 'data') when we've already established that static analysis is limited
[02:15:36] <Layl> to construct something, you need a requirement of at least 2 factories producing it
[02:15:51] <Astraea> Layl: I love esoteric languages!
[02:15:55] <Astraea> I've always wanted to make one
[02:16:02] <Astraea> but you know... one that's just impossible to grasp
[02:16:13] <Layl> at runtime, every data structure's internal memory is shuffled around every 20 operations, to make sure you don't accidentally violate encapsulation
[02:16:40] <scott> Layl: Make it work like a resource game. String objects require you to first manufacture characters in factories that consume raw bytes mined in the RAM quarry.
[02:16:41] <Peach> Diggsey: when a pointer gets assigned to data, it sends a reference to the variable's address to a global list so delete knows which pointers to set to null
[02:17:40] <Layl> of course, singletons are strictly forbidden by the compiler
[02:17:41] <Peach> Diggsey so like:   int* data = new int[20];  var* x = data; trackreference(&x, data);  delete data; foreach(r : trackedrefs) { r = NULL; } print(x);

[02:19:43] <scott> Recycle old strings by regexing them into new strings
[02:20:42] <Diggsey> I've always wanted to come up with a language which would allow safe, self-modifying code...
[02:20:43] <Layl> free memory by dumping it into the ocean
[02:20:54] <Layl> just like real life
[02:21:26] <scott> Level 12 introduces the GC, which makes your life much easier
[02:21:52] <scott> Over the next 10 levels you make your systems make tons of trash and just throw it away from the GC to deal with
[02:21:56] <Layl> unfortunately, it stops the world every 50 cycles to make a bunch of inspectors run around and see if the factories are still using everything
[02:22:05] <scott> Level 23 the garbage men go on strike
[02:22:16] <scott> You have to deal with the tons of garbage you are making
[02:23:37] <blueridanus> What's a good name for that game?
[02:23:54] <blueridanus> And does it end in Simulator 2015?
[02:24:30] <Layl> I would call the game Deadbeef honestly
[02:24:44] <scott> AbstractSimulatorFactorySingleton 2015
[02:25:01] <Diggsey> What about a language, where instead of writing the code that will run, you write a set of requirements which the code running at any given time must meet, but the code that's running is actually changing randomly within those limits, the changes being driven by some form of machine learning algorithm...
[02:25:38] <Layl> what about a language that randomly switches around functions, just to keep you on your toes
[02:25:51] <scott> Genetic programming, basically?

[02:26:16] <scott> Layl: That's kind of what fuzzers do
[02:26:31] <Layl> or a language that can only output by 'blowing up' part of the memory
[02:26:38] <Layl> making that bit of memory unusable for the rest of execution
[02:27:11] <Diggsey> It's perfect for running on write-once CDs...
[02:27:34] <Layl> or a language that only accepts input by plugging in and out usb sticks
[02:27:45] <Layl> not any data on the sticks, just the plugging in and out of the sticks
[02:28:21] <Diggsey> better yet: a language where you write code by dancing in front of a kinect...
[02:28:36] <Layl> my screen is not accepting my money
[02:29:03] <blueridanus> Dance moves are instructions
[02:29:06] <scott> I'm going to start working part-time in a human-computer interaction lab in a month
[02:29:09] <scott> I should make that happen
[02:29:12] <scott> They have lots of kinects
[02:29:20] <blueridanus> Programs are, like, your full performance
[02:29:31] <blueridanus> That's amazing. Purely amazing.
[02:29:35] <Diggsey> fun fact: if you have a lot of kinects in a room, they all interfere with each other :P
[02:29:56] <scott> Yeah, they use IR projectors
[02:30:02] <blueridanus> scott, do, it, please. The world needs that.
[02:30:08] <blueridanus> do it*
[02:30:34] <Layl> oh wow I wonder, will this be turing complete:
[02:30:54] <scott> It would be easy enough to input brainfuck programs via a kinect sensor
[02:31:18] <Layl> a language like befunge, except the only way you can access memory is through a grid where the memory cursor moves around over the grid as the pointer moves through the program, and you can set with some instructions the size of the memory grid and if the pointer will roll over to the other side
[02:31:52] <scott> The data pointer moves when the instruction pointer moves?
[02:31:57] <Layl> yes
[02:32:00] <scott> Scary
[02:32:17] <Layl> you can't stop the pointer, you can only set if it rolls over to the other side or not
[02:32:55] <blueridanus> I'm too interested in the dance language...
[02:33:01] <blueridanus> How would you name variables and functions?
[02:33:10] <blueridanus> With a custom dance move?
[02:33:20] <Diggsey> lol
[02:33:39] <Layl> make that dance language object oriented
[02:33:41] <Layl> somehow
[02:34:32] <blueridanus> And then you make it support metaprogramming...
[02:34:52] <Layl> best language idea, a language where all identifiers have to follow an unreasonable password security requirement
[02:34:54] <Diggsey> I'm just imagining the hackathons...
[02:35:30] <Layl> minimum 20 characters, at least 5 different punctuation marks, must contain a number that's not prime
[02:35:30] <blueridanus> "Alright boys, the best performance of A* wins!"
[02:35:41] <blueridanus> [electronic music]
[02:35:55] <Layl> it certainly would give a new meaning to "game jam"
[02:36:41] <nathan7> Layl: non-primes are easy to find though
[02:37:06] <Diggsey> the IDE automatically synthesizes the music based on static analysis of the program...
[02:37:11] <Layl> nathan7, arbitrary rules are fun
[02:38:00] <Layl> of course, for security reasons, a md5 hash of the identifier may not contain 2 Fs in a row
[02:41:40] <blueridanus> Better yet
[02:42:18] <blueridanus> Somehow manage to make the compiler of your friend for a non-esoteric language enforce these rules
[02:43:06] <blueridanus> The reaction would be possibly priceless.

[02:56:04] <scott> I know a bit.
[02:56:13] <scott> Yeah, it's not standard
[02:56:18] *** Joins: c74d (c74d3a4ebb6@moz-0ersgu.oc.cox.net)
[02:58:33] <Peach> why
[02:59:04] <scott> The C++ standards committee never decided to include it. I don't know why.
[02:59:19] <scott> Possibly because restrict is pretty dangerous.
[03:01:08] <Peach> "dangerous" :O
[03:01:31] <JustAPerson> Deref/Mut should be in the prelude ;_;
[03:02:01] <scott> restrict asserts that a pointer doesn't alias so the optimizer can do more optimizations, but if the programmer then accidentally makes the pointer aliased then you get undefined behaviour.
[03:02:05] <Astraea> wonder how C++17 is shaping up
[03:03:00] <scott> JustAPerson: Don't you rarely need to actually mention them by name?
[03:03:15] <scott> Most of the time you can just write *foo and it works without `use`ing Deref.
[03:03:46] <scott> Even traits like Add aren't in the prelude.
[03:04:46] <JustAPerson> doesn't work if I'm trying to println!("{:?}") a T: Deref<Target=[u8]>
[03:05:21] <JustAPerson> and I can't #[derive(Debug)] because it's actually `struct T([u8; 512])` and the automatic trait impls for fixed arrays only go up to like 32, not 512
[03:05:23] <scott> Do you have a testcase for that?
[03:05:47] <scott> I feel like you should be able to println!("{:?}", &*t)
[03:06:24] <scott> Trait impls for fixed-sized arrays are definitely annoying right now.
[03:07:32] <JustAPerson> scott: yea, &* works too
[03:07:38] <JustAPerson> this was my case before thathttp://is.gd/csFipp
[03:07:41] <JustAPerson> that http://is.gd/csFipp
[03:08:17] <scott> Ah, so you were impling Deref specifically to get around array trait impl issues?
[03:09:18] <scott> s.deref() is equivalent to &*s
[03:09:23] <JustAPerson> no I need Deref in general just to manipulate the bytes and use crates like byteorder, but I kept running into needing to .deref()
[03:09:29] <JustAPerson> thanks for the &* tip
[03:09:49] <scott> Since *s desugars to *s.deref(), &*s becomes &*s.deref() which is just s.deref()
[03:13:17] <Peach> That's it, I'm redesigning Rust

[03:14:11] <scott> It's was nuts. :p
[03:14:32] <Peach> Rust IS terse, almost nothing gets a full named spelled out
[03:14:37] <Peach> "fn" "Impl"
[03:14:47] <scott> Yeah, but even that used to be more extreme.
[03:14:49] <scott> return was ret
[03:14:51] <scott> match was alt
[03:14:54] <Peach> I'm surprised you don't have cls for class
[03:15:01] <scott> There was a keyword 'log' instead of println! and such
[03:15:02] *** Joins: blueridanus (Mibbit@moz-k63.43p.20.201.IP)
[03:15:26] <scott> There was ~T instead of Box<T> and ~x instead of Box::new(x)

[03:15:41] <Peach> The symbols are too terse
[03:15:44] <Peach> <'a>
[03:16:04] <scott> The terseness if an expert-friendly feature.
[03:16:06] <scott> is*
[03:16:10] <Peach> no body reading that can intuitively understand it, nor easily google it
[03:16:17] <Astraea> I'd say it's a limitation of text
[03:16:19] <Peach> expert-friendly : (
[03:16:27] <scott> I know you're interested in beginner friendliness, but making it all spelled out makes things harder for experienced users.
[03:16:44] <c74d> how?
[03:16:53] <c74d> just that there's more to type?
[03:16:54] <Astraea> which ends up forcing you into bad syntactic sugar
[03:16:56] <scott> Everyone is a beginner for a little while, but we all spend more time as experienced users than we do as beginners.
[03:17:04] <scott> Unless we give up on the language entirely.
[03:17:15] <scott> (So you can't be 100% expert-focused.0
[03:17:27] <scott> But it doesn't pay off to be entirely beginner-focused either.
[03:18:10] <Astraea> as always, I say text is the limiting factor
[03:18:15] <scott> c74d: More to read, as well.
[03:18:26] <scott> Actually that's probably more important than the typing.
[03:18:42] <Astraea> and will continue to be until I make my magnum opus... sometime before I die
[03:18:45] <scott> Lifetime elision is a good example.
[03:19:07] <scott> It's kind of bad for beginners to totally hide details from them. But for more experienced users it's useless noise.
[03:19:35] <c74d> I like the idea of showing the fully-spelled-out forms of identifiers in tooltips.

[03:19:59] <scott> "un-elide this func sig for me"
[03:20:01] <Peach> scott: The IDE will explain keywords on hover, 
[03:20:30] <Peach> and code is often read more than it gets written

[03:21:01] <Peach> but I go semi terse - like int  int32 int64 etc.
[03:21:06] <scott> Terseness can help reading, if done right, like with lifetime elision.
[03:21:53] <Peach> lifetimes are so important I'd rather them be spelled out
[03:21:54] <scott> int32 is definitely not any clearer than i32 to me, so I consider is just extra noise.
[03:21:59] <scott> it*
[03:22:11] <c74d> in my programming language concept, I'd have a set of standard abbreviations (fn = function, addr = address, ...), and the capability to define new ones within a namespace.
[03:22:18] <Astraea> so long as you're not being terse to the point of being laconic
[03:22:43] <Peach> int is most certainly clearer and more common than just "i" scott
[03:23:12] <Peach> I also use "ref" keyword for address/pointer
[03:23:14] <Astraea> also inaccurate! =P
[03:23:17] <scott> Yes, but the i32 type is so common in Rust everyone knows what it is.
[03:23:25] <scott> Commonly used things can have shorter names.
[03:23:30] <scott> Less common things need to be spelled out
[03:23:41] <Peach> but it's not even intermediate friendly : (
[03:23:42] <blueridanus> Peach: I'm just going to leave that I knew what i32 was even before being told by some documentation that it was int32.
[03:23:59] <blueridanus> It was obvious enough for me.
[03:24:03] <Peach> (talking about Rust's general syntax)
[03:24:18] <Astraea> this all sort of ties into my general feelings that in programming representation needs to be separated from the underlying data
[03:24:22] <scott> Another example of that is Vec vs. BinaryHeap
[03:24:24] <c74d> I knew what it was, but only because I already knew LLVM's type names.
[03:24:31] <scott> Vec's are common so it's not necessary to use a longer name
[03:24:32] <Astraea> like in every other thing we do...
[03:24:42] <scott> But BinaryHeap is less common so it's not abbreviated.
[03:25:10] <blueridanus> Well, I just saw instances of "i32, u32, f32"
[03:25:39] <blueridanus> And thought "if it can be i or u or f, it's obviously unsigned, float and signed"
[03:25:44] <scott> I had used names like i32 in C before since I used them often enough that int32_t seemed a bit excessive.
[03:26:12] <blueridanus> (not in that particular order)
[03:28:47] <c74d> blueridanus: that wouldn't help someone who isn't already familiar with the C senses of "unsigned", "signed", and "float" (but the documentation explains that, I trust?).
[03:29:14] <Peach> scott: Vec is specific to data processing domains, to a game developer, Vec is a 3D vector of 3 floats :P
[03:29:21] <Peach> I use List
[03:29:29] <scott> c74d: They type doesn't need to explain itself when it's so pervasive in the language, though.
[03:29:52] <swgillespie> List sounds like a linked list to me
[03:29:56] <scott> Peach: I agree the specific name of Vec is a bad one. I'm only referring to the fact that it's abbreviated in this case.
[03:30:06] <scott> List does have that bad connotation. ^
[03:30:22] <c74d> scott: did you mean someone else? I'm not saying anything on that subject.
[03:30:29] <Peach> Why on earth is List "linked list" 
[03:30:36] <scott> C++
[03:30:50] <c74d> Maybe Lisp, too?
[03:30:50] <Peach> C++ needs to go jump out the window
[03:31:15] <blueridanus> C++ is too useful and too used to die
[03:31:50] <blueridanus> c74d: What name would you suggest for "32bit unsigned integer?"
[03:32:02] <blueridanus> I can't think of anything self-descriptive.
[03:32:04] <scott> c74d: Oh, I was just responding to what you said about people not already familiar with unsigned/signed/float not picking up on the i32/f32/u32 names right away.
[03:32:40] <scott> I think it doesn't matter if those aren't immediately recognizable since they're just so pervasive and any intro tutorial will cover them at least partially.
[03:33:02] <XMPPwocky> can i sign up somewhere to just receive random laptop stickers in the mail occasionally
[03:33:15] <scott> Self-description is less and less important the more commonly used something is.
[03:33:26] <blueridanus> Indeed.
[03:33:37] <blueridanus> What's worse than not being reconizable is being easily recognizable as something else
[03:34:27] <niconii> honestly i can't think of many things you could call "self-descriptive"... eventually you do just have to learn and memorize what something is
[03:34:42] <niconii> without prior knowledge, even "string" isn't self-descriptive
[03:34:45] <blueridanus> The former only makes a beginner need a Google search, the latter is, however, very confusing
[03:36:04] <Peach> I want to make a programming language with "Google-able" syntax
[03:36:20] <blueridanus> Google has poor support of special characters
[03:36:39] <niconii> it's true that rust does have some issues with that
[03:36:55] <niconii> trying to find info on for<'a> is near-impossible
[03:37:29] <blueridanus> That's true.
[03:38:11] <scott> That's a good example. It might be a mistake to reuse the for keyword there.
[03:38:15] <c74d> blueridanus: hm... maybe "iu32" for a language such as Rust? I certainly don't have a strong opinion on it, and I would only make such a suggestion were the language's designers soliciting suggestions.
[03:39:01] <niconii> iu32 would just confuse me
[03:39:08] <blueridanus> ^
[03:39:25] <niconii> ui32 maybe would work, since i read it as "unsigned integer, 32-bit"
[03:39:40] <niconii> but "integer unsigned, 32-bit"...
[03:39:48] <c74d> hypothetical suggestion-proffering me yields to the community input.
[03:39:59] <c74d> (though, "integer, unsigned, 32-bit")
[03:40:00] <scott> I wonder to what extent people actually expand names like "i32" and "u32" in their minds.

[03:41:01] <blueridanus> "Eye thirty two" for me as well.

[03:48:11] <Peach> blueridanus:  Rust is not made in a way the corresponds nicely to high level computer science concepts, it's very terse and has a lot of implicit behavior and high learning curve
[03:48:31] <scott> Some fonts make it better but a lot of fonts don't make <> tall enough to work well as brackets.
[03:48:41] <niconii> ugly is subjective
[03:48:50] <Peach> eh
[03:49:04] <niconii> if rust had gone the no-curly-brackets route with significant whitespace and all that, i don't think i'd have liked it as much
[03:49:10] <blueridanus> Hmm. It's indeed subjective. I asked it because I thought it's pretty nice, personally
[03:49:21] <Peach> I dislike symbols, brackets are cool
[03:49:33] <scott> My main point is that Rust steered toward C++-like stuff to some extent to appeal to that crowd. It restricts the amount of experimentation of the syntax regardless of whether you think that's good or bad.
[03:49:33] <Peach> but I really dislike the cryptic names for the library functions
[03:49:36] <Peach> Like Eq
[03:49:40] <Peach> *Eq*
[03:49:47] <scott> That's a Haskell-ism
[03:49:54] <scott> Same with Ord
[03:50:00] <blueridanus> scott: I saw someone argue Rust is a functional language and is not presented that way because of that crowd.
[03:50:08] <niconii> Ord is a lot more cryptic than Eq imo
[03:50:21] <Layl> I should revive my old EU4 mod generator in rust
[03:50:22] <JustAPerson> most rust function names are fully spelled out, sometimes pretty long
[03:50:25] <blueridanus> As someone that was attracted to Rust for its functional style, I can see it
[03:50:29] <Peach> Do any math/programmer people even appreciate using English-like names occasionally
[03:50:31] <niconii> there's not many words that start with Eq
[03:50:32] <Peach> Ord
[03:50:38] <Peach> Ord why
[03:50:47] <blueridanus> English words are too long
[03:50:48] <blueridanus> :p
[03:50:53] <Layl> I made a generator a while back that for the game europa universalis 4 generates a country per region
[03:51:01] <Layl> might be fun to recreate that in rust
[03:51:03] <Peach> Code is read more than it gets written blueridanus 
[03:51:03] <scott> Mathematicians tend to invent terse notation so they can communicate complex ideas more efficiently.
[03:51:18] <Peach> "efficiently"
[03:51:29] <Layl> efficiently between eachother but NO ONE ELSE
[03:51:33] <Peach> but you still have to decode it in your mind as you read it
[03:51:34] <JustAPerson> ∀
[03:51:39] <Peach> lol Layl 
[03:51:44] <scott> And looking at it another way, I have absolutely no trouble remembering what Eq and Ord are, and beginners can look them up. But I would be okay with longer names.
[03:51:50] <JustAPerson> ∃
[03:51:51] <scott> i just don't see it as a big deal.
[03:52:06] <blueridanus> I don't, either.
[03:52:15] <blueridanus> I do have a preference for going the Ord way than the Ordered way.
[03:52:17] <Peach> My idea is: User friendliness in programming languages,
[03:52:37] <Peach> blueridanus and scott  you prob don't see the deal cause I know you must be command line people anyway
[03:52:55] <blueridanus> Peach: I'm not really that much of an expert.
[03:52:58] <Peach> probably just used to short command names and such
[03:53:11] <scott> I have a different idea of user friendliness than you, that's all.
[03:53:17] <Peach> hmmmmmmm
[03:53:19] <scott> i'm thinking about different kinds of users for the most part.
[03:53:29] <scott> I lean toward expert-friendliness to a greater extent.
[03:54:03] <scott> If it's for a system where I think most people will spend more time experienced than as beginners.
[03:54:04] <blueridanus> My idea of beginner friendliness is "make it easy to Google and make it easy to experiment."
[03:54:14] <Peach> I primarily thinking of a user friendly language as one where a new user can write code that doesn't easily mess up the rest of a code base
[03:54:18] <blueridanus> C++ is horrible to experiment with
[03:54:24] <blueridanus> Javascript is amazing to experiment with
[03:54:27] <Peach> blueridanus: 
[03:54:28] <Peach> YES
[03:54:29] <Peach> YES
[03:54:33] <Layl> javascript to me is a big pain to use
[03:54:36] <Peach> blueridanus idea of beginner friendliness is "make it easy to Google and make it easy to experiment." < Yes
[03:54:48] <blueridanus> Why, Layl?
[03:54:50] <Layl> *shakes fist at the game called rust*
[03:54:58] <scott> Javascript makes it really easy to mess up the codebase, though. Tons of gotchas.
[03:55:03] <Peach> blueridanus: that's actually the prospect of the language I'm making - It's a language built for experiments
[03:55:09] <Layl> blueridanus, bunch of design decisions that I don't quite like, and I've got a personal vendetta against it
[03:55:12] <Peach> a language like Javascript but with 0 gotchas
[03:55:18] <Layl> javascript slowed down my early years of programming
[03:55:19] <scott> It's only friendly because of availability (i.e. you have a web browser already).
[03:55:33] <blueridanus> scott: Yes, but not only that.
[03:55:43] <Layl> probably it took me like 2 more years than it would have taken to really get into programming... if javascript wasn't called javascript
[03:55:44] <blueridanus> You don't have to fiddle with -L
[03:55:48] <blueridanus> You don't have to fiddle with header files
[03:55:56] <blueridanus> You don't need DLLs
[03:55:59] <Peach> I want to make a language that's super fast and the end user never has to setup libraries/header files
[03:56:01] <blueridanus> That's very beginner friendly.
[03:56:10] <Layl> because the first language I was trying to get into was java
[03:56:16] <Peach> So like a "C++ for Javascript people"
[03:56:20] <Peach> but better
[03:56:20] <niconii> Layl: wait, because of the name "javascri-- ah. yeah.
[03:56:22] <Layl> and I ended up finding a mix of java and javascript books
[03:56:29] <niconii> oops.
[03:56:30] <Layl> and I couldn't make any sense of what the hell was going on
[03:56:48] <Layl> seriously, fuck javascript's name
[03:56:50] <scott> Heh, some things that seem obvious can be big problems to beginners.
[03:57:05] <blueridanus> Well, my experience with javascript is:
[03:57:16] <Layl> why the hell did no one get upset at them naming it javascript
[03:57:17] <Layl> seriously
[03:57:17] <scott> It's hard to imagine what programming looks like from an outside perspective these days.
[03:57:22] <Peach> javascript should have been called webscript or netscript
[03:57:29] * blueridanus pastes three.js in directory
[03:57:41] * blueridanus copies some text from threejs website
[03:57:45] <Layl> what's wrong with EcmaScript
[03:57:46] <blueridanus> "Cool, I can do 3D."
[03:57:53] <blueridanus> Compare that with OpenGL + C++
[03:58:04] <c74d> Peach: I'm a command-line person who likes the idea of fully-spelled (by default) names and editor features to make that and other defaults configurable.
[03:58:04] <blueridanus> Or <insert 3D library> + C++
[03:58:18] <scott> I'm fairly experienced and OpenGL with C or C++ is still a very painful process.
[03:58:18] <Peach> blueridanus!!! That's exactly what I mean and what I'm enspired by
[03:58:28] <Peach> (inspired by)
[03:58:35] <Peach> webgl makes it so easy
[03:58:43] <Layl> PHP is probably the first language I actually was able to do anything with that looked like it could be a real product to me
[03:58:44] <Peach> and C++ is fast but so complex to setup
[03:58:50] <Layl> before that, all I did was console C++
[03:58:50] <scott> it's such a shame web technology is mostly crap.
[03:59:02] <blueridanus> We seem to have lots of ideas in common Peach. <3
[03:59:06] <Layl> and I never could get win32 stuff working... because the only book I had on GUIs was for windows 3.1
[03:59:06] <scott> It makes a lot of things a lot easier, or at least should.
[03:59:06] <Peach> I'm making a language that has 0 setup and it's as fast as C++ AND user friendly
[03:59:25] <Peach> and all the good stuff like 3D/opengl is avaiable right at the start
[03:59:36] <Peach> so it's all good for experimenting
[03:59:38] <Layl> I still used turbo vision because I didn't have anything better at the time
[03:59:52] <blueridanus> Well, I guess the stuff that you have to keep in mind is that you can't really catch 'em all
[03:59:53] <Layl> and this was when windows 95 was starting to get old
[04:00:21] <blueridanus> You might not be able to appeal to everyone, but that's fine. 
[04:00:41] <Layl> now that I think about it, probably the most important thing you have to explain to new programmers is the concept of third party libraries
[04:00:44] <scott> Appealing to everyone is definitely impossible.
[04:00:56] <blueridanus> Not only is it impossible
[04:00:59] <blueridanus> It's a distraction
[04:01:10] <Layl> it sounds so basic, but I know from my early experience with programming that I really didn't know I could do all sorts of things with libraries
[04:01:19] <scott> Yeah, you shouldn't attempt it. Have a specific audience in mind and what you make will be much better.
[04:01:25] <blueridanus> Layl, me neither.
[04:01:33] <blueridanus> Which is why I loved javascript as a beginner.
[04:01:40] <blueridanus> And now know too much javascript to stop using javascript
[04:01:54] <Peach> Any ever used smallBasic?
[04:01:59] <blueridanus> (and got too interested in web development as well)
[04:02:21] <Peach> I liked how the smallBasic IDE was nicer in some ways than a real IDE was
[04:02:37] *** Quits: blue_deref (blue_deref@moz-eqnijv.res.rr.com) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[04:05:14] <blueridanus> Peach: and then there's doing stuff wrong... the "annoying game tutorial" way
[04:05:16] <blueridanus> https://www.touchdevelop.com/app/
[04:05:22] <blueridanus> ^ I'm looking right at you, TouchDevelop.
[04:05:55] <Peach> I wanna make a language that's super easy yet it IS a practical full language in itself
[04:06:49] <scott> Racket took an interesting approach by actually having different versions of the language designed for beginners. As you move through the tutorials, you move to versions with more features until you get to the actual lanugage.
[04:08:04] <Peach> Lisp is evil *TM
[04:08:22] <scott> Why?
[04:08:37] <Peach> I need to pose a theory, I call it the "wall of unparsable text theory"
[04:08:52] <Peach> Programs can often be so large that they span dozens of pages for a single file
[04:09:03] <Peach> You want code constructs to be visible at a glance
[04:09:22] <scott> That applies to all languages equally.
[04:09:25] <Peach> if the core language has no visualizable structure, it makes it far difficult to understand code
[04:09:31] <scott> You can break up your code in Lisp, too.
[04:09:55] <scott> I agree about control structures being non-obvious, but not on code size.
[04:10:18] <blueridanus> Same. Some projects just require very large code bases
[04:10:46] <scott> Anyway, I only brought it up because Racket had a good idea. Whether the language itself is good isn't really relevant.
[04:11:01] <blueridanus> I think we may be taking language design as too important.
[04:11:10] <blueridanus> (for the specific issue of beginners)
[04:11:11] <blueridanus> What about beginner resources?
[04:11:19] <blueridanus> What about stuff like this:
[04:11:20] <blueridanus> https://www.haskell.org/
[04:11:29] <blueridanus> That "Try it," is awesome.
[04:12:05] <scott> Good point. I agree that documentation and REPLs are way more important for beginners than the details of the syntax and whatnot.
[04:12:08] <Peach> I can say that rust's IRC system is very nice
[04:12:17] <Peach> and especially 
[04:12:24] <Peach> playbot: println!("sup")
[04:12:25] -playbot- sup
[04:12:25] -playbot- ()
[04:12:29] <scott> Yeah.
[04:12:36] <scott> I use playbot in PM all the time. It's my Rust REPL.
[04:12:50] <scott> (Even thought it doesn't save any state or anything.)
[04:12:51] <eddyb_> REML
[04:12:54] <eddyb_> or rather
[04:13:11] <eddyb_> PMENL
[04:13:32] <blueridanus> scott: I do that as well. 
[04:13:55] <Peach> I didn't know you could PM playbot
[04:14:04] <Peach> Can anyone check the code I send to playbot
[04:14:08] <Peach> or does no one check it?
[04:14:18] <scott> Possibly the person who runs the bot.
[04:14:21] <blueridanus> "Can" or "will"?
[04:14:25] <JustAPerson> i doubt anyone would bother, but there's certainly a log of it
[04:14:28] <JustAPerson> don't send personal info
[04:14:28] <blueridanus> They can, they probably won't.
[04:14:36] <scott> Don't send playbot your passwords. :p
[04:14:54] * Peach sends playbot  passwords and credit card info
[04:15:13] * blueridanus exploits playbot, gets Peach's information
[04:15:16] <blueridanus> ^ way more possible
[04:15:23] <blueridanus> likely*
[04:15:31] <Astraea> <insert obligatory hunter2 joke here>
[04:17:17] <niconii> Astraea: what's a ******* joke
[04:17:58] <Peach> Ok
[04:18:08] <Peach> Haskell just lost me with it's "fst" function
[04:18:11] <Peach> like WHAT
[04:18:12] <eddyb_> the heck is *******?
[04:18:13] <Peach> seriously
[04:18:28] <eddyb_> Peach: fst x is x.0 in Rust
[04:18:34] <blueridanus> fst = first
[04:18:39] <eddyb_> (I think)
[04:18:42] <eddyb_> oh, no, it's head?
[04:18:44] <Peach> the naming is terrible
[04:18:46] <eddyb_> it's something!
[04:18:49] <niconii> eddyb_: we were just having a conversation about stuff being too terse
[04:18:57] <scott> fst is for tuples
[04:19:01] <eddyb_> so .0
[04:19:03] <niconii> for context
[04:19:05] <scott> Yeah
[04:19:13] <eddyb_> aww and I missed my spot
[04:19:18] <eddyb_> blueridanus: only because it's written in Python and not Rust :P
[04:19:21] <scott> fn fst<T,U>((x, _): (T, U)) -> T { x } // whee
[04:19:31] <eddyb_> blueridanus: Python and C, I think
[04:19:42] <Astraea> I mean... Take out the vowels, not other consonants.
[04:19:47] <scott> It's sad haskell doesn't have something like p.0
[04:19:58] <scott> fst doesn't work for 3-tuples
[04:20:11] *** eddyb_ is now known as eddyb
[04:20:52] <blueridanus> scott: It actually works only for (a,b)
[04:20:59] <eddyb> full disclosure: I don't use Haskell because I would abuse it to hell and I would not be able to read my code after a few months
[04:21:06] <scott> blueridanus: Yeah, that's what I mean
[04:21:07] <eddyb> I mean, I already do that with Rust
[04:21:22] <eddyb> but what you call line-noise, is actually my lifeline
[04:21:33] <eddyb> life-noise
[04:21:35] <scott> Just Another Perl Hasker

[04:21:55] <scott> lol Hasker
[04:22:04] <scott> We should call Haskell programmer Haskers.
[04:22:08] <eddyb> scott: funny thing is, I wrote more Haskell than Perl. and I don't write Haskell, except for one-liners
[04:22:16] <scott> I've never used Perl.
[04:22:24] <blueridanus> Same, never used Perl.
[04:22:24] <scott> It always scared me.
[04:22:24] <eddyb> however...
[04:22:38] <eddyb> ES6 can do a bunch of DSL-ish things
[04:22:49] <eddyb> it's where I started abusing "free-form"
[04:23:19] <scott> Ruby was the first language I learned well and I abused it heavily.
[04:23:47] <eddyb> I tried to get Ruby
[04:23:58] <eddyb> and then I noticed it conflates method calls and field access
[04:24:04] <blueridanus> I use javascript for quick stuff. 
[04:24:14] <blueridanus> My URL bar becomes a terminal
[04:24:18] <eddyb> I write my JS like it's C with GC :P
[04:24:19] <scott> Ruby does a lot of silly things.
[04:24:24] <eddyb> blueridanus: that seems wrong

[04:26:10] <eddyb> that is an API for the data query API of X-Trade Brokers
[04:26:23] <blueridanus> eddyb: Dunno, but I do use the console sometimes
[04:26:29] <eddyb> as compactly as you may ever get it
[04:26:41] <eddyb> it could be better if we had casing-manipulation macros, I guess
[04:27:04] <eddyb> I should maybe try to port it to serde

[04:33:20] <eddyb> c74d: you could switch to i18n`...` in ES6 for user-facing strings
[04:33:28] <c74d> huh
[04:33:29] <Peach> It makes a new page that says red

[04:34:10] <blueridanus> Peach: Welcome to the world of URL bar hacking. Don't let eddyb know
[04:34:11] <eddyb> you don't do ES6 natively
[04:34:15] * c74d knows little of ES6.
[04:34:17] <eddyb> you use transpilers
[04:34:20] <c74d> oh
[04:34:23] <eddyb> this stuff worked fine ages ago
[04:34:28] <eddyb> and most of it has no impact on performance
[04:34:41] <eddyb> traceur-compiler was one of the first
[04:34:46] <scott> That's the cool thing about ES6. You can use it today with transpilers until browsers support it, then run natively.
[04:34:52] <scott> Kicks the chicken-egg problem right out.
[04:34:53] <eddyb> now everyone and their dog have a transpiler
[04:35:31] <eddyb> the syntax is optional_preprocessing_function`blah blah. this is interpolated: ${some_expression}. a+b=${a+b}`
[04:35:47] <Peach> wow there's so many colors
[04:36:00] <Peach> javascript even has gold as a background color

[04:36:32] <eddyb> and I got the hunter2 meme *sigh*. I just fail at tailing a joke

[04:37:06] <blueridanus> Peach: You can also type it like that: "rgb(255,0,0)" or "hsl(h,s,l)" or rgba, hsla, or #FF000
[04:37:13] <eddyb> parse`function(${arg_name}) {return ${proxy}(this, ${arg_name});}`
[04:37:14] <Peach> Also, with flat UI, nowadays, you don't even need effort to make a ui anymore
[04:37:24] <c74d> I forgot about ES6→JS compilers (despite having some starred on GitHub), I suppose due to never having worked on a JavaScript project large enough that I felt a compilation step would be worthwhile.
[04:37:31] <eddyb> would produce an AST without looking inside those AST pieces
[04:37:44] <eddyb> c74d: it's not necessarily a compilation step
[04:37:52] <Peach> You just set the background color and make buttons without any decoration
[04:38:29] <blueridanus> The best thing about it is that it also looks very nice
[04:38:41] <eddyb> traceur-compiler can automatically convert <script type="text/fuck-I-forgot-the-mime-XD">
[04:38:52] <eddyb> and it also has a node.js mode
[04:38:57] <eddyb> I haven't hacked on it in a while though
[04:39:07] <c74d> "application/ecmascript"?
[04:39:09] <eddyb> and I didn't fix everything I could have
[04:39:11] <eddyb> c74d: maybe
[04:39:22] <Peach> so javascript is evil
[04:39:22] <eddyb> I used to use it on jsfiddle
[04:39:23] <Peach> also,
[04:39:30] <Peach> how do you parse template strings?
[04:39:45] <eddyb> Peach: like raw strings
[04:39:50] <c74d> I think, for each JavaScript project I've worked on, I either (1) was ignorant of ES6, or (2) am averse to using JavaScript heavily
[04:39:51] <eddyb> (I'm not sure what you mean)
[04:40:07] <eddyb> c74d: anyways, you can do i18n with template strings
[04:40:47] <eddyb> you translate the constant bits and then interpolate
[04:41:09] <c74d> eddyb: when does it "automatically convert" that though? is it running in the client or the server (as opposed to the developer's system)?
[04:41:18] <eddyb> c74d: it's just JS code
[04:41:23] <Peach> the newest javascript has string templates
[04:41:30] <eddyb> Peach: it's not "JS"
[04:41:33] <c74d> oh, so it's put in the page as a <script>?
[04:41:34] <eddyb> it's ES2015
[04:41:41] <eddyb> that's what I said
[04:41:44] <Peach> it works like    "hey my name is \(username)"
[04:41:47] <eddyb> well, let me refraze
[04:41:54] <eddyb> Peach: wtf that's not ES
[04:42:01] <blueridanus> It's not new
[04:42:08] <blueridanus> Not that new, I think.
[04:42:14] <blueridanus> My browser supports it.
[04:42:18] <eddyb> c74d: traceur-compiler is JS code (well, ES, it's bootstrapped)
[04:42:40] <eddyb> c74d: you can include a certain build of it in your page and it will convert your ES <script> tags
[04:42:46] <eddyb> in the client
[04:42:57] <Peach> "Hey here's math ${acos(45)} and ${4+4}"
[04:43:00] <eddyb> or you can pre-compile on the server, in any way you like
[04:43:08] <ChrisMorgan> Peach: backticks, backticks.
[04:43:10] <eddyb> Peach: it needs `
[04:43:18] <eddyb> so wtf is \(...)?
[04:43:26] <Peach> Does rust have string templates?
[04:43:42] <eddyb> no
[04:43:45] <scott> It's normally called string interpolation
[04:43:50] <blueridanus> println!("{}", 2) is what we have AFAIK?
[04:47:12] <Peach> Hey,
[04:47:19] <Peach> help me solve the halting problem
[04:48:25] <Peach> Or, more realistically - help me detect some infinite loops
[04:48:39] <c74d> eddyb: hm, 'k. I think I'd choose compiling the scripts AOT, were I to use that
[04:48:56] <Peach> obviously while(true) {}  without any break loops forever
[04:49:11] <Peach> is there any algorithm to partially detect code that will loop forever?
[04:49:21] <c74d> but at present, I doubt I'd put enough logic into JavaScript that I'd feel that worthwile
[04:49:28] <scott> There's probably infinite different algorithms that'll catch "some" loops.
[04:49:33] <c74d> Peach: talk to the Idris, Coq, Agda people
[04:49:48] <scott> If you want to catch all loops, you also have to deny stuff that doesn't loop. It's just impossible to be perfect.
[04:51:31] <scott> At best you can basically make an algorithm that decides "this loops", "this doesn't loop", or "I can't tell" and then you can decide what to do when you can't tell.
[04:51:45] <c74d> Peach: there are definitely programming languages that prevent infinite loops, such as those three, without banning looping/recursion altogether.
[04:53:15] <scott> Yeah, those three restrict code so it's easy to tell that every program doesn't loop. But it makes it impossible to do some complicated things that the programmer can tell won't go forever but the compiler can't figure out.

[05:15:05] <Peach> there's really poor standardization of math
[05:15:24] <Peach> there's no clean directory of well implemented math programs in C
[05:15:45] <Peach> I want standardization of high level math algorithms open source and everywhere
[05:17:44] <genbattle> "I want"
[05:17:56] <leftylink> NEW PUN on www.mondaypunday.com
[05:18:45] <Skyler> leftylink: that's the first one of these that I've gotten
[05:19:26] <Skyler> always so frustrated that there's not an open directory of answers
[05:19:57] <Skyler> Peach: math algorithms like what?
[05:20:12] <leftylink> 🎉
[05:20:53] <Peach> Skyler:  something like: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh_parameterization
[05:21:33] <Peach> I should say, that there needs to be a collection of well known algorithms that are easily accessible for anyone
[05:21:38] <Peach> especially for simpler math
[05:22:29] <Skyler> ah yeah the scope would have to be smaller than "math algorithms" certainly
[05:23:37] <Skyler> I'm awful at applying math though, so I would love a well documented math standard :)
[05:25:11] <Peach> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_mathematics_topics
[05:25:19] <Peach> ^That is quite broad but still
[05:27:21] <Skyler> I'll take the first half, you'll take the second
[05:27:54] <blueridanus> Peach: a library or a collection of algorithms?
[05:28:06] <blueridanus> The difference being implementation vs pseudocode
[05:28:18] <Peach> blueridanus:  code snippets that actually compile
[05:28:35] <blueridanus> I just thought and had an idea.
[05:28:41] <blueridanus> What about a wiki?
[05:28:59] <Peach> That's good! Now we need to add more github-y things to that though
[05:28:59] <whipsch> [Lag: 38755.789]
[05:30:01] <blueridanus> whipsch: How high are you orbiting?
[05:30:13] <Peach> playbot: let x = 5;  let mut v = Vec::new(); if (x > 5) { v.push("hello"); }
[05:30:15] -playbot- <anon>:9:48: 9:55 warning: unnecessary parentheses around `if` condition, #[warn(unused_parens)] on by default
[05:30:15] -playbot- <anon>:9         let x = 5;  let mut v = Vec::new(); if (x > 5) { v.push("hello"); }
[05:30:15] -playbot- output truncated; full output at: http://bit.ly/1fWWfYE
[05:30:27] <niconii> ~11 hour lag would be pretty impressive...
[05:30:33] <Peach> let x = 5;  let mut v = Vec::new(); if x > 5 { v.push("hello"); }
[05:30:37] <c74d> Peach: a <https://*.github.io> website whose pages are edited by submitting pull requests against the underlying GitHub repository?
[05:30:42] <whipsch> more like 11 hours without power :)
[05:30:45] <whipsch> or however long its been
[05:30:51] <whipsch> im not sure anymore
[05:31:06] <blueridanus> c74d: I'd rather have a wiki
[05:31:19] <c74d> whipsch: Your computer stayed on for 11 hours?
[05:31:36] <Peach> blueridanus:  There needs to be a github project/wiki collection of ALL known CS algorithms, implemented cleanly enough to at least work
[05:31:38] <whipsch> closed lid
[05:31:47] <Peach> It would be a starting point for anyone
[05:31:48] <whipsch> i wish i had a ups that beefy though that would be sweet
[05:31:55] <Peach> and could always be improved
[05:32:21] <blueridanus> Peach: The nice thing about a wiki is that we could have implementations for multiple languages.
[05:32:29] <blueridanus> Pull requests are too slow
[05:32:53] <Peach> We really do need it blueridanus 
[05:32:57] <c74d> Rust was granting around ten PRs per day, last I checked.
[05:33:01] <Peach> We *could* just mod wikipedia
[05:33:09] <blueridanus> Mediawiki, you mean?
[05:33:13] <Skyler> I would only accept a wiki if it was tested automatically
[05:33:33] <Skyler> lots of wildly outdated code snippets out there
[05:33:37] <blueridanus> c74d: But is that quick enough for the scope of such a project?
[05:33:44] <Peach> I mean wikipedia wiki - it has a nice list of algorithms but not all areas contain psudeocode for complex cases
[05:34:05] <c74d> I'd think so. I doubt you'd get PRs near that fast.
[05:34:23] <Peach> I suppose a separate wiki would be better - we could at least start with wikipedia content and organize it better 
[05:34:40] <Peach> We can add more code and practical reserach history of algorithms
[05:35:42] <blueridanus> Hmm...
[05:35:56] <blueridanus> I'm liking the idea.
[05:35:57] <Peach> It should be structured: Overview(what algo does)  -  Example code(s) - History of algo - Then a mirror of PDF research papers
[05:36:09] <Peach> that would be the structure per page
[05:36:58] <Peach> We could add "theory behind algo" which would be a summary of what the research papers say
[05:37:04] <Skyler> bonus points if you could modify/execute example code
[05:37:25] <Peach> YES, it needs advanced visual code running
[05:37:47] <c74d> Like the Rust Playground?
[05:38:05] <Skyler> something like the playground or rustbyexample but with I/O capabilities
[05:38:17] <blueridanus> Well, it needs to support multiple languages
[05:38:18] <Skyler> if not just stdin/out, maybe a simple graphics API
[05:38:32] <Skyler> yeah, it would be a cool project blueridanus
[05:38:33] <c74d> I/O capabilities?
[05:38:34] <whipsch> like ideone?
[05:38:38] <blueridanus> If it's supporting just one, it's useless and we might as well do it in pseudocode
[05:38:43] <Peach> It NEEDS graphics Skyler 
[05:38:50] <blueridanus> I can do graphics, definitely.
[05:38:55] <blueridanus> I do web design/development.
[05:39:01] <blueridanus> I'm up for the project.
[05:39:02] <Peach> like webgl - especially cause graphics programming is gonna be a major part of explaining theory
[05:39:11] <Peach> wow blueridanus that would be epic
[05:39:12] <c74d> More than just displaying the result of the computation?
[05:39:17] <blueridanus> Hey!
[05:39:20] <Skyler> c74d: yeah, graphical results etc
[05:39:21] <blueridanus> Awesome idea
[05:39:47] <Skyler> the example code would be executed on a server, graphics/text I/O would be piped to the browser via websocket
[05:39:51] <blueridanus> What if important enough pages that got enough collaboration had visualizations like this:
[05:39:51] <blueridanus> https://jackschaedler.github.io/circles-sines-signals/dft_introduction.html
[05:40:20] <blueridanus> And this:
[05:40:20] <blueridanus> http://bost.ocks.org/mike/algorithms/
[05:40:24] <Peach> we would need space to host it though, and I have no idea how that would work
[05:41:01] <Peach> What would be a good name? It's more than just CS wiki or algo wiki - it's all about practical application 
[05:41:56] <blueridanus> I'm too bad with names to think of one right now.
[05:41:57] <c74d> Atlantic.net has VPSs for $0.99/month
[05:41:58] <Peach> So while wiki is focused more on just theory explanation, this project would be focused on concrete working code along with the theory and scientific publication
[05:42:09] *** Quits: dpc (dpc@moz-t6gr4b.ca.comcast.net) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[05:42:09] <Peach> *official wikipedia
[05:42:23] <blueridanus> c74d: at that price, donations may as well be enough
[05:42:39] <Skyler> could you offload the theory stuff to wikipedia?
[05:43:21] <c74d> Math Subprogram Implementation Wiki
[05:43:38] <Skyler> scrape updates to the Theory section of each subject from wikipedia daily
[05:43:43] <blueridanus> But only math? And wow, that's a large name.
[05:43:43] <Skyler> from the Theory section*
[05:46:19] <c74d> What if there is no Theory section?
[05:46:27] <c74d> E.g., <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_computing_square_roots>
[05:46:53] <blueridanus> c74d: This assumes the wiki focuses not just on implementations.
[05:46:59] <blueridanus> Should it focus only on implementations?
[05:47:12] <blueridanus> I like the idea of teaching how to implement, and nice visualizations
[05:47:22] <blueridanus> But that might make the project too broad
[05:47:37] <blueridanus> But, at the same time: maybe not?
[05:48:06] <blueridanus> The original idea was a resource for programmers who need math algorithms in their code.
[05:48:50] <c74d> Programmer's Guide to Mathematical Algorithms
[05:49:12] <c74d> (I like long, bland, descriptive names, yes)
[05:49:14] <Peach> It should be slightly more than math - you'd want to extend it graphics programming
[05:49:39] <Peach> cause that's a major thing that needs some standardization of all the rendering techniques on modern hardware
[05:49:49] <Peach> So it's a collection of algorithms
[05:49:55] <blueridanus> "Programmer's Guide" does not focus enough on the "database of algorithm implementation" aspects
[05:50:28] <Peach> So sorting, math theory, graphics programming, focus is on implementation
[05:50:38] <Peach> every page has an implementation of what the title is
[05:50:54] <Peach> so Implementationwiki ?
[05:50:58] <blueridanus> Hmm...
[05:51:03] <blueridanus> Only implementations?
[05:51:17] <blueridanus> What about a page that's like "Sorting Algorithms"
[05:51:25] <Peach> Yes
[05:51:43] <Peach> Sorting algorithms - and then pages for each with an implementation
[05:51:55] <Peach> so quick sort, naive sort etc.
[05:52:06] <blueridanus> I'm thinking of something that's primarily a database of implementations
[05:52:10] <Peach> Yes
[05:52:12] <c74d> "Peach Algorithm Wiki"?
[05:52:36] <blueridanus> But at the same time, not only that, wikibook-esque guides for topics that get more coverage
[05:52:58] <c74d> It seems like a fairly broad remit...
[05:52:59] <Peach> that's exactly what I'm thinking blueridanus 
[05:53:06] <c74d> "Peach Pattern Repository" (joking)
[05:53:07] <blueridanus> I'm not sure on that idea though. 
[05:53:42] <Peach> blueridanus: I'm thinking that the style would be explaination, not really a guide/tutorial
[05:54:17] <Peach> so: "here's what this code is used for", "here's the code", "here's how it works",
[05:54:20] <blueridanus> The domain algorithms.info seems to be avaible
[05:54:33] <blueridanus> available*
[05:54:34] <Peach> "here's scientific research papers and explainations"
[05:54:42] <Peach> blueridanus: that sounds hot
[05:55:19] <Peach> wait I just used the link and it says it's registered blueridanus 
[05:55:28] <Peach> but algorithms.info is *excellent*
[05:55:43] <c74d> Google Domains shows it as taken for me.
[05:56:03] <c74d> (along with algorithms.{com,net,org})
[05:56:03] <blueridanus> Oh, it seems to be actually on auction
[05:57:02] <Peach> blueridanus: theory2code.com?
[05:57:19] <Peach> from theory to working code
[05:58:08] <Peach> blueridanus: algo2code.org
[05:58:13] <Peach> That sounds nice
[05:58:26] <Peach> from algorithm 2 working code
[05:58:30] <Peach> how about that?
[05:59:21] <blueridanus> Hmm. It's an option. I'm currently looking at a list of TLDs for some cool domain hacks
[05:59:49] <Peach> Also blueridanus , you know how a lot of blogs explain various theory very nicely and often give code, it would be similar to that - an organized place with a down to earth explanation and working code
[06:00:19] <blueridanus> Peach: Did you take a look at the URLs I pasted here? I was thinking visualizations like these would be nice
[06:00:52] <Peach> Oh yes beautiful
[06:01:01] <whipsch> algorit.hm sadly taken
[06:02:34] <Peach> Every page should have animated examples when possible
[06:02:42] <Peach> make everything nice and visual
[06:02:46] <Peach> blueridanus: algorithm2code.org  ?
[06:03:43] <blueridanus> algorith.ms seens to be taken as well
[06:03:45] <blueridanus> :(
[06:03:49] <Peach> algorithms.code ?
[06:04:13] <Peach> how about algorithms.code blueridanus  ?
[06:04:20] <blueridanus> .code is a TLD?
[06:04:32] <Skyler> .everything is a .tld
[06:04:50] <blueridanus> Skyler: Not enough TLDs :p
[06:05:10] <blueridanus> And I can't do a cool domain hack with my name because .va is reserved for vatican stuff
[06:05:28] <whipsch> get something that doesnt make much sense, like algorithm.boutique or .kiwi
[06:05:34] <whipsch> my personal favorite is .fish
[06:05:38] <blueridanus> algorithm.guru?
[06:05:47] <Peach> I'd take it blueridanus 
[06:05:59] <Peach> we can't do "algorithms.code" why blueridanus ?
[06:06:22] <whipsch> i believe it's actually .codes
[06:06:32] <blueridanus> I know .codes
[06:06:39] <blueridanus> .code I have never heard of
[06:07:18] <Peach> blueridanus: we can do algorithms.guru
[06:07:44] <niconii> .codes? seems odd for that to exist and not .code
[06:07:58] <blueridanus> niconii: .codes is for something like
[06:08:01] <blueridanus> niconii.codes
[06:08:05] <blueridanus> For devs.
[06:08:17] <blueridanus> Peach: Let me see if it's available
[06:08:21] <niconii> ahh
[06:09:08] <blueridanus> algorithm.guru is taken
[06:09:17] <Peach> blueridanus algorithm.codes ?
[06:09:23] <Peach> is that unusable
[06:09:24] <Peach> ?
[06:09:41] <blueridanus> algorithm.codes is a bit weird, isn't it?
[06:11:30] <Peach> well, it's more clear what it is
[06:11:43] <Peach> It's source code(s) of algorithms
[06:11:43] <Peach> :P
[06:13:20] <Peach> so blueridanus , if you ever get a domain; how do you think you can setup the website to work?
[06:13:27] <blueridanus> findingdomainnames.sucks
[06:13:32] <blueridanus> (yes. that is a TLD)
[06:13:42] <blueridanus> Peach: What do you mean?
[06:13:56] <Peach> It would be so cool if we can incorporate fancy running code snippets
[06:14:08] <Peach> and storing PDFS of scientific papers
[06:14:17] <blueridanus> Storing? Why storing?
[06:14:23] <Peach> (cause I hate when wikis have dead links)
[06:14:26] <Peach> but we don't have to

[06:17:14] *** Joins: perillamint (perillamint@moz-pvo.3mu.72.61.IP)
[06:17:15] <blueridanus> Whatever language people decide to collaborate implementations for
[06:17:20] <Peach> Also it's super cool to have adjacent snippets between languages :3
[06:17:26] <Peach> and cool
[06:17:46] <blueridanus> We might only be able to make only some of them editable/runnable
[06:17:51] <blueridanus> But it's good enough.
[06:18:28] <Peach> So, I have no idea how websites and domains work, are you like doing everything manually blueridanus ? Cause usually people go through some web site creating companies and what not
[06:18:56] <blueridanus> You are familiar with github, right?
[06:19:07] <blueridanus> You can just do it through github
[06:19:23] <blueridanus> It's the easiest way for a project that's going to use github anyways and benefit on collaboration.
[06:20:40] <blueridanus> But I do have familiarity with doing it manually if it's needed

[06:23:17] <Peach> how much non trivial math/cs theory do you know blueridanus ?
[06:23:34] <blueridanus> Not much. :P
[06:24:43] <blueridanus> Just putting it on github is enough to get collaboration, if the project's interesting enough.
[06:25:45] <Peach> github is so big, how does anything even get attention
[06:26:01] <Peach> well maybe through this channel and/or #rust I suppose
[06:26:46] <niconii> or if someone searches for something they want and it happens to turn up
[06:26:59] <blueridanus> ^ which is how I find mostly everything anyways
[06:32:26] <blueridanus> Anyways, I have switched to PMs as I feel kinda bad for flooding the chat. If anyone is interested in helping, message me or Peach. :p
[06:36:50] <Skyler> Peach: I think you'd get collaborators easily if you first develop the infrastructure and a handful of topics/algorithms to start with
[06:37:04] <Peach> Yes
[06:37:26] <Skyler> I'd be interested in casually contributing code
[06:37:40] <Skyler> (infrastructure code, I'm awful at math)
[06:37:43] <blueridanus> Would you be interested if there was a github repo right now?
[06:37:52] <Skyler> yeah
[06:43:11] <blueridanus> Skyler: for future reference: https://github.com/blueridanus/algorithmwiki
[06:43:12] <blueridanus> :p
[06:43:33] <Skyler> cool, following
[06:52:10] <Peach> guys
[06:52:20] <Peach> I'm trying to think of a killer new github name
[06:53:08] <blueridanus> killerpeach
[06:53:36] <Skyler> oxXO_PEACH_OXxo
[06:53:59] <blueridanus> Not enough leetspeak.
[06:54:17] <blueridanus> oxX0_P3ACH_0Xxo
[06:57:49] <Peach> hmmmmmmmmmm
[07:00:07] <Peach> I'm really just deciding on a name
[07:00:13] <Peach> I still can't decide
[07:00:49] <Peach> I did it
[07:00:56] <Peach> I am Peach1
[07:01:53] <Peach> Github is so pretty
[07:02:03] <Peach> Oh my
[07:02:07] <Peach> it's 3AM
[07:02:22] <blueridanus> The "1" is a nice touch
[07:02:26] <Peach> Really? :D
[07:03:23] <blueridanus> Well...
[07:03:27] <blueridanus> :P
[07:10:34] <Peach> ?? WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN D:
[07:26:04] <ChrisMorgan> Peach1 sounds like the password of someone who wanted their password to be “peach” but something had requirements like a capital letter and a number.
[07:26:20] <Peach> :P
[07:26:30] <ChrisMorgan> … and so >95% of people just capitalise the first letter and append 1.
[07:26:44] <ChrisMorgan> Seriously, most people do, though I’m not certain of the percentages.
[07:26:56] <blueridanus> Well, obviously, because it's annoying.
[07:27:24] <ChrisMorgan> And that, in turn, voids the whole purpose of the thing in the first place.
[07:27:42] <fkaa> morning
[07:27:46] <fkaa> nom is awesome
[07:28:07] <blueridanus> Not my fault they can't allow horsebatterystaple because there's no capital letters or numbers
[07:29:03] <Peach> It would be far more secure to have pass phrases instead of requiring this symbol nonsense
[07:29:46] <Peach> because 15 or more letters takes YEARS to guess with even a super fast GPU setup
[07:30:13] <blueridanus> Peach: That assumes the brute force is dumb.
[07:30:33] <Peach> :P

[07:32:00] <blueridanus> I would prefer if passwords were managed.
[07:32:18] <Peach> Yeah
[07:32:34] <Peach> just generate a 256 length password
[07:32:37] <ChrisMorgan> Hypothesis: a password of one UTF-8 character, U+2014 EM DASH, is probably not going to be broken by crackers. I really need to test that at some point.
[07:32:41] <Peach> and have the PC remember it :P
[07:32:47] <Peach> Oh, unicode
[07:32:49] <Peach> OH WAIT
[07:32:51] <Peach> EMJOI
[07:33:01] <Peach> That would make everything so much more secure
[07:33:01] <ChrisMorgan> I normally use 100-character random passwords.
[07:33:12] <Peach> mypassword(lovesign)
[07:33:17] <blueridanus> Emoji passphrases
[07:33:18] <Peach> that would be super secure
[07:33:24] <blueridanus> Emoji passphrases must be secure as hell.
[07:33:42] <ChrisMorgan> But I always have to check the maxlength of password fields, though, because far too often you come across sites with maxlength set.
[07:33:43] <Peach> someone needs to do it right now
[07:34:09] <JustAPerson> just pick a couple random emoji and you've got far more entropy than the usual password 
[07:34:10] <ChrisMorgan> I came across one that had maxlength of 50 or 60 on register, and 30 on login. I wonder if they ever fixed it when I reported it to them?
[07:34:56] <ChrisMorgan> MailChimp is the only one that’s handled maxlength properly: it sets maxlength to 51, and if you put in more than 50 characters validation fails saying it can only be 50 characters.
[07:35:21] <ChrisMorgan> *That* is the sort of level of care one should take with such things.
[07:35:43] <blueridanus> I find maxlength in most websites way too short.
[07:36:59] <blueridanus> It's only saving you some bytes, really, I don't see the purpose.
[07:37:08] <Peach> So like
[07:37:17] <ChrisMorgan> Frankly I don’t see why it should be less than 1000 ever. But if you *are* going to do it, MailChimp demonstrates how to do it properly.
[07:37:20] <Peach> Unreal engine source code is poorly organized
[07:37:35] <Peach> Unreal engine 4 uses Csharp and complex build setups
[07:37:39] <Peach> I think that's so dumb
[07:37:47] <ChrisMorgan> Django and Rails both had trivial DoS attacks on massive password submissions a couple of years back.
[07:38:10] <ChrisMorgan> (Hashing is, of course, expensive.)
[07:38:54] <blueridanus> Uh, so someone just sent in a massive password and the server choked trying to hash it?
[07:39:18] <fmtq> yus
[07:41:46] <XMPPwocky> Peach: i wanted to take a look at unreal's security stuff
[07:41:53] <XMPPwocky> see how it compares to Source
[07:42:16] <Peach> unreal crashes so much - maybe it improved
[07:42:29] <Peach> but it crashed so much when I first tried it

[16:16:55] <Tiffany> for example, you could use a peer to peer network to manage credit scores, and have transactions simply be receipts signed by the account holder
[16:18:24] <Tiffany> I spent some time thinking about debt-based cryptocurrency systems rather than credit-based ones
[16:18:32] <Tiffany> after reading accelerando, and wondering how the hell economics 2.0 could work
[16:18:51] <Tiffany> eddyb: what did you think about economics 2.0?

[16:19:48] <ytain> http://www.lietaer.com/2010/03/the-worgl-experiment/
[16:20:01] <Tiffany> a debt-based crypto currency would line up with the letter of how economics 2.0 is described to work, but it's not exactly outside the grasp of humans

[16:20:37] <eddyb> Tiffany: hmm
[16:20:44] <eddyb> Tiffany: what about HFT?
[16:20:54] <Tiffany> well
[16:20:58] <Tiffany> HFT is understandable by humans
[16:21:00] <Tiffany> but not in real time..
[16:21:15] <Tiffany> it usually takes years to investigate the causes of flash crashes
[16:21:28] <Tiffany> although you can usually guess what happened pretty quickly
[16:21:40] <Tiffany> one of the recent ones was pretty funny
[16:21:43] <eddyb> I'm trying to remember if economics 2.0 could be just sped up trading
[16:21:56] <Tiffany> HFT bots created and popped their own bubble in teasurey futures in the space of about 10 minutes
[16:22:32] <Tiffany> there was something or other about it getting rid of the intermediary that is money, eddyb
[16:22:36] <Tiffany> so presumably they trade debts directly
[16:22:38] <eddyb> I guess if you took HFT and instead of using it for optimizing individual gain in futures
[16:23:06] <eddyb> you used it for optimizing market friction
[16:23:08] <eddyb> Tiffany: yeah
[16:23:14] <eddyb> *optimizing away
[16:23:38] <eddyb> idk
[16:24:04] <eddyb> ask me in a few years, when I (hopefully) will have learned more about real-world economics

[16:37:26] <eddyb> btw, the math exam today https://i.imgur.com/nN0yRGI.jpg
[16:38:06] <eddyb> it was pretty easy, except for a few bits
[16:38:14] <Tiffany> astraea: the idea is that autonomous corporations became the majority participant in the economic system, so they replaced it with one which is more efficient for themselves

[16:39:44] <eddyb> this is someone remembering what everything was :P
[16:40:08] <eddyb> scott: does that work for arbitrary values?
[16:40:34] <scott> It does even though it doesn't really make much sense.
[16:40:35] <eddyb> -x⁺ looks weird
[16:40:38] <Astraea> oh man
[16:40:53] <Astraea> I thought 9 was going to get into complex analysis territory
[16:40:56] <eddyb> whereas y -> -x, y > -x is more verbose by okay-ish
[16:40:58] <Astraea> hurray, it did not

[16:41:33] <Astraea> that's not entirely true
[16:41:46] <eddyb> 14 is evil, in a weird way

[16:42:43] <eddyb> well, we used to, 13th century or something
[16:42:51] <scott> I see, I see
[16:43:07] <eddyb> but the Romanian there was more different than the Romanian today, than Shakespear English is different from the English today
[16:43:11] <Astraea> to be fair, I know nothing about your area either, eddyb 
[16:43:13] <scott> Hmm, Romania is not as far east as it was in my mind.

[16:44:59] <Astraea> the US is horrible! heh
[16:45:05] <Astraea> I mean, I took calculus in high school
[16:45:05] <Tiffany> instead of like middle english or whatever shakespear is
[16:45:08] <Astraea> but it wasn't required
[16:45:18] <eddyb> Tiffany: possibly. also from the same age
[16:45:24] <niconii> shakespeare is classified as modern english
[16:45:38] <scott> I self-taught calculus in high school since there was low demand (small town school), but I took exams from a teacher and got credit.
[16:45:39] <eddyb> Tiffany: related to a nasty rape case here, someone dug up some laws from the middle ages
[16:45:51] <Tiffany> oh boy
[16:46:02] <eddyb> Tiffany: the phrase structure and connectors you could guess pretty easily
[16:46:04] <niconii> middle english is completely unintelligible to a modern english speaker
[16:46:08] <Tiffany> it might be a good idea for laws to have uh expiration dates
[16:46:14] <scott> Yeah, English changed a lot.
[16:46:24] <niconii> well maybe not completely, but
[16:46:35] <eddyb> but then any non-trivial word is going to be very different
[16:46:37] <niconii> still a lot harder than shakespearean
[16:46:43] <scott> Is Middle English pre-Norman influence?
[16:46:57] <ytain> middle english originated more from the dutch language at that time
[16:47:27] <eddyb> can't find it though :/
[16:47:37] <niconii> yeah, more specifically, shakespeare wrote in "early modern english"

[16:48:17] <eddyb> actually, nevermind, I forgot since a few hours ago, when I read it
[16:48:21] <Astraea> scott: my graduating class in high school was 84 people (out of... 120 or so)
[16:48:25] <Astraea> and they offered calculus
[16:48:30] <Astraea> how small was your school? heh
[16:48:42] <scott> grades 6-12 roughly 300 students
[16:48:43] <eddyb> the weird part is "shtrumeleagul invartoshat" for "dick"
[16:49:02] <Astraea> oh
[16:49:04] <Astraea> huh...
[16:49:04] <eddyb> it's not only archaic, but... strange
[16:49:12] <Tiffany> English and Frisian are almost mutually intelligible
[16:49:16] <Tiffany> they split in like the middle ages
[16:49:19] <eddyb> like "twisted stick"
[16:50:09] <eddyb> "aruncarea lui la retze" lel they were cutting rapist dicks and throwing them at ducks
[16:50:50] <scott> eddyb: Looking at that tweet is interesting. I'm not sure how well I would have been able to place that language without knowing. It looks maybe a bit greek or latin-y, but with some things that definitely set it apart (like the J's and stuff).
[16:50:59] <scott> I'd like to think I would at least guess Balkans
[16:51:04] <eddyb> it's funnier because the modern form is "rațe", so "retze" is like lel is to lol. also, tz?
[16:51:10] <Astraea> ... what
[16:51:12] <eddyb> scott: tweet?
[16:51:15] <Astraea> that sounds horrible
[16:51:23] <scott> eddyb: Err, facebook post
[16:51:51] <eddyb> scott: romance language, so yeah, latin counts
[16:51:57] <Tiffany> yeah I was going to say
[16:52:09] <Tiffany> it looks like a romance language but I don't think I would be able to specifically tell it from other romance languages
[16:52:17] <eddyb> 1750 isn't that long ago
[16:52:22] <eddyb> Tiffany: it's not mainstream :P
[16:52:26] <scott> I know the western romance languages, so I could at least rule them out
[16:52:36] <scott> I mean, I can recognize them
[16:53:06] <eddyb> I can tell apart Portugese/Spannish/Catalan from Italian and from French. and Italian from French, ofc
[16:53:17] <eddyb> *Spanish?
[16:53:24] <scott> Yeah, Spanish
[16:53:32] <eddyb> I'm not sure I can tell apart Portuege from Spanish though

[16:54:38] <scott> Then I can't tell Brazil from other SA countries
[16:54:45] <eddyb> if you can recognize Spanish, Italian and French, Romanian is easy
[16:55:18] <eddyb> it's romance but without any of the previous language's distinguishing features
[16:55:36] <eddyb> also, diacritics (ă, â, î, ș, ț)

[16:56:47] <eddyb> that's French

[16:56:58] <Tiffany> what about į?

[16:57:14] <eddyb> (not sure what it is on this font)
[16:57:23] <Tiffany> it's an i with a , underneath
[16:57:36] <Tiffany> it's weird because it's attached
[16:57:53] <eddyb> so at 1750 they had a better stance on rape in Romania than they do right now in the west, FSVO "better"
[16:58:09] <Tiffany> uhh...

[17:07:51] <eddyb> it's like high-security detainment facilities were a thing
[17:07:52] <Tiffany> a lot of laws used to be more to serve to harm the assailant as much as the assailant harmed the victim
[17:07:59] <Tiffany> modern law is mostly designed to stop people from doing bad things
[17:08:07] <Tiffany> either the first time, or from doing it again
[17:08:26] <eddyb> you could consider the modern version of the law to be leaning towards victim-blaming
[17:08:27] <scott> > The guillotine remained the official method of execution in France until the death penalty was abolished in 1981.[2] The final three guillotinings in France before abolition were those of child-murderers Christian Ranucci on 28 July 1976 in Marseille and Jérôme Carrein on 23 June 1977 in Douai, and torturer-murderer Hamida Djandoubi on 10 September 1977
[17:08:27] <scott> in Marseille.
[17:08:43] <Tiffany> well, not all old law was like that though
[17:08:53] <Astraea> somewhat depends on what legal system we're talking about, eddyb 
[17:09:04] <Tiffany> iirc in the bible it says that a rapist has to pay the victim's father some silver to marry her

[17:09:52] <scott> dowry exists with regular non-rape marriages
[17:10:02] <eddyb> I mean, that's what he had to pay
[17:10:06] <Tiffany> I don't think dowry is the right thing
[17:10:18] <Tiffany>      2. The money, goods, or estate, which a woman brings to her
[17:10:18] <Tiffany>         husband in marriage; a bride's portion on her marriage.

[17:11:24] <eddyb> I'm pretty sure it applied whether or not the premarital sex was consensual. or maybe it was applied only if it was consensual? idk

[17:12:51] <Astraea> well weren't women considered assets back then?
[17:13:04] <eddyb> oh
[17:13:11] <eddyb> Tiffany: you were talking about the deutoronomy text
[17:13:17] <eddyb> which mentions silver
[17:13:20] <Tiffany> yeah
[17:13:20] *** Joins: Murarth (Murarth@moz-hkku5g.dyn.nltelcom.net)
[17:13:27] <Tiffany> and yeah they were astraea
[17:13:29] <Tiffany> or close enough, anyway
[17:13:32] <eddyb> I was not aware of that one, just the exodus one
[17:13:34] <scott> Women were essentially sold from father to husband
[17:13:48] <Tiffany> yeah
[17:13:50] <scott> Current western marriage ceremonies still kind of echo that
[17:14:14] <eddyb> judaic law is a bit hard to interpret. at least in the Romanian translation of the Bible
[17:14:27] <Tiffany> western marriage ceremonies aren't my kind of thing
[17:14:40] <eddyb> you have "whoring" and (modifier)-"whoring"
[17:14:51] <eddyb> and it just means nothing
[17:15:09] <Astraea> marriage in general is (apparently) not my kind of thing, heh
[17:15:11] <scott> They make me a bit uncomfortable, but I think most people I know never think very hard about it
[17:15:24] <eddyb> I've been saying marriage is a religious institution and it should be left at that
[17:15:35] <eddyb> every time marriage equality comes up
[17:15:42] <Astraea> scott: why would they make you uncomfortable?
[17:15:42] <Tiffany> yeah but eddyb
[17:15:42] <Tiffany> it'
[17:15:45] <Tiffany> s more than just religious
[17:15:48] <Tiffany> it's also a legal union
[17:15:50] <Tiffany> and gives certain rights
[17:15:59] <Tiffany> I think the two concepts should be divorced
[17:16:00] <eddyb> IIRC UK solved that through civil partnership
[17:16:03] <eddyb> Tiffany: yupp
[17:16:07] <Tiffany> and that's what a lot of the "marriage is a religious institution" arguers miss
[17:16:10] <eddyb> just like religion and state should never mix
[17:16:12] <scott> Astraea: The whole "father giving away the bride to the husband" and other things along those lines
[17:16:18] <eddyb> Tiffany: oh lol
[17:16:22] <Tiffany> I've heard of civil partnerships
[17:16:27] <Tiffany> iirc they're a lot more limited than real marriage
[17:16:38] <eddyb> I thought there was no marriage left in UK law
[17:16:45] <Tiffany> I don't know about UK
[17:16:46] <eddyb> and civil partnership replaced it entirely
[17:16:50] <Tiffany> but I think the US had civil partnerships and they sucked
[17:16:55] <eddyb> my sources might be incorrect though
[17:16:56] <Astraea> scott: meh, our very existence is steeped in tradition, at this point most of it means nothing
[17:16:59] <eddyb> Tiffany: then they should fix it
[17:17:05] <Astraea> and if the participants don't even think about it then it holds no actual power
[17:17:23] <scott> Astraea: It's not a huge deal to me, it's more of just a subtle/subconscious thing
[17:17:56] <scott> The other thing is, people will get upset if you change the ceremony
[17:18:04] <scott> I don't care much for tradition.
[17:18:10] <Astraea> because it's tradition for traditions sake
[17:18:18] <eddyb> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thou_shalt_not_commit_adultery#In_Judaism
[17:18:22] <Astraea> I dunno, I have a weird outlook on life
[17:18:23] <eddyb> okay, this clears it up a bit
[17:18:23] <dfockler> The debate wasn't at all about the religious aspect of marriage, it was about the government giving married couples more rights
[17:18:27] <Astraea> I care very little what other people think
[17:19:01] <eddyb> dfockler: yupp
[17:19:14] <eddyb> dfockler: I'm saying there should be no other aspect of marriage other than the religious one
[17:19:23] <eddyb> purge traces of religious practices from law
[17:19:32] <Tiffany> okay
[17:19:37] <Tiffany> so eddyb
[17:19:44] <eddyb> write the law in Prolog or something while you're at it :P
[17:19:53] <Tiffany> it looks like some states had limited civil union, with less privileges than marriage
[17:19:57] <Tiffany> but others had it similar to marriage
[17:20:12] <eddyb> for all I know, marriage equality fixed that exact thing
[17:20:12] <Astraea> eddyb: I really wish we'd insert some technological advancements into law...
[17:20:15] <eddyb> but I'm not sure
[17:20:17] <Astraea> figuring out US law is just horrible
[17:20:20] <scott> I like the idea of computer formalized law but it's so far from what our current systems are (at least in the US and Canada)
[17:20:24] <dfockler> then we should get rid of tax benefits for churches, because they are classified as a public good
[17:20:31] <eddyb> dfockler: oh fuck yeah
[17:20:32] <scott> A lot of law is stored in court case decisions
[17:20:40] <eddyb> around here the situation is ridiculous
[17:20:50] <Tiffany> scott: maybe formalized law systems should include court decisions
[17:20:55] <Astraea> ^
[17:20:56] <eddyb> literal gold
[17:21:11] <Astraea> but whatever
[17:21:22] <Astraea> this sort of thing won't happen
[17:21:27] <scott> It would be interesting to see how to make a formalized system that allows for the kind of "up to interpretation in the courts" our current system does
[17:21:37] <Tiffany> I think the problem with formalized systems is that they're always black and white
[17:21:40] <Astraea> I mean maybe if some independent nation gets set up on the moon or mars where they can start fresh it will
[17:21:42] <dfockler> it would get you to court faster, but the circumstances around what happened are what defines how laws and sentencing works
[17:21:43] <Tiffany> when there's so much grey area
[17:21:44] <eddyb> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriarch_Daniel_of_Romania this guy
[17:21:49] <Tiffany> at least, I don't see how you could make them have grey area
[17:21:52] <Astraea> but existing systems are just too messy to switch over
[17:23:48] <dfockler> codified law wouldn't really help that much except for normal people that aren't lawyers to interpret the law
[17:24:09] <scott> eddyb: Romanian language has some pretty clean distribution lines: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_language#/media/File:Idioma_rumano.PNG

[17:27:01] <eddyb> I walked home from uni today, the sun's rays felt kinda therapeutic TBQH

[17:28:37] <Tiffany> in florida it stays 30C and really high humidity all night long
[17:28:44] <Astraea> ugh
[17:28:49] <Astraea> I was in Georgia last week, Tiffany 
[17:28:56] <Astraea> how do you live with high humidity?
[17:29:02] <Tiffany> by staying indoors
[17:29:02] <Astraea> it's ridiculous!
[17:29:08] <Tiffany> with large air conditioning units and fans
[17:29:12] <scott> Saskatchewan is hot in the summer and warm in the winter but doesn't swing wildly except from weather. And it's not humid.
[17:29:16] <Astraea> well I mostly stayed in doors
[17:29:23] <scott> Err. Cold in the winter, lol
[17:29:31] <Astraea> except when I was stuck outside after running afoul with johnny law
[17:30:08] <scott> Even Toronto is too humid for me. I couldn't stand the south.
[17:30:09] <dfockler> Where I live, it's hot in the summer, cold in the winter, and spring and fall are each 3 weeks long
[17:30:28] <Astraea> Colorado is pretty nice
[17:30:32] * Astraea shrugs
[17:30:34] <scott> Saskatchewan winter is like 7-8 months...
[17:30:53] <scott> Roughly September to March/April
[17:31:48] <scott> Maybe more like October-March. We do have some real autumn/spring.
[17:34:40] <Astraea> I still want to live in Seattle though
[17:34:50] <Astraea> or around that area
[17:34:58] <scott> Why?
[17:35:19] <scott> I'm interested in the pacific northwest but I'm not sure why
[17:35:19] <Tiffany> I want to live in seattle as well
[17:35:29] <Tiffany> it has nice weather, and it has tech industry
[17:35:35] <Astraea> I love the city, I love the weather, I love everything about it
[17:35:41] <Tiffany> I mean, there's silicon valley, but I keep hearing bad stuff about it lately
[17:35:50] <Astraea> I don't want to live in CA at all
[17:35:53] <Tiffany> expensive to live there, full of sexism(?)
[17:35:54] <Astraea> I've been there many times
[17:35:57] <Tiffany> plus there's really horrible weather
[17:36:06] <ytain> i barely tolerate Toronto because of humidity 
[17:36:10] <Astraea> mmm... dunno about it being full of sexism
[17:36:12] <Astraea> well
[17:36:18] <Astraea> I mean the bay area is really progressive
[17:36:22] <Tiffany> there's also california laws that I don't like
[17:36:28] <Tiffany> bay area isn't silicon valley though is it?
[17:36:31] <scott> I've had the same ideas mostly. Silicon valley sounds pretty crappy, but I'd like to live somewhere a bit techy
[17:36:39] <Tiffany> I guess if I wanted to live in california I would go to the bay area, but that's still california
[17:37:33] <Astraea> silicon valley is in the bay area
[17:37:35] <ytain> scott how about the triangle (Kitchener/Cambridge/Waterloo)?
[17:37:50] <dfockler> california has some pretty progressive laws, although it's been pretty republican as of late
[17:38:04] <scott> ytain: I lived/interned there 4 months last summer. I'm considered it as well. It'd be a lot easier, since I'm Canadian.
[17:38:19] <ytain> scott aha ok
[17:38:21] <scott> considering*
[17:38:44] <ytain> scott if you are able to drive a car you could consider, otherwise no
[17:38:46] <Tiffany> what do you mean by progressive laws?
[17:38:53] <scott> I do have a car right now.
[17:38:56] <Astraea> in fact I'd say seattle is less progressive than the bay area
[17:38:57] <Tiffany> all I ever hear about california is drought and gun bans
[17:39:14] <scott> I'd like to live somewhere where I didn't need a car, but that seems difficult in north america...
[17:39:22] <Astraea> they tend to not get as involved in gender/racism/etc debates
[17:39:37] <Astraea> scott: east coast
[17:39:42] <ytain> scott yeah, NA is notorious for not being pedestrian friendly
[17:39:46] <scott> I don't really like the east coast :p
[17:39:53] <Astraea> well...
[17:39:58] <Astraea> that's as good as it gets
[17:40:10] <scott> I've never been there, though.
[17:40:39] <Astraea> actually, I dunno if seattle is necessarily less progressive
[17:40:42] <Astraea> they're just... less vocal

[17:42:12] <Astraea> also, seattle isn't cheap either
[17:42:26] <Astraea> not nearly as bad as the bay area (or surrounding areas)

[17:44:20] <Tiffany> there's also the organic/natural food craze, which while being mostly based on chemophobia, does actually produce some stores which have fresh produce for reasonable prices
[17:44:25] <dfockler> Seattle and Portland are getting more expensive, although in Portland there are less companies who operate in the downtown area
[17:44:44] <Tiffany> that's not central to california though
[17:44:46] <Astraea> well I don't know about Portland
[17:44:57] <Astraea> but Seattle is already quite pricey
[17:45:13] <Astraea> it's worse than Colorado and Colorado is getting pretty bad
[17:45:23] <Astraea> $1250/mo for a studio apartment bad

[17:51:25] <Astraea> I had 3 one hour long phone interviews beforehand
[17:51:41] <Astraea> but yeah, I stayed in downtown seattle, all that stuff was paid for
[17:51:42] <dfockler> Amazon is kind of a sausage grinder from what I've heard

[17:58:18] <zofrex> secondly, hey US, think up some original place names, it's very confusing. signed, an englishman.
[17:58:32] <scott> Kitchener's original name was Berlin, so all three of those cities were named after European cities
[17:58:50] <zofrex> weird
[17:58:51] <Astraea> oh... so a denver omelette is just... an omelette...
[17:58:58] <scott> There's also a London nearby

[18:06:52] <Astraea> the wheel is always turning
[18:06:55] <Tiffany> and the implementation dependant behaviour is dictated unto other implementations by the original implementation

[18:06:59] <scott> Thanks matz
[18:07:02] <Tiffany> yeah
[18:07:21] <Tiffany> the alternative impls have tried to make ruby even have consistent behaviour, but the original impl is not interested
[18:07:34] <Tiffany> they basically have to be bug-compatible with the original impl
[18:07:36] <Tiffany> it's absurd
[18:08:23] <scott> Yeah, the rubyspec project even has special functions for handling behaviours that are just bugs in MRI

[18:11:07] <Tiffany> like, not only does this language have undefined behaviour (an interpreted high-level garbage collected language, with iterator invalidation! seriously!), but it has tests that check to make sure the undefined behaviour does something terrible
[18:11:23] <scott> Ah, so Brian finally gave up on rubyspec
[18:11:34] <scott> He used to try pretty hard to get matz and the other MRI devs to change their ways
[18:11:51] <scott> Rubinius is still the coolest Ruby implementation
[18:12:13] <Tiffany> does it fix all this garbage?
[18:12:15] <eddyb> Tiffany: is it just JS-like iterator invalidation or real UB?
[18:12:25] <Tiffany> what is JS-like iterator invalidation?
[18:12:35] <eddyb> or C-like, I guess, but C has pointers
[18:12:40] <eddyb> Tiffany: JS doesn't have iterators
[18:12:45] <eddyb> ba-dum-tsh
[18:12:56] <eddyb> Tiffany: you iterate arrays with integer indices
[18:12:59] <Tiffany> it's UB, but I don't know if it actually does anything particularly evil
[18:13:07] <scott> Tiffany: I don't know, but it's way funner to hack on. A huge amount of the code is just Ruby (it goes through some wild bootstrapping to make this happen), and the core is a pretty readable C++ VM
[18:13:16] <scott> MRI is lots of crazy C code
[18:13:27] <eddyb> so you get iterator invalidation, but it's harmless as far as memory safety goes
[18:14:03] <eddyb> and might actually work reasonably well in a few different scenarios
[18:15:22] <zofrex> Tiffany: I'm increasingly growing tired with ruby and things like this... we run a mix of JRuby and MRI and I constantly trip over tiny differences between the two
[18:16:09] <Tiffany> it looks like lua doesn't have problems with iterator invalidation (it has the high level equivalent, but not anything actually harmful)
[18:16:18] <Tiffany> if you use next() or pairs(), it will behave fine
[18:16:27] <Tiffany> if you use ipairs(), you'll end up skipping the element after the one you deleted
[18:16:51] <Tiffany> ipairs() with table.remove, that is
[18:16:56] <Tiffany> I don't think table.insert() is harmful
[18:17:22] <Tiffany> oh
[18:17:42] <Tiffany> ipairs will screw up if you insert or remove before the iterator position
[18:17:48] <Tiffany> next/pairs will always work
[18:17:57] <Tiffany> (pairs is implemented in terms of next)
[18:18:13] <Tiffany> I imagine this isn't a big deal for managed languages either
[18:19:06] <Tiffany> according to matz: "It is undefined behavior of iterators if the block modifies iterating object.  It may crash or fall in to infinite loop."
[18:20:10] <scott> Gosh
[18:20:47] <Tiffany> the way lua handles iteration is actually kind of screwy
[18:20:52] <Tiffany> since it doesn't actually have arrays
[18:21:21] <Tiffany> the only really reliable way to iterate the elements of a table is to use next()
[18:21:45] <Tiffany> ipairs() is broken in more ways than behaving badly to table modifications
[18:22:04] <scott> ```irb(main):009:0> a = (1..10).to_a
[18:22:05] <scott> => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
[18:22:05] <scott> irb(main):010:0> a.map!{|x| a.clear if x == 5; x + 1 }
[18:22:05] <scott> => [nil, nil, nil, nil, 6]
[18:22:05] <scott> ```
[18:22:17] <scott> I totally pasted that as if this was Slack and not IRC.
[18:22:26] <scott> Anyway, I've never tried to break Ruby like that before
[18:22:33] <Tiffany> I wish IRC had slack features
[18:23:12] <Tiffany> I do not like slack though, because it's centralized, proprietary, and costs money

[18:55:02] <Peach> Basically it means that you can call     x.f();    when defining a global function that takes   the type of x as its parameter
[18:55:46] <Peach> so you define    openfile(file* f);

[19:20:32] <Peach> scott: I'm thinking from the perspective of reading someone else's code and the person who wrote it just wanted their code to compile
[19:20:46] <Peach> How hard it would be to know what's going in the code
[19:20:55] <Peach> when does the allocation of the vec take place?
[19:21:24] <scott> What do you mean by allocation?
[19:21:35] <scott> The Vec is created exactly when you say Vec::new()
[19:22:00] <Peach> Vector is allocated on the heap, isn't it? 
[19:22:11] <Peach> does the sizeof Vector depend on the elements it contains?
[19:22:23] <scott> Its data is. It stores a length, capacity, and data pointer on the stack.
[19:22:36] <scott> An empty Vec doesn't allocate any heap, too.
[19:22:46] <Peach> Oh true
[19:23:17] <niconii> nor does a vec of zero-sized types
[19:23:25] <niconii> vec
[19:23:28] <niconii> oops

[19:28:13] <niconii> does it still double or whatever when exceeded, even though it doesn't actually need to worry about reallocations?

[19:56:33] <Peach> I want everything to have a single header file option
[19:56:40] <Peach> Especially if it's math related things

[19:59:19] <scott> In C/C++, I'm always so loath to include a dependency, so I tend to reimplement stuff unless it's a lot of work. I think lots of people do that same, so a lot of effort is duplicated.

[19:59:31] <Peach> scott: YES
[19:59:36] <Peach> that is so true

[20:32:23] <Peach> i++ vs i+=1
[20:32:27] <niconii> Peach: one more if you eschew the space
[20:32:33] <Layl> Peach, obviously you should have any combination of punctuation be overloadable
[20:32:35] <scott> Weren't you the one suggesting int64 instead of i64? :p
[20:32:37] <eddyb> Peach: that's how you end up with Perl :P
[20:32:45] <Layl> want to add 2 to a value? x++++
[20:32:56] <scott> I prefer += 1 to ++ because it adds less complexity to the language.
[20:33:04] <scott> += is general, ++ is oddly specific.
[20:33:09] <huon> Peach: you may be interested in golfscript
[20:33:13] <huon> :P
[20:33:14] <Peach> No no
[20:33:15] <Layl> want to waste cpu cycles? x++--
[20:33:18] <niconii> Peach: actually, that's a good point, you're the one who wanted longer names for things because code is read more often than written, yes?
[20:33:35] <eddyb> Layl: doesn't --++x work in C?
[20:33:51] <scott> x++-- might work but --++x won't
[20:33:52] <Layl> no idea but I wouldn't be surprised
[20:33:53] <eddyb> I expect x++ to produce an rvalue
[20:33:55] <scott> ++x is an rvalue
[20:33:56] <Peach> niconii: Yes longer names especially if something is uncommonly used
[20:34:00] <scott> x++ is an lvalue
[20:34:02] <eddyb> WAT
[20:34:07] <eddyb> HOW
[20:34:11] <Peach> but for simpler constructs,
[20:34:14] <scott> wait, did I reverse that?
[20:34:17] <scott> :(
[20:34:18] <eddyb> scott: maybe :P
[20:34:22] <scott> too tired today
[20:34:24] <Tiffany> uh
[20:34:28] <Layl> C isn't about how, it's about how not
[20:34:29] <eddyb> ++x can give you access to the "current" state of x
[20:34:33] <eddyb> while x++ has to make a copy
[20:34:39] <scott> yeah, you're right
[20:34:45] <Tiffany> I don't think either is an lvalue
[20:34:50] <niconii> imo `+= 1` is clearer, and it means one less operator to learn
[20:34:52] <Tiffany> however
[20:34:53] <Peach> Guys I don't want golfscript, the prospect of the language is - minimal keystrokes, yet easy to read
[20:35:01] <Tiffany> derferencing a pointer can take an rvalue pointer and make an lvalue value
[20:35:07] <Tiffany> which is why *x++ is an lvalue
[20:35:09] <Tiffany> but x++ is not
[20:35:31] <Tiffany> if x++ was an lvalue, then (x++)++ would be valid syntax
[20:35:32] <niconii> C is hell
[20:35:33] <Tiffany> and it's not
[20:35:41] <eddyb> ++x might not be an lvalue due to sequence point hell
[20:35:49] <eddyb> in C, at least
[20:35:52] <Tiffany> the same with ++(++x)
[20:36:08] <eddyb> it should be valid in C++
[20:36:09] <Peach> In my language ++ is a statement, and there is no prefix ++
[20:36:11] <Tiffany> and yeah, sequence points are pretty screwy with ++s
[20:36:21] <scott> ++++x is accepted in cling (clang-based C++ repl)
[20:36:29] <Peach> That eliminates all confusion with ++/-- operator
[20:36:34] <scott> It's probably UB because of sequence points
[20:36:38] <Tiffany> is it actually a double increment?
[20:36:40] <scott> Yes
[20:36:43] <Tiffany> oh
[20:36:48] <Tiffany> so it's not +(+(++x))
[20:36:51] <eddyb> I'm pretty sure it's defined in C++
[20:36:58] <eddyb> due to overloading
[20:37:04] *** Quits: pczarn (piotr@moz-9un7t9.izacom.pl) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[20:37:15] <scott> It does have a sensible definition, I just don't trust it without confirmation
[20:37:20] <eddyb> http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/operator_incdec
[20:37:49] <Peach> I'm also removing exceptions in my language
[20:38:07] <eddyb> > pre-increment and pre-decrement operators increments or decrements the value of the object and returns a reference to the result.
[20:38:34] <Peach> I'm replacing exceptions with functions can return a  fail value MUST be handled in an if statement when used

[20:39:00] <eddyb> > Unlike C++ (and some implementations of C), the increment/decrement expressions are never themselves lvalues: &++a is invalid.
[20:39:15] <scott> Interesting
[20:39:47] <Tiffany> oh
[20:39:48] <eddyb> overloading operator++ is used in iterators
[20:39:51] <Tiffany> you're right eddyb
[20:39:57] <Tiffany> I forgot about operator++'s signature
[20:39:57] <eddyb> iterators couldn't work if that wasn't defined sanely in C++
[20:40:14] <eddyb> I guess they could use a regular method
[20:40:36] <eddyb> but that's not hell-^W C-ish enough
[20:40:43] <Tiffany> using a regular method is too nice
[20:40:58] <eddyb> :P
[20:41:08] <Tiffany> I think the idea was that operators would carry 'common' operations
[20:41:21] <Tiffany> and it wasn't until they started doing containers that they realized how horrible of an idea that was
[20:41:35] <Tiffany> I expect if iterators were introduced today, they would have named methods
[20:41:45] <Tiffany> or, at least
[20:41:48] <Tiffany> a named .next()
[20:41:56] <Tiffany> well
[20:41:58] <Tiffany> actually, maybe not
[20:42:02] <eddyb> returning optional<T> :P
[20:42:09] <Tiffany> since the idea with the iterator interface is to be syntax-compatible with using pointers
[20:42:50] <eddyb> riiight
[20:43:11] <eddyb> C++ iterators are a pair of range ends
[20:44:33] <eddyb> and you iterate using a cursor inside that range

[21:09:31] <scott> I think what I described above would work for 3D, too, except that part I handwaved that I don't fully understand
[21:09:32] <Astraea> you change your coordinate system, 3 points are always coplanar =P
[21:10:32] <eddyb> oh
[21:10:49] <eddyb> one thing that seems to work well: put an edge on the x axis

[21:27:17] <niconii> i just use git and the actual site
[21:27:28] <XMPPwocky> git commit -am "commit message here"; git push origin master
[21:27:40] <XMPPwocky> somebody else made  changes? git pull
[21:28:00] <XMPPwocky> if the merge fails, it'll tell you how to fix it; do that, and then commit again
[21:28:04] <fkaa> XMPPwocky: wrong, `git push -f origin master`
[21:28:07] <fkaa> >:)
[21:28:31] <Astraea> you're all evil and I disagree with you!
[21:28:47] <niconii> no no, obviously you rebase the entire history into one commit, *then* do a force push
[21:29:22] <Astraea> but in all honesty, git is very emblematic of what's wrong with a lot of projects
[21:29:24] <XMPPwocky> niconii: i once accidentally made a PR to rust with ~10,000 commits accidentally
[21:29:41] <XMPPwocky> niconii: git rebase: not even once
[21:29:41] <Astraea> it's a relatively simple concept bogged down in arcane incantations
[21:29:43] <niconii> XMPPwocky: oh geez
[21:29:52] <XMPPwocky> niconii: the pr did not get merged
[21:30:16] <niconii> i can't imagine why
[21:30:22] <scott> Astraea: idk, I found the incantations simple because I understand the simple concepts behind them mostly
[21:30:29] <scott> I find*
[21:30:39] <XMPPwocky> scott: they're simple but they're not consistent
[21:31:02] <XMPPwocky> it's like working on somebody else's computer with zsh all configured up and loads of "convienient" alienses for everything
[21:31:06] <XMPPwocky> aliases, evn
[21:31:18] <XMPPwocky> except for you, coming /in/ to this environment, you don't know where everything is
[21:31:30] <XMPPwocky> the person who actually made it probably has it all memorized,  but 
[21:32:23] <Astraea> not to mention there's multiple ways to do things
[21:32:30] <Astraea> and which is best always boils down to 'it depends'
[21:33:02] <Astraea> which a novice can't answer
[21:33:19] <XMPPwocky> stuff like "git pull == git fetch && git merge" makes sense once you hear about it, but you need to frontload a /lot/ of stuff before you can do anything besides cargo-culting command
[21:33:20] <scott> The learning curve can be pretty bad
[21:33:23] <XMPPwocky> commands/
[21:33:24] <Astraea> and I'm sure this isn't statistically true, but novices always choose the wrong path =P
[21:34:04] <eddyb> git pull --rebase pls
[21:34:30] <Diggsey> also, information about using git is REALLY bad - it tries to be simplistic, but in the process misses out all the actually important information you need
[21:34:41] <eddyb> also, git gui is very useful for the few things it does
[21:34:51] <scott> I learned git like I learn most things, in an erratic patchwork fashion
[21:35:04] <scott> I'm not sure if there are any really good books or tutorials
[21:35:37] <scott> But now I can go browsing through .git and that's my entire repo and I understand the vast majority of it
[21:35:39] <Astraea> in all honestly I know it well enough to use it, but the stuff that I don't know could probably fill a book
[21:36:29] <scott> Maybe I should learn mercurial for comparison
[21:37:20] <scott> My current VCS experience amounts to git=good, everything else=frustrating
[21:38:33] <Peach> In git terminolgy, what is "tracking"
[21:38:34] <Diggsey> I haven't used mercurial, although I think it's supposed to be better with binary files than git
[21:38:40] <Peach> or "track"
[21:39:07] <Peach> I'm about to push a change, an my Git UI offers a "Track?" checkbox
[21:39:20] <Diggsey> which GUI is it?
[21:39:36] <Peach> source tree, does it matter?
[21:39:49] <scott> Peach: When your local branch is tracking the remote branch (on github's server), then pulling will automatically pull the changes from github and pushing will push the changes to github
[21:40:46] <scott> I always have master (the default branch, and the only one if you don't make any yourself) track the remote master branch
[21:40:52] <Peach> scott: that sounds like what I want, are they any cases where someone wouldn't want to use "track" ?
[21:41:07] <Diggsey> sometimes there is no remote branch, if you're just working locally
[21:41:15] <scott> I might consider not tracking an experimental branch I don't want to push to github yet
[21:41:25] <Astraea> scott: I started out with cvs/svn
[21:41:29] <Astraea> MISERABLE
[21:41:47] <Peach> OHFRHOGVHOI
[21:43:44] <Diggsey> SVN has one advantage over git: it can keep track of cherry-picked commits which have already been merged in

[21:45:02] <Peach> THIS IS BEAUTIFUL
[21:45:08] <Diggsey> in git if you try to merge a branch, of which some commits have already been cherry-picked in, it treats all those changes as conflicts
[21:45:15] <Peach> HAHAHAHAHAHHA I"M SO HAPPY
[21:46:04] <scott> Diggsey: Hmm, I haven't experienced that, but I can imagine how it happens since cherry-picked commits have different hashes
[21:46:11] <scott> Because they have different parent commits
[21:46:44] <Diggsey> yeah, SVN explicitly tracks which commits have already been merged in, on a per-file basis if necessary

[21:48:25] <scott> Also, I totally agree now about git having weird incantations now that I remember using `curl <github commit url>.patch | git am` to cherry-pick commits
[21:48:51] <scott> But on the other hand I was happy when I found out it was that easy
[21:50:33] <Peach> :3
[21:51:28] <mbrubeck> git can automatically merge branches that have cherry-picked changes between them, though its algorithm is content-based rather than metadata-based like SVN's, so it fails in different ways.
[21:53:29] <Diggsey> I've never had it succeed in that scenario: sometimes it actually applies the change twice, effectively inserting two copies of the new code...

[22:14:56] <Peach> Hey,
[22:15:12] <Peach> does anyone know how to calculate the volume for an arbitrary 3D mesh?
[22:16:12] <huon> have you tried googling? it seems promising
[22:16:29] <Tiffany> if it's watertight, there is a straightforward way
[22:16:39] <huon> (although I haven't looked at any of the actual things)
[22:16:49] <Tiffany> for every outward facing triangle, you compute the volume of the simplex created by taking that triangle and adding the origin as a fourth point
[22:16:51] <Tiffany> and add it to a sum
[22:16:59] <Tiffany> and for inward facing triangles, you subtract
[22:17:47] <Peach> huon: of course I google, I use this channel as a secondary form of commentary
[22:18:00] <Tiffany> if it's not watertight, you'll get at best incorrect results, and at worst you won't be able to figure out which faces are inside and which are outside
[22:18:35] <huon> Peach: I meant concretely, the results I saw for "volume of 3d mesh" seemed promising
[22:18:42] <Tiffany> usually meshes use counter clockwise winding on faces to implicitly encode sign, but if you're going for "arbitrary" 3D meshes...
[22:19:11] <huon> Peach: if they're not, you probably need to give more detail or we'll fall into the same holes as google
[22:24:14] *** Joins: ChrisMorgan (ChrisMorgan@moz-g6osuq.tpgi.com.au)
[22:24:30] <XMPPwocky> Tiffany: hm, i think you might fix the winding and tell if it's watertight or not in one step- if you represent vertices as nodes on a graph
[22:24:57] <XMPPwocky> start at one node, look at its neighbors, find the "most clockwise
[22:25:04] <Tiffany> yeah, you can do that
[22:25:23] <Tiffany> really though, it's much easier to just dictate that only watertight counter-clockwise-wound meshes are supported
[22:25:27] <XMPPwocky> yeah
[22:25:42] <Tiffany> otherwise you have trouble defining what "inside" even means
[22:25:56] <scott> Does anyone know how to set up vim with syntastic using cargo instead of rustc?
[22:26:05] <XMPPwocky> you could also just convert the mesh to G-code, 3D-print it, and dump it into a tub of water
[22:26:24] <Tiffany> hahaha
[22:26:43] <Diggsey> pretty sure conversion to G-code requires a watertight mesh :P
[22:27:04] <XMPPwocky> ooh, skip the tub of water entirely and measure the amount of filament you used!
[22:27:20] <zofrex> the dumping it in water method also requires a watertight mesh ;)
[22:28:22] <XMPPwocky> the "existing" bit does too
[22:28:22] <Diggsey> just load the mesh into bullet physics and use its water simulation
[22:28:34] <XMPPwocky> i feel like an infinitely thin polygon wouldn't work very well
[22:29:24] <zofrex> Diggsey: I love the idea of how much redundant mathematics occurs in that solution
[22:29:45] <zofrex> it's like the elaborate way to perform that calculation
[22:30:03] <Diggsey> but it does handle non-solid meshes :P
[22:31:32] <Peach> What's an English word that means "tediously sort through to find something"
[22:32:14] <huon> "look for a needle in a haystack"
[22:32:23] <dfockler> laboriously search
[22:33:03] <zofrex> even 'search' on its own implies it's somewhat involved
[22:33:15] <wrl> spelunk
[22:33:26] <dfockler> sift
[22:33:31] <wrl> yeah sift is a good one
[22:34:11] <dfockler> dredge
[22:34:13] * wrl pulls up thesaurus
[22:34:20] <wrl> scour
[22:34:36] <huon> "exhaustively" is a nice adverb too
[22:34:46] <Peach> exhaustively search!
[22:35:04] <zofrex> hunt
[22:35:10] <Diggsey> well exhaustively search means something in CS tho...
[22:35:12] <Peach> scour is good
[22:35:26] <Peach> Oh cool then in my case it's a pun
[22:35:35] <Peach> Diggsey: what's the CS term "exhaustive search"
[22:35:43] <dfockler> yeah exhaustively describes a method of searching
[22:35:52] <zofrex> ransack
[22:36:00] <zofrex> rifle!
[22:36:00] <Diggsey> it means searching by trying every possibility
[22:36:07] <wrl> rifling yes!
[22:36:11] <Diggsey> as opposed to a more intelligent method
[22:36:17] <zofrex> oooh rummage
[22:36:54] <dfockler> all of these have slightly different connotations in English at least
[22:37:28] <zofrex> the OED Historical Thesaurus allows one to be very precise: http://i.imgur.com/WshyByC.png
[22:37:32] <zofrex> (this is my first time using it)
[22:37:36] <wrl> they are colorful words

[22:55:44] <Peach> What symbols can I use in github
[22:55:59] <Peach> I want to write:  Area / Volume
[22:56:07] <Peach> can I use & ?
[22:56:31] <Peach> Or just git really
[23:03:40] <mbrubeck> Peach: Like, in a commit message?  You can use any characters.
[23:03:51] <Peach> No mbrubeck I mean in a file directory
[23:04:12] <Peach> can I use & or +  in a folder name in git?
[23:05:58] <mbrubeck> I believe git can handle any characters in filenames that the underlying filesystem allows
[23:06:37] <mbrubeck> but if you want to avoid problems when cloning the repo onto a different platform, it's best to avoid chars that other common filesystems have trouble with
[23:06:59] <mbrubeck> e.g. colon (:), slash (/), backslash(\), and sibling files that differ only by case

[23:08:49] <Diggsey> mbrubeck: git actually seems pretty good at handling that - I'm sure I've had a case where it chose the closest representable name on the OS
[23:09:17] <Diggsey> (but kept the original name in the object database)

[23:52:47] <Peach> Anyone know if I can define a new syntax highlighting rule for a new file type?
[23:53:00] <Peach> in github
[23:53:02] <Peach> ?
[23:53:45] <c74d> Peach: yes; you can, or at least could last I checked.
[23:56:24] <c74d> hm, that might have been only for the filetype statistics thing.
[23:57:50] <mbrubeck> Peach: GitHub uses https://github.com/github/linguist for syntax highlighting
[23:57:59] <Astraea> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70ljEdcLRXI
[23:58:02] <Astraea> awesome
[23:59:15] <mbrubeck> So you can do it if you write a grammar for the new format and get it accepted in the github/linguist repo
