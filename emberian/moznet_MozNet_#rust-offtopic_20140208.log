[21:32:34] <bjz> does anybody here use bitcoin?
[21:34:11] <bjz> it seems I just got a bitcoin tip on a commit, and I need a wallet
[21:35:02] <bjz> is https://multibit.org/ ok?
[21:35:50] <_achin> a wallet is just a signed data on your machine.  any bitcoin client will give you one
[21:36:07] <bjz> ah ok
[21:36:16] <_achin> but note:
[21:36:20] <_achin> You will get your money when your balance hits the threshold of 0.00100000 Ƀ
[21:36:41] <bjz> yeah
[21:37:04] <_achin> i got a 0.00008517 BTC tip, which is a long way away from 0.001 BTC
[21:37:13] <bjz> was just doing it because it expires in 30 days
[21:37:48] <_achin> oh, hmm.  maybe you just need to sign into tip4commit?
[21:38:02] <bjz> heh
[21:38:02] <bjz> :)
[21:38:02] <bjz> I have 0.00053052
[21:38:09] <bjz> on tip4commit
[21:38:59] <_achin> btw, does this seem every so slightly sketchy to you at all?
[21:39:00] <bjz> oh wait
[21:39:00] <bjz> 0.00065814
[21:39:33] <bjz> a tad
[21:40:16] <bjz> who on earth would tip me?
[21:40:59] <_achin> you don't get to see what commit it was
[21:41:04] <bjz> it's safe to give my address though right?
[21:41:14] <_achin> it's safe you give a bitcoin address, yes.
[21:41:25] <_achin> but you might have had to give an email address to signup with tip4commit
[21:41:44] <bjz> oh well, my email is on my git commits anyway
[21:42:26] <bjz> what client do you use?
[21:43:06] <_achin> i don't really "use bitcoin", but i have the QT gui client that's downloadable from the official bitcoin website
[21:44:30] <bjz> heh, was just looking at the blockchain size: https://blockchain.info/charts/blocks-size
[21:44:31] <bjz> I guess 14mb isn't that much
[21:45:07] <_achin> that appears to be 14 thousand megabytes
[21:45:21] <bjz> oh!
[21:45:23] <bjz> haha
[21:45:25] <_achin> (assuming a US locale, where a comma is the thousands seperator)
[21:47:43] <_achin> this is one of the "problems" with bitcoin (the amount of data you have to cary around to perform bitcoin transactions is huge, and will only get huger)
[21:51:46] <bjz> I'm not downloading that !
[21:51:46] <bjz> You don't have to. As a normal user of Bitcoin you are only interested in the parts of the blockchain that contain your transactions. That small portion is about 25Mb.
[21:51:46] <bjz> https://multibit.org/faq.html
[21:51:49] <bjz> from the faq ^
[21:52:10] <bjz> (multibit was linked from the bitcoin website)
[21:52:13] <_achin> in practive, i'm not sure it's actually that simple
[21:53:43] <_achin> it's true that bitcoin clients can hardcode "checkpoints" into the blockchain, so you only need to download stuff newer than your checkpoint
[21:54:44] <_achin> but downloading that stuff can be a pain
[21:57:07] <_achin> (i currently have a little over 1 gig of blockchain on my machine)
[21:58:28] <_achin> but i am many months out of date.  i'm guessing it'll take at least until tomorrow before i am up-to-date (rough estimation based on the fact that my progress bar hasnt moved at all)
[22:01:44] <_achin> also, this is quite an excellent FAQ
[22:06:27] <_achin> https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script
[22:07:12] <_achin> (this is where my understand of how bitcoin *really* works starts to break down into little crumbly pieces)
[22:18:31] <_achin> also https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Contracts
