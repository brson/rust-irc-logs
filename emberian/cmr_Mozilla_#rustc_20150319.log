[13:56:35] <nmatsakis> eddyb_: I almost asked you to r? that PR, should have cc'd you at least, sorry about that 
[13:56:45] <eddyb_> nmatsakis: I had to remove a reborrow coercion on overloaded operators, with a comment talking about Eq for &'a T and &'b T
[13:56:53] <eddyb_> nmatsakis: np, just trying to keep track of everything
[13:57:21] <eddyb_> nmatsakis: thing is, tests didn't break, so I'm not sure if we don't have enough tests or it just isn't required anymore
[13:57:36] <nmatsakis> yeah I was thinking of that one in particular when I said we may do more than we need
[13:57:47] <nmatsakis> though japaric has been doing some work on overloaded operators, I might try to pick it up from him
[13:57:53] <nmatsakis> I think the type checking there is not good
[13:57:59] <nmatsakis> but I don't thikn it'll affect this necessarily
[13:58:04] <eddyb_> however, there is one place where such a reborrow can be added
[13:58:13] <nmatsakis> there are some requests for more such reborrows 
[13:58:29] <nmatsakis> in particular in this scenario
[13:58:31] <nmatsakis> fn foo<T>(x: T)
[13:58:32] <eddyb_> lookup_in_trait_adjusted can do it just fine
[13:58:36] <nmatsakis> foo(&mut x)
[13:58:49] <nmatsakis> well, not quite that scenario

[13:58:54] <nmatsakis> foo(x)

[13:59:27] <nmatsakis> there's an issue on it somewhere
[14:00:20] <eddyb_> nmatsakis: so the next step is enforcing that you can't have unsizing without an autoref. I think I've got everything covered with asserts :P
[14:00:35] <nmatsakis> nice, is there a WIP branch I could peek at?
[14:00:54] <eddyb_> because these coercions are triggered by function calls, and function calls take rvalues, I'm pretty certain it should be always be the case
[14:01:07] <nmatsakis> I've been wanting to rework a bit how overloaded operator method calls, particular fn calls, work 
[14:01:08] <eddyb_> the method stuff took waay too long though
[14:01:23] <nmatsakis> I ran into a problem trying to add impls like
[14:01:36] <nmatsakis> impl<F> Fn for F where F:Fn
[14:01:39] <nmatsakis> er
[14:01:42] <nmatsakis> impl<F> Fn for &F where F:Fn
[14:01:57] <nmatsakis> because of the way that the autoderef loop works there
[14:02:02] <nmatsakis> in particular you wind up needing to do
[14:02:10] <nmatsakis> fn foo(mut x: &mut FnMut())
[14:02:16] <nmatsakis> because x() becomes
[14:02:21] <nmatsakis> FnMut::call_mut(x, ())
[14:02:23] <nmatsakis> instead of
[14:02:31] <nmatsakis> er
[14:02:32] <nmatsakis> it becomes
[14:02:37] <nmatsakis> FnMut::call_mut(&mut x, ())
[14:02:38] <nmatsakis> instead of
[14:02:43] <nmatsakis> FnMut::call_mut(&mut *x, ())
[14:02:51] <nmatsakis> that's kind of annoying
[14:02:53] <eddyb_> is this related to needing to add mut to closures all over the place?
[14:02:59] <nmatsakis> not really
[14:03:06] <nmatsakis> I presume you mean this
[14:03:08] <eddyb_> what about f: &mut F?
[14:03:21] <nmatsakis> fn foo<F>(mut f: F) where F:FnMut()
[14:03:23] <eddyb_> I can't remember if that worked without `mut f`
[14:03:25] <eddyb_> nmatsakis: yes
[14:03:28] <nmatsakis> well it did before
[14:03:30] <nmatsakis> but it doesn't with my change
[14:03:31] <nmatsakis> maybe it's ok
[14:03:37] <nmatsakis> but it's kind of annoying
[14:03:41] <nmatsakis> that is
[14:03:51] <nmatsakis> fn foo<F>(mut f: &mut F) where F:FnMut() <-- that used to work, doesn't with my change
[14:04:01] <eddyb_> nmatsakis: https://github.com/eddyb/rust/commits/dst
[14:04:52] <nmatsakis> cool thanks
[14:05:07] <eddyb_> nmatsakis: that last commit went a bit too far, I'll admit. I kinda wanted to finish it and have AutoUnsize contain only the pointer type, but, ugh, it's getting too large already :(
[14:05:33] <eddyb_> nmatsakis: oh, something I wanted to ask you, in case I start implementing nrc's RFC
[14:06:08] <eddyb_> nmatsakis: in traits::select, can I return a custom enum variant or something which represents "the built-in impl"?
[14:07:09] <eddyb_> nmatsakis: e.g. `<Struct<[T; N]> as Unsize<Struct<[T]>>>` would be satisfied, but I also want the pair ([T; N], [T]) out of it
[14:07:22] <eddyb_> which I call the leaf source/target
[14:09:18] <eddyb_> maybe it could be UnsizeLength(N), but I can't be certain it will only be used from trans
[14:09:42] <eddyb_> and matching over the type isn't more expensive than matching over some custom enum

[14:46:28] <nmatsakis> since I haven't seen aatch in a while... 
[14:46:39] <nmatsakis> I'm not sure why it should suck though, I mean, 
[14:46:41] <eddyb_> nmatsakis: inference during the selection process?
[14:46:44] <nmatsakis> you have to write the code to look it up once?
[14:46:53] <nmatsakis> so if you ahve this subroutine 
[14:46:55] <nmatsakis> that computes it
[14:46:58] <nmatsakis> why can't you just call it again
[14:47:29] <nmatsakis> in any case, no I just mean type inference during typeck
[14:47:42] <eddyb_> I need to use it from trans
[14:47:45] <nmatsakis> the cache persists across fns in some cases -- you could change that so that the cache is always local to a fn
[14:47:48] <nmatsakis> for this trait
[14:47:58] <eddyb_> that's weird
[14:47:58] <nmatsakis> using it form trans isn't a problem
[14:48:01] <nmatsakis> *from trans
[14:48:07] <eddyb_> nmatsakis: it depends on the parameter environment
[14:48:12] <nmatsakis> so?
[14:48:21] <nmatsakis> we take that into account
[14:48:28] <eddyb_> then I don't see any issues
[14:48:42] <eddyb_> unless there is a chance inference variables can pass between functions
[14:49:00] <eddyb_> can that happen?
[14:49:01] <nmatsakis> that'd be the concern, yes
[14:49:37] <nmatsakis> e.g. if you have [$0;N]: Unsize<[$0]>
[14:50:02] <nmatsakis> as an aside
[14:50:16] <nmatsakis> we should restructure how trans does its caching; it always creates fresh type parameter environments, or frequently does, right now 
[14:50:20] <nmatsakis> and then it has its own more global cache
[14:50:22] <nmatsakis> which is silly
[14:50:26] <nmatsakis> it should just share a param env
[14:50:29] <nmatsakis> I never got finished doing that
[14:50:37] <nmatsakis> (because there is caching in the param env)
[14:50:54] <nmatsakis> anyway let me review how its setup now
[14:50:55] <eddyb_> (I think I would have to write the recursive function twice)
[14:51:00] <nmatsakis> why?
[14:51:30] <eddyb_> because in traits::select, I'd require an Unsize bound on the trailing field in a structure, no?
[14:52:16] <eddyb_> whereas a trans-only extraction implementation would recurse directly on nested struct tails until it reaches an unsized leaf
[14:52:55] <nmatsakis> hmm,I just figured trans would use the same fn but drive it until it reaches a base case
[14:53:11] <eddyb_> drive it *how*?
[14:53:15] <nmatsakis> or have the fn recurse as mucha s it acn, which in trans should be the whole way
[14:53:20] <nmatsakis> call it?
[14:53:23] <eddyb_> oh, you mean, have a function just to get the tail
[14:53:52] <nmatsakis> or have a fn to get the next "step" which bottoms out in the builtin cases
[14:54:00] <nmatsakis> that is, it returns an enum like
[14:54:11] <nmatsakis> UnsizeLength, UnsizeTrait, UnsizeUpcast, UnsizeStructField

[15:00:47] <nmatsakis> basically normalization would become lazy and those three things will get somewhat merged
[15:00:52] <nmatsakis> we'll see though I'm still experimenting

[23:07:56] <huon> doener: I'm playing with https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/22987 but I can't seem to work out why IRCE doesn't exist in our LLVM
[23:08:10] <huon> afaik, we're using https://github.com/rust-lang/llvm/commits/rust-llvm-2015-02-13 and IRCE was added before that
[23:08:48] <huon> https://github.com/llvm-mirror/llvm/commits/master/lib/Transforms/Scalar/InductiveRangeCheckElimination.cpp
[23:08:56] <huon> do LLVM or us do something strange with branches/landing?
[23:11:41] <doener> huon: IRCE was added in r226201 and release_36 forked from r225991
[23:12:16] <huon> oh
[23:12:19] <huon> that's explains it then
[23:12:21] <huon> thanks!

[23:41:04] <doener> huon: btw, I was thinking about moving the null check elimination pass out of our llvm pass, compiling it separately and going back to configuring the pass manager ourselves, adding that pass even when compiling wih a stock llvm
[23:41:38] <doener> huon: that way we could support using IRCE even while supporting older llvm versions
