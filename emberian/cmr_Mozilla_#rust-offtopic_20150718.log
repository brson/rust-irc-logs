[08:38:07] <blueridanus> What, there's an asteroid mining company? 
[08:39:34] <blueridanus> I guess I need to read space news more...
[08:43:52] <eddyb> blueridanus: there's several
[08:44:13] <eddyb> not sure if others have launched technology testbeds yet
[08:46:30] <eddyb> I haven't heard of prospector-type interceptors ever being used. I mean, there's Dawn and Rosetta, but they're not centered on mining, even if they should be able to measure relevant properties
[08:49:23] <Layl> I made an attempt at pixelart http://i.imgur.com/itlcVCD.png
[08:49:55] <blueridanus> It's nice to see the acceleration of commercial interest in space exploration.
[08:50:25] <Layl> I like being able to pixelart, it's nice to be confident that I can make my own stuff if I need to
[08:50:45] <eddyb> blueridanus: forget exploration, these lumps of rocks floating in space have more high-value metals in them than humanity has ever mined
[08:51:25] <Layl> eddyb, how do you get them back down though
[08:51:34] <blueridanus> ^ that's the question I had in mind
[08:51:36] <Layl> and how long are those metals going to stay valuable
[08:51:43] <Layl> if you're mining them by the truckloads
[08:51:55] <blueridanus> How long they stay valuable is a bit irrelevant, though.
[08:51:59] <Layl> true
[08:52:12] <blueridanus> The company that gets to sell so much of them that they get no longer valuable will be pretty happy...
[08:52:47] <Layl> if platinum catalytic converters could be insanely cheap that would be best
[08:52:56] <eddyb> earth-based mining is going to be affected more by the price drop than the company putting the large quantity on the market
[08:53:27] <blueridanus> I wonder if that's good
[08:53:31] <eddyb> and industry is going to soak a lot more now that it can, and the demand will go up
[08:53:31] <Layl> positive thing though, if earth based mining gets price drops, it drives more people to space
[08:53:47] <blueridanus> Will it have a positive environmental effect if people lose interest in mining here?
[08:53:52] <Layl> imagine how fast space travel will go with the full weight of capitalism behind it

[09:03:44] <Layl> yea
[09:03:53] <blueridanus> That's done with a normal map.
[09:04:19] <Layl> I can never figure out how to make normal maps
[09:04:26] <Layl> are there editors for that or something
[09:04:29] <blueridanus> Yes
[09:04:39] <blueridanus> I got that gif from a kickstarter project for just that
[09:04:44] <blueridanus> Which I heard about a while ago
[09:04:50] <blueridanus> https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/finnmorgan/sprite-lamp-dynamic-lighting-for-2d-art/
[09:05:21] <Layl> that's.... very pricy
[09:05:28] <Layl> 83 euro for pro
[09:05:36] <Layl> way too much for me
[09:05:49] <blueridanus> Woah, I was not aware of the price
[09:06:08] <blueridanus> The thing is
[09:06:18] <blueridanus> Baking normal maps from a 3D shape is extremely easy
[09:06:36] <blueridanus> Defining the 3D shape for a pixel art sprite, though... How are you meant to do that?
[09:07:30] <blueridanus> BTW Layl, the way he explains how it works makes it seem easy to implement. You can try just programming it
[09:07:32] <Layl> you can use cylinders and stuff to create a rough shape
[09:07:38] <Layl> then use some kind of brush and color picking from there
[09:08:01] <Layl> making an editor like that would take way too much time
[09:08:10] <Layl> especially since I'm actually currently making a top-down game without lighting at all
[09:08:17] <blueridanus> It's not an editor
[09:08:30] <blueridanus> It's just a tool that transforms 4 versions of your sprite into a normal map
[09:08:37] <blueridanus> Which seems rather not so complicated to do
[09:08:57] <Layl> link to the algorithm?
[09:09:17] <blueridanus> Well, basically
[09:10:07] <blueridanus> You know how a normal map works, right?
[09:10:15] <Layl> yea
[09:10:22] <blueridanus> The XYZ components are encoded in RGB
[09:10:48] <blueridanus> If you do a sprite that's lit from the front
[09:11:03] <blueridanus> In grayscale
[09:11:33] <blueridanus> You are basically specifying one of the components
[09:11:42] <blueridanus> X, in that case
[09:11:56] <blueridanus> Do another 2 and you have your normal map
[09:12:36] <XMPPwocky> not /lit/ from the front- it's where the normals are. it can be lit from anywhere
[09:13:51] <blueridanus> As in "it does not need to be aligned to any axis"?
[09:14:54] <blueridanus> I guess as long as you have enough information to know how a single pixel changes according to the light's position, you can have a normal map.
[09:16:08] <XMPPwocky> that's not necessarily a normal map. a normal map is a pretty specific thing
[09:16:34] <Layl> see: bump maps vs normal maps
[09:16:50] <XMPPwocky> OT: googling "normal map" gives me an actual map of my location
[09:16:52] <XMPPwocky> thanks google
[09:17:24] <blueridanus> I was thinking of something like this:
[09:17:26] <blueridanus> http://shdr.bkcore.com/
[09:17:49] <blueridanus> Replace the inner contents of "main" with "gl_FragColor = vec4(fNormal.x);"
[09:18:00] <blueridanus> Then   gl_FragColor = vec4(fNormal.y);
[09:18:06] <blueridanus>   gl_FragColor = vec4(fNormal.z);
[09:18:25] <blueridanus> I will google that though, thanks.
[09:18:46] <Layl> the actual formula of calculating light value from a normal map and a light is not by far the hard part
[09:19:22] <blueridanus> Yeah.
[09:19:23] <Layl> compared to the structure you have to set up to get light values into the shader and such
[09:19:32] <XMPPwocky> yeah, at least for diffuse things. it's pretty much just a dot product
[09:19:39] <Layl> if you want to do for example isometric, it becomes even harder
[09:19:46] <XMPPwocky> Layl: one light is /pretty/ easy. multiple lights are... fun.
[09:20:02] <Layl> yea one light is easy but you almost never want just one light
[09:20:03] <XMPPwocky> and if you want to have spotlights and other stuff too...
[09:20:16] <Layl> deferred 2D rendering
[09:20:17] <Layl> fun
[09:20:28] <XMPPwocky> and then tracking shadowing for every light, and cascading shadowmaps...
[09:20:42] <Layl> 2D ambient occlusion should be fun
[09:20:44] *** Joins: eerie (eerie@moz-8qhkpk.red.bezeqint.net)
[09:20:45] <blueridanus> I'm still not too sure what is a good way of doing shadowing...
[09:21:25] <blueridanus> Raycasting is intuitive, but horribly slow
[09:21:36] <blueridanus> raytracing*
[09:21:40] <XMPPwocky> blueridanus: the canonical way is to render the scene from the light's perspective, and save the depth values. then, when rendering the actual image, you look at the distance from the light to the fragment you're working on
[09:21:41] <Layl> generally I hear cascading shadow maps are the best way
[09:21:48] <Layl> for sunlight
[09:22:02] <Layl> non cascading shadow maps for the rest
[09:22:07] <blueridanus> XMPPwocky: Rerendering for every light?
[09:22:13] <XMPPwocky> if the distance from the light to that fragment is less than the value in the shadow map, it's not in shadow
[09:22:38] <Layl> one of these days we'll hit a point where realtime raytracing renderers are viable
[09:22:50] <XMPPwocky> blueridanus: yeah, although: 1. if the lights aren't moving, you can cache the static partso f the scene
[09:22:55] <XMPPwocky> and just re-render the moving bits
[09:23:24] <blueridanus> Layl: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpT6MkCeP7Y
[09:23:28] <XMPPwocky> also, 2. your fragment shader literally does nothing but have a depth output, your resolution is small, and rasterization is fast
[09:23:36] <Layl> iirc you can just render a lightmap for something static
[09:23:45] <Layl> then render your dynamic stuff on top of that lightmap at very low cost
[09:23:56] <Layl> blueridanus, not quite there yet though
[09:24:09] <Layl> that fussyness is the biggest problem
[09:24:11] <XMPPwocky> Layl: yes- but this is how you have dynamic objects affecting static lighting
[09:24:23] <blueridanus> Layl: It's just a consequence of performance.
[09:24:35] <blueridanus> Layl: Not enough samples. We should have enough computational power pretty soon
[09:24:46] <Layl> the fact that it takes a second to render away the fuzz makes it very unsuitable for games, where the camera is almost always moving

[09:26:27] <blueridanus> However, I can see that if 4k becomes a thing
[09:26:41] <blueridanus> It'll be basically delayed for another bunch of years
[09:27:06] <Layl> though, moore's law has moved to GPUs so
[09:27:11] <Layl> eventually they will catch up
[09:27:11] <blueridanus> Exactly.
[09:27:23] <blueridanus> 2 GTX TITANs, the description says
[09:27:41] <blueridanus> You can extrapolate that and get a rough approximation of when it becomes viable.
[09:27:44] <Layl> I'm more excited for AR than raytracing in the future really
[09:28:01] <blueridanus> Oh, same
[09:28:17] <Layl> right now we're hitting the "early prototype oculus rift" point of AR
[09:28:26] <XMPPwocky> raytracing is much nicer from a developer's standpoint, though; less futzing around with clunky things
[09:28:33] <Layl> not quite in the "virtual boy" era anymore
[09:28:47] <blueridanus> Raytracing is extremely intuitive.
[09:29:00] <Layl> I can imagine that artists will like it a lot as well
[09:29:28] <Layl> making models becoming more natural
[09:29:33] <blueridanus> Also, raytracing is the standard right now for movies/animations/anything that isn't real time
[09:29:42] <XMPPwocky> apparently artists are already happy about PBR, which does a lot of the sam estuff'
[09:29:49] <blueridanus> If you use Blender, you know Cycles
[09:29:55] <blueridanus> And Cycles has amazing results.
[09:30:46] <blueridanus> XMPPwocky: A question about shadows: why in lots of games are their edges horrible?
[09:31:17] <Layl> blueridanus, because there's no good way to anti alias shadows in shadowmaps
[09:31:22] <XMPPwocky> ^
[09:31:41] <blueridanus> Oh, I see.
[09:31:44] <XMPPwocky> also, if you're doing deferred rendering, it ends up being even harder to do anything but either "shadowed" or "fully lit"
[09:31:46] <Layl> shadowmaps aren't overlays for every object
[09:31:55] <Layl> a shadowmap is rendered from the light, as if the light was a camera
[09:32:06] <XMPPwocky> a lot of games will do, for that, a "speckling" or dither sort of thing
[09:32:10] <XMPPwocky> which looks awful up close
[09:32:20] <Layl> imo it looks better than jaggies up close
[09:32:54] <blueridanus> I wonder if there's an alternative to doing shadows...
[09:33:00] <Layl> the only solution most engines seem to give is to just ramp up the shadow detail
[09:33:01] <blueridanus> Can't you do an geometric projection?
[09:33:04] <Layl> I wonder how Arma 3 does it
[09:33:09] <Layl> the shadows in that look so crisp
[09:34:17] <blueridanus> I just googled it and they look amazing.
[09:34:34] <Layl> it's quite spectacular as well when flying a helicopter
[09:36:46] <XMPPwocky> in other news, qubes-os is pretty amazing
[09:37:16] <Layl> seems they use shadow mapping
[09:37:23] <Layl> their pipeline just must be very very efficient
[09:37:42] <XMPPwocky> http://imgur.com/JqoZlTr seen here are 3 different OSes, one playing a youtube video in the background, with audio and everything
[09:37:54] <XMPPwocky> as in, 3 different kernels, userspaces, etc.
[09:37:59] <blueridanus> Layl: I saw some sligthly jagged edges in an helicopter's shadow, but the player shadow was totally crisp
[09:38:39] <Layl> http://assets.vg247.com/current//2014/09/arma3_dlc_helicopters_screenshot_02.jpg
[09:38:41] <Layl> seems they use dithering
[09:38:44] <Layl> if you zoom in you can see
[09:39:01] <Layl> their resolution is just extremely high
[09:39:27] <blueridanus> XMPPwocky: I'm going to skip the "how" and ask "why"?
[09:39:30] <Layl> I guess that makes sense for the sun light though
[09:39:51] <blueridanus> Yeah, I can see the dithering.
[09:39:53] <XMPPwocky> blueridanus: security. they're fully isolated from eachother (modulo exotic side-channels like cache timing, etc.)
[09:40:41] <XMPPwocky> plus, they're based on templates (and their FSes are CoWed from a template), so making a new VM is really easy (and again, you get interoperability with windows from other VMs)
[09:41:06] <blueridanus> How big is the performance hit?
[09:42:37] <XMPPwocky> blueridanus: not that bad, actually; IO is the worst of it, because it's pretty heavily abstracted (guest OS's FS -> its block layer -> Xen's device emulation -> its fs & block layer -> LUKS for encryption)
[09:42:55] <XMPPwocky> pulseaudio is configured weirdly at first and has like 500ms latency, but you can fix that with a config setting
[09:43:17] <XMPPwocky> Oh, also you can apparently have a Windows VM, and have windows and linux windows on the same desktop
[09:43:56] <XMPPwocky> the GUI stuff is basically just sending the bitmaps through shared memory, which X was going to do anyways
[09:45:10] <blueridanus> Uh, Windows and Linux on the same desktop?
[09:45:11] <XMPPwocky> the biggest issue is that the GPU isn't accessible in the guests; you could potentially do some stuff with PCI passthrough, but that's insecure unless you have VT-d, which I don't
[09:45:25] <blueridanus> I'm pretty confused.
[09:45:34] <blueridanus> Did you try it yet?
[09:45:39] <XMPPwocky> that's my screenshot
[09:45:50] <Layl> don't you need to enable VT-d in your motherboard settings
[09:46:01] <XMPPwocky> Layl: my cpu doesn't support it
[09:46:05] <Layl> ah
[09:46:33] <XMPPwocky> blueridanus: https://www.qubes-os.org/attachment/wiki/QubesScreenshots/r2b3-windows-seamless-1.png haven't tried the windows thing yet, but this is their screenshot of it
[09:47:04] <XMPPwocky> > Windows AppVMs are fully integrated with the rest of the Qubes OS system, which includes things such as secure, policy governed, inter-VM file copy, clipboard, and generally whole our elastic qrexec infrastructure for secure inter-VM RPC!
[09:48:48] <XMPPwocky> it seems like the sort of thing that gets announced and then turns out to be vaporware, but it actually exists and works
[09:48:52] <Layl> how do you check if you've got VT-d anyways
[09:49:30] <Layl> seems I do
[09:49:42] <Layl> googled the specs of my CPU (i7 3770)
[09:49:46] <XMPPwocky> Layl: not sure. the security impact is just 1. you can't do pci passthrough and 2. your NetVM could compromise the entire system by using the network card for DMA
[09:50:12] <XMPPwocky> of course, on basically every other OS, if your networking stack gets owned, you're inherently screwed
[09:51:34] <Layl> well mainly I'm looking for the convenience not really the security
[09:52:01] <Layl> I've got bad experiences with my PC and linux though
[09:52:16] <blueridanus> Same. Wine does not always do the job for me.
[09:52:18] <Layl> RAID nightmares
[09:52:42] <Layl> also I probably wouldn't like the startup times and not everything fits on my SSD
[09:52:59] <blueridanus> Layl: I have problems with my graphics card. AMD's drivers for Linux suck
[09:53:03] <Layl> I should get a second SSD and RAID-0 them
[09:53:15] <Layl> iirc they've become relatively cheap
[09:53:23] <blueridanus> And it's some weird switchable graphics. I should've get a nVidia card...
[09:53:34] <XMPPwocky> uugh amd linux switchable graphics
[09:53:36] <XMPPwocky> i know your pain
[09:53:49] <XMPPwocky> sometimes, if you restart X, you can even switch the graphics!
[09:54:20] <blueridanus> XMPPwocky: Honestly I'm surprised I even got X to work.
[09:54:48] <blueridanus> And I'm not sure if I'm running on the integrated card, or it's using my GPU
[09:54:53] <blueridanus> I wasn't sure even when on Windows
[09:55:02] <blueridanus> dxdiag and everything detected it as the integrated card
[09:55:28] <blueridanus> Turning off the Radeon would decrease performance dramastically, though
[09:55:30] <XMPPwocky> the thing is you wolud need to configure amd's thingy on windows to run dxdiag with discrete graphics
[09:55:37] <XMPPwocky> it automatically does it for most games
[09:55:58] <blueridanus> XMPPwocky: You mean, the custom profiles?
[09:56:08] <XMPPwocky> on linux, you're either using amd or integrated, and switching requires a reboot
[09:56:22] <blueridanus> Nope.
[09:56:27] <blueridanus> My BIOS can't even switch cards.
[09:56:43] <XMPPwocky> blueridanus: it's callled "vgaswitcheroo" under linux
[09:56:53] <XMPPwocky> blueridanus: if you right-click on the desktop there's a thing in the drop-down for "configure switchable graphics", at least for me
[09:57:39] <blueridanus> I don't know if it's even possible to set the computer to use the discrete card
[09:57:50] <blueridanus> Google suggested it was with a BIOS option, but I don't have it
[09:57:57] <XMPPwocky> you can't, not in the bios at least; you can only disable it
[09:58:20] <XMPPwocky> btw- if you don't explicitly configure that, afaik, in linux it leaves the card running in the background, eating easily 50% of my battery
[09:58:20] <blueridanus> The AMD control panel on Windows only changed the performance, dxdiag and games would still detect it as intel
[09:58:30] <XMPPwocky> blueridanus: hmm, weird. 
[09:58:47] <blueridanus> It's some weird kind of throttling system.
[09:59:02] <blueridanus> When I'm on low battery, performance is horrible
[09:59:04] <XMPPwocky> yeah i don't think that's in the right place
[09:59:38] <blueridanus> My battery is fine, though
[09:59:41] <XMPPwocky> blueridanus: For some reason, the windows on this laptop throttles the CPU when below 50%. it's not the actual windows power settings, it's something else
[09:59:52] <XMPPwocky> when plugged in, it's throttled to 2GHz
[10:00:01] <XMPPwocky> when not plugged in, it's 750MHz
[10:00:22] <XMPPwocky> that's not extending the battery life, that's cutting it in half, because as soon as it gets low it's unbearably laggy
[10:00:25] <blueridanus> XMPPwocky: For me, it's when the battery is under 15% or something and power is not connected
[10:01:38] <XMPPwocky> hm
[10:01:48] <blueridanus> And you can't mess with it at all.
[10:01:53] <blueridanus> The hardware just behaves that way
[10:02:01] <XMPPwocky> yeah that's what mine was too
[10:02:03] <blueridanus> No BIOS setting, nothing
[10:02:10] <XMPPwocky> but- it doesn't happen on linux
[10:02:18] <XMPPwocky> so i assumed it was some sort of obnoxious service
[10:02:23] <blueridanus> I'm using Arch only here and it happens always
[10:02:28] <XMPPwocky> ouch
[10:03:19] <blueridanus> I also can't seem to get WebCL to work, or do any GPGPU programming at all.
[10:05:22] <blueridanus> What laptop are you using, by the way?
[10:05:29] <XMPPwocky> lenovo y40-70
[10:07:31] <blueridanus> Did you manage to get it working for gaming on Linux?
[10:07:47] <blueridanus> (or even Windows, seeing it's switchable graphics)
[10:08:19] <XMPPwocky> yes on windows, sorta on linux
[10:08:35] <XMPPwocky> but again, you have to use amdconfig --px-dgpu to get it working on linux, with the proprietary drivers
[10:08:40] <XMPPwocky> no clue for the free drivers
[10:09:00] <blueridanus> Installing the proprietary drivers just made X not work at all for me.
[10:09:50] <XMPPwocky> hm
[10:11:22] <blueridanus> On Windows, you needed both the intel graphics driver and AMD's
[10:11:27] <blueridanus> Same on Linux?
[10:12:06] <XMPPwocky> yeah afaik
[10:13:33] <blueridanus> Huh. I'm going to clean this computer and install Arch again eventually, so I'll try to get it working.
[10:13:36] <blueridanus> Thanks.
[10:15:05] <XMPPwocky> np

[17:53:25] <niconii> anyway, my point is, technically you *could* use null for the raw ptr in Vec, but that'd get messy when taking a slice of it, because null doesn't fly there
[17:53:40] <scott> Do &() values get erased like () values?
[17:53:46] <GBGamer> and also, there's not really a point

[17:54:45] <scott> Interesting. I guess it's point at the place on the stack the () would be if it took up any real space.

[17:59:16] -playbot- (0x7fffd0374fd0, 0x7fffd0374fd0)
[17:59:41] <scott> I don't know enough to tell which addresses are stack or not.

[18:00:01] -playbot- (0x7f571e875350, 0x7f571e875348)
[18:00:22] <eddyb> it's easy
[18:00:29] <eddyb> scott: 7fff is stack
[18:00:39] <scott> I assumed that but I wasn't sure.
[18:00:42] <eddyb> everything else isn't
[18:00:46] <eddyb> including &mut ()
[18:00:52] <GBGamer> hah, there we go
[18:00:52] <GBGamer> so a () takes up 8 bytes of space
[18:01:02] <scott> A () takes up 0 bytes of space.
[18:01:05] <eddyb> GBGamer: no
[18:01:12] <eddyb> the pointer to it does, though :P
[18:01:39] <scott> playbot: let mut a = (); let mut b = (); (&mut a as *mut (), &mut b as *mut ())
[18:01:40] -playbot- (0x7fff0b624af0, 0x7fff0b624af0)

[18:02:07] <GBGamer> ah shit right
[18:02:07] <GBGamer> lol
[18:02:20] <GBGamer> ZSTs are weird
[18:02:25] <scott> Indeed
[18:02:34] <GBGamer> but very useful
[18:02:43] <eddyb> rvalue promotion is suboptimal
[18:02:53] <GBGamer> eddyb: ?
[18:02:55] <scott> Option<()> is equivalent to bool and it's the same size
[18:03:02] <scott> Vec<()> is weird... it'
[18:03:11] <eddyb> two () are treated as different values
[18:03:12] <scott> it's basically 3 semi-arbitrary usizes
[18:03:47] <GBGamer> doesn't that make some kinda sense?
[18:03:54] <eddyb> *mut [()] is an arbitrary pointer and an arbitrary usize
[18:04:38] <scott> I love that HashMap<K, ()> is a reasonable implementation of HashSet<K> in Rust.
[18:04:46] <scott> That's what made me like ZSTs.
[18:04:57] <eddyb> oi
[18:05:11] <GBGamer> I like ZSTs because of Typesystem Arithmetic
[18:05:16] <eddyb> or maybe this was explored before
[18:05:25] <scott> http://doc.rust-lang.org/1.1.0/src/std/collections/hash/set.rs.html#109-111
[18:05:36] <scott> This is actually the current std HashMap implementation.
[18:05:42] <scott> HashSet*
[18:06:10] <eddyb> Index forces you to return a reference
[18:06:17] <eddyb> but it can be a reference to a DST
[18:07:10] <scott> So it desugars into dereferencing a fat pointer, then?
[18:07:28] <eddyb> it desugars the same way
[18:07:35] <eddyb> a[i] is *a.index(i)
[18:07:51] <eddyb> &a[i] is &*a.index(i) i.e. a.index(i)
[18:08:09] <eddyb> but, you can take a &Foo and return a structure that's just (&Foo, [()])
[18:08:22] <eddyb> tadaa now you have an usize (that you can read in safe code)
[18:08:30] <eddyb> sorry
[18:08:37] <GBGamer> and I guess &* is defined as a noop
[18:08:38] <eddyb> a reference to a (Foo, [()]) structure
[18:08:53] <eddyb> GBGamer: a borrow of an lvalue does point to that lvalue
[18:09:07] <eddyb> and the dereference of a reference is an lvalue
[18:09:12] <GBGamer> yup
[18:09:44] <scott> &* can change types if Deref is implemented.

[18:11:10] <GBGamer> ah right, forgot about that
[18:11:16] <GBGamer> what's up with DerefMove by the way?
[18:11:36] <eddyb> DerefOwn, you mean :D
[18:11:59] <GBGamer> didn't it used to be called DerefMove
[18:12:01] <GBGamer> ?
[18:12:15] <eddyb> well, it doesn't move, so why would it be named that?
[18:12:16] <scott> Yes
[18:12:33] <GBGamer> ah okay. what's up with DerefOwn?
[18:13:06] <scott> eddyb: Hmm, is the distinction that it allows you to move, but doesn't do any move on its own?
[18:13:14] <eddyb> yeah
[18:13:27] <eddyb> GBGamer: there unresolved design issues with Own
[18:13:41] <GBGamer> i.e.?
[18:13:57] <eddyb> how do you create one pointing to the stack
[18:14:28] <GBGamer> I'm very confused by what that means
[18:14:31] <eddyb> should the autoref attemt to produce an Own<T> to call a method on a T value?
[18:14:37] <eddyb> *attempt
[18:14:44] <GBGamer> ohh
[18:15:05] <eddyb> GBGamer: Own<'a, T> is a owned pointer to a T "allocated" in 'a
[18:15:05] <GBGamer> so the automatic Deref is the issue?
[18:15:08] <eddyb> no
[18:15:47] <eddyb> issue 1: given let x: T; how do you create an Own<'a, T> where 'a is x's scope?
[18:16:22] <eddyb> issue 2: should x.foo() attempt to create an Own<'a, T> to call a foo method defined on Own<'a, T>?

[18:17:48] <GBGamer> I guess I really don't understand
[18:18:24] <GBGamer> so, if x is owned, shouldn't you have to move x into Own to create an Own<T>?
[18:18:37] <GBGamer> I don't see why Own has a lifetime, I guess
[18:18:49] <eddyb> because it would point to the stack
[18:18:55] <GBGamer> because x shouldn't be a reference
[18:19:05] <GBGamer> it should be owned by Own
[18:19:11] <eddyb> the value would be owned
[18:19:16] <eddyb> the allocation wouldn't
[18:19:28] <GBGamer> no here, see what I'm saying
[18:19:37] <eddyb> what?
[18:19:58] <GBGamer> it's a Box<T> because you move t into Box's allocation
[18:20:24] <GBGamer> so, if you have an Own<T> where Own is on the stack, it should just be Own(T)
[18:20:26] <eddyb> there is no Box<T> in this discussion

[18:23:17] <GBGamer> why is it useless then?
[18:23:19] <eddyb> it's useless because you can't write DerefMove for Box<T> with just &move T

[20:09:30] <Astraea> so... eh
[20:09:42] <Astraea>  spent more than I wanted, but... yeah
[20:09:54] <GBGamer> sounds good to me
[20:10:30] <GBGamer> at least you can upgrade the ssd later...
[20:10:46] <Astraea> well... at some point
[20:10:50] <Astraea> might just build a NAS tbh
[20:12:13] <GBGamer> what for?
[20:12:37] <GBGamer> movies or something?
[20:13:31] <Astraea> yeah
[20:13:40] <Astraea> all the stuff that usually takes up a ton of space on my laptop
[20:14:39] <GBGamer> I don't really understand having movies on your computer, unless piracy
[20:15:04] <GBGamer> I just use Netflix for everything
[20:16:06] <Elaine> Netflix lacks much content, and digitizing large DVD collections is easier than hauling disks around.
[20:16:43] <GBGamer> Elaine: perhaps I'm just not a movie person
[20:16:45] <Astraea> ^
[20:17:09] <Astraea> ^ to Elaine
[20:17:26] <Astraea> GBGamer: I'm more of a TV series guy than a movie guy
[20:17:44] <Astraea> And those take up tons of space (physically as in box sets and storage wise)
[20:17:55] <GBGamer> yeah, I can get it
[20:18:09] <GBGamer> I'm thankfully a music guy
[20:18:21] <Astraea> Off the top of my head, battle star galactica and Babylon 5 are no longer on Netflix
[20:18:24] <GBGamer> so I only need like 30-50 gigs for my collection
[20:18:33] <GBGamer> wait what? BSG isn't on Netflix?
[20:18:43] <GBGamer> that sucks!
[20:18:45] <Astraea> Unless they added it back
[20:18:49] <Elaine> not anymore, it got taken down.
[20:18:57] <GBGamer> noooo
[20:19:08] <Astraea> And that's why I want a NAS
[20:19:20] <Astraea> I love Netflix, but it has a lot of gaps....

[20:19:47] <ytain> you can get a router with one or two usb ports and you can use openwrt to set up a nas on it
[20:20:26] <Astraea> wouldn't that actually be a SAN
[20:20:34] <Astraea> also, I have one of those, hehe
[20:20:48] <Astraea> though it's running asus' fork of openwrt
[20:20:54] <Astraea> or... was it dd-wrt

[20:22:11] * GBGamer is very jealous
[20:22:38] <Astraea> at one of my previous jobs we had tons of SANs
[20:23:07] <Astraea> relatively small place, but we had a few hundred TBs
[20:23:07] <whipsch> pools aint cheap, though :(

[23:03:15] <eddyb> Zoxc: it shouldn't be harder than on a x86
[23:03:34] <eddyb> Zoxc: but they also have bits reserved for tags that a GC might use
[23:04:04] <Zoxc> Yes, I'm unclear on how those are to be used
[23:04:21] <Zoxc> Also stack barriers might be problematic

[23:09:40] <Zoxc> That's my topic =P
[23:11:18] <eddyb> oh!
[23:11:54] <Zoxc> I also noticed that the codePointer, dataPointer and threadPointer registers are call local. Can those be used to avoid a global offset table for dynamic linking?
[23:12:36] <eddyb> hmm
[23:13:05] <eddyb> maybe? I'm not sure, I thought they were just to speed up protection checks in those memory regions

[23:59:28] <Elaine> They'd probably be called tags.
