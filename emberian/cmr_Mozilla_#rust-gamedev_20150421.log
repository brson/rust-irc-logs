[03:09:32] <eddyb> sekao: I was talking about UV coordinates. 0, 0 is one corner of the texture, 1, 1 is the opposite one. then, say, 0, 0 to 0.5, 0.5 is one quarter of the texture and you can split it as much as you want

[03:11:03] <eddyb> right. graphics is abstracting away UV coordinates
[03:11:42] <eddyb> this doesn't make sense to support at the Texture level, since spritesheets exist as an optimization, allocating different Textures defeats the entire purpose of that
[03:12:16] <eddyb> a Sprite abstraction should have support for this, but I am not familiar with that part of piston
[03:12:28] <sekao> eddyb: i wasn't expecting separate textures to be allocated. i was expecting a way to draw a texture region (aka sub texture), but there doesn't appear to be a way.
[03:13:47] <sekao> eddyb: should i do away with spritesheets and use separate images? I assume others have run into this before...
[03:13:52] <niconii> sekao: right, that's the point of UV coordinates, which are something you'd deal with in opengl, but sprite does not expose that to you
[03:14:23] <niconii> sekao: so the problem is with sprite, which doesn't support that yet, but you gathered that already

[06:36:07] <aatch> tomaka, that's a little extreme.. I mean, it's not forcing you to use it.
[06:36:15] <bluss> cmr: well, maybe that should be fixed instead ?
[06:36:28] <cmr> bluss: it's a non-trivial property to encode correctly.

[06:36:41] <cmr> even stating the property has not been done yet I think
[06:36:43] <tomaka> I can also write a cargo crate that segfaults
[06:36:43] <bluss> right, I don't have a solution on hand
[06:36:58] <bluss> but I would have liked to resolve it
[06:37:04] <tomaka> aatch: right now library writers can rely on RAII for correctness
[06:37:20] <cmr> tomaka: that's really not true at all, as the thread::scoped issue shows.
[06:37:24] <tomaka> if library users can use mem::forget, library writers have no guarantees that their destructors will even be run
[06:37:32] <cmr> that's already the case.
[06:37:51] <cmr> destructors are never guaranteed to run right now.
[06:38:05] <bluss> maybe we can get some kind of linear types in the future that guarantee that destructors run
[06:38:22] <tomaka> right now you are guaranteed that if you have access to an object, all objects that had access to it too have seen their destructors run
[06:38:44] <bluss> tomaka: there's a bug that makes this not the case
[06:38:51] <tomaka> for example if I have a &'a mut Foo, I am sure that all objects that had a &mut Foo at one point have seen their destructors run

[06:39:28] <tomaka> which means that I can safely change the state of "Foo", return a guard, and revert the change in a destructor
[06:39:37] <tomaka> if the destructor is not run, Foo is no longer accessible so it's ok
[06:40:08] <bluss> have you commented on the RFC?
[06:40:10] <tomaka> that's also the rational for JoinGuard::join() panicking in case of an error instead of returning a Result
[06:40:17] <tomaka> bluss: yeah, I saw this RFC just now

[06:41:05] <tomaka> http://is.gd/hWIaCV
[06:41:07] <cmr> about JoinGuard or the property you stated about reachability and destructors?
[06:41:20] <aatch> "non-trivial" is kinda putting it lightly, I'm not this hole can be fixed without essentially replacing the entire type system.
[06:41:22] <tomaka> no, my last comment on the RFC (http://is.gd/hWIaCV)
[06:41:24] <bluss> tomaka: you've missed the point of the rfc, since that's where it started

[06:42:54] *** Joins: Tobba|Laptop (Tobba@moz-1hh.7ki.21.217.IP)
[06:42:54] <cmr> no? thread::scoped is completely unsafe in the presence of forget, as you point out correctly.
[06:42:56] <bluss> the RFC is about giving up using RAII to do this kind of guarantee, and scoped will have to be changed completely
[06:43:25] <cmr> it can't be used regardless of whether mem::forget is unsafe or not, since you can write mem::forget in safe code right now.
[06:43:39] <cmr> (modulo some minor nits about 'static bounds etc)
[06:44:14] <tomaka> you can't write mem::forget in safe code
[06:44:19] <bluss> so why haven't we discussed solutions that change Rc instead
[06:44:23] <tomaka> putting a ref in a RefCell is different than using mem::forget
[06:44:43] <bluss> tomaka: yes you can unfortunately
[06:45:02] <tomaka> I'll just delete my last comment on the RFC, I don't want people to focus on it while my main point is my other comment right above
[06:45:10] <bluss> sounds good
[06:45:33] <cmr> bluss: solutions that involve changing Rc have been discused, but like I mentioned, finding the property that we want to guarantee about destructors hasn't been done yet...
[06:45:50] <cmr> (see the proposed "Leak" marker trait)
[06:47:19] <cmr> I suspect the only workable solution in any deterministic timeframe is using closures and a callback-style api, a la https://gist.github.com/arielb1/5eb299a87546ce8829b3

[07:03:54] <tomaka> I'm relying a lot on destructors being run in hlua
[07:04:08] <tomaka> in fact hlua is more or less black magic
[07:04:32] <cmr> you should bring it up as a usecase of guaranteed destructor running, though I wonder how it fares in the face of unwinding.
[07:04:39] <tomaka> and since rules are very strict I fear that users might be tempted to just write mem::forget
[07:05:03] <tomaka> which would make the whole library fall into pieces
[07:05:12] <cmr> I agree that leaning on RAII can make very nice, correct code.
[07:06:12] <tomaka> I should write some kind of blogpost about the design of hlua in general
[07:06:24] <tomaka> because I did some serious brainstorming
[07:06:46] <cmr> I think it's the nicest access to lua I've seen in any language, fwiw :)
[07:07:19] <tomaka> that's not true, as I wrote the same thing in C++ a few years ago :D
[07:07:29] <cmr> well, I didn't see it ;)
[07:07:35] <tomaka> but it's less safe in C++ obviously
[07:07:54] <tomaka> it's safe as long as you follow the instructions

[08:38:03] <tomaka> I'm writing a long post about its design right now
[08:38:21] <tomaka> This could be a good illustration of Rust's awesomeness when it comes to safety
[08:38:51] <aatch> What library is this?
[08:38:55] <cmr> hlua
[08:39:19] <aatch> which is?

[08:39:32] <cmr> https://github.com/tomaka/hlua tomaka's highlevel lua bindings.
[08:39:52] <OmniMancer> I assume even in rust there are rules, like don't put the RAII guards in Rc loops
[08:40:30] <tomaka> OmniMancer: Well, I see it like this: rules prevent you from doing complex things
[08:40:58] <tomaka> if you're asking yourself "is it a problem if I put this thing in an Rc?", you'll probably come to the conclusion: "better safe than sorry"
[08:41:24] <tomaka> instead of Rust guarantees you that nothing you do can be wrong, you unlock endless possibilities of crazy code

[12:29:33] <OmniMancer> you can avoid C strings when talking to lua

[12:29:56] <tiffany> all of lua's string functions have explicit length fields yeah

[12:30:30] <libfud> is it similar to python?

[12:30:45] <OmniMancer> lua actually interns all strings I believe
[12:30:48] <libfud> ah
[12:31:00] <tiffany> but instead of objects and arrays it just has tables
[12:31:27] <tiffany> which is like a hash table and an array in one data structure, with some operator overloading built in
[12:31:36] <libfud> I see
[12:32:03] <OmniMancer> well it's a map
[12:32:09] <libfud> does it allow for lexical scoping
[12:32:12] <OmniMancer> that has an optimisation for sequential integers
[12:32:15] <tomaka> also, lua indexes from 1
[12:32:18] <tomaka> which is confusing :o)
[12:32:28] <tomaka> array[1] is the first element
[12:32:33] <OmniMancer> indexing from 1 is IMO incorrect

[12:32:39] <libfud> OmniMancer: I agree
[12:32:47] <tiffany> 'local var = foo' declares a lexically scoped variable
[12:32:52] <libfud> slicing syntax used to really screw me up
[12:32:54] <OmniMancer> but it doesn't matter which you do, you still end up with places where it is terrible

[12:34:15] <OmniMancer> tiffany: not errors until they are :P
[12:34:19] <libfud> what
[12:34:32] <tiffany> a variable which doesn't exist will resolve to nil
[12:34:50] <OmniMancer> calling a function that doesn't exist doesn't error until the call actually happesn
[12:35:00] <tiffany> there is a thing called strict.lua which makes invalid accesses to the global namespace cause an error
[12:35:06] <tiffany> but it doesn't help with tables
[12:35:13] <libfud> I see
[12:35:30] <libfud> this is unrelated to lua, but on the subject of bad decisions in language design
[12:35:38] <libfud> why is assignment in comparison expressions legal in C?
[12:35:48] <tiffany> convenience
[12:35:59] <OmniMancer> because the assignment returns the assigned value
[12:36:08] <tiffany> assignment is an expression so you can assign for and check the result of an expression in one line
[12:36:19] <OmniMancer> yea
[12:36:27] <OmniMancer> it isn't a problem until you meant to use ==
[12:36:50] <tiffany> the compiler will warn you if you use = without wrapping it up in some "yes, I'm sure" syntax
[12:37:20] <OmniMancer> it will now
[12:37:23] <libfud> been a while since I wrote C, I don't recall gcc doing that (but then I don't think I hardly ever wrote if foo = bar
[12:37:28] <libfud> )
[12:37:32] <aatch> clang does it
[12:37:43] <aatch> you have to use an extra set of parens
[12:37:54] <OmniMancer> yea
[12:38:00] <libfud> when I was testing out calling rust stuff from C, I switched to clang
[12:38:07] <libfud> because GCC gave horrible error messages
[12:38:20] <libfud> I just can not understand why they told the clang folks to shove off
[12:38:38] <tomaka> yay I launched a debate about lua :D
[12:39:04] <tiffany> it was because RMS doesn't want it to be possible to use gcc in closed source software
[12:39:21] <tiffany> like writing proprietary compiler backends by using something akin to libclang to extract the AST
[12:39:40] <aatch> In other news, I now have a bunch of brightly-colored spheres bouncing around!
[12:40:03] <libfud> I wonder when mitchmindtree will implement canvases in conrod
[12:40:12] <OmniMancer> AFAIK gcc is specifically architected to be twisted and tightly coupled everywhere to ensure that you can't separate out one piece easily
[12:40:26] <tiffany> it's still architected like that
[12:40:37] <OmniMancer> yes
[12:40:41] <libfud> an unfortunate side effect of linux using the gnu toolchain
[12:40:50] <libfud> is how horribly hard it is to build it using some other toolchain
[12:41:04] <tiffany> there was an argument on the gcc mailing list about people wanting to use gcc for autocompletion for C++ in emacs
[12:41:05] <OmniMancer> specifically to make sure that if you want to make a tool using it you must contribute it to the gcc source or atleast give out the source
[12:41:15] <tiffany> which would have required full AST output
[12:41:26] <OmniMancer> clang is much nicer
[12:42:08] <tiffany> RMS demonstrated just how little he knows about C++
[12:42:29] <libfud> to be fair, if I could bother to get away with knowing no C++
[12:42:30] <libfud> I would
[12:42:43] <tiffany> well
[12:42:56] <tiffany> RMS doesn't really know about any programming language that didn't exist in 1985
[12:43:09] <OmniMancer> well didn't they not allow C++ in gcc until a short while ago?
[12:43:19] <libfud> he's so wizardly in lisp he doesn't need to
[12:43:19] <libfud> lol
[12:43:41] <tiffany> gcc is written in C++ now, although at this point it's not really a short while ago
[12:43:52] <libfud> kidding, of course, but the man does have undeniable mastery with lisp
[12:43:58] <tiffany> but yeah RMS pretty much only knows lisp and C
[12:44:39] <aatch> I think RMS has gradually become more and more detached from reality over the years. He's gone from idealist to idealogue to nut case over the past 30-40 years
[12:44:47] <OmniMancer> anyway we have clang now so we don't have to care that gcc is weird :P
[12:45:04] <libfud> aatch: unfortunately so, but he is still cool to talk to imo

[12:50:30] <tiffany> I've heard of musl but I don't dislike glibc enough to switch

[12:50:49] <tiffany> its allocator is just as awful as glibc's
[12:51:00] <libfud> a lot of packages break because of bad behaviour inherent to glibc

[12:52:29] <libfud> if nothing else, you could say that finding those bugs has been a large positive

[15:13:13] <tiffany> I'm not terribly impressed with hlua
[15:13:31] <tiffany> I was thinking of making a thing which would track values currently on the stack using the type system
[15:14:25] <tiffany> I don't think this really counts as "almost free" if it needs to faff with Result values every single time you want to access the stack

[15:19:18] <tomaka> just add a method that reads without checking for the type
[15:19:39] <tiffany> yeah but then you have to rely on the programmer to not screw it up
[15:19:44] <tiffany> rather than having the type system guarantee it
[15:20:14] <tomaka> but how do you want to make the type system guarantee it if you don't knwo the type in advance?
[15:20:32] <tiffany> well, you can provide an up-front validator

[15:21:53] <tomaka> you can write closures as functions, and it does exactly what you described
[15:22:11] <tiffany> like extern "C" fn my_func(L: *mut lua_State) -> c_int { let stack = Stack<LNumber, LString, LString, LTable>::new(L); ... }
[15:22:12] <tomaka> if you pass a |a: i32, b: bool| it will load the values from the stack (checking the types), then pass them to the function
[15:22:26] <tiffany> okay

[17:00:44] <dlc> I think it would be nice to add some benches for the drawing of the different widgets in Conrod, but it looks like the GlGraphics::draw method needs a Viewport and I am not sure how to get the information without a RenderArgs event. Anyone know?
[17:05:54] <mindtree> dlc: benches would be great! is there any reason you can't use an event_iter (like in the all_widgets example) that will produce the Render(args) event?
[17:07:07] <libfud> mindtree: do you think it may be easier to implement custom traits if you make the mouse module not private?
[17:07:26] <libfud> or is there something publicly exposed for me to use?

[17:09:03] <libfud> ok
[17:09:11] <libfud> how should I say that my widget has been selected?
[17:09:20] <dlc> mindtree, because the benchmark functions in rust work by taking a Bencher iterator that is used to run whatever one wants to bench, using that iterator inside of the other I think would give invalid results
[17:09:24] <libfud> similarly to button, but such that it doesn't immediately perform an action if left-clicked
[17:09:35] <libfud> selecting it would chnage the state
[17:09:36] <libfud> hmm
[17:09:43] <mindtree> libfud: actually yeah, it would be handy for abstracting parts of the `.set` implementation into different functions wouldn't it
[17:09:58] <libfud> so, it'd be something similar to a widget matrix I guess, and only one part of the widget could be selected at any given time

[17:28:34] <mindtree> XMPPwocky: It used to be completely broken, I tried fixing it the other day and it seems to draw the right size now, but the res is definitely strange
[17:30:00] <Amaranth> I know why they really give the two different sizes, it's so you can scale your UI and such based on effective window size
[17:30:08] <Amaranth> It just makes things more complicated to think about
[17:31:08] <Amaranth> Sorry, got a bit more stream of consciousness there than normal, need more caffeine :D
[17:31:37] <mindtree> XMPPwocky: any ideas on fixing it at all?
[17:31:55] <kvark> Amaranth: it makes sense to me. In games, UI is often layed out in its own coordinates. In the OS, the situation is not too different now.
[17:31:57] <XMPPwocky> no clue, sorry

[17:32:55] <tiffany> it's very easy to deal with if you just define your UI in terms of real-world units like points or millimeters
[17:33:35] <Amaranth> XMPPwocky, mindtree: On Windows you need a manifest entry
[17:33:48] <libfud> mindtree: font size is u32?
[17:33:50] <kvark> tiffany: right, that's why window size is in points, not pixels https://github.com/PistonDevelopers/viewport/blob/master/src/lib.rs#L12
[17:34:03] <tiffany> oh

[17:35:43] <mindtree> what is "points" in regards to window size? some arbitrary scale for moving between different dpi?
[17:35:59] <tiffany> points are a customary unit, 1/72 of an inch iirc
[17:36:09] <mindtree> tiffany: oh right! I had no idea
[17:36:17] <tiffany> yeah

[17:37:06] <mindtree> tiffany: ahh
[17:37:13] <Amaranth> Except they're only 1/72" if you have your monitor and scaling factor setup correctly, it's not doing some conversion or something for you
[17:37:40] <tiffany> it's mostly used as a virtual unit yeah
[17:37:49] <tiffany> there's often no way to ensure that it actually maps to reality
[17:37:52] <tiffany> and sometimes, that isn't even desired
[17:38:01] <tiffany> e.g. zooming in, changing UI scale
[17:38:15] * mindtree goes to add an issue to conrod to discuss using virtual units instead of pixels
[17:38:47] <dlc> What does all of this mean for benchmarking graphics? There needs to be some kind of standard Viewport that is used?

[22:32:23] <Layl> kvark, pong
[22:32:44] <kvark> have you figured out the shader logs?
[22:32:48] <Layl> I have not
[22:33:13] <kvark> we are printing it with error!, using the "log" crate
[22:34:14] <kvark> to see it on the screen, you need to use the log crate as well as env_logger, call env_logger::init() somewhere at the start of your app, and then run it with "RUST_LOG=debug <your_app>" (for example)
[22:35:17] <Layl> honestly it feels a bit iffy to have a graphics library do logging automatically instead of returning that error for me to handle
[22:35:20] <kvark> it's pretty inconvenient due to how logging now works in rust. It didn't use to require env_logging interaction
[22:35:55] <Layl> I would personally really rather have that any error information is inlcuded in the error that's returned
[22:36:01] <cmr> Layl: that's how the graphics APIs work though.
[22:36:24] <cmr> it's really inefficient to extract full error information on every call.
[22:36:36] <kvark> Layl: totally. A kind person tried to fix this earlier with https://github.com/gfx-rs/gfx-rs/pull/657 but he didn't end up finishing it
[22:36:48] <Layl> cmr, well hopefully an error doesn't happen every call
[22:37:06] <Layl> so no information has to be extracted
[22:37:27] <kvark> Layl: even if it doesn't error, there can still be information, in general
[22:37:31] <kvark> like warnings or hints
[22:37:51] <Layl> I consider a warning coming from an API as an error generally myself
[22:38:45] <Layl> still, I just don't think the graphics api should be doing things like logging, what if the library that uses it wants to record detailed debugging information and send it back

[22:40:02] <ty> tomaka: Drawing commands have no effect :|
[22:40:17] <kvark> Layl: but I don't mind just returning the log to the user really, we just haven't reached a sound design on this (see the PR I linked earlier)
[22:41:29] <cmr> we still don't have any KHR_debug handling I think
[22:42:00] <Layl> kvark, what if you return a struct as value in the enum?
[22:42:02] <kvark> cmr: there is an issue to add it, yeah
[22:42:10] <Layl> so, you've got the enum with different shader error types
[22:42:24] <Layl> and one can be: LinkError(LinkErrorData)

[22:43:03] <Layl> doesn't matter if it just contains .log, it makes it clear what it is
[22:43:44] <kvark> Layl: two questions to this proposal
[22:43:57] <kvark> Layl: 1) you want to ignore the log entirely if the link is success?
[22:44:19] <kvark> there is no second yet
[22:44:52] <Layl> well you can go the consider warnings as errors route, though I've had problems before with that causing crashes when switching from nvidia to amd
[22:45:22] <Layl> alternatively, you can create a variation on Result<> that also has a warning
[22:45:36] <Layl> that contains both the warning data and the value, and returns the value on .unwrap()

[22:46:13] <kvark> what if the info log says "Compilation succeeded"
[22:46:22] <Layl> if we don't know either way if it's a warning or an error, then all we really can do is treat it as an error
[22:46:44] <Layl> also, iirc opengl has no output in log if there was no error or warning
[22:47:05] <kvark> Layl: nope
[22:47:14] <Layl> don't know about other APIs
[22:47:17] <kvark> it can print anything it likes, regardless of the success/failure
[22:47:39] <Layl> hm, and I guess you can only detect an error right, not a warning?
[22:47:45] <kvark> yes
[22:48:16] <Layl> and the log can only be requested right after linking I guess
[22:48:22] <Layl> linking or compiling
[22:48:22] <kvark> Basically, whatever interface we come up with has to obey 2 rules. 1) support info log for both errors/warnings/whaverer, and 2) support not querying the logs if the user doesn't need them
[22:48:38] <kvark> yes, compiling also has info logs
[22:48:45] <Layl> how long can you wait until you can request the log no more
[22:48:52] *** bvssvni is now known as bvssvni_
[22:49:00] <kvark> forever
[22:49:11] <kvark> the log stays in GL context until the next recompilation/relink
[22:49:15] <Layl> then why not put a get log on the resulting program
[22:49:33] <kvark> Layl: that's a bright idea :)
[22:49:49] <kvark> it fulfills both of my requirements
[22:50:21] <kvark> we just keep being locked in a functional-style programming box
[22:50:32] <kvark> this case needs more imperativeness to be sound
[22:51:56] <Layl> sidenote, hopefully I can get by friday a nice start on a UI library written using gfx-rs working
[22:52:00] <kvark> Layl: there is a bit of a problem though
[22:52:13] *** Joins: lenstr (lenstr@moz-50s.vju.25.171.IP)
[22:52:23] <kvark> Layl: sounds promising ;)
[22:52:35] <Layl> what's the problem?
[22:52:48] <kvark> Layl: the problem is that the user typically just calls link_program, passing down the sources for VS and FS.
[22:53:04] <kvark> so the user doesn't have VS/FS shader handles, so he would unable to query the compilation logs for them
[22:53:07] *** Quits: lenstr (lenstr@moz-50s.vju.25.171.IP) (A TLS packet with unexpected length was received.)
[22:53:16] <kvark> only for the linkage, which may contain nothing useful
[22:53:43] <Layl> well why not let the get logs on Program return a struct with the logs for everything
[22:54:24] <kvark> because the associated shader objects may not be alive any more?
[22:54:47] <Layl> can you keep just a handle to get their logs alive?
[22:55:04] <Layl> through .get_log_handle or something similar
[22:55:19] *** Quits: fmtq (fmtq@moz-d08itp.tpgi.com.au) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[22:56:05] <kvark> we could keep all the object handles alive, yes
[22:56:10] *** Quits: bluss (bluss@moz-ec5o68.cust.bredbandsbolaget.se) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[22:56:27] <kvark> and store it within the program
[22:56:32] <Layl> though, what's the harm in keeping the handles for the VS/FS alive
[22:56:56] <kvark> not sure, it's just the resources that are never going to be used, I suppose
[22:57:01] *** Quits: tokamach (tom@moz-k9q.58r.209.90.IP) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[22:57:09] *** Joins: fmtq (fmtq@moz-d08itp.tpgi.com.au)
[22:57:17] <Layl> I guess that will also depend on the graphics API
[22:57:33] <kvark> alternatively, we could return all the handles in link_program, and the user then figures out if he needs to keep them, query their logs, or toss everything but the program handle
[22:57:58] <Layl> that would be another option yea
[22:58:13] <kvark> thinking about other APIs though, they don't have a concept of a program like GL does
[22:58:32] <kvark> so they'll need to keep all the shader handles alive
[22:58:44] <Layl> then you'll have to build that abstraction yourself
[22:58:45] <kvark> so perhaps doing it for GL is just going to be more consistent with others
[22:58:56] <kvark> Layl: yes, that was the idea.
[22:59:40] <Layl> probably once mantle hits people will want a library that builds abstractions on top of mantle anyways
[22:59:45] <Layl> not everyone needs the to-the-metal power
[23:00:08] <kvark> Layl: thank you for the discussion, I believe we definitely advanced on the logging front
[23:00:21] <Layl> I'm glad to help
[23:01:05] <kvark> Layl: abstracting a program would allow us to guarantee that all the contained shaders work correctly with each other. Same guarantee we do now with a Batch concept in regards to shader parameters and mesh attributes.
[23:01:25] *** Quits: kmcguire_ (kmcguire@moz-pg1gb9.biz.rr.com) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[23:01:32] <kvark> so we'll keep this interface of program linkage, supposedly, when adding support for Mantle and such
[23:01:35] <Layl> quick question, what's a draw state for?
[23:01:48] *** Joins: bluss (bluss@moz-ec5o68.cust.bredbandsbolaget.se)
[23:01:48] <kvark> it's the rasterizer state
[23:01:52] <Layl> ah I see
[23:02:02] <kvark> depth/stencil/blending/primitive assembly/multisampling/etc
[23:03:47] <kvark> https://github.com/gfx-rs/gfx-rs/issues/656
[23:04:22] <Layl> and I assume slice is a way to define how the data should be sliced
[23:05:36] <kvark> defines the subset of vertices
[23:06:21] <Layl> alright sweet I've got what I need to get this up and running tomorrow then
[23:06:22] *** Quits: Lilly (Lilly@moz-pfkvo9.bredband.comhem.se) (Quit: bajs)
[23:06:25] <kvark> with either just a range, or also supplying an index buffer
[23:06:30] <Layl> hopefully I'll have something presentable on friday, when my deadline is
[23:06:51] <kvark> Layl: wut. That's a challenge then, if you are just starting...
[23:07:14] <Layl> I'm already experienced with opengl, I've written engines before
[23:07:23] <Layl> as well as UI libraries
[23:07:37] <Layl> I've got two entire work days, I've written a GUI library before in 1
[23:07:45] <Layl> shouldn't be too hard
[23:07:50] <kvark> oh man, crossing fingers for you :)
[23:08:01] <Layl> feelin' the stress
[23:08:16] <Layl> I already know I'm not gonna hit all 3 cards, but I can do the first 2
