[17:04:14] <doener> oops
[17:04:47] <doener> looks like the micro optimization for dereferencing rvalue boxes is the problem
[17:04:53] <Luqman> no, got sidetracked with other stuff
[17:08:39] <Luqman> doener: ah, in expr::deref_once::deref_owned_pointer ?
[17:08:46] <doener> Luqman: right
[17:11:34] <doener> Luqman: hm, though, if we were to create an Lvalue there, we'd still get the scope wrong
[17:14:26] <doener> scratch that... the lvalue would get an alloca, and that will dominate the use regardless
[17:14:33] <Luqman> doener: maybe we need to push a custom cleanup scope for every arm body?
[17:16:11] <doener> we do that, but the deref expression gets the cleanup scope of the function body, because it is a "trailing" expession for the match which in turn is the trailing expression for the body (sorry if I got the terminology wrong here)
[17:16:29] <doener> deref_owned_pointer goes by ast scope

[17:32:45] <kmc> Manishearth: what do you think are the most common Rust pitfalls? not the concepts people have trouble grasping, or common mistakes the compiler catches, but the stuff where a beginner would write code that compiles and does something unexpected
[17:32:50] <kmc> or just anyone who isn't 100% paying attention
[17:33:03] <kmc> also #rust-internals might be a better place, sorry
[17:33:09] <Manishearth> nah it's fine
[17:33:25] <kmc> I might do a blog post about this
[17:33:35] <Manishearth> I want to too :P
[17:33:40] <Manishearth> But I'll never reach it, so you go ahead
[17:33:43] <Manishearth> um
[17:33:44] <Manishearth> hmm
[17:34:04] <Manishearth> Arrays vs vectors vs slices vs blargh
[17:34:08] <kmc> so far I have:  byte indexing for utf8 strings; integer types and integer overflow being different from C
[17:34:11] <kmc> macros are weird
[17:34:12] <Luqman> doener: so, i guess the comment on deref_owned_pointer is somewhat wrong "The language rules ensure that the contents will be used (or moved) before the free occurs."
[17:34:12] <Manishearth> &static str, String, &str
[17:34:19] <Manishearth> yes yes yes byte indexing
[17:34:22] <kmc> never alias &mut even if you "think" it's safe
[17:34:24] <Manishearth> um
[17:34:34] <kmc> isn't String vs &str in the category of things where the compiler and existing docs help you?
[17:34:40] <Manishearth> impl Trait {}
[17:34:50] <kmc> I'm much more interested in silently broken code
[17:34:52] <Manishearth> kmc: people still use &str where STring should be used
[17:34:54] <Manishearth> oh
[17:34:56] <Manishearth> hm
[17:35:08] <kmc> every language is going to have some mistakes that are easier to make than they should be
[17:35:14] <Manishearth> yes
[17:35:15] <kmc> we need to continually categorize them and try to eliminate them
[17:35:33] <Manishearth> Iactually had a perfect example of this in the morning -- at least I think I had -- but I forgot :/
[17:35:43] <Manishearth> I jsut have this strong feeling of deja vu here
[17:35:45] * Manishearth thinkgs
[17:35:47] <kmc> the alternative is the traditional systems programming approach where you memorize all the problems and act superior to everyone who has better things to do with their time :P
[17:35:49] <doener> Luqman: no, the value is used/moved. The cleanup happens too late in this case.
[17:35:57] <kmc> Manishearth: cool
[17:36:02] <doener> Luqman: or rather, on a code path where the value doesn't necessarily exist

[17:37:23] <Manishearth> Or just silently compiling wrongness?
[17:37:24] <kmc> potentially
[17:37:31] <kmc> needing UnsafeCell and avoiding aliasing &mut T unconditionally is definitely on this list
