[00:01:22] <cmr> I'm curious how those changes happen.
[00:01:51] <WindowsBunny> Either bindgen is very very wrong, or the headers you used are very very wrong, or when you were reformatting you did a lot of very very wrong mistakes
[00:06:28] <cmr> Looks like it was a sed gone wrong, used a \2 when I should have used a \3 (or something similar, it looks like I clobbered the return type with the this type.
[00:06:47] <cmr> My bad.

[00:11:05] <Layl> csherratt, I think I've fixed it but the examples seem to attempt to get the git version of gfx_graphics, any clue on what I might be doing wrong?

[00:16:30] <Layl> it's pushed
[00:17:30] <kmcguire> cmr, haha /passiveaggressive, because it just feels good sometimes
[00:19:37] <csherratt> Layl: it looks like piston itself depends on gfx_graphics. So having piston as a dev dependency grabs the one from git
[00:20:06] <Layl> that's annoying, so I can't test if it works then I guess
[00:20:25] <Layl> I really guessed at a few of the new needed parameters

[00:24:14] <cmr> Neither am I, but when I'm binding hundreds of things I really don't have the patience for it.
[00:24:24] <Layl> csherratt, want me to just put up a pull request so you can look over it?

[00:25:49] <aatch> WindowsBunny, you're not in politics, are you?
[00:25:56] <WindowsBunny> aatch: No
[00:26:22] <csherratt> Layl: I think you might have found a bug in Cargo. I am trying to use the `paths` override and even it wont seem to ignore this. Something to do with the `piston2d` prefix I would guess.
[00:26:37] <Layl> odd
[00:26:41] <Layl> it's a really trivial update though
[00:26:56] <Layl> mostly I'm worried about the changes to renderer.draw

[10:21:47] <tomaka> today I learned that you could theoretically use primitive restart with glDrawArrays
[10:22:08] <tomaka> which means that you could say that the vertex #n is actually not a vertex but a primitive restart
[10:22:19] <tomaka> they removed it in 4.5 because nobody implemented it
[10:22:28] <Esption> And what's a primitive restart?
[10:22:39] <tomaka> If you draw with a triangle strip for example
[10:22:54] <tomaka> You can pass the indices [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, PRIMITIVE_RESTART, 12, 13, 14, 15, ...]
[10:23:11] <tomaka> it will draw from 0 to 5 as a single triangle strip, and 12 to 15 as a single trangle strip
[10:23:16] <tomaka> it won't connect 4, 5 and 12

[15:10:38] <csherratt2> @kvark The big reason globs are problematic is that adding a trait can break an downstream component, even if they don't use that trait. In addition, it can cause name space collisions if they already have a structure with that name.

[15:21:55] <csherratt2> kvark: I do. We can use it internally for mod imports, but any example should probably be shown using the traits directly. It also stops us from making more traits then we need to.

[15:59:55] <csherratt2> @kvark It lets you glob data onto a entity, and then send it to a `sink`. In my case a sink either a hashtable or a channel.
[16:00:40] <kvark> do you have to have an enum for the components?
[16:02:17] <csherratt2> That's where it gets cool. You can bind _anything_ you don't need a predefined enum. As long as the sink understands the types, and how to use them it is fine.
[16:02:37] *** Quits: erickt (erickt@moz-4hh.6p3.217.74.IP) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[16:02:38] <csherratt2> If the sink does not know how to write a type out, it will assert a compile time error.
[16:02:54] <kvark> csherratt2: is it for ECS or some other kind of a system?
[16:03:12] <csherratt2> It's the EC of the ECS.
[16:03:48] *** Joins: erickt (erickt@moz-4hh.6p3.217.74.IP)
[16:04:59] <csherratt2> The idea is that if you writing to position system, and a graphics system you can create a new entity, bind the position, the infromation on how to draw it. The sink will split the writes to go to the correct place.
[16:05:21] *** Joins: SpaceManiac (Tad@moz-g50q8a.dyn.suddenlink.net)
[16:05:38] <kvark> csherratt2: ok, so the sink solves the problem of synchronization between systems?
[16:07:05] <csherratt2> Yes, I am trying to see if the snowstorm model will work. So the systems downstream are being written to by upstream components. The writes get converted into changelists, the downstream system reads the changelist and applies it to its state and does magic.
[16:10:54] <csherratt2> The nice part about this is that the downstream systems can work while the upstream compnents are still producing work. The position system for example needs to populate dirty flags for when things are changed. This can cause cache misses ect, but since it is done on another thread and not by the upstream component it `downloads` the cost downstream.

[17:19:00] <XMPPwocky> sorry :P anyways, Rust has a small standard library compared to many other languages because of its stability guarantees
[17:19:07] <Soulfoam> XMPPwocky, but not every game is 3D :P. Also cmr no worries I understand, I don't feel offended or like you guys are being aggressive.
[17:19:18] <XMPPwocky> if rust shipped with a graphics API that turned out to not be very good, it'd have to be kept around at least until rust 2.0
[17:19:20] <Tiffany> OpenGL isn't actually a 3D graphics API though
[17:19:27] <Tiffany> it is explicitly neutral in how many dimensions you have
[17:20:06] <agmcleod> I remember reading this with webgl anyways
[17:20:13] <cmr> Soulfoam: the short answer to your question is I don't know of any nice libraries that don't boil down to using OpenGL right now.
[17:20:22] <agmcleod> that it's really a 2d api, you use perspective math to "make it" 3d
[17:20:35] <cmr> There's Cairo bindings, so you could draw into a texture and then draw that somehow (using the x11 etc crates directly)
[17:20:44] <Tiffany> that's a bit of a stretch agmcleod
[17:20:44] <Soulfoam> I'm a tad worried in the resources Rust has I think overall, since it is new. I mean there are a crap ton of resources right now and this IRC chat and such, but I feel like a lot of "Common problems" are yet to be posted and answered easily findable with a simply Google search. I could be dead wrong though.

[17:20:55] <Tiffany> seeing how it has built in concepts of things like depth buffers
[17:21:17] <cmr> Soulfoam: no, you're pretty much right, the depth of writen resources isn't nearly as deep as older communities.
[17:21:19] <Soulfoam> cmr there are libraries that don't deal with OpenGL directly, correct? I don't mind if they boil down to using OpenGL, but libraries that don't directly deal with OpenGL calls etc.
[17:21:28] <Tiffany> oh
[17:21:29] <Soulfoam> Well having ME DEAL with OpenGL calls directly etc.
[17:21:35] <Tiffany> most of the libraries don't make you do GL calls directly, no
[17:22:01] <agmcleod> gfx-rs from my experience is like working with opengl in terms of buffers and such, but it abstracts the actual calls away from you
[17:22:01] <Tiffany> they wrap it up in their own APIs
[17:22:06] <agmcleod> there's piston graphics which takes it further
[17:22:39] <cmr> Soulfoam: yeah. in terms of "raw" graphics access there's glium and gfx-rs, further away in abstraction you have piston's graphics crate.
[17:22:50] <Soulfoam> What 2D graphics library is there for Rust that wouldn't slaughter me making me use OpenGL calls directly?
[17:23:13] <cmr> I'm not a huge fan of the approach https://github.com/PistonDevelopers/graphics uses but it's pretty popular and easy to use.
[17:23:31] <XMPPwocky> it's probably not super hard to write a simple draw_rect function over glium
[17:23:48] <XMPPwocky> which just takes in a transformation for a 1x1 square, and draws that with a texture
[17:23:56] <agmcleod> cmr, what library/crates do you use with rust if i may ask?

[17:47:05] <csherratt2> Texture cannot support Clone because it deletes the texture when it drops. So if you did a clone by just copying it the first one to drop would corrupt the other's state.
[17:47:25] <desophos> hmm
[17:48:04] <csherratt2> You might be able to throw the Texture in an Rc, the Rc itself can be cloned.

[19:34:01] <fkaa> would it be possible to have a different lua frontend (different syntax), while still using its backend and possible luajit?
[19:34:18] <chc4>  yup
[19:34:22] <chc4> you could compile to Lua bytecode
[19:34:31] <chc4> and then luaJIT would run on that
[19:34:47] <chc4> or you could transpile to Lua like moonscript does
[19:36:00] <fkaa> nice :o
[19:36:28] <fkaa> so interpreted lua also compiles to bytecode at runtime?
[19:36:35] <Tiffany> the language would have to be sufficiently lua-like to run decently
[19:36:44] <Tiffany> it does
[19:36:52] <fkaa> Tiffany: i'm in dire need of braces
[19:36:54] <chc4> yeah, the bytecode is pretty tightly coupled with Lua's way of thinking
[19:36:54] <Tiffany> the bytecode is more or less a 1:1 form of the language source though
[19:37:02] <Tiffany> uh
[19:37:05] <Tiffany> really, braces?
[19:37:15] <fkaa> {} squiggly majingies
[19:37:24] <chc4> Tiffany: not really? just tightly coupled with the notion of a stack and tables being quasihashes

[19:38:09] <fkaa> also some other stuff :p
[19:39:59] <Tiffany> I tried to make a typescript analog for lua once

[19:40:32] <Tiffany> don't use lpeg
[19:40:42] <Tiffany> it doesn't have error checking, it just returns false when it fails to parse

[21:09:37] <navaati> for example, the look_at function in c++'s GLM (and I guess the lookAt function in legacy opengl apis) gives this :
[21:09:44] <navaati> ((0.600000, -0.411597, 0.685994, 0.000000), (0.000000, 0.857493, 0.514496, 0.000000), (-0.800000, -0.308697, 0.514496, 0.000000), (-0.000000, -0.000000, -5.830953, 1.000000))
[21:09:50] <kvark> well I'm looking at https://www.opengl.org/sdk/docs/man2/xhtml/gluLookAt.xml

[21:10:22] <niconii> this has translation stuff at the bottom too
[21:11:14] <niconii> is it just transposed then?

[21:12:12] <niconii> okay
[21:12:17] <navaati> ah, ok
[21:12:34] <kvark> I heard that this is one of the differences with nalgebra, which is row-major
[21:12:44] <kvark> thus, cgmath should be easier to use with GL
[21:12:46] <navaati> uh, does that mean that I need to transpose the final result just before giving it to GL ?
[21:13:15] <tomaka> nalgebra is column major as well
[21:13:19] <navaati> (like, with the boolean flag in glUniformMatrix4fv ?)
[21:13:57] <kvark> tomaka: hm, I must have misunderstood it then
[21:13:58] <tomaka> you don't need to transpose the matrix normally
[21:14:39] <navaati> in nalgebra i was successful with simple transforms hand-assembled like translations and rotations, and i did not need to set the open gl transpose flag to true
[21:15:14] <tomaka> when you create a matrix with new() like in https://github.com/bjz/cgmath-rs/blob/6e560fbd03a8ec16d0d4486dbb6d3441dc71319f/src/matrix.rs#L292
[21:15:26] <tomaka> the values are passed in the order in which they are stored
[21:15:33] <tomaka> so the last four values are the last column
[21:15:40] <tomaka> even though in the source code it looks like a lin
[21:15:42] <tomaka> line*
[21:16:06] <tomaka> nalgebra takes the parameters in a different order, so that matrix columns look like columns in the source code
[21:16:16] <tomaka> but it still stores the values the same way as cgmath
[21:16:32] <kvark> tomaka: ah, so it's just the constructors that are different
[21:16:36] <tomaka> yeah
[21:17:12] <navaati> which seems to be the native opengl order. right

[21:37:50] <kvark> " rewrite my whole stuff with cgmath" sounds like a big investment ;)
[21:38:11] <navaati> my whole stuff is not big, it's just a sample code :)
[21:38:14] <kvark> navaati: I'm using cgmath heavily in gfx_scene, but not using look_at
[21:38:40] <tomaka> I'd still be more convinced if that last column was just "-eye.x * s.x", "-eye.y * u.y", "-eye.z * f.z"
[21:39:19] <kvark> tomaka: but that would be just scale, while eye vector needs to be *rotated*
[21:39:58] <tomaka> hmm, probably
[21:40:13] <tomaka> I'm now convinced that this dot product works
[21:40:45] <kvark> it's basically: eye' = mat3(s,u,f) * -eye

[21:47:05] <kvark> implementing From<> for lots of stuff, and Into<> for some more
[21:47:55] <navaati> ah, so it's the doc on rust-ci that's not up to date ^^
[21:48:25] <kvark> the docs may be out of date easily, I don't think rust-ci script works (that updates the docs)
[21:48:50] <kvark> in gfx-rs we had to switch to upload the docs on gfx-rs.github.io instead
[21:49:51] <navaati> mmmmh… « the trait `cgmath::angle::Angle<f32>` is not implemented for the type `_` [E0277] »
[21:50:24] <kvark> from what line?
[21:50:47] <fkaa> any grand plans for gfx.rs yet?

[22:38:26] <kvark> your cargo.lock was pointing to version 25, while git repo was updated to 26. Since git repo doesn't store the old version any more, cargo was unable to find a match
