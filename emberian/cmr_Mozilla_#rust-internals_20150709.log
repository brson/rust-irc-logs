[00:26:34] <Peach> Hey for Rust libraries: Would it be silly to use a byte code instead of actual compiled code for libraries - merely for the purpose of having any Rust library be cross platform (Window/Linux Distros/Mac work with the same library) ?
[00:26:54] <Peach> Or does Rust already do this? Or will it /can it ever?
[00:27:09] <brson2> Peach: seems inevitable that it will for some reason or another
[00:27:41] <brson2> Niko is working on a MIR that might serve that purpose well
[00:28:03] <Yurume> brson2: did you pinged me yesterday? :) (I see you are not in -internals, so...)
[00:28:11] <Peach> Oh really?! Because it would be SO nice for developers to download libraries without worrying about OS / processor architecture 
[00:28:17] <Peach> Like that would be AMAZING :3
[00:29:08] <brson2> Yurume: i was asking of rust-chrono was a complete replacement for the time crate
[00:29:58] <Yurume> I intend so in the long term, but currently no.
[00:30:37] <Gankro> nrc: It depends on how you define index out of bounds :)
[00:30:38] <Yurume> (at the very least, I wanted to cease the dependency on time)
[00:31:39] <nrc> Gankro: by any definition, Rust cares about preventing it, no?
[00:31:44] <brson2> Yurume: is rust-chrono otherwise complete? what does the time crate do differently, system integration stuff?
[00:31:58] <Gankro> nrc: [1, 2, 3][5]
[00:32:07] <Gankro> is that OOB?
[00:32:39] <nrc> is this a trick question?
[00:32:44] <brson2> Peach: rust will probably also have really nice webasm support eventually. JavaScript may be a very capable cross-platform VM for rust.
[00:33:58] <Elaine> Peach: Having a single binary work on all platforms isn't quite as useful because Cargo and open source.
[00:35:21] <aatch> brson2, MIR is just an intermediate representation to make analysis easier.
[00:35:46] <Elaine> aatch: MIR could be interpreted quite easily I think?
[00:35:49] <Yurume> brson2: Chrono 0.2 is usable but not yet complete, 0.3 (WIP) is what I think that should be complete. the time crate ultimately depends on ISO C time.h (and subsequent improvements on POSIX), while Chrono 0.3+ will only depend on the lowest-level OS API (e.g. gettimeofday etc. as opposed to localtime).

[00:36:08] <jroesch> and write a Rust interpreter 
[00:36:09] <jroesch> ;) 
[00:36:10] <nrc> depens on the design of the MIR
[00:36:16] <Elaine> nrc: did you see the pre-RFC?
[00:36:22] <nrc> yes
[00:36:25] <Yurume> Elaine: yes, that separates a good portion of the time crate from it :)
[00:36:35] <aatch> What? No. I'd be amazed if it was that low-level to be effectively executed.
[00:36:58] * Yurume thought this channel was #rust til seconds ago
[00:37:22] <jroesch> aatch: from my perspective an interpreter doesn't need to be fast, GHC implements a custom byte code and byte code interpreter

[00:38:08] <jroesch> the bytecode implements the semantics of STG
[00:38:19] <jroesch> as far as memory serves
[00:38:25] <jroesch> which is the next level of IR
[00:38:33] <nrc> Elaine: more that it is not complete - you still need some side tables, aiui
[00:39:09] <aatch> jroesch, "next level of IR" compared to what?
[00:39:29] <jroesch> GHC is HsSyn -> Core -> STG -> Cmm -> ASM
[00:39:50] <jroesch> and there is a separate path if you use the LLVM backend 
[00:43:51] <Elaine> nrc: Hrm, what side tables do you have in mind? 
[00:43:53] <jroesch> it would be interesting to take a small abstract machine and specify a transform down to the abstract machine, might make dealing with constant evaluation more reasonable as well 
[00:44:00] <Elaine> I guess you need type sizes.
[00:44:10] <Elaine> or, rather, representation

[00:46:09] <Elaine> Wait what?
[00:46:16] <nrc> Gankro: we insert bounds checks on every access - that is a lot more than c++
[00:46:17] <Elaine> We do bounds checks
[00:46:30] <Elaine> OOB indexing is totally bogus reads of uninit memory.
[00:46:53] <Gankro> Elaine: That's why I said it depends on how you define index out of bounds :)
[00:47:09] <Gankro> I would say indexing out of bounds is quite simply the act of *passing* an invalid index to an array
[00:47:26] <Elaine> let x = [1, 2, 3]; *x.as_ptr().offset(1000)
[00:47:32] <Elaine> I guess you could say that.
[00:47:52] <Gankro> Elaine: I'm pretty sure you know what I meant :)
[00:48:01] <Elaine> I do now, yes.
[00:48:05] <blaenk> did the discussion of scoped threads ever go anywhere?
[00:48:14] <Elaine> From the perspective of unsafe code, that's not as relevant I think.
[00:48:23] <nrc> Elaine: I was thinking of method lookup, I guess we actually recalculate that now
[00:48:26] <Elaine> It's really any violation of LLVM "inbounds" that you care about, or other reads of uninit.

[00:50:09] <Elaine> yeah
[00:50:35] <Gankro> So that's why I don't really mention it in TURPL; it doesn't seem particularly notable to me.
[00:50:51] <Gankro> Any language that claims to be safe is *obviously* doing bounds checks
[00:51:18] <Gankro> And any language not making that claim doesn't *particularly* care about indexing out of bounds

[00:55:32] <nrc> Peach: that's why you should use an iterator for that kind of thing
[00:55:37] <aatch> Peach, slice iterators are implemented in such a way as to avoid bounds checks.
[00:56:33] <nrc> Gankro: re repr(Rust), we implicitly guarantee that the declared last field of a struct will always be the last field if it can be unsized, not sure if you should actually mention that...

[08:13:54] <blaenk> in the future it would be awesome if cargo could interface with rustc to calculate the severity of changes between versions in order to recommend a new version number that abides semver

[08:30:47] <dlight> blaenk, at very least it could verify whether the public exported types / functions / traits / etc changed in an incompatible way (from the type checking point of view)
[08:30:58] <blaenk> exactly
[08:32:56] <blaenk> https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/1793
[08:33:47] <dlight> this isn't enough to check whether semver should be bumped, because there might be incompatible changes that wouldn't trigger a compilation failure (due to mismatched types / etc)
[08:34:01] <blaenk> oh psh, cmr you coulda told me ;_;
[08:34:10] <blaenk> oh cmr isn't here
[08:34:42] <dlight> but I think that the ideal situation is to always trigger a compilation failure anyway ;-; for example, renaming a function if its behavior had to be changed

[08:37:51] <Elaine> no
[08:37:58] <Elaine> it's not cargo's place really
[08:38:03] <Elaine> it'd just use the breakage checking tool
[08:38:08] <blaenk> oh really
[08:38:25] <blaenk> idk figured since it was cargo that associated any notion of a version (semver in particular) that's where it would go
[08:38:39] <Elaine> you don't care about semver for checking for API changes.
[08:38:57] <Elaine> cargo would look for changes (the proposed tool) and see if there are any breaking if the version change isn't major.
[08:39:36] <Elaine> https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/8962
[08:39:38] <blaenk> yeah, that's what I'm thinking, I'm not following how that doesn't have to do with cargo
[08:40:12] <Elaine> cargo wouldn't do the breakage checking, another tool would.

[09:41:13] <doener> LLVM really needs to be able to figure that out itself...
[09:41:47] <aatch> doener, I think it can. I think the IRCE pass can manage it.
[09:42:47] <bluss> regarding the llvm passes discussion, can it hurt to add more passes? :) naively it sounds like it can't hurt to just add to the list
[09:43:45] <doener> bluss: even the order is important, sometimes passes rely on seeing a specific form of something which is produces by one pass but replaced with something else by another
[09:43:46] <aatch> bluss, well it hurts compile-time, but in theory it should cause any actual problems. Just that you can't just add them to the end of the list.
[09:44:31] <aatch> Some passes are literally inverses of each other. i.e. mem2reg and reg2mem

[16:04:10] <eternaleye> Hm. I wonder how hard it'd be to get an OIBIT for interior mutability. I suspect a GC smaht pointer could benefit enormously from it - when it takes something without interior mutability, then the GC only needs to mark it once, and future marking passes can stop on reaching it.

[22:01:20] <steveklabnik> actually
[22:01:31] <steveklabnik> that code isn't what not to do at all
[22:03:24] <Elaine> it doesn't explain how to iterate over collections though, and if you take that example and say "ok now I want to do this over a vector" you end up indexing etc.
[22:03:36] <Elaine> and the iterators section uses ranges everywhere instead of showing that collections are also iterable etc
[22:04:32] <Elaine> I can see how someone could get confused.
[22:05:30] <steveklabnik> that's true i guess
[22:05:32] <steveklabnik> i mean

[22:14:22] <steveklabnik> :)
[22:14:42] <burntsushi> does anyone know the history of `std::sync::mpsc`? it looks like its history got chopped late last year.
[22:14:57] <Elaine> burntsushi: yeah, that code has bounced around a lot.
[22:14:59] <steveklabnik> iirc it was just in std::sync before
[22:15:29] <burntsushi> Elaine, steveklabnik: mostly what i'm interested in is whether it was written/optimized for a time when we had green threads.
[22:15:56] <Elaine> You can often traverse nasty history by clicking "history" on a file, going to the earliest commit, and then clicking through to that commit's parent, and finding the file in that tree.
[22:16:00] <huon> burntsushi: you can track the entire history by looking at the first commit in its history and iterating backward
[22:16:01] <bluss> burntsushi: you can try git log --stat --follow  std/libstd/sync/mpmc/mod.rs  something like that
[22:16:10] <huon> yeah, what Elaine said
[22:16:18] <bluss> burntsushi: follow only works on a single file though
[22:16:24] <Elaine> burntsushi: I believe it has been rewritten since green threads left.
[22:16:31] <brson> burntsushi: i don't think it is optimized for green threads. it is a straight translation of the upstream source afairc
[22:16:41] <Elaine> yeah
[22:16:46] <huon> the easiest way to track its history is to ask acrichto I guess
[22:17:16] <acrichto> burntsushi: I'm familiar with it, what're you wondering?
[22:17:25] <Elaine> (upstream being http://www.1024cores.net/home/lock-free-algorithms/queues iirc)

[22:18:08] <acrichto> mpsc has not been rewritten since green threads left, it was written right as we first decided we wanted native + green
[22:18:13] <acrichto> it wasn't optimized for either particular use case
[22:18:22] <acrichto> it was written in such a way that it could be used for either use case though
[22:18:31] <burntsushi> acrichto: i have an observation ("my naive mpmc queue gets similar throughput to mpsc::sync_channel") and i'm trying to understand it better. maybe my observation is wrong. or maybe mpsc was built with an assumption that is no longer true.
[22:18:34] <acrichto> the optimizations for mpsc are all about allocating as little as possible and never touching locks
[22:18:39] <burntsushi> just trying to feel around
[22:18:44] <acrichto> oh sync_channel is super slow
[22:18:49] <acrichto> it hasn't been optimized at all
[22:19:01] <acrichto> aka it uses no atomics, only mutexes
[22:19:22] <acrichto> there's a very large implementation difference between sync_channel and channel
[22:19:47] <acrichto> burntsushi: how'd you build your mpmc channel?
[22:19:48] <burntsushi> acrichto: ahhh that explains some of it. mpsc::channel does indeed get better throughput then my own naive mpmc async channel.
[22:19:55] <burntsushi> acrichto: very naively. mutex + condvar.
[22:20:05] <acrichto> oh interesting, I figured that'd be pretty similar to sync_channel
[22:20:16] <acrichto> but I also wouldn't be surprised to found out the other way :)

[22:39:22] *** Joins: yjv_ (yjv@moz-ll38tk.pa.comcast.net)
[22:39:45] <bluss> yes 1.3.0 is the next release if you merge to master today

[22:55:53] <posix4e> bluss: heard a rumour that you were building a higher performance hashmap
[22:56:41] <bluss> ah well it's a higher performance b-tree map
[22:56:54] <bluss> it's mainly that iteration is much better since it uses parent pointers
[22:56:59] <huon> acrichto: nice, dropping `ar`!
[22:57:23] <acrichto> huon: :D
[22:57:27] * acrichto is very happy with the result

[23:13:38] <reem> What feature should I use for new stable thing?
[23:13:46] <reem> using rust1 complains
[23:14:47] *** Quits: eljay (eljay@moz-fmte10.skybroadband.com) (Quit: Leaving)
[23:15:03] <huon> was it previously unstable?
[23:15:07] <huon> if so, use that feature
[23:15:08] <reem> it previously didn’t exist
[23:15:09] <reem> an impl
[23:15:14] <huon> oh
[23:15:15] <reem> so can only be marked stable
[23:15:23] <huon> I guess we just don't mark them at all
[23:15:39] <reem> hmm, the other ones in this module are marked with rust1
[23:15:40] <bluss> shouldn't it be introduced as unstable?
[23:15:48] <bluss> reem: anyway, it should have a new feature name
[23:15:58] <bluss> reem: just descriptive new identifier
[23:16:07] <huon> bluss: impls can't be unsafe
[23:16:07] <reem> bluss: I can put anything? I don’t have to register it somewhere?
[23:16:09] <huon> erm, unstable
[23:16:19] <huon> reem: yeah, libray features are entirely adhoc
[23:17:09] <nagisa> just make up some name that makes some sense
[23:17:16] <reem> great
[23:17:32] <nagisa> you can’t use rust1, because that’s a feature unique for 1.0.0 release
[23:17:44] <reem> it is noticeably faster to do a bootstrap now than it was last time I tried it
[23:17:49] <reem> huge +1 for that
[23:18:21] <reem> I can now check-stage1-std in < 10 minutes :)
