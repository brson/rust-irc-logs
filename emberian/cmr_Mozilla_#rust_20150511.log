[03:50:44] <LeviM> Hmm. The Crates and Modules section seems to imply each create must have a module.
[03:50:59] <LeviM> Let's say I have a crate named levim
[03:51:01] <Layl> a mutable reference means you can mutate the reference to point at something else (please someone correct me if I'm wrong)
[03:51:06] <mattico> Anyone else having problems downloading from crates.io right now?
[03:51:16] <Layl> while a reference to something mutable is an immutable reference to a mutable object
[03:51:25] <LeviM> I can't put stuff directly in levim::? I have to make a module?
[03:51:52] <Layl> so, you can't do foo.thing = 5 on mut foo: &T

[03:59:29] <mbrubeck> LeviM: Don't even worry about separate crates then.  Just write all your code in one file, and if you have a `mod x { ... }` that grows too big, move its content into "x.rs" and change the main file to just say `mod x;`

[04:00:25] <LeviM> The first crate has two modules.
[04:00:44] <Layl> that's not that much of a jump compared to one module
[04:01:00] <mbrubeck> LeviM: The first four (short!) paragraphs of http://doc.rust-lang.org/book/crates-and-modules.html#multiple-file-crates explain this.  Maybe not as well as they could.
[04:01:50] <LeviM> mbrubeck: Uh, if that's what that *means* they don't explain the implication at all.
[04:01:55] <Layl> mbrubeck, personally I think it could probably use a few changes that avoid confusions with polymorphism
[04:02:05] <LeviM> They are talking about some lib.rs file
[04:02:11] <LeviM> and how you declare these modules.
[04:02:18] <LeviM> And then you put stuff in special directory structure
[04:02:20] <Layl> lib.rs file is essentially the entry point
[04:02:21] <LeviM> and it's supposed to work.
[04:02:27] <Layl> rustc builds that

[12:29:41] <nollidj> is there any reasonable support for first-class tests or metaprogramming with tests? say that i have a test suite targeting a couple of traits, and i'd like to define a bunch of test methods in a parent testing module and then have it run on the trait implementations provided by each of a list of submodules
[12:29:49] *** rkruppe_ is now known as rkruppe
[12:30:23] <nollidj> for N submodules, this seems like i need to define N #[test] declarations for each method in the suite
[12:31:06] <kimundi> nollidj: I think the best approach would be to use macros and generics to generate the same test code for multiple different implementors

[12:34:08] <nollidj> i could also just have a single test method that itself calls all the test methods, and use a generic implementing type. but that doesn't mesh well with the interface to `cargo test` and will presumably confuse other tools like anything providing test coverage analysis

[13:33:14] <tunnuz> steveklabnik, I am trying to build what you could call a symbolic algebra system
[13:33:46] <tunnuz> steveklabnik, where a I can use operators to build expressions, in this case I would like Expr == Expr to return an Expr representing the equality
[13:34:13] <steveklabnik> yeah. we talked about this, but it was basically decided not to do so
[13:34:37] <steveklabnik> == being tied to bool is nice in cases, even if it limits cases like yours. at least, for now, that's the current thought
[13:34:40] <tunnuz> steveklabnik, of course I can put Equal(a, b) where a and b are Exprs but it's a less "streamlined" way of building expressions
[13:34:56] <tunnuz> steveklabnik, that's OK, it's not a big deal

[13:35:34] <tunnuz> bluss, what do you mean?
[13:35:47] <bluss> tunnuz: the trait uses &self etc.
[13:35:47] <kimundi> I think the most streamlined we can get is a macro/attribute approach. foo!(a == b) or #[foo] (a == b)
[13:36:03] <steveklabnik> tunnuz: as you can see, that links to another issue that's open, so it's not a done deal yet

[13:36:49] <tunnuz> I must admit I haven't looked into macros yet (I know, I know)

[13:53:29] <Mutabah> I'm just interested in the possibility of an alternate compiler implementation
[13:53:40] <WindowsBunny> Its mostly just a matter of how much we can land in Rust 1.x before we give up and realize we need to make breaking changes for 2.0 :D
[13:53:53] <steveklabnik> well
[13:54:28] <steveklabnik> it's the general opinion of the team that a model more like ember 2.0 is what we'd hope to do. there's been a joke or two about having 2.0 be a 'gc' release, haha
[13:54:38] <steveklabnik> basically, the idea is that instead of breaking changes, you introduce deprecations throughout 1.x
[13:54:39] *** kimundi is now known as zz_kimundi
[13:54:44] <steveklabnik> with 'here's how to upgrade your code'
[13:54:54] <steveklabnik> and then, the only thing that 2.0 does is remove all deprecations
[13:54:57] <steveklabnik> hence the GC joke
[13:55:11] <steveklabnik> that way, anyone who's on the last release of 1.x with no warnings gets a drop-in upgrade to 2.x

[14:17:50] <fkaa> do you `.ok().unwrap()` to "unwrap" a Result?
[14:17:56] <Manishearth> I'm not really fond of freezing the online docs just because of 1.0. I can understand freezing them for a little while

[14:18:11] <steveklabnik> yeah
[14:18:15] <Fenhl> fkaa: you can just .unwrap() iirc
[14:18:40] <fkaa> what does the .ok() do?
[14:18:45] <fkaa> i've seen it a lot
[14:18:46] <steveklabnik> Result -> Option

[14:18:59] <fkaa> .unwrap panics on error?
[14:19:06] <Manishearth> yes
[14:19:10] <fkaa> neat :)

[14:20:42] <eddyb> .ok().unwrap() is an antipattern
[14:20:47] <eddyb> you see it, you kill it
[14:21:57] <jshs> with Result you have an error value, so you don't need to explain what's wrong as you do with Option::expect
[14:22:31] <Mutabah> jshs: Sometimes you want to though (context)
[14:23:14] <eddyb> prepending context is an amazing tool to have... and we don't
[14:23:25] <simias> I always thought "expect" was a weird name
[14:23:35] <tomaka> Well, if I write  "12".parse().unwrap(), the message is not very useful
[14:23:39] <simias> since the parameter is what is displayed when the expactation was wrong
[14:23:52] <tomaka> but if I write   "12".parse().ok().expect("Wrong format for the number"), it's more useful

[14:30:38] <simias> if it's C owned why do you want to free it?
[14:30:47] <simias> you shouldn't free it if you don't own it

[14:32:37] <jpg> Hmm, what is the difference between CStr and CString?
[14:32:55] <geofft> CStr is like a slice (str), CString is like an owned string (String) 
[14:33:02] <simias> CString is owned
[14:33:17] <geofft> I _think_ for your use case, a custom struct with a CStr member and a Drop impl is correct?

[23:29:42] <mbrubeck> casual_llama: Okay, I just noticed that `-f=false` does not actually set `false` to false, because docopt::Value::get_bool doesn't work that way.
[23:29:54] <mbrubeck> I mean it doesn't set `falsta` to false.
[23:30:03] <steveklabnik> feels so dumb to have to box this

[23:30:28] <meh> http://sprunge.us/EXFO?rust does this API suck?
