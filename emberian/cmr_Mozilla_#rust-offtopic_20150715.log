[00:16:36] <Peach> ^
[00:17:19] <Peach> Should unix / linux ever be rewritten in a language with better cross platform support and strong type checking?
[00:17:42] <aatch> Peach, well that first criteria doesn't really make sense.
[00:18:00] <aatch> Peach, cross-platform support is irrelevant when you're building the platform itself.
[00:18:13] <Astraea> A fanless laptop makes sense
[00:18:21] <niconii> if we could put all that effort into rewriting a whole OS in another language
[00:18:29] <niconii> i'd rather just have a new OS
[00:18:33] <Peach> Could Drivers and kernels can't benefit from static analysis ?
[00:18:42] <Peach> *remove the "can't"
[00:19:05] <Peach> All current OS's are based on crufty C code
[00:19:42] <aatch> Peach, sure, and they do. Linux actually has some extra tools to help catch common mistakes, (like distinguishing "user" pointers from "kernel" pointers).
[00:19:49] <scott> People can start writing drivers in other languages today.
[00:20:04] <Peach> what if an OS was written in a newer cleaner higher level language so it runs faster and more correctly
[00:20:13] <Peach> imagine the possibilities :3
[00:20:26] <eddyb> we already have
[00:20:29] <scott> A Rust driver probably wouldn't be accepted into something like Linux today for maintainability reasons, but it could probably happen.
[00:20:44] <aatch> scott, I think somebody did, as a proof-of-concept.
[00:20:47] <eddyb> but it's a lot of work, so we only get some hoppy kernels
[00:20:54] <eddyb> aatch: yupp, ages ago

[00:21:09] <eddyb> *oops
[00:21:11] <XMPPwocky> i wrote a kernel module in rust at some point, just a PoC to see if the ffi worked
[00:21:13] <scott> It's hard to imagine anything replacing Linux for a long time.
[00:21:17] <eddyb> maybe I should let sleep take me
[00:21:40] <aatch> But yeah, an entire kernel is a lot of work. And what we have now works.
[00:22:29] <Astraea> We build on past mistakes until it collapses, e.g. IPv4 :p
[00:22:34] <aatch> The time taken to re-write an entire, usable, OS in another language is just too great. The economics jsut don't work out.

[00:23:03] <eddyb> unless you come up with magic to speed up development based on prior work
[00:23:08] <niconii> there's also not a huge incentive for people to switch over

[00:23:55] <Peach> Isn't a major problem of productivity how little C gives you out of the box?
[00:24:13] <Peach> Like if you had a low level language that gave you stack allocated maps and strings
[00:24:16] <Peach> and was smart
[00:24:31] <Peach> wouldn't that cut most of the time of the OS dev?
[00:24:45] <aatch> Peach, "smart"? Not a word OS devs like when looking at languages.
[00:25:21] <niconii> but they *already* have an OS
[00:25:34] <Lurkin> I don't think there's need to rewrite the kernel in rust.
[00:25:36] <Lurkin> Not yet anyways.
[00:25:47] <Peach> Is it conceptually possible to make low level OS programming feel like high level programming?
[00:26:05] <Astraea> If JavaScript has taught me anything it's that there's always a need to reinvent everything constantly
[00:26:21] <aatch> Peach, probably not. Sure, in some places, but only in those places that are more high-level anyway.

[00:26:42] <Lurkin> Until there's a computing problem that can't be solved with the kernel it's kind of futile, except as a research project imho.
[00:27:20] <aatch> Peach, when you're writing code that has to write specific bits in memory, then set a specifc register to a specific value, "high level" isn't really something you can have.
[00:27:33] <Peach> Awww
[00:27:51] <Lurkin> Peach check out some drivers for ARM chips.
[00:28:04] <Lurkin> That will give you a bit of an idea about the pendantry that is CPU instructions.
[00:28:10] <aatch> Peach, remember, a kernel is what lets you have all those nice higher-level features. Like memory allocation.
[00:28:26] <Peach> Well surely there can be retooling of existing codebases though - Have the source code look pretty and organized and better named,
[00:28:31] <Astraea> aatch: time to move that low level stuff into firmware then :p
[00:28:33] <Peach> there's a lot of sloppy named command line tools
[00:28:38] <Peach> in linux and elsewhere
[00:28:42] <Lurkin> I agree actually Astraea 
[00:29:24] <niconii> command line tools aren't the kernel though
[00:29:48] <Peach> Oh I'm also talking about OS design too, not just kernels
[00:29:58] <Peach> This is all theoretical of course
[00:30:29] <aatch> Peach, the problem though is that a lot of what you're saying are just truisms.
[00:30:39] <XMPPwocky> you know you're prematurely optimizing when: you save a grand total of 1 bit of memory

[00:30:55] <aatch> Peach, "The code should be better organised" is not something you can disagree with on principle.
[00:31:27] <Peach> So you mean I should say something more specific and contribute new ideas
[00:31:59] <niconii> XMPPwocky: well hey, one bit is a lot! just think of all you can store in one bit
[00:32:19] <niconii> XMPPwocky: you can store... a single 1bpp pixel
[00:32:24] <Astraea> XMPPwocky: which means you're wasting space because the cpu pulls in at least an octet :p
[00:32:28] <niconii> just stick it right in the middle of the screen
[00:32:36] <niconii> just to show how much space you saved
[00:32:58] <Lurkin2> Think of all the bits we can save if everybody was as diligent as XMPPwocky though, everybody should do their part.
[00:33:00] <niconii> of course, the code to *display* that bit will be a lot larger...
[00:33:17] <XMPPwocky> Astraea: i was doing prime sieving and was considering starting indices into a BitVec at 1 instead of 0 (because 0 is meaningless)
[00:33:18] <aatch> "Look after the bits and the bytes look after themselves"
[00:33:20] <XMPPwocky> so it's a BitVec already
[00:33:41] <XMPPwocky> actually, 1 isn't necessary either
[00:33:43] <Astraea> Gah, I hate sieving
[00:33:47] <XMPPwocky> that's a potential /two-bit/ saving
[00:33:53] <Astraea> That's a rabbit hole of optimizations
[00:34:13] <niconii> oh yeah
[00:34:21] <XMPPwocky> ofc, the extra instructions to fix the indexes probably would use even more space
[00:34:21] <Astraea> Well... Finding primes in general I should say
[00:34:24] <niconii> we've upgraded from a 1bpp pixel to a 2bpp pixel
[00:34:30] <niconii> that's four whole colors you can choose from

[04:20:57] <Manishearth> not sure why Windows was banned, let's wait for Elaine to comment on it
[04:22:34] <Mutabah> Manishearth: There was a meme-ish joke, referencing the mastercard ads
[04:22:59] <Elaine> Because if their conduct in #rust-gamedev, and the subsequent comment "I regret nothing"
[04:23:06] <Mutabah> However, I didn't see any concrete reason for the ah
[04:23:18] <Mutabah> Elaine: Mind putting the reason in the kick message next time?
[04:23:48] <Elaine> Does it really matter?
[04:24:13] <Astraea> I think so
[04:24:19] <Mutabah> Well, there were people asking why WB was banned
[04:24:24] <Astraea> Otherwise it spawns discussions like this
[04:24:44] <Mutabah> In the absence of a reason, it's assumed the ban is related to their most recent comment in this channel
[04:25:42] <Astraea> Also I'm not in rust-gamedev so in still lost. Darn dead laptop, irc on a phone is miserable!
[04:28:11] <Manishearth> Elaine: fair enough
[04:29:47] <Manishearth> Mutabah: no memes rule only applies to reddit, and we take that one lightly anyway

[04:30:05] <Mutabah> Manishearth: Yep, which is why I was confused

[04:51:40] <Astraea> So some important people are supposed to be stopping by work tomorrow and people were told to dress up a bit more
[04:51:50] <Astraea> And here I am with purple hair...
[04:58:45] <Mutabah> Astraea: Well, make sure you're properly colour coordinated
[04:59:37] <Astraea> Tbh all I have are jeans and t-shirts. So... Hopefully no one cares, heh
[04:59:57] <Pierre_M> good luck
[05:02:42] <Astraea> I can always close my office door and pretend I'm not there. Or just come in after lunch... Hmmm...
[05:03:46] <Manishearth> Astraea: you were told to dress up, not dress up more formally
[05:03:53] <Manishearth> pick the wackiest outfit
[05:04:10] <Manishearth> :P
[05:04:43] <Manishearth> (as someone who has been coming to work in jeans/tshirt, sometimes shorts, I can't imagine coming to work in formal attire. Poor execs.)
[05:04:54] <Astraea> So... Jeans and a t-shirt? Lol
[05:05:08] <Astraea> I'm not imaginative with my attire
[05:05:09] <niconii> if it was just a single important person, i'd suggest just standing right behind them at all times so they can't see you
[05:05:45] <niconii> if they start to turn, quickly get behind them again
[05:05:51] <niconii> it's foolproof
[05:06:08] <Astraea> Though strangely I love formal attire, I just don't have a need to wear it ever so I don't own any
[05:06:35] <Astraea> That'd probably creep them out, heh
[05:06:43] <niconii> since you say there's multiple people though, i suggest standing behind each of them simultaneously
[05:08:17] <Astraea> That seems like a physically sound plan
[05:10:07] <niconii> huh
[05:10:39] <niconii> for a second i just saw a window in steam with a title bar that said "Untitled"
[05:11:30] <niconii> and then when the main steam window showed up, it said "#STEAM_WELCOME" at first...
[05:18:31] <whipsch> flip flops are pretty much standard attire at my workplace
[05:22:11] <Astraea> My boss wears flip flops, shorts, and a t-shirt. Heh

[06:07:22] <XMPPwocky> hm, is there a "fntools" crate or something
[06:08:08] <XMPPwocky> specifically, i want a HoF that takes a Fn[Mut/Once] returning bool, and returns a Fn[Mut/Once] returning the inverse of that
[06:09:49] <XMPPwocky> maybe a simple form of fmap, even
[06:10:05] <XMPPwocky> really, my issue is that i had a function, and i wanted to filter an iterator with it
[06:10:15] <XMPPwocky> but i needed to invert it
[06:10:38] <XMPPwocky> so i had to write .filter(|x| !my_function(x)) instead of .filter(not(my_function))
[06:11:15] <Havvy> XMPPwocky:  I think that'd be better as a macro.
[06:11:29] <Havvy> .filter(not!(my_function))
[06:11:44] <XMPPwocky> i guess
[06:12:17] <XMPPwocky> expandng to a closure?
[06:12:24] <Havvy> Yeah.
[06:12:24] <Manishearth> whipsch: I regularly roam around with no footwear at night
[06:12:26] <XMPPwocky> Havvy: the issue there is that it can't
[06:12:34] <XMPPwocky> wait, no, it could take an ident
[06:12:35] <XMPPwocky> nvm
[06:12:37] <Manishearth> but yeah, a lot of the folks here come with flopflops

[17:13:10] <Astraea> when I stopped looking into that I was getting frustrated that clang and libobjc didn't agree on stuff
[17:14:19] <mystor> kimundi: Yeah, one of the things I'm not sure how well it would work for you is your closure semantics. I don't think that implicitly closing over values between languages is a good idea. Say that you write `unsafe cpp! { floor(x) }`, are you refering to the floor in rust, or in C++? (In that case you can infer, but it can get confusing)
[17:14:30] <mystor> I explicitly declare the values I'm closing over in rust-cpp

[17:21:35] <mystor> kimundi: yeah
[17:21:44] <kimundi> interesting
[17:21:53] <mystor> The implementation is awful, it's mostly a proof of concept. 
[17:21:59] <kimundi> What do lints have access to?
[17:22:14] <kimundi> trans?
[17:22:19] <mystor> I needed the lint to get type info from the compiler. I use a syntax extension to actually generate the rust code
[17:22:51] <mystor> They have access to semantic analysis results.
[17:24:55] <mrmonday> mystor: how do you link the type info to the stuff you find in the syntax extension?
[17:25:38] <mystor> mrmonday: I generate a FFI function in the syntax extension with a very long, recognisable name. When I see that function being called in the lint, I look at the types of the arguments
[17:25:49] <mrmonday> aahh, ok
[17:26:01] <mrmonday> I was wondering if you'd found a useful general technique for it
[17:26:14] <mystor> mrmonday: nope, just a hack that works for me
[17:26:16] <mrmonday> lack of type info for syntax extensions is my biggest problem with them :L
[17:26:31] <mrmonday> I've got all sorts of ugly/half-baked workarounds to handle that
[17:26:34] <mystor> mrmonday: Well, you can't have type info, because it's an extension on the _syntax_
[17:26:43] <mystor> there's no type info analysis yet

[17:45:04] <zofrex> I need radial ones - Stefan Gerlach's "Scanner" for Windows, DaisyDisk for OS X
[17:46:53] <Astraea> ugh
[17:47:11] <Astraea> so this client went with a different developer after we wrote the software
[17:47:17] <Astraea> right at launch
[17:47:27] <Astraea> so no one is fixing bugs
[17:47:29] <Astraea> hurray!
[17:48:01] <fkaa> lahwran: i've never gone over 150gb ever
[17:48:44] <zofrex> Astraea: that's an interesting choice.
[17:49:29] <Astraea> yeah....
[17:49:41] <Astraea> fkaa: I definitely have at least 150GB of videos
[17:50:07] <Astraea> the five seasons of Babylon 5 are 50GB alone
[17:51:14] <Astraea> though I could probably save ~10GB and delete most of season 5...
[17:53:02] <fkaa> i don't watch that many videos or play games, so lots of space for other stuff :)
[17:53:35] <Astraea> I did a bit of poking around the chromium source code
[17:53:37] <Astraea> that was 10GB
[17:54:28] <fkaa> i do have all seasons of farscape actually, i should get rid of them probably
[17:54:52] <Astraea> initially I couldn't stand farscape, seemed too silly
[17:55:00] <Astraea> then they hacked off pilot's arm...
[17:55:53] <fkaa> hehe
[18:07:17] <kimundi> Hm, random C++ FFI thought: A generated C++ wrapper around a Rust type would have to add a drop flag, and a generated RUst wrapper around a C++ type would have to heap allocated to have a stable address

[18:38:16] <Astraea> bleh
[18:38:19] <Astraea> iOS programming is a pain
[18:38:32] <Astraea> getting comfortable with their APIs takes a while
[18:40:15] <dfockler> Astraea: I know that feeling with Android too
[18:41:03] <Astraea> I haven't touched android since 2.3
[18:41:08] <Astraea> but strangely I was pretty comfortable with it
[18:41:32] <Astraea> I think my problem with iOS development is the fact that I'm using Xcode =P
[18:41:46] <Astraea> trying to figure out storyboards, auto layout, size classes, stuff like that
[18:41:55] <dfockler> Yeah! totally
[18:41:58] <zofrex> I've been putting off learning iOS dev
[18:42:00] <Astraea> maybe Android is as complex as iOS at this point, but I wouldn't know
[18:42:09] <zofrex> I promised myself I would learn iOS dev when I switched from Android to iPhone
[18:42:30] <dfockler> I just remember passing around Context and Inflaters and Deflaters and being like what, but I was younger then
[18:42:48] <Astraea> I remember Android pissing me off
[18:42:54] <Astraea> very inflexible inheritance
[18:43:05] <zofrex> yeah the Android SDK is not well designed
[18:44:12] <dfockler> a lot of it is that they just yanked it right out of java

[18:44:56] <Astraea> if I had started iOS development around the time it first came out I might be a bit better off, as it stands there's years of changes to the APIs, so even googling for help can become an issue
[18:45:00] <Tiffany> https://keybase.io/blog/2014-09-17/error-handling-in-javascript it appears that they invented an ugly version of monads
[18:45:50] <Astraea> dfockler: well what I noticed was they'd recommend you subclass everything if you needed different behavior, but they made 90% of a class private
[18:46:03] <zofrex> to quote InfoSec Taylor Swift:
[18:46:06] <zofrex> "It took the acquisition of Android, years of work and hundreds of millions of dollars, but Google finally brought malware to Linux."
[18:46:15] <dfockler> hahahaha

[19:31:02] <Astraea> She's a high maintenance animal -_-
[19:31:58] <dfockler> I try to feed my cat the same food all the time
[19:32:25] <dfockler> and about the same time every day
[19:32:53] <Astraea> Well I went on vacation so my friends took care of her
[19:33:04] <dfockler> oh yeah I know how that is
[19:33:32] <Astraea> She's a very skittish cat (if kitty xanax was a thing she would qualify for an unlimited subscription)
[19:34:46] <Astraea> So I bought some canned food she likes to keep her hydrated since I knew she'd be too scared to eat or drink for a while

[21:16:11] <Lurkin> Because I'm 4 months in and I still don't know how to accomplish what I want to accomplish.
[21:16:19] <Lurkin> AT this rate I might have to pack it up.
[21:16:52] <Astraea> don't give up!
[21:17:30] <Astraea> and I really would like to see a well curated site dedicated to programming
[21:17:47] <Astraea> like a trade journal, but web infinity.0
[21:18:10] <Astraea> democratic voting doesn't really work tbh
[21:18:32] <dfockler> I guess the ACM journal is a little mathy
[21:19:10] <Astraea> there are quite a few journals tbh
[21:19:29] <Astraea> but again, they don't have the exposure a place like HN does
[21:19:38] <Astraea> and I don't much care for HN
[21:19:45] <dfockler> HN is barely programming anymore
[21:19:54] <dfockler> I guess it never was supposed to be
[21:26:46] <Astraea> it has some good stuff on there with smart people
[21:27:02] <Astraea> but... it's also very start-up-in-the-bay-area centric
[21:27:46] <Astraea> so... who wants to make a curated rust journal with me? =D
[21:29:10] <Lurkin> Will you do the part of discussing how to transfer a file from disk to ram across a wire to another computer?
[21:29:21] <Lurkin> I'll spellcheck it.
[21:29:23] <Lurkin> :)
[21:29:44] <Lurkin> Oh and the transfer needs to be encrypted.
[21:30:02] <dfockler> That would actually be a pretty good project
[21:30:13] <Lurkin> I'm failing hard :(
[21:30:32] <dfockler> Plan 9 OS?
[21:30:37] <dfockler> Is that a solution?
[21:31:57] <Astraea> content is important, but I think I'd have to figure out how best to elevate good content first tbh
[21:32:57] <dfockler> curation or votes
[21:33:08] <Astraea> also, my sister did not like my text this morning
[21:33:16] <Astraea> "Prime deals on a composite day!"
[21:33:21] <Astraea> "Nobody thinks of math first!"

[21:33:43] <dfockler> haha :)
[21:33:48] <Lurkin> dfockler, Plan 9 looks wonderful.
[21:34:04] <Astraea> dfockler: there has to be a better alternative
[21:34:23] <Astraea> votes are just too susceptible to group mentality
[21:34:26] <dfockler> Lurkin: your file could already be in the ram of the other computer
[21:34:30] <Lurkin> Astraea, encrypted self hosted subreddits.
[21:34:31] <Astraea> and biases in general
[21:34:43] <dfockler> That's kind of like diaspora

[21:34:49] <Lurkin> Pardon the lang.
[21:34:51] <Astraea> curation is too time consuming for experts who should be spending their time doing other stuff
[21:36:24] <Astraea> preface: don't judge me
[21:36:31] <Astraea> I had an idea for a porn site using RNNs
[21:36:53] <Astraea> maybe I can work that into a site like this
[21:37:10] <dfockler> was it watching the porn?
[21:37:13] <Tiffany> procedurally generated porn seems to be the first thought everyone has after looking at RNNs
[21:37:18] <dfockler> haha
[21:37:24] <Astraea> Tiffany: that's actually not what I had in mind
[21:38:28] <Tiffany> we've seen procedurally generated movie-background-screen C code and math papers, almost perfect image enhancers that work on anime, and a couple people seem to be working on automatically tagging anime pictures by training off various image boorus.. it's the next logical step, really
[21:38:48] <Astraea> yeah, my idea was tagging
[21:39:02] <Astraea> there's been some work done in classifying videos with RNNs
[21:39:07] <dfockler> tagging the bird species in the background if they were in a national park right?
[21:39:34] <Tiffany> that's not just RNNs though, google's deep dream thing is like that
[21:39:39] <Tiffany> it's mostly trained off dogs though, not anime
[21:39:44] <Astraea> I mean I don't think my coding-fu is good enough
[21:39:50] <Astraea> but I can imagine an awesome site
[21:39:52] <Tiffany> so of course there's lots of porn images transformed into fractal dogs being passed around...
[21:39:52] <Astraea> also no ads
[21:40:29] <dfockler> I'm sure deep down in Google they use it to find videos that break the User agreements or something

[21:41:45] <dfockler> I wrote a sigmoid function yesterday!
[21:42:27] <Astraea> I'd still feel a bit weird making such a thing though
[21:43:07] <Astraea> eh, I get my new laptop on Friday, I'll do a coding marathon this weekend
[21:43:12] <dfockler> It would be nice to generate auto tags for large sets of images
[21:43:26] <Astraea> video or go home tbh
[21:43:30] <dfockler> haha
[21:43:43] <Astraea> my idea is actually even more involved than I'm letting on
[21:43:44] <dfockler> who has that many videos though? like film editors?
[21:43:57] <Astraea> yeah... test data will be a bit of an issue
[21:44:04] <Astraea> for a lot of reasons
[21:44:39] <Tiffany> so you want to classify arbitrary video?
[21:45:04] <dfockler> or just pornographic video?
[21:46:21] <Astraea> well since the site would be pornographic in nature, the latter
[21:46:29] <Astraea> though I'm sure there's lots and lots of applications
[21:46:38] <Tiffany> if you're going for live action stuff, I imagine you can scrape pornhub or something..
[21:47:34] <Astraea> who knew pornography could have such interesting technical problems
[21:48:07] <dfockler> they get a lot of traffic
[21:48:14] <dfockler> they have scaling issues too
[21:48:58] <Lurkin> dfockler is plan 9 still in dev?
[21:49:02] <dfockler> and there aren't as many people familiar with programming around video as you would think
[21:49:12] <dfockler> Lurkin: haha oh my maybe
[21:49:27] <Astraea> yeah, I can see a lot of scaling issues

[21:51:12] <Astraea> this might give me an excuse to learn elixir
[21:51:24] <dfockler> Lurkin: according to the wiki there are a couple of forks that are adding drivers for it and stuff
[21:52:54] <dfockler> It's funny because if we can imagine another way computers could work, someone could just go and build it
[21:54:42] <Tiffany> a few people still use plan 9, it has a sort of cult around it
[21:56:44] <Astraea> ugh, I again have too many project ideas rolling around in my head

[22:08:21] <Astraea> I can see it from both perspectives
[22:08:35] <Tiffany> apparently the vast majority of the time, this issue is caused because alsa starts out being muted
[22:08:39] <Tiffany> but this wasn't what I had wrong

[22:15:37] <zofrex> I've gotten a few helpful pointers from #freebsd though that I'm reading up on :)
[22:17:22] <zofrex> and also, what Tiffany said. I did not have a great reception in #(popular linux distro) when I found a kernel panic on a fresh boot (even the livecd) on a particular machine... it happened at random intervals but I insisted the hardware was fine
[22:18:12] <Tiffany> I've been unable to boot linux-ck the last couple updates, but I think it might be because of some file system corruption I had

[22:18:21] <zofrex> I get that's the most common cause but I actually legit found a bug... and other software ran just fine
[22:18:23] <Tiffany> a bunch of files got truncated
[22:18:28] <Tiffany> including /usr/bin/nano, surprisingly
[22:18:59] <zofrex> I guess I can see how "linux must be wrong because windows 95 runs fine" /could/ be trolling... but meh I try to assume the best in everyone these days and it takes less energy than getting angry
[22:19:06] <zofrex> Tiffany: that sounds weird
[22:19:12] <Tiffany> it's happened a couple times
[22:19:22] <Tiffany> in particular, whenever my system crashes during pacman running
[22:19:28] <Tiffany> this time it didn't happen
[22:19:36] <Tiffany> however, I suspect it was shenanigans with disk cache
[22:19:52] <Tiffany> my computer does this thing where sometimes it won't shut down when I tell it to shut down
[22:19:57] <Tiffany> it will just freeze
[22:20:03] <Tiffany> so I have to hard kill it
[22:20:21] <Tiffany> it could have been trying to flush the cache and frozen
[22:20:38] <Tiffany> maybe I should run fsync before shutdown
[22:21:02] <Tiffany> my laptop has a lot of weird issues
[22:21:44] <Tiffany> but yeah
[22:22:04] <Tiffany> it's really frustrating to have a legit issue and have a bunch of people treat you like a newbie with a super basic problem, completely misdiagnosing the issue
[22:22:30] <Tiffany> support contracts exist for a reason, I guess

[22:30:23] <Lurkin> dfockler, plan9 is omg sweet!
[22:31:26] <zofrex> why can't managing packages be as easy as Cargo

[22:47:23] <Tobba> good lord CNNs site is bad
[22:47:49] <Tobba> each page actually is so big that it actually freezes your browser for several seconds
[22:47:53] <dfockler> Lurkin: Are you trying it, or reading about it?
[22:48:08] <Tobba> and the autoplaying videos fall back to HTML5, which is slow as fuck
[22:48:22] <Tobba> oh and their player code is broken so the videos can't be paused
[22:51:00] <dfockler> I bet it works great on IE8 though
[22:51:13] <Tobba> I would somewhat not be surprised
[22:52:20] <Lurkin> REading about it
[22:52:29] <Lurkin> Especially the protocol portion.
[22:53:30] <Lurkin> But I guess it's a dead project?
[22:53:52] <Lurkin> 9front seems to be the most up to date but it looks to be dead as well.
[22:58:57] <dfockler> basically a more function CRUD but for an OS
[22:59:06] <dfockler> s/function/functional
[22:59:45] <dfockler> It never caught on sadly

[23:10:01] <Lurkin> Thanks dfockler this dead project has given me an idea I think I can actually do.
[23:10:12] <Lurkin> And another thank you to Tiffany for adding Chacha to sodiumoxide wooo!
[23:13:16] <dfockler> Nice! Those weird OSs are fun to read about it

[23:39:35] <Tiffany> why, is it useful to you?
[23:40:27] <Tiffany> I should probably submit another PR that adds other primitives like the rfc 7539 chacha20-poly1305 AEAD
[23:40:38] <Tiffany> it's not actually that big of a thing, just bindings to existing code in libsodium
