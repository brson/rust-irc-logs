[08:08:18] <Ilari> CT is important? I thought CT as of present only applies to EV, which tends to be much higher quality than DV/OV.

[16:50:16] <Ilari> bascule: Intermediaries came up in the meeting quite a bit, but not really as a usecase. And lots of OAuth (KIWF) terminology was thrown around.
[16:52:15] <bascule> heh
[16:52:22] <bascule> is the CFRG meeting today?
[16:54:11] <bascule> tomorrow, I guess

[17:06:00] <Ilari> Yeah, Wednesday.
[17:17:08] <bascule> oh hey, people asking about ECDSA vs EdDSA on the TLS list, eh?
[17:20:08] <Ilari> KP asked about some feedback on compat. vs. something new.
[17:24:23] <Ilari> I strongly prefer something new.
[18:05:07] <bascule> yup

[18:55:11] <bascule> so OPTLS is like Noise for TLS? heh
[18:59:48] <Ilari> Well, the offline variant might be something akin to Noise. Online variant seems to have no benefits.

[21:13:37] <Ilari> bascule: Basically, DH certs _and_ classic signing. Worst of both worlds.
[21:21:20] <Ilari> bascule: doing DHF is quite a bit simpler than doing signatures.
[21:24:18] <bascule> lolololol
[21:24:24] <bascule> yeah sounds terrible :|
[21:27:03] <Ilari> Also, then there's changing TLS PRF to HKDF.
[21:30:07] <Ilari> ... For reasons I can't make sense of.
[21:30:39] <Ilari> Basically, I have got a bad feeling about this...
[21:39:09] <Ilari> Also, to me the new key derivation (they changed that) looks just incompetent.
[21:47:07] <bascule> oh god
[21:47:12] <bascule> this unberable email
[21:47:16] <bascule> are these idiots reinventing CAS?
[21:51:00] <bascule> https://jasig.github.io/cas/development/images/cas_proxy_flow_diagram.jpg
[21:51:02] <bascule> IT'S SO SIMPLE
[21:56:33] <Ilari> Hmm... How many bytes does ASN.1 DER blow on one boolean? :->
[21:57:05] <Dcoder> what's wrong with HKDF?
[21:59:31] <Ilari> Well, at least it is used in a very nasty-looking way.
[22:00:57] <Ilari> Okay, as far as I can tell, ASN.1 DER blows 3 bytes for each boolean. :-)
[22:01:35] <tiffany> whoa
[22:01:45] <tiffany> http://www.pl-enthusiast.net/2014/07/01/how-did-heartbleed-remain-undiscovered-and-what-should-we-do-about-it/#comment-96
[22:02:26] <tiffany> polarssl has partial formal verification of a particular configuration being sold as a product
[22:04:24] <Ilari> bascule: BTW, discovered my signature code doesn't work... Because I can't figure out how to actually disable debug assertions (which are just plain incompatible with the ECC code).
[22:12:44] <eternaleye> ...I hate it when people who don't know what they're doing cargo-cult crypto stuff. https://plus.google.com/+ArjanvandeVen/posts/VAK1SRHjTZm
[22:13:45] <eternaleye> "This has 'DES' in the name so it must be the same 56-bit DES that's completely trashed!" "...have you not heard of 3DES?"
[22:14:39] <eternaleye> And what the ever-living fuck is "Ok, so MD5 is technically not insane broken for small packets" supposed to mean?
[22:15:05] <Ilari> Haven't there been 64-byte (1 block) MD5 collisions?
[22:15:27] <eternaleye> Not sure, but it's an utterly braindead statement regardless.
[22:15:57] * Ilari tries to figure out what the hell cargo is doing...
[22:16:30] <eternaleye> Also "GASP! OpenSSL doesn't compile without MD5 support!" "...well, considering the SSL PRF is defined as mixing MD5 and SHA-1..."
[22:18:16] <Ilari> Well, only in obsolete versions of SSL or TLS.
[22:18:54] <tiffany> it could at least be a better error message
[22:19:03] <tiffany> such as, for example, saying why you can't compile without MD5
[22:19:10] <tiffany> or even just removing the option to disable md5 to begin with
[22:20:34] <eternaleye> Ilari: Well, I did say SSL - anything over TLS 1.0 is TLS not SSL
[22:20:44] <tiffany> eternaleye: does the DES option actually do 3DES?
[22:20:53] <tiffany> also, is 3DES actually that good? I was under the impression it wasn't
[22:21:12] <Ilari> tiffany: It isn't good, but it isn't horribly broken either.
[22:21:52] <tiffany> what does it isn't good mean? that you could bruteforce it in reasonable time if you had a couple password cracking rigs?
[22:22:08] <tiffany> or, well, some other attack that isn't bruteforce, more likely
[22:22:10] <eternaleye> tiffany: It means that AES is a better option
[22:22:18] <eternaleye> tiffany: 3DES is dog-slow, for one
[22:22:29] <Ilari> Also, has only 64-bit blocks.
[22:22:41] <eternaleye> tiffany: And the 64-bit blocksize means you need to rekey after each 4gb due to birthday bound stuff
[22:23:22] <eternaleye> Well, less 'need to' than "would be taking stupid risks if you didn't"
[22:23:55] <tiffany> is it actually used in tls connections?
[22:24:25] <eternaleye> tiffany: Sure; there's at least one spider that the only PFS suite it supports is a DHE-3DES one
[22:25:11] <eternaleye> tiffany: I think IE on Windows XP was in the same boat...
[22:27:40] <eternaleye> tiffany: Also, I don't know if the DES option controls both DES and 3DES enablement, but I do know it's at least a prereq for 3DES, since 3DES in OpenSSL seems to be a simple wrapper 'mode' around DES
[22:28:12] <eternaleye> tiffany: But the ciphersuite list in that link only had 3DES-EDE and DES-CBC3 as far as I saw, not single-DES
[22:28:25] <eternaleye> tiffany: Van de Ven just assumed.
[22:29:02] <Dcoder> yes, there are 1-block md5 collisions
[22:29:19] <tiffany> alright
[22:29:31] <tiffany> that's kind of what I expected
[22:30:52] <tiffany> it would make me feel better if you could disable single DES and not 3DES
[22:30:56] <tiffany> make it private or something
[22:35:39] <Ilari> Well, it would not be too bad if 3DES was dumped at the same time.
[22:38:21] *** erickt_ is now known as erickt
[22:39:01] <tiffany> well, as the article mentioned lots of applications depend on it
