[00:02:02] <eddyb> -1 on spelling out what symbols do very very well
[00:02:36] <zofrex> omg there's a rust-tcl, two of my favourite things <3
[00:03:55] <eddyb> int foo(int) is not very clear without knowing at least a bit of C's nasty type syntax, but `fn foo(int) -> int` needs at most a mention that "fn" is short for function
[00:04:05] <eddyb> "function" is one of the ugliest things ever in JS
[00:04:14] <eddyb> in ES6 you get to write menthods without it
[00:04:17] <eddyb> *methods
[00:04:27] <zofrex> I pronounce fn "fn" in my head
[00:04:35] <zofrex> ... I don't know how to type it out but I don't say "function"
[00:04:58] <eddyb> { foo(x) { this.bar(x) } bar(x) { ... } } (maybe it's not in ES2015. idk. it was in traceur-compiler)
[00:05:15] <eddyb> zofrex: yeah, I don't need to pronounce it in my head
[00:05:16] <Astraea> all syntax is ugly
[00:05:35] <WindowsBunny> zofrex: Do you pronounce it like this? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zusLgd9L04Y
[00:05:35] <eddyb> Astraea: install Hasklig (or Rustlig, since it exists)
[00:05:44] <Astraea> what is rustlig
[00:05:55] <eddyb> Hasklig minus the ligatures that don't apply to Rust
[00:06:09] <eddyb> => in match arms is another thing that I would never want to see replaced with words
[00:06:11] <Astraea> oh
[00:06:12] <Astraea> right
[00:06:16] <Astraea> yeah
[00:06:17] <eddyb> or any symbol longer than it is
[00:06:19] <Astraea> that's also horrible
[00:06:27] <eddyb> arrows are great
[00:06:36] <eddyb> words suck

[00:06:54] <XMPPwocky> because there's no other way to contact the devs apparently
[00:07:00] <Astraea> though it's a step in the right direction
[00:07:02] <zofrex> WindowsBunny: I pronounce it.. kinda like "fern" without the "r"
[00:07:21] <Astraea> I pronounce it fun, because they're so FUN!

[00:07:58] <zofrex> pronouncing symbols makes me think of this excellent talk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SkdfdXWYaI
[00:07:59] <eddyb> or fânâ which is how you pronounce "F N" in Romanian
[00:08:22] <zofrex> on programming via voice recognition... dude has lots of made up words like "pah slap scratch fah chuk"
[00:08:39] <eddyb> effen is how "F N" is pronounced in English
[00:08:41] <eddyb> more or less
[00:08:53] <Astraea> actually I pronounce it function
[00:08:57] <eddyb> fânâ is less elegant, but shorter
[00:09:01] <Astraea> but I've used fn plenty of times in math as a shorthand

[00:22:36] <XMPPwocky> and "->", for  some reason, i read sort of like... "dah-dah"
[00:24:15] <c74d> I think I typically mind-pronounce "fn" as either /f<syllabic-n>/ or /fɨn/ (eddyb's "fân").
[00:24:33] <niconii> i don't pronounce any punctuation in my head for whatever reason
[00:24:57] <niconii> (probably since that's how human languages work...)
[00:25:01] <c74d> I don't think I do either, at least usually
[00:25:47] <c74d> sometimes arithmetic operators, but often not even those
[00:27:43] <niconii> so `fn foo(x: i32, y: u32) -> f64` is just `eff en foo, ecks eye thirty two, why yoo thirty two, eff sixty four`... i miiight read -> as "gives" or "is" though

[00:35:45] <Peach> How would I make an IRC bot like playbot?
[00:36:10] <Elainemo> !source

[00:36:20] <niconii> Elainemo: that's rustbot, not playbot
[00:36:25] <Elainemo> Oh right.
[00:36:29] <Elainemo> Peach: to execute code?
[00:36:46] <Peach> I wanna make a bot just like playbot for running my own language 
[00:36:48] <niconii> finally, rustbot is mistaken for playbot, instead of the other way around!
[00:36:49] <Elainemo> https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-playpen is playbot's source.
[00:36:52] <Peach> cause playbot is so useful
[00:36:56] <niconii> rustbot finally gets its moment to shine
[00:37:02] <Elainemo> https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-playpen/blob/master/bot.py is the irc bit.
[00:37:25] <Elainemo> it substitutes in the input text into a template
[00:37:29] <Elainemo> compiles it with rustc
[00:37:35] <Elainemo> and then runs that executable in a https://github.com/thestinger/playpen sandbox.

[01:11:33] <whipsch> Peach: you would want to sandbox the arbitrary code execution, of course (like the playpen/playbot do)
[01:12:56] <Peach> Right - no file access, use auto code timeouts, restrict output to just a 2 lines 
[01:14:34] <whipsch> 'no file access' goes quite a bit deeper
[01:14:53] <whipsch> i believe the playpen whitelists syscalls, with some other stuff going on

[01:17:34] <Elainemo> they fucked up the jets that bad?
[01:17:37] <Tiffany> yeah
[01:17:54] <Elainemo> their C is pretty nasty, I guess I shouldn't be surprised.
[01:17:58] <Tiffany> yeah
[01:19:18] <niconii> i don't know that i'd stop at just their C...
[01:19:22] <Elainemo> hehe
[01:19:27] <Elainemo> I think it's a fine idea.
[01:19:29] <niconii> and i mean that, i genuinely don't know
[01:19:37] <Elainemo> I'm not sure how I feel about it either.
[01:19:43] <niconii> i'm still not sure if hoon is a real language or if someone's cat ran on the keyboard
[01:19:57] <Tiffany> which part is a fine idea, elainemo?
[01:20:39] <Tiffany> I mean, urbit has some interesting ideas
[01:20:46] <Tiffany> but at every turn they pick the worst possible implementation of them
[01:20:57] <Elainemo> Tiffany: the concept of what they're doing -- tossing everything out and considering how it'd have to be done if the system were to run for 50 million years.
[01:21:06] <Elainemo> yeah I can't help but feel that after spending a few days poking at it.
[01:21:18] <Tiffany> it's pretty hard to keep urbit running for a month, much less 50 million years
[01:21:49] <Tiffany> it's way too centralized to ever have that kind of stability
[01:22:19] <Elainemo> what does urbit actually include? the entirety of everything?
[01:22:25] <Elainemo> arvo, hoon, nock, everything ele?
[01:22:31] <Elainemo> it seems like arvo is the bit they fuck up the most.
[01:22:32] <Tiffany> I think so
[01:22:42] <Tiffany> yeah, I guess so
[01:22:44] <niconii> imo urbit is interesting as an experiment
[01:22:49] <Elainemo> niconii: yeah definitely.
[01:23:06] <niconii> besides that......... well...................
[01:23:15] <Elainemo> arvo's network architecture is downright peculiar.
[01:23:45] <Peach> so like
[01:24:01] <amstrad> Elainemo: got diagrams?
[01:24:03] <Peach> SHould I run my programming language code bot in a VM?
[01:24:04] <Tiffany> 256 carriers ever, but they only really have one at the moment
[01:24:11] <Elainemo> Peach: yes.
[01:24:13] <Tiffany> and if a carrier goes down, everyone whose ship is under it becomes uncontactable
[01:24:27] <Elainemo> amstrad: I haven't seen any diagrams
[01:24:29] <Elainemo> only text
[01:24:44] <Elainemo> (and code, but I can't really read hoon yet (hopefully ever) so I can't say much about that :P)
[01:24:57] <amstrad> Elainemo: i like looking at network architecture (in diagram form)
[01:25:05] <amstrad> especially curious network architecture
[01:26:08] <niconii> you know, in regards to Peach's language, the point of "concepts are hard to learn, syntax is much easier" was brought up a couple of times
[01:26:14] <Tiffany> 6 layers of star topology...
[01:27:11] <niconii> i might have to amend that to "syntax is much easier to learn, unless it's hoon"...
[01:29:44] <niconii> well, syntax-bashing aside
[01:31:03] <niconii> honestly i'm not sure i have much to say about urbit that hasn't already been said a million times
[01:33:31] <Peach> In programming languages, syntax matters. #controversial
[01:33:53] * whipsch takes a look
[01:34:21] <whipsch> Pacakges
[01:34:24] <whipsch> off to a good start
[01:34:44] <niconii> hoon is what perl *wishes* it could look like; nock, the computation model /the entire system is founded on/, is so ridiculously slow it requires special-cased code recognition just to decrement a number...
[01:35:33] <whipsch> what the heck is this shit
[01:36:00] <whipsch> is this also a valid J program or something? is that the joke?
[01:36:28] <Elainemo> whipsch: hey, don't mock J, I'll break you :P
[01:37:11] <whipsch> naw J is cool, im making fun of whatever that language is
[01:37:16] <niconii> but on the flipside, hoon is an interesting experiment in language syntax, and nock is interesting in its minimalism
[01:37:16] <scott> I like all the boring names for Rust crates I'm using.
[01:37:21] <scott> "gl", "image", "time"
[01:37:35] <Elainemo> niconii: I actually think that Nock does that right.
[01:37:46] <Elainemo> The abstract model should be universal
[01:38:00] <Elainemo> And special-casing certain patterns in the VM is par for the course!
[01:38:06] <Elainemo> usually not to that extent, but even so.

[02:51:54] <Elainemo> Peach: if you can't express a cycle in control flow, you can't loop, and if you can't loop, you can't infinitely loop.
[02:52:07] <Peach> I ask this for making a prototype IRC bot that runs commands in my programming language - I'd like to just disable looping until I have a proper timeout setup

[02:52:42] <Peach> so If I remove for while and recursion, I think that should be good right?
[02:52:50] <niconii> can't help but think it would be a lot easier to just set up the timeout
[02:53:37] *** Joins: RC9 (RCIX@moz-r2piba.tmodns.net)
[02:54:12] <Elainemo> niconii: imo the further away from nock you get in urbit, the more clear it becomes that this is not something that will work.
[02:55:24] <niconii> Peach: on a number of unix systems there's actually a "timeout" command you can use, "timeout 5s my_program arguments" for example executes "my_program arguments", then terminates if it takes longer than five seconds
[02:58:22] <niconii> Elainemo: yeah, can't really say that surprises me too much...
[03:00:22] <niconii> sure, you can create a fancy, super-abstract system that does everything differently from the norm, but eventually you do have to hit the real world
[03:00:38] <niconii> the further you are away from that, the messier the collision's gonna be
[03:02:55] <Peach> Do you think I should manually implement timeout instead of relying on my OS's internal "timeout" command?
[03:03:04] <Peach> Timeout in the VM
[03:03:48] <Elainemo> why bother?
[03:04:05] <Skyler> Peach some VMs do integrate that
[03:04:36] <Skyler> therubyracer (embedded V8) has a timeout method
[03:04:54] <Skyler> it's definitely valuable if you're exposing a scripting engine
[03:06:25] <niconii> i took "embedded" in the "embedded programming" sense and suddenly became afraid someone had actually created a cpu that ran javascript
[03:06:38] <Skyler> depending on your language you could also possibly infinitly recurse if you somehow don't push to a stack
[03:07:10] <Skyler> niconii: there was a recent article actually...

[04:15:59] <WindowsBunny> Peach: That's because there is no standalone cross platform networking in C++
[04:16:11] <Peach> false
[04:16:22] <Elainemo> no, true.
[04:16:30] <WindowsBunny> You either have to rely on third party libraries or write platform specific code
[04:16:43] <Elainemo> C++ doesn't define networking, so valid C++ implementations need not provide it.
[04:16:47] <Peach> You implement native platform specific things to create one library that works for them all
[04:16:52] <Elainemo> There is no "all"
[04:16:54] <Peach> No I'm talking about libs
[04:16:57] <Elainemo> does it work on hurd?
[04:17:02] <Peach> external libs
[04:17:28] <WindowsBunny> Peach: If it depends on platform specific APIs it isn't truly cross platform
[04:17:41] <Peach> ........
[04:17:45] <WindowsBunny> unless you make sure it is implemented for every single platform that ever had a reasonably compliant C++ compiler
[04:18:01] <Peach> That's kinda what cross platform means 
[04:18:05] <Peach> like seriously
[04:18:19] *** Joins: RC9 (RCIX@moz-pf0.dfa.8.198.IP)
[04:18:27] <Quxxy> Let's see you find one that works on DOS or Palm Pilot :3
[04:18:31] <Peach> each platform is different, cross platform means an implementation that has the same interface for each platform but a different backend
[04:18:46] <Peach> cross platform doesn't mean every platform though
[04:18:54] <WindowsBunny> Peach: The problem here is finding a networking library that supports every platform that C++ does
[04:19:05] <WindowsBunny> Otherwise your library will be limited by that networking library
[04:19:08] <Peach> I ....... never said every platform
[04:19:46] <WindowsBunny> Then make sure you specify cross platform across the limited subset of popular OS's
[04:20:02] <Peach> cross platform like always means that WindowsBunny 
[04:20:11] <Peach> no one ever uses cross platform to mean *everything*
[04:20:18] <Quxxy> Peach: "standalone cross platform C++", that means limited to what the stdlib provides
[04:20:26] <Quxxy> Which means every platform with a compliant C++ compiler
[04:20:32] <Peach> No no
[04:20:34] <WindowsBunny> Peach: Also, you said standalone, which typically is understood to mean not depending on external third party libraries
[04:20:56] <Peach> Ack terminology
[04:20:58] <WindowsBunny> standalone typically means depending on nothing more than the standard library
[04:21:05] <Elainemo> c74d: I looked into it more, turns out libvirt *will* detach devices from the host, but when the guest shuts down it will re-attach them to the host, or if the device is unplugged then replugged.
[04:21:28] <WindowsBunny> Peach: So, which networking library are you going to use
[04:21:38] <WindowsBunny> Boost.asio?
[04:22:00] <Peach> To me standalone means that it's something that can be integrated easily with other projects,
[04:22:04] <Peach> also Boost.asio is ew
[04:22:22] <WindowsBunny> Hopefully C++'s Networking TS will land soon
[04:23:51] <Quxxy> Heh.  C++2017: now with "networking"!  This astonishing new feature allows your programs to communicate with *other* programs *anywhere in the world*, and once again demonstrates C++ rightful dominance over programming.
[04:24:32] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: It needs to be a TS first
[04:24:42] <WindowsBunny> it is still in draft form
[04:24:45] <Elainemo> Quxxy: I recall a piece of early windows marketing essentially claiming that they invented tcp/ip, "the internet"
[04:24:49] <WindowsBunny> not even near the voting stage of TS
[04:25:07] <Quxxy> Well, no; I imagine something as groundbreaking as networking would be highly contentious *nods*
[04:25:09] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: After it is published in a TS, then it has to go through the process of being accepted into the next C++ standard
[04:25:21] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: So not for C++17, but maybe for the next major version of C++ in 6 years
[04:25:25] <WindowsBunny> C++23 perhaps?
[04:26:26] <Quxxy> Doubtless it'll be usable cross-platform sometime around 2045, when MS finally implements it because "well, we already have WinSock, and our customers aren't asking for it"
[04:27:01] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: Actually, I'm pretty sure MS will be one of the first to implement it
[04:27:17] <WindowsBunny> I mean, they're pretty much on the ball about implementing the Filesystem TS
[04:27:40] <Elainemo> "one of the first" compared to who :P
[04:27:53] <WindowsBunny> Elainemo: uh, everyone else?
[04:27:55] <Elainemo> like, there's only three important C++ libraries.
[04:28:01] <Quxxy> Yeah, but they *still* haven't implemented full C support yet, and how many years has it been? :P
[04:28:27] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: Actually, as of VS 2015 they pretty much have C99 now
[04:28:37] <Quxxy> That sounds like weasel words...
[04:28:50] <WindowsBunny> >Our C99 Standard  Library implementation is complete, except for tgmath.h (which is  irrelevant in C++) and the CX_LIMITED_RANGE/FP_CONTRACT pragma macros.
[04:28:58] <Quxxy> Ah-ha!
[04:29:02] <Quxxy> So it's *still* not complete
[04:29:04] <Quxxy> Told ya
[04:29:20] <Peach> How does Boost.asio even work
[04:29:20] <WindowsBunny> as if anyone even uses that shit
[04:29:23] <scott> Doesn't GCC not even have C99 complete?
[04:29:24] <Quxxy> Send them back to the C mines to dig out implementation details from cold, unfeeling rock
[04:29:30] <Quxxy> scott: *shhhhh!*
[04:29:34] <Elainemo> WindowsBunny: ported fortran programs do.
[04:29:38] <Quxxy> Wait, they're underground... the rock would be hot
[04:29:40] <WindowsBunny> scott: GCC doesn't have <codecvt>
[04:29:51] <WindowsBunny> Elainemo: pffft, fortran
[04:30:08] <scott> I seem to recall something about C99 being sort of designed before being implemented and then when it came to being implemented people were kind of like ehhhhh
[04:30:18] <Elainemo> like it or not, almost every "new" C feature is about competing with fortran
[04:30:26] <scott> whereas every C++ feature these days has at least one implementation before it's decided upon

[06:42:55] <Astraea> and the syntax shares a lot of similarities with rust (and other newer languages... weird syntactic shift going on)

[07:16:14] <eddyb> given that Swift was (in part) inspired by Rust (except for syntax, I guess)
[07:16:51] <eddyb> or rather "not syntax" because only a few bits were borrowed from Rust

[07:22:17] <Yurume> Peach: many (read: almost all modern) IRC servers support 005 RPL_ISUPPORT which gives lots of infos about limitations and rules.
[07:22:28] <Yurume> you should absolutely parse that if you have any.
[07:22:40] <Yurume> cf. http://www.irc.org/tech_docs/005.html
[07:25:00] * Peach is so silly and doesn't know how to parse IRC commands
[07:25:06] <Peach> I think there's a  :   character?
[07:28:19] <Yurume> Peach: well, the generic format of IRC command and response is: [:<source>] <command> <argument> <argument> [:<last argument>]. only <last argument> can contain whitespaces (and it can be swapped for <argument> if it doesn't have them).
[07:29:08] <Yurume> there are several micro-syntaxes in IRC, but this single format should be sufficient for many cases

[17:31:53] <Astraea> also, I've forgotten how irritating reading C++ can be
[17:33:10] <scott> One of the most disrupting parts of Windows development for me might be the lack of a package manager
[17:33:48] <scott> "You mean I can't just apt-get install build-essential? I have to search for a website and do clicky things?"
[17:34:09] <Astraea> scott: there's nuget and chocolatey

[17:35:11] <Astraea> until win10
[17:35:45] <Astraea> at which point windows will have a package manager and OS X still won't -_-
[17:36:46] <c74d> I'd consider App Store to be a package manager.
[17:37:03] <c74d> Its dependency handling could likely be better, sure....
[17:37:36] <Astraea> not really
[17:37:48] <Astraea> I mean in the most rudimentary sense I suppose
[17:38:09] <Astraea> before the app store was announced people were hoping apple was working on a proper package manager for osx
[17:39:50] <Astraea> for(uint8_t id = 0; id < dtNBR_ALARMS; id++) free(id);
[17:39:52] <Astraea> uhhhhhhhhhh
[17:39:52] <c74d> a rudimentary package manager, in that it gives users one OS-sactioned way to install software from an OS-sactioned repository
[17:41:02] <Astraea> I need an adult, because that bit of code does not seem right
[17:41:03] <scott> Astraea: Is that some embedded device stuff? That's can't be the stdlib free function...

[18:09:13] <scott> Peach: Say I have 3 defaults and I want to specify the first and third while taking the second's default value
[18:09:25] <scott> That's why you want to specify the first and third by name and omit the second

[18:11:48] <niconii> (by the way, after the .. can be any arbitrary Options struct, doesn't have to be Options::default())
[18:12:23] <scott> Yeah, your library could define different sets of default options for different usecases, and then you could use one as a base and override just what you want.
[18:13:14] <scott> It's also easy to do something like parse an Options struct from a file and then pass it into the function, rather than extracting all the arguments separately. So there are upsides to using a struct.

[18:14:58] <Peach> Heh, I don't only mean syntax, I mean brevity too
[18:15:06] <scott> I find the same thing with new UIs as with new syntaxes - most of the things that seem really bad to you at first you just don't even notice after a while of use.
[18:15:19] <scott> Unless something is really abhorrent.
[18:15:27] <scott> Like, C type syntax
[18:15:28] <Peach> Rust does a lot, but I'd like to see something like Rust with a lot more condensed-ness to it
[18:15:44] <Peach> In terms of design and syntax, while still being very useful
[18:16:47] <Peach> {:?} in the print syntax?
[18:16:55] <dfockler> condensed-ness with any statically typed syntax is going to be hard
[18:17:01] <niconii> that uses Debug rather than Display to print it
[18:17:15] <niconii> Debug tends to give the internal details of stuff, for programmer use
[18:17:21] <niconii> Display is intended more for user display
[18:17:41] <scott> I find println!("{:?}", ) is a major pain to type, but I have a snippet for it in vim.
[18:17:48] <scott> (So I never type it)
[18:17:56] <niconii> Peach: for instance, on an error, Display might print an error message, whereas Debug might print all the struct fields, etc. of the error
[18:19:12] <niconii> Peach: by the way, you can get it to look a fair bit nicer with a macro: http://is.gd/H4wGB4

[18:19:41] <niconii> Elainemo: right
[18:19:49] <Peach> #[derive(Debug)] does what?
[18:19:51] <fkaa_> macros are amazing
[18:20:10] <niconii> Peach: it just derives the default implementation for Debug
[18:20:12] <Elainemo> Peach: implements the Debug trait for the type automatically.
[18:20:14] <scott> Peach: Implements the Debug trait for the following type so it can be printed by a {:?} format
[18:20:48] <niconii> Peach: so on an enum, that'll be the name of the variant; on a struct, that'll be the full struct with all its fields
[18:20:51] <fkaa_> you can also specify width etc. with the {} syntax
[18:20:56] <fkaa_> {:>20}
[18:21:28] <niconii> Peach: you could also implement it manually if you want it to behave differently

[18:26:52] <niconii> Display/Debug would end up being consolidated (and i prefer having that distinction tbh)
[18:28:18] <niconii> enum variants might have collision problems, honestly
[18:28:40] <Elainemo> enums used to be non-namespaced.
[18:28:41] <niconii> it might be possible for rust to just infer that, since color's type is Color, Orange should mean Color::Orange
[18:29:43] <niconii> i.e. `let x = Orange;` is invalid, but `let x = Color::Orange;` and `let x: Color = Orange;` would be valid

[18:40:57] <Elainemo> Why have the complexity at all?
[18:40:57] <scott> You can use Color::* today
[18:41:04] <Peach> Elainemo: less typing
[18:41:29] <Elainemo> *sometimes* less typing, only when you're in the same scope, and the feature becomes more to document, implement, test, and 
[18:41:33] <Elainemo> explain to new users
[18:41:46] <eddyb> Peach: the enforce expliciteness thing is what is planned for conflicting glob imports
[18:41:58] <Elainemo> "Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules", "There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it"
[18:42:11] <Peach> Rust isn't Python :P
[18:42:23] <Elainemo> It follows its philosophy in many places.
[18:42:59] <c74d> what problems would there be with, for `fn foo(x: SomeEnum); ... foo(A)`, only looking up `A` in `SomeEnum`?
[18:43:26] * c74d is, disclaimer, not suggesting a change to Rust.
[18:43:33] <WindowsBunny> c74d: Sometimes I wish I could have an enum's variants be in scope whenever I call a function that takes that enum
[18:44:08] <Elainemo> c74d: it'd intertwine name resolution and type checking, which would be a complication, but I think it'd work.
[18:44:44] <Elainemo> what if "A" is also a local variable or a different name in scope?
[18:45:10] <Elainemo> and what if those are of the wrong type -- should it use the variant instead?
[18:45:26] <scott> I'd like if enum variants were in scope on a match over that enum, but that's inflexible (what if I match Option<Enum>?) and easily done with `use`.
[18:45:32] <WindowsBunny> Elainemo: I think it should error if an existing identifier is already in scope
[18:45:57] <c74d> hm, I agree with WindowsBunny
[18:45:57] <scott> WindowsBunny: Then how do you pick the existing identifier explicitly?
[18:45:59] <Elainemo> WindowsBunny: what if it *does* have the right type?
[18:46:10] <Elainemo> Does this happen with all variants, even the ones you don't use?
[18:46:47] <WindowsBunny> scott: rename it yo
[18:47:17] <Elainemo> http://www.computer.org/cms/Computer.org/ComputingNow/homepage/mostread/MostRead-SW-SoftwareEngineeringAnIdeaWhoseTimeHasCome.pdf
[18:47:42] <WindowsBunny> Elainemo: If you use a an identifier which is both a variant of the enum used in that place, AND something else which is in scope, then error
[18:48:21] <scott> I think `use` really covers all desired usecases well enough today, and in a more explicit manner.
[18:48:32] <scott> glob-use, that is
[18:49:00] <WindowsBunny> Elainemo: Considering that enum variants are typically CamelCased while variables are snake_case, or even consts which are SCREAMING_SNAKES
[18:49:21] <Peach> Elainemo: the feature would be to only enforce typing a full name space IF there's a naming conflict
[18:49:32] <Elainemo> Peach: and the complexity piles on...:)
[18:49:46] <Peach> Naw :P
[18:49:54] <Peach> Things should be named uniquely,
[18:50:09] <WindowsBunny> Elainemo: In fact, I think this auto enum scope thing could work in Rust without breaking any existing code
[18:50:13] <scott> An enum variant could conflict with a struct name pretty easily, which you may not want to rename.
[18:50:43] <Peach> and a single file really shouldn't include things with a bunch of the exact same names,  and even if you do, they can still be resolved
[18:50:50] <Peach> structs should *always* be scoped
[18:50:51] <WindowsBunny> scott: You wouldn't be passing that struct name to a function taking that enum in the first place
[18:50:56] <Peach> but enums are kinda different
[18:51:17] <scott> WindowsBunny: But unless name resolution becomes type-directed, rustc can't tell that you weren't trying to.
[18:51:30] <scott> Type-directed name resolution seems... bad. But idk.
[18:51:36] <Elainemo> And you can't to type checking without resolved names!
[18:51:39] <Elainemo> The whole thing becomes a mess.
[18:51:56] <Peach> ?
[18:52:01] <WindowsBunny> scott: In cases where it is ambiguous, you just refer to the variant explicitly via SomeEnum::SomeVariant
[18:52:07] <Elainemo> Consider the argument type being the associated type of some complex constrained type parameter.
[18:52:22] <scott> Honestly, just `use SomeEnum::*` today and be happy. :P
[18:52:30] <scott> It's so much simpler
[18:52:42] <WindowsBunny> scott: That's what I do with winapi
[18:52:54] <scott> The suggested change is a small gain with a large increase in complexity.
[18:52:58] <WindowsBunny> I glob the contents of each enum into the root of winapi
[18:53:02] <WindowsBunny> and then `use winapi::*;`
[18:53:17] <WindowsBunny> and I jam up my scope with bazillions of identifiers!
[18:53:33] <Peach> Where it's ambiguous, the compiler says  "Did you mean Color::Orange or Fruit::Orange"
[18:53:46] <Elainemo> Peach: detecting that ambiguity is not straightforward.
[18:53:50] <eddyb> Peach: like I said, that's what's planned for glob imports
[18:53:54] <Elainemo> Even knowing what type is expected is not straightforward.
[18:53:58] <scott> That can be done easily with globs for sure.
[18:54:21] <eddyb> (which would be opt-in, right now any chance of ambiguity doesn't compile, even if there are no ambiguous uses)
[18:54:21] <Elainemo> If you want to try the possibilities, well, typechecking isn't fast, and you just made it N times slower.
[18:54:35] <Peach> Elainemo: explain? Symbol lookup should be a straight forward thing anyway that goes from local scope all the way to global anyway?
[18:54:40] <scott> WindowsBunny: That seems semi-reasonable. I prefer to keep globs in small scopes so it's easy to tell where most names came from from the use statements, but if you have so many...
[18:54:41] <Peach> Or do you do it faster somehow?
[18:54:52] <Peach> Cause if the language has shadowing,
[18:54:55] <eddyb> Peach: except you are trying to make it type-dependent
[18:54:58] <Peach> then doesn't it do it anyway?
[18:55:08] <eddyb> I believe that's what Elainemo was referring to
[18:55:11] <Elainemo> yes

[19:12:09] <Peach> in Rust, can nothing other than a bool be in an if?
[19:12:17] <scott> Peach: Correct
[19:12:30] <eddyb> (just like Java, incidentally)
[19:12:37] <WindowsBunny> My code warns, but is otherwise valid

[19:13:58] <WindowsBunny> scott: This could be used to do some really obscure code!
[19:14:07] <scott> It's great for macros.
[19:14:17] <Peach> So uh
[19:14:18] <scott> (Almost everything being an expression, that is)
[19:14:22] <Peach> I don't get Rust's macros
[19:14:31] <WindowsBunny> Peach: Neither do I
[19:14:36] <Peach> why aren't they the same semantics as the rest of the language?
[19:14:44] <WindowsBunny> because they operate on the AST
[19:14:44] <Elainemo> Peach: because they're syntactic.
[19:15:03] <Elainemo> entirely different level of abstraction
[19:15:09] <Peach> Would it not be possible to have first class AST access in Rust Elainemo ?
[19:15:18] <scott> You can do that with compiler plugins.
[19:15:37] <scott> It would be neat to have procedural macros stabilized and easy to write.
[19:15:39] <Peach> no, Native first class type and AST inspection in Rust language itself scott 
[19:15:53] <scott> You can write compiler plugins in Rust, so still.
[19:15:56] <scott> It's just not stable.
[19:15:57] <Elainemo> So, you write a program which modifies the AST.
[19:16:08] <Elainemo> How does that... work?
[19:16:18] <WindowsBunny> I'd love to have procedural macros in stable Rust
[19:16:20] <Elainemo> You compile the program and... what?
[19:16:26] <Peach> Elainemo - even simpler - a function that accepts "code" and can emit text that the compiler  substitutes
[19:16:28] <WindowsBunny> assuming they're better designed than the current macro_rules
[19:16:33] <Astraea> Elainemo: it's compiling all the way down
[19:16:42] <scott> Procedural macros would have to be compiled in an earlier stage.
[19:16:47] <scott> (As they are now.)
[19:16:49] <Elainemo> Peach: can those functions use other code in the module?
[19:17:15] <Peach> Huh?
[19:17:20] <Peach> Ok, lemme give an example
[19:17:23] <WindowsBunny> Peach: could the function call another function which itself uses the macro that the first function is defining?
[19:17:47] <scott> Peach: Elainemo is just pointing out issues you'll inevitably run into implementing this kind of macro support.
[19:17:54] <Elainemo> fn regular_thing() { } syntax fn macro(code) -> text { ... regular_thing() ... }
[19:18:01] <niconii> umm, text substitution sounds a *lot* like C macros
[19:18:07] <niconii> and those come with a *ton* of issues
[19:18:20] <Peach> niconii: no, something better - it uses the same syntax and is type checked
[19:18:26] <Astraea> #undef niconii 
[19:18:28] <Peach> *same syntax as rest of the language
[19:18:32] <Peach> and same semantics
[19:18:34] <niconii> Astraea: :c
[19:18:45] <Elainemo> #error
[19:18:49] <Peach> It just returns a string that the compiler can replace inline - so programmable code generation
[19:19:07] <Elainemo> Peach: ideally macros are hygenic..
[19:19:22] <Elainemo> you should study Racket's macro/reader system.
[19:19:29] <niconii> so, if you create a macro that expands to 1 + 1
[19:19:31] <Elainemo> for the state of the art
[19:19:34] <Astraea> speaking of, #undef now()
[19:19:43] <Astraea> that's also in the code I was looking at earlier
[19:19:44] <Peach> Elainemo: ok I'll study Racket's macro system
[19:19:48] <niconii> and use it like `2 * macro()`
[19:19:52] <Peach> here's what I'm saying though:
[19:19:55] <niconii> does that print 4 or 3
[19:20:01] <Peach> say you have C style    for(int i = 0 ; i < 10; i++)    and you want to simplify it so it works like     ifor(10)   to do the same thing
[19:20:31] <Peach> code function ifor(int x) { return "for(int i = 0; i < \(x); i++)"; } 
[19:20:35] <Elainemo> I think we all know what you're saying, it's just a gross idea :P
[19:20:40] <scott> You can write that in Rust with macro_rules today (it would be cfor!(i, 10) or similar)
[19:20:45] <scott> Doing macros with strings is a bad idea.
[19:20:50] <Elainemo> there are better ways to do i
[19:20:51] <Elainemo> t
[19:21:00] <Peach> No Elainemo you gotta explain, because I totally think Rusts macros are gross and confusing
[19:21:00] <c74d> Peach: are you sure you want to return text, not AST?
[19:21:03] <niconii> Peach: can you answer my question?
[19:21:15] <Elainemo> Peach: that's because you don't understand them at all.
[19:21:22] <Peach> Where is your question niconii 
[19:21:27] <Elainemo> They're more complicated than "magic code that returns text"
[19:21:27] <c74d> AST to be spliced into the AST, rather than text to be spliced into the text
[19:21:38] <Elainemo> but it's for robustness.
[19:21:38] <scott> Rust macros can't go wrong in really bad ways like C-style string macros can.
[19:21:54] <niconii> Peach: if you have a macro that returns "1 + 1", and use it like `2 * macro()`, does that result in 4 or 3
[19:22:05] <scott> Or even like Common Lisp-style unhygienic macros.
[19:22:44] <Peach> niconii: macros would be verbatim text substitution, so the same as   2 * 1 + 1
[19:22:50] <niconii> Peach: if it just directly expands, you'll get `2 * 1 + 1`, and operator precedence will do the multiplication first, resulting in 3
[19:22:51] <eddyb> lol
[19:23:02] * eddyb popcorn
[19:23:05] <Peach> Ok, so
[19:23:06] <Elainemo> eddyb: inorite
[19:23:07] <eddyb> well, no, it's cob corn
[19:23:09] <niconii> Peach: yeah, this is the source of tons of bugs in C.
[19:23:21] <eddyb> still delicious
[19:23:25] <Peach> What about upgrading to emit AST nodes niconii ?
[19:23:29] <Peach> would that be better?
[19:23:47] <scott> Working on the AST is much better, yes
[19:24:08] <Peach> I would make it so it just returns AST nodes and doesn't try to modify anything
[19:24:09] <scott> Then you can emit an expression node and it would be equivalent to 2 * (1 + 1) which is what you expect
[19:24:15] <Peach> ^
[19:24:19] <niconii> which is pretty much what rust macros do.
[19:24:40] <Peach> But Rust macros use an ugly syntax niconii :P
[19:24:49] <Elainemo> they do for now.
[19:24:49] <Peach> Not unified with the rest of the language
[19:24:55] <Elainemo> the current macro system will perish.
[19:24:56] <niconii> yes, but syntax is syntax, semantics are what matter
[19:24:58] <scott> Yes, this is what we have already today. macro_rules is just a stable wrapper around a subset of what compiler plugins can do.
[19:25:26] <scott> Based on Scheme/Racket's macro system, which is one of the nicer ones in existence.,

[19:42:15] <niconii> parens/braces are mandatory
[19:42:30] <Elainemo> Peach: you can use playbot in a query
[19:42:37] <Peach> oh
[19:43:30] <niconii> being able to omit parens/etc. for macros would be especially problematic since macros can have arbitrary syntax
[19:44:28] <niconii> say you have a macro that takes a series of idents with no seperators between them besides whitespace
[19:44:46] <niconii> so macro!(a b c d e)
[19:45:14] <niconii> if you could omit the parens, you could do macro! a b c d e
[19:45:25] <niconii> but what if you wanted to use macro! inside macro!
[19:45:44] <niconii> macro! a b macro! c d e f g
[19:46:17] <niconii> how many should the inner macro get?
[19:46:31] <Elainemo> everything to the right!
[19:46:34] <Elainemo> parens to disambiguate!
[19:46:41] <Elainemo> J's parsing is pretty neat, should look into it :P

[19:47:32] <Elainemo> 5x9
[19:47:48] <niconii> well i guess that's one way to do it
[19:48:04] * Peach looks at J
[19:48:08] * Peach cries
[19:49:12] <niconii> i've always liked forth's parser
[19:49:30] <niconii> literally just break on whitespace
[19:49:51] <niconii> read each word, if you need special syntax, just have a word hijack the parser to do its own thing
[19:50:41] <niconii> does lead to some weird things like the hello world program being
[19:50:46] <niconii> ." Hello, world!"
[19:50:53] <niconii> where the space after ." is completely mandatory
[19:51:07] <niconii> and isn't actually part of the string
[19:51:21] <niconii> but i do like the KISS aspect of it
[19:52:31] <niconii> basically it's just a word called ."
[19:53:00] <niconii> which when executed grabs all following input until it hits a "
[19:53:15] <niconii> prints the string it got, then returns to normal parsing
[19:54:35] <scott> Yeah, Factor does the same thing
[19:54:55] <scott> CHAR: is a library-defined "parsing word" that lets you write CHAR: a for a character literal 'a'
[19:55:16] <scott> Very little is language-defined
[19:56:33] <niconii> scott: oh, by the way, i forgot to elaborate earlier
[19:56:36] <c74d> sounds like my concept's ideal
[19:56:48] <niconii> you asked about whether forths used bytecode, and i said "no", but
[19:56:56] <c74d> (having very little be in the language rather than the library)
[19:57:00] <niconii> there are a number of forth processors
[19:57:16] <Elainemo> http://www.excamera.com/sphinx/article-j1a-swapforth.html released recenetly.
[19:57:22] <niconii> where that basically is what's going on; the bytecode is just machine code is the thing
[19:57:30] * Elainemo has a few of that FPGA
[19:57:34] <niconii> there's also retro, which is a forth dialect that uses a vm, and thus bytecode
[19:57:46] <scott> niconii: I meant to refer to the "threaded code" or whatever they call it in forth, but I wasn't sure if they had special instructions for primitives like integer addition

[19:59:52] <Elainemo> I had forgotten about it.
[19:59:58] <Elainemo> I made my current circle of CS friends read it
[20:00:10] <Elainemo> None of them had ever really seen forth before
[20:00:12] <Elainemo> it's a shame
[20:00:19] <Peach> In Rust can you redeclare a class in the same scope? 0.O
[20:00:24] <scott> I might write an x86 OS that bootstraps to Forth as quickly as possible. That would be fun.
[20:00:44] <scott> Or, a Forth-like, at least
[20:00:46] <niconii> scott: so anyway, + would be a normal word, but instead of one with a pointer to the normal forth interpreter routine, it's a pointer to an addition asm routine

[20:27:38] <Peach> programming language design is especially cool when you can have your own playbot to let other people test out your language
[20:29:46] <Peach> Static analyzed languages is one area I really like
[20:30:05] <Peach> cause there aren't many new ones that come with that
[20:31:33] <niconii> personally i'm planning to write a colorforth dialect so
[20:31:54] <niconii> making a playbot would be awkward, since color is part of the syntax

[20:32:39] <niconii> nah it'd be like four or five probably
[20:32:56] <niconii> i could just substitute prefix symbols maybe

[20:33:07] <niconii> oh?
[20:33:15] <Astraea> what
[20:33:46] <Astraea> oh
[20:33:51] <Astraea> kind of yeah
[20:34:10] <Astraea> I had actually considered using color in lieu of curly brackets to denote scope
[20:34:56] <niconii> ahh, that's a little different than my case
[20:35:18] <Elainemo>  /b 12
[20:35:20] <Elainemo> ff
[20:35:33] <Astraea> hmm...
[20:35:36] <Astraea> downtown denver
[20:35:44] <Astraea> I might get an apartment there
[20:36:17] <niconii> for mine, a red word means "define this word as starting here", yellow means "compile this word", and green means "execute this word immediately"
[20:36:58] <Astraea> niconii: to be fair I'm trying to think of a way to separate the code from how it's displayed
[20:37:22] <Astraea> so... that's just one idea, I don't actually care how things get displayed, I'll probably serialize it back into text at the start
[20:37:58] <niconii> right, i could replace the colors with prefix symbols in my case as well, and just display it with colors
[20:38:08] <scott> Analogously, you could show Rust code by stripping "fn" and making the name after it red, stripping the ! from macros and making them green, etc
[20:38:20] <niconii> yeah

[20:40:10] <Astraea> give me a bit, need to make a phone call
[20:40:15] <niconii> by the way, i guess i dropped a color; there would also be white for comments
[20:41:11] <scott> Hmm, that sounds nice. Comments anywhere without ugly /* */ constructions.
[20:41:59] <niconii> in any case i may or may not scrap the color part of it and just go with normal syntax; depends on how big of a pain it ends up being
[20:43:23] <niconii> colorforth has a lot of other interesting ideas as well, color is more of a gimmick than anything
[20:43:23] <Astraea> scott: YES!

[20:47:22] <Astraea> my thoughts are jumbled, I really need to write them down and organize them tbh

[20:49:09] <Astraea> I tend to think in something close tot he AST, then I serialize it into text, then the lexer/parser deserializes it into an AST

[20:51:28] <scott> I made a language with a nice REPL, but no IRC bot because sandboxing is a pain.
[20:52:08] <Astraea> I just see so many problems with textual based languages
[20:52:21] <Astraea> even if my ideas don't pan out, it's better to try and fail than stick with the status quo
[20:52:46] <Astraea> hopefully some day future generations will look back upon our textual programming languages the same way we look at punch card programming
[20:52:55] <Astraea> with utter confusion and disbelief =P
[20:53:07] <Peach> Astraea: For really complex expressions, I don't know how you can get more efficient than text though - You want a GUI system or?
[20:53:35] <Astraea> Peach: GUI system as in... point and click with a mouse?
[20:53:37] <Astraea> if so, absolutely not
[20:53:48] <Astraea> that's slow as hell
[20:53:56] <Peach> (8*2+x/3+10)   - like do you edit * with a drop down menu?
[20:54:18] <Astraea> no, if it can't be done from the keyboard then it won't be a good solution
[20:54:28] <niconii> Peach: playbot competition? well... i *do* have a brainfuck interpreter lying around...
[20:54:43] <Peach> More rules:
[20:54:49] <Peach> has to be a serious language
[20:54:51] <Astraea> and keep in mind that that expression can be displayed in a vastly better way if you're not limited to text
[20:54:52] <Elainemo> I refuse to accept more rules
[20:54:52] <scott> arithmetic is still an area where you do want something really close to plain textual input, but a lot of code is not arithmetic
[20:54:53] <Peach> no esoteric
[20:54:54] <Elainemo> since I already started
[20:54:59] <Peach> lol Elainemo 
[20:55:02] <Peach> what did you do
[20:55:02] <niconii> Peach: brainfuck isn't serious? :c
[20:55:11] <Astraea> and it becomes a matter of navigating a tree
[20:55:14] <Peach> No niconii 
[20:55:24] <Peach> It's a snarky way for progammers to be rude
[20:55:28] <Peach> :P
[20:55:37] <niconii> Peach: ...but no, i agree. i wrote 99 bottles in brainfuck, and needed 99 bottles by the time i was done
[20:55:46] <Elainemo> amen
[20:56:30] <Astraea> http://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/piet/99bottles_big.png
[20:56:36] <Astraea> that's how a real programmer makes 99 bottles
[20:56:44] <Elainemo> +1
[20:56:45] <Astraea> abstractly!
[20:56:49] <scott> Perfect, a non-textual language
[20:56:54] <scott> Piet is what Astraea wanted all along
[20:56:56] <Peach> Image based programming is kinda cool
[20:57:08] <Astraea> I've written 3 interpreters for piet
[20:57:11] <Astraea> it's a fun language =)
[20:57:18] <Zoxc> In piet?
[20:57:23] <Peach> Actually
[20:57:24] <Astraea> no
[20:57:28] <Zoxc> :(
[20:57:28] <Astraea> I've thought about it, Zoxc 
[20:57:36] <Peach> You can convert text to png actually
[20:57:39] <scott> Do you ever try running random photographs?
[20:57:45] <Peach> 0 - 255 chars
[20:57:56] <Zoxc> Can you JPEG programs?
[20:57:57] <Peach> UTF8
[20:57:58] <Astraea> oh yeah, I piped a ton of random photographs into my interpreters
[20:58:02] <Astraea> they mostly just do nothing
[20:58:17] <scott> Peach: A friend of mine wrote a program to store arbitrary data in PNGs on imgur
[20:58:33] <scott> text, executables, whatever
[20:58:39] <niconii> Peach: well, not utf-8, many byte sequences are invalid in utf-8
[20:59:05] <Astraea> then again you either treat colors that aren't part of the rules as white or black
[20:59:12] <Astraea> so... not that interesting
[20:59:13] <Peach> ASCII is limited though, but you can def encode it as UTF8 
[20:59:14] <scott> niconii: You can store UTF-8 in a PNG, just not all PNGs are valid UTF-8
[20:59:20] <Peach> ^
[20:59:22] <niconii> scott: right
[20:59:39] <Peach> I wonder if it saves file space at all
[20:59:45] <niconii> probably most aren't; 0xFF is illegal in UTF-8 no matter what
[20:59:48] <Elainemo> unlikely.
[21:00:06] <Elainemo> the only likely candidate is RLE and most text isn't RLE friendly.
[21:00:09] <niconii> as well as 0xFE and maybe some other bytes
[21:00:14] <Peach> Think about how dense of a program you can make
[21:00:19] <Elainemo> I guess for spaces
[21:00:22] <scott> PNG would cut down on whitespace probably
[21:00:39] <Astraea> so Elainemo these structured editors, can you provide an example?
[21:00:54] <Elainemo> Astraea: http://www.guilabs.net/
[21:00:56] <Peach> Unfortunately, it isn't practical to bar scan a PNG acurately
[21:01:07] <Peach> so I can't think of a use for it
[21:01:09] <niconii> (yeah, C0, C1, F5 through FF; all are invalid in utf-8)
[21:01:18] <Peach> but a QR code program would be so epi
[21:01:19] <Peach> c
[21:01:35] <Elainemo> why isn't it practical?
[21:01:37] <Elainemo> I'd think it'd work fine?
[21:02:11] <Astraea> why can't I ever have an original thought
[21:02:13] <Astraea> stupid people...
[21:02:16] <c74d> how should I start implementing a programming language?
[21:02:39] <Elainemo> c74d: I like to start with the abstract structure and make an interpreter.
[21:02:47] <Elainemo> Then define a syntax and iterate.
[21:03:38] <c74d> I used to have a start of a compiler for a far older edition of my current concept, but it was a mess, and did nothing but segfault, when I could get it to link.
[21:04:27] <c74d> "abstract structure"?
[21:05:26] <Elainemo> A bytecode or other intermediate representation representing the constructs of the language, but not syntactically.
[21:05:33] <c74d> ah
[21:06:50] <c74d> my concept is fairly Lisp-y in its approach to syntax, is having an IR still appropriate?
[21:06:52] <Elainemo> Peach: meh, I've lost interest already.
[21:06:55] <Peach> Elainemo: the detail you'd need to scan a really large program is too much for most camera's precision to handle
[21:07:05] <Elainemo> oh that's what you mean
[21:07:15] <Elainemo> I thought you meant feeding a png into a bar scanner
[21:07:30] <Elainemo> c74d: maybe, maybe not.

[21:07:59] <c74d> what programming language to use...
[21:08:03] <Peach> Lol Elainemo 
[21:08:09] <c74d> something with sum types, definitely.
[21:08:26] <scott> c74d: I've heard of a good language with sum types
[21:08:28] <c74d> something with good parsing libraries
[21:08:54] <scott> I have not found a convenient way to write a parser in Rust yet...
[21:09:02] <Peach> Elainemo: how far did ya get?

[21:10:59] <huon> scott: and niko's larlpop seems kinda magic
[21:11:02] <Elainemo> nom is good but it's not good for parsing context-free languages.
[21:11:03] <huon> *lalrpop
[21:11:16] <scott> I would use nom for specific things, but I wanted to hand-write a recursive descent parser
[21:12:08] <scott> I think if I keep iterating on my current approach I'll be able to figure out something good.

[21:33:11] <Tiffany> oh I see what's happening
[21:33:20] <XMPPwocky> i.e. transparently having a renderer process that actually uses Servo instead of Gecko
[21:33:27] <Tiffany> yeah, the connection closed
[21:35:07] <Elainemo> XMPPwocky: that'd be neat.
[21:35:11] <Elainemo> XMPPwocky: should bring it up in #servo
[21:35:35] <XMPPwocky> the nice part there is that you could initially render only certain websites that you know work well in Servo; then, as it develoops, render websites that you know are broken in Gecko; and finally switch transpparently over to all-servo
[21:35:56] <XMPPwocky> Elainemo: hm, good idea

[22:50:54] <Elainemo> you need to write something
[22:51:12] <c74d> I did
[22:51:45] <c74d> does Git require a message body now, in addition to a summary line?
[22:51:48] <eddyb> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URAJsTlPnnc cool tool, but the canvas is too small :(
[22:52:02] <niconii> c74d: no
[22:52:15] <c74d> I wouldn't disapprove
[22:52:18] <eddyb> (heh, I just saw my name, around 2:15)
[22:52:28] <niconii> c74d: though if you just have a summary line, `git commit -m "message"` works
[22:52:41] <niconii> rather than going into vim and all that
[22:52:51] <niconii> (as for why vim isn't working for you, not really sure)
[22:55:06] <c74d> okay, using `vim` rather than `gvim` worked

[23:44:29] <Peach> dfockler: I plan to rewrite the language in itself someday
[23:44:37] <dfockler> that's cool
[23:44:54] <c74d> rather than starting small, with just an interpreter or such, I started with a full LLVM-based compiler
[23:44:59] <Peach> One of the goals is to be cleaner than Rust - less concepts to learn but still really powerful
[23:44:59] <c74d> it did nothing but segfault
[23:45:02] <dfockler> I wouldn't even know where to begin on a compiled language
[23:45:22] <Peach> compiling to C is the best option that everyone ignores :P
[23:45:42] <Peach> LLVM manually is good only if you really really know what you're doing
[23:45:56] <Peach> otherwise segfaults everywhere and no debugger :'(
[23:46:10] <dfockler> I'm just doing an interpreter in rust
[23:46:31] <WindowsBunny> Peach: compiling to C means compiling to nasal demons
[23:46:32] <c74d> well, mostly, it wouldn't even build, and the only way to fix it I could come up with was "#if-0-#endif"-ing out the entire compiler
[23:46:52] <WindowsBunny> Peach: aka you're very likely to run into UB

[23:47:22] <ChrisMorgan> niconii: ah, that’s the spirit!
[23:47:34] <Peach> Lol niconii , I'm totally stabilizing it though

[23:51:58] <Tiffany> because uh.. reasons
