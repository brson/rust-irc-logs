[02:06:18] <patrickkim> hi simon
[02:06:26] <patrickkim> i have question
[02:06:47] <patrickkim> i try to read width attr in "<img width="100%"/> "
[02:07:07] <SimonSapin> ah, presentational attributes
[02:07:30] <patrickkim> https://github.com/mozilla/servo/blob/master/src/components/main/layout/box_.rs#L126
[02:07:42] <patrickkim> now, width,height read by here
[02:07:59] <patrickkim> it cannot parse %
[02:08:13] <patrickkim> do you have any idea for this problem?
[02:10:51] <SimonSapin> http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/the-map-element.html#attr-dim-width says the attribute value is a non-negative integer
[02:11:00] <SimonSapin> so I expect that 100% would not parse
[02:11:07] <SimonSapin> do other browsers apply it?
[02:11:57] <patrickkim> yes,
[02:12:06] <cmr> the web \o/
[02:12:17] <SimonSapin> wait, that’s author requirements
[02:12:41] <SimonSapin> user-agent requirements below eventually link to http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/common-microsyntaxes.html#rules-for-parsing-dimension-values

[02:13:01] <SimonSapin> … which includes percentages
[02:13:11] <patrickkim> :(
[02:13:41] <SimonSapin> but that value is a presentational hint
[02:14:00] <SimonSapin> that is, an input to the cascade like CSS style rules
[02:14:06] <SimonSapin> with author origin and zero specificity
[02:15:17] <patrickkim> is there utility function to parse that value in servo?
[02:15:26] *** Joins: lurk_ (chatzilla@moz-F088D030.hsd1.in.comcast.net)
[02:15:48] <patrickkim> you think that we shuold not support that "%" values?
[02:16:12] <SimonSapin> I’d be surprised if that particular syntax is already supported in Servo
[02:16:37] <SimonSapin> there is two things: parsing that syntax, that’s the link above
[02:17:26] <SimonSapin> and making it (with other presentational hints) an input to the cascade. That’s bug #1517. If you don’t want to do that just yet, you can approximate by using the attribute when the CSS value is 'auto'
[02:17:26] <crowbot> Issue #1517: Make presentational hints have author origin an zero specificity - https://github.com/mozilla/servo/issues/1517
[02:18:50] <SimonSapin> But presentational hints are not high in my personal priorites. Everything they do can be done with CSS
[02:18:59] <SimonSapin> eg. <img style="width: 100%">
[02:19:13] <cmr> (aren't they deprecated in favor of css?)
[02:19:42] <SimonSapin> cmr: yes, it’s a legacy feature that’s necessary to render existing content
[02:19:46] <SimonSapin> don’t use them in new content
[02:19:55] <patrickkim> is there a utility for str to ~[ComponentValue]?
[02:20:29] <SimonSapin> I don’t believe adding them to Servo will have a significant impact on the overall architecture
[02:20:45] <SimonSapin> patrickkim: yes, in rust-cssparser
[02:21:26] <SimonSapin> but note that HTML’s "rules for parsing dimension values" syntax is not based on CSS
[02:22:08] <patrickkim> is str->~[ComponentValue]->LengthOrPercentageOrAuto bad thing you think?
[02:22:18] <patrickkim> because it is not spec?
[02:23:35] <SimonSapin> patrickkim: the only reason to have presentational attributes at all is compatibility with legacy content
[02:23:56] <SimonSapin> if we implement almost-but-not-quite the same syntax, we still risk compatibility issues
[02:24:11] <SimonSapin> I’d rather not support the attribute at all, for now
[02:24:58] <patrickkim> ok 
[02:25:07] <patrickkim> thank you SimonSapin!
[02:25:19] <SimonSapin> (Actually, cssparser::tokenize returns an Iterator<(ComponentValue, SourceLocation)>, but you can use .map(|(c, _)| c).to_owned_vec() on that)
[02:25:22] <cmr> SimonSapin: does servo have the goal of supporting the whole web? or does it mind breaking it.
[02:26:03] <cmr> (specifically legacy junk)
[02:26:42] <SimonSapin> cmr: Servo could be the chance to experiment and see how much legacy junk we can get away with not implementing, and still render the web
[02:27:29] <SimonSapin> but eventually yes, we want to render the web IMO :)
[02:28:45] <SimonSapin> patrickkim: this is my opinion, but then why were you interested in <img width="100%"> specifically?
[02:29:26] <patrickkim> because, many web sites is made by that value :(

[05:40:05] <SimonSapin> recrack: I’m not sure, does it make sense to have more glyphs than code points?
[05:45:40] <recrack> SimonSapin: if i put roman upper(I, II, III ...),
[05:45:56] <recrack> I = glyph_count(1u)
[05:46:05] <recrack> II = glyph_count(2u)
[05:46:16] <recrack> ...
[05:46:29] <recrack> but, char_max is
[05:46:36] <recrack> I = 1u
[05:46:39] <recrack> I = 1u
[05:46:42] <recrack> II = 1u
[05:47:03] <recrack> so assert!(glyph_count <= char_max) is fail.
[05:47:23] <recrack> II -> assert!(2u, 1u)
[05:48:23] <recrack> and i
[05:48:32] <SimonSapin> I see. In that case the assert looks wrong indeed. Just make sure to explain all that in the commit message
[05:48:35] <recrack> using roman character is unicode
[05:49:44] <SimonSapin> depending on the font and the code point, a single code point can be rendered with more than one glyph.
[05:52:23] <recrack> SimonSapin: Thanks.

[08:36:14] <patrickkim> in this article
[08:36:39] <patrickkim> says, "In HTML 4.01, the width could be defined in pixels or in % of the containing element. In HTML5, the value must be in pixels."
[08:37:01] <Ms2ger|deputyduty> Don't read w3schools, it's known to be wrong a lot
[08:37:07] <patrickkim> is it wrong? or we should implemented html5?
[08:37:10] <patrickkim> ah ha
[08:37:25] * Ms2ger|deputyduty looks what the spec says
[08:37:47] <Yurume> http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/the-map-element.html#attr-dim-width ?
[08:38:12] <Yurume> The width and height attributes on img, [...], if specified, must have values that are valid non-negative integers.
[08:38:25] <patrickkim> in pixel?
[08:38:39] <patrickkim> thank you Ms2ger, Yurume!
[08:39:09] <Yurume> patrickkim: you should never believe W3Schools no matter if you are an author or a browser developer ;)
[08:39:19] <patrickkim> ok :)

[08:40:45] <Ms2ger|deputyduty> a) Authors should not use percentages in those attributes
[08:40:55] <Ms2ger|deputyduty> b) Browsers should still implement percentages

[08:42:16] <Ms2ger|deputyduty> For a: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/the-map-element.html#attr-dim-width
[08:42:25] <Yurume> Ms2ger|deputyduty: really? I cannot find a corresponding specification in the WHATWG HTML section 15. maybe I'm missing something...
[08:42:29] <Ms2ger|deputyduty> For b: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/rendering.html#dimRendering
[08:42:35] <Ms2ger|deputyduty> Wait
[08:42:46] <Ms2ger|deputyduty> That doesn't mention img...
[08:43:22] <Yurume> and that doesn't imply that the `width` attribute can get anything possible in CSS anyway
[08:44:05] <Ms2ger|deputyduty> ?
[08:45:50] <Ms2ger|deputyduty> Looks like we found a spec bug
[08:45:53] <Yurume> hmm!
[08:45:58] <Yurume> yeah, that seems to be self-contradicting
[08:46:36] *** Joins: dwainfaithfull (dwainfaith@90CFE50D.665C37FB.F9C4C345.IP)
[08:46:46] <Ms2ger|deputyduty> Hmm?
[08:46:56] <cmr> spec bugs.
[08:46:59] <cmr> what a surprise.
[08:47:18] <Yurume> so the `width` attribute is supposed to be integer-only but when it gets a percentage (which is impossible as per the premise) it should be used for a presentational hint.
[08:47:30] <Ms2ger|deputyduty> It's not impossible
[08:47:44] <Ms2ger|deputyduty> It's just not conforming for authors to write a page that does that
[08:48:12] <Yurume> then why is it missing from the obsolete features?
[08:48:21] <Ms2ger|deputyduty> The spec for browsers defines the behaviour on all inputs, regardless of whether a document that uses it is conforming
[08:48:35] <Ms2ger|deputyduty> Probably because nobody thought of adding it
[08:49:50] <Yurume> > For example, "the foo attribute's value must be a valid integer" is a requirement on producers, as it lays out the allowed values; in contrast, the requirement "the foo attribute's value must be parsed using the rules for parsing integers" is a requirement on consumers, as it describes how to process the content.
[08:50:01] <Yurume> okay, it is now clear that Ms2ger|deputyduty is correct
[08:50:20] <Yurume> I haven't read the HTML spec thoroughly yet ;)
[08:52:56] <Ms2ger|deputyduty> It's not clear to me that anybody has :)

[18:05:18] <marianoguerra> sorry to bother here but you may know a little bit more about this, I need to pass a *XEvent as a parameter to a function in xlib, how do I declar and pass it
[18:05:26] <marianoguerra> XEvent is an alias to c_void
[18:05:44] <marianoguerra> pub type union__XEvent = c_void /* FIXME: union type */;                        
[18:05:45] <marianoguerra> pub type XEvent = union__XEvent; 
[18:06:08] <marianoguerra> the function is pub fn XNextEvent(arg0: *Display, arg1: *XEvent) -> c_int;
[18:06:21] <marianoguerra> is there some place where I can read about rust interop with C?
