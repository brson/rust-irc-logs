[00:00:02] <centennial> I'm a math major but I have a lot of background in cs (one class away from the major)
[00:00:11] <jdm> heh
[00:00:19] <centennial> which is why i'm generally looking for internships/entry-level. I dont have any industry programming experience yet.

[00:06:11] <kmc> I think my knowledge was out of date by the time the plane landed =)
[00:06:25] <jdm> I learned it in order to start hacking on the compiler after it successfully bootstrapped
[00:06:49] <eddyb> I started by fiddling with rustic (pcmattman's kernel project)
[00:06:59] <jdm> one year later we realized I had a very unique combination of skills with my background in browser development

[02:03:43] <pradeep> ibnc: Hi. Could you explain what #1831 was about? I don't quite understand the display list index idea :)
[02:03:43] <crowbot> Issue #1831: Children of fixed flows don't make it to their parents display list. - https://github.com/mozilla/servo/issues/1831
[02:03:58] <ibnc> sure
[02:04:58] <ibnc> The fixed flow itself has boxes, and those were being appended to the correct list, but the children of the flow didn't have an updated index; so, they were making it into the wrong display list.

[02:07:09] <pradeep> lpy: pong
[02:07:38] <ibnc> It's kinda grey at the moment. Display lists for fixed displays represent the need for a new compositor layer; whereas generally, display lists are going to represent paint order for stacking contexts.
[02:07:41] <lpy> pradeep: hi. yesterday you said I could use `style.Box.get()` to get the box from `ComputedValues`
[02:07:59] <lpy> pradeep: I got the no field error
[02:08:07] <pradeep> ibnc: Where is the multiple display list being used differently from a single display list? AFAICS, in display_list.rs we simply iter over all the lists combined.
[02:08:18] <pradeep> ibnc: hmm... I'm actually working on paint order atm
[02:08:29] <lpy> pradeep: the `Box` in `ComputedValues` is different from the one in `box_.rs` I think
[02:08:38] <pradeep> lpy: yes. it is different
[02:09:05] <pradeep> lpy: see box_.rs, e.g., self.style().Box.get().vertical_align
[02:09:15] <ibnc> pradeep: I'm currently working on implementing multiple compositor layers. I've got the basic implementation finished see (https://github.com/mozilla/servo/pull/1678)
[02:09:19] <pradeep> lpy: is used in the vertical_align function

[02:10:03] <pradeep> ibnc: cool. so how do we translate items in the display list(s) into the different compositor layers?
[02:10:19] <ibnc> pradeep: as it stands the multiple display list setup isn't ready to full support stacking contexts. Sorting still needs to be done, and the weird cased have to be taken into account.

[02:11:38] <ibnc> pradeep: Well, I've added new fields to both the DisplayList, and CompositorLayer: an id to associate them, and a parent id. So, we send that data to the compositor, and it creates a new layer for the fixed displays.

[02:13:40] <pradeep> larsberg: was kidding :) I know you guys are at the Rust workweek
[02:13:43] <larsberg> I think one of our big questions is whether we really want to maintain the stacking context hierarchy or if we want to flatten them all out when we are building the set of display lists to send over

[02:14:15] <pradeep> larsberg: cool. Yeah, that seems to be the big design choice
[02:14:18] <ibnc> I'd actually think that's the best approach larsberg 
[02:14:28] <larsberg> We are probably going to type something up and then try to loop in roc and bz
[02:15:11] <pradeep> larsberg: great!
[02:15:27] <larsberg> The big concern I have is making sure that we don't make too many layering decisions on the layout side, but provide as much information as possible for the renderer (e.g., is it fixed or because of a CSS animation/opacity) so that the renderer can make platform-specific choices about # of layers
[02:16:25] <larsberg> But, if this takes too long, I still want to talk about how to possibly do something shorter-term to get z-index working, since I don't want to hold up all of acid2 for a month of display list refactoring :-)
[02:17:34] <pradeep> larsberg: sure :) I don't know too much about the compositor requirements (and some animation stuff that pcwalton mentioned), so once we can list them all out, I will try to factor them into the design
[02:18:41] <larsberg> pradeep: I'm still learning as well, primarily from the people who've been doing the Android / B2G work, as they've had to do a lot of tuning of their layers code to get good perf on mobile

[05:43:07] <bharadwaj> Hey guys... I am getting a illegal hardware instruction (core dumped) error when running servo. What could be the reason?
[05:43:26] <cmr> bharadwaj: that's an abort.
[05:43:37] <cmr> (llvm emits the ud2 instruction for aborts, which is always illegal)
[05:44:03] <cmr> bharadwaj: you'll have to capture a backtrace in gdb for more information.

[05:50:14] <bharadwaj> cmr: does that mean anything different, or do I have to capture a backtrace in gdb? How could I do that?
[05:50:41] <cmr> bharadwaj: I don't know enough about servo to know exactly what that error means, but it looks like you're hitting OOM
[05:50:45] <cmr> sorry!
[05:51:18] <larsberg> bharadwaj: do you have the msttcorefonts package installed? Servo currently does not behave well at "falling back " if the fonts it is looking for are not available
[05:51:20] <bharadwaj> cmr: np.
[05:51:42] <bharadwaj> larsberg: that's a good question... let me check...
[05:52:31] <bharadwaj> larsberg: I did install fonts, but I don't remember myself accepting any EULA, which I should have if that were installed properly...
[05:52:50] <bharadwaj> *did install the installer... 
[05:53:51] <larsberg> yeah, if you're on ubuntu/debian 'sudo apt-get install msttcorefonts' should have taken you through that awesome 80s-feel license agreement thing after it downloaded the package
[05:56:59] <bharadwaj> larsberg: it seems like the installer was installed, accepted the agreement too.. but the proxy server I am using is actually blocking the download of those fonts... 
[05:57:12] <bharadwaj> didn't see that coming....
[05:58:31] <larsberg> bharadwaj: that is a new and exciting failure mode :-) we're planning to address this (#1474 ), but haven't gotten a fix yet, unfortunately. I'm sorry for the inconvenience!
[05:59:17] <cmr> larsberg: btw I couldn't reproduce with an up-to-date fontconfig... has anyone else been able to?

[06:00:22] <larsberg> cmr: Oh! I didn't know that. And by 'up to date' do you just mean the one that kmc integrated into the build process? If so, shouldn't it have worked for bharadwaj ?

[06:24:00] <bharadwaj> Do I have to 'make' servo each time I make any change to the code? How do you guys do it... it's took me very long time the first time...  
[06:24:36] <cmr> bharadwaj: it's much much faster after the first time.
[06:24:53] <bharadwaj> cmr: good to hear that...
[06:25:37] <bharadwaj> larsberg: funny thing.. I am still getting fontconfig errors, however servo is running...

[14:31:42] * Ms2ger scrolls back
[14:31:52] <Ms2ger> if (*vp).v != 0 { 1 } else { 0 }
[14:32:10] <Ms2ger> (*vp) is a JSVal, (*vp).v its bit-representation
[14:32:25] <Ms2ger> The bit pattern 0...0 is a double with value zero
[14:32:35] <Ms2ger> And in particular, not null
[14:32:40] <jdm> Ms2ger: JSVal is a Rust struct containing a single field
[14:32:54] <Ms2ger> Yes, 'v'
[14:33:18] <jdm> I'm fairly certain this was ported directly from the gecko codegen
[14:38:29] <jdm> hmm, it's definitely different than the equivalent line ine Codegen.py

[14:58:01] <Ms2ger> Because that's what the spec says :)
[14:58:31] <abinader> yeah, but getElements... functions are supposed to return Element-like nodes, right?
[14:59:52] <Ms2ger> Sure
[15:00:22] <abinader> so if HTMLCollections are for Element-like only types of nodes, it sounds more appropriate

[16:28:57] <lpy> I mean when through the spec, when calculating the clientTop, it should return the computed value of the 'border-top-width' property plus the height of any scrollbar rendered between the top padding edge and the top border edge

[16:38:39] <lpy> SimonSapin: Hi SimonSapin
[16:38:39] <SimonSapin> I don’t think Servo has any scrollbar yet
[16:39:08] <SimonSapin> but when it does, I suspect we’ll want overlay scroll bars that don’t take up any space and fade out when inactive for a while
[16:39:10] <lpy> SimonSapin: so what I should do now is just to return the border-top-width for clienttop?
[16:39:47] <SimonSapin> assume that scrollbars take up 0 space

[19:29:02] <jgraham> abinader: I'm really sorry that failed so hard :(
[19:29:31] <jgraham> My best suggestion at this point is to avoid in-place rewrites as much as humanly possible
[19:29:42] <Ms2ger> I already did that
[19:29:49] <Ms2ger> Maybe that's why I don't find it hard :)
[19:30:15] <abinader> jgraham: no problem :-)
[19:30:47] <abinader> however, in-place rewrites seems inevitable when the function you're working on has changed since first review attempt
[19:31:13] <jgraham> Huh?
[19:31:22] <abinader> in the case of HTMLCollection
[19:31:25] <jgraham> In place rewrites are never necessary

[19:31:56] <jgraham> I mean if you have commits like A-A'-A''' you shouldn't squash them into a single commit B
[19:32:20] <abinader> there were a coulpe of patches
[19:32:28] <abinader> each doing something unrelated, right
[19:32:43] <abinader> but then the code I was working on has changed
[19:33:07] <abinader> thus I had to do in-place rewrites otherwise the patches wouldn't rebase
[19:33:28] <abinader> not sure if you followed it
[19:33:35] <jgraham> I don't understand :)
[19:33:44] <jdm> modifying existing commits while rebasing is fine
[19:33:49] <jgraham> Obviously if there are merge conflicts you need to fix them
[19:33:52] <jdm> squashing them is not, afaiu
[19:34:14] <jgraham> (merge conflicts during a move-type rebase)
[19:34:23] <jgraham> (confusingly)
[19:34:37] <abinader> yes, a bit :-)
[19:35:00] <abinader> from previous critic reviews,
[19:35:07] <abinader> I usually upload a single patch
[19:35:17] <abinader> then get reviews, fix the issues w/ new patches
[19:35:24] <abinader> and then at the end, when accepted,
[19:35:29] <abinader> I squash them all together
[19:35:34] <abinader> right, Ms2ger?
[19:36:09] <jgraham> That sounds right
[19:36:10] <abinader> but I didn't did it for HTMLCollection because I was unable to create another patch to fix both issues pointed by first review *and* conflicts
[19:36:36] <jgraham> So rebasing and fixing conflicts is thought to work OK
[19:36:40] <abinader> so I rewrote the patches to reflect the changes and fixes at the same time
[19:36:55] <abinader> right
[19:37:05] <jgraham> It kind of helps if you don't think of "patches"
[19:37:13] <jgraham> A branch is a series of commits
[19:37:48] <jgraham> At the end you might create a "new" branch with the same total diff but organised into different commits
[19:38:04] <jgraham> and merge that rather than the branch that you did the work on
[19:38:37] <jgraham> But that doesn't mean that you have to keep the original branch looking clean through its lifetime
[19:40:02] <Ms2ger> abinader, okay, is cloneNode in a better shape? :)
[19:40:03] <abinader> yes, that's what I try to do (sounds like a behavior addiction from past projects)

[20:06:24] <jdm> Ms2ger: why would Optional be different than Option?
[20:06:26] <cmr> you should see some of the other python scripts.
[20:07:03] <Ms2ger> jdm, well, I'd argue they're semantically different, and that it's useful to have the type system enforce that
[20:07:17] <jdm> Ms2ger: can you enlighten me on the difference?
[20:07:39] <jdm> this is just something like optional boolean foo, right?
[20:07:43] <Ms2ger> Option<T> is T or null; Optional<T> is a T that either is or isn't passed
[20:08:03] <Ms2ger> And in particular, Optional<Option<T>> is a nullable T that either is or isn't passed :)

[20:10:15] <jdm> Noncompulsory<T>
[20:10:34] <SimonSapin> sounds like splitting hair. What’s wrong with Option<Option<T>> if you need a nullable thing that may not be passed?
[20:10:42] <Ms2ger> discretionary<T>? :)
[20:10:57] <jdm> SimonSapin: personally my brain breaks a little bit when I see things like Some(None)

[20:12:13] <jdm> bah, I can't really find anything better :/
[20:12:32] <jdm> and Option for null _is_ idiomatic
[20:12:50] <Ms2ger> Right, that's the annoying bit
[20:12:52] <SimonSapin> for optional as well
[20:13:09] <Ms2ger> Mm
[20:13:21] <Ms2ger> But optionality doesn't spread through the system so much
[20:13:28] <jdm> right
[20:14:04] <Ms2ger> I guess I'll leave it with Option for now and see how bad it turns out
[20:14:13] <jdm> yeah, that's what I'm leaning towards too
[20:14:28] <jdm> maybe we could do type Optional<T> = Option<T>
[20:14:57] <jdm> I can't wait to see Option<Option<JS<Blob>>>

[23:19:18] <Armavica> hello, I am experimenting with rust-xlib, is it possible that some of the bindings are wrong? I had to replace "*" by "*mut" at some places to make it work
[23:20:40] <Armavica> (for instance XFree)
[23:21:22] <jdm> Armavica: it's quite likely that they're "wrong"
[23:21:40] <jdm> make whatever changes you require

[23:51:25] <jmgrosen> is there any way to create a vector of function pointers with different return types?
[23:51:31] <unsafe> no.
[23:51:50] <jmgrosen> yeah, I guess that doesn't really make much sense
