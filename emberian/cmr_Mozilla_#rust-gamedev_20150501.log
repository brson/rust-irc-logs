[00:41:23] <kkimdev> Q: Do popular Rust game libraries use floating point for time and absolute coordinates?
[00:46:21] <kkimdev> (if so, I think fixed-point is worth considering http://home.comcast.net/~tom_forsyth/blog.wiki.html#%5B%5BA%20matter%20of%20precision%5D%5D )
[00:47:06] <Tiffany> it doesn't make much sense for coordinates
[00:47:19] <Tiffany> a lot of operations are really expensive to implement for fixed-point, since there's no hardware acceleration
[00:47:25] <Tiffany> try implementing fixed-point sin()
[00:47:33] <Tiffany> for time, absolutely

[00:48:42] <kkimdev> Hmm is there a case that we want to apply trigonometric functions on absolute coordinate values?
[00:49:06] <Tiffany> physics in particular is very difficult to do in fixed point
[00:49:23] <Tiffany> lots of varying precisions too
[00:49:56] <Tiffany> pretty much nothing you can do will be faster than just using doubles

[00:50:24] <kkimdev> I could be wrong, but I have an impression that most(if not all) physics calculation starts from distance type, not absolute position
[00:50:30] *** Joins: lenstr (lenstr@moz-nde.vju.25.171.IP)
[00:50:39] <aatch> Given that I'm currently writing a physics engine, the idea of using fixed-point seems mad.
[00:50:53] <Tiffany> doubles have enough precision that you can have positions out to about the radius of the earth and still not have any meaningful precision loss
[00:50:56] <aatch> Especially since you then instantly lock yourself out of using SIMD
[00:51:20] <Tiffany> things get lossy when you start trying to represent the entire solar system as a contiguous space
[00:51:52] <Tiffany> in which case, you might want to switch to some kind of reference frame-based system
[00:51:56] *** Quits: lenstr (lenstr@moz-nde.vju.25.171.IP) (A TLS packet with unexpected length was received.)
[00:52:02] <kkimdev> I think most operations should be still in float, but just absolute coordinate can be fixed-point.
[00:52:04] <Tiffany> for example, orienting relative to the nearest large body, or perhaps in a regular grid
[00:52:39] *** Joins: alex-abreu (alex@moz-j54ho8.biz.rr.com)
[00:52:51] <Tiffany> how practical would you say that is aatch, to convert to a relative coordinate frame in double before doing any math?
[00:52:55] <Tiffany> from fixed point
[00:53:01] <Tiffany> I think that's doable
[00:53:06] <Tiffany> it's a bit overkill though
[00:53:15] <Tiffany> unless you are building a 1:1 scale solarsystem sim
[00:54:38] <kkimdev> yeah I think actual implementation will be annoying, and I can't say it's worth or not, but I think that the concept is appealing (from the article linked)
[00:54:41] <aatch> Tiffany, the issue is converting back to fix-point at the other end. You're liable to lose precision.
[00:55:27] <Tiffany> it's not so bad thoug
[00:55:47] <Tiffany> if you're building a sandbox game, double is liable to be so huge that players would have to walk for thousands of years to even see the smallest amount of precision loss
[00:55:48] <aatch> Tiffany, but it kinda defeats the point of having fixed-pointed to start with.
[00:55:52] <Tiffany> unless you have ridiculously high velocities
[00:56:04] <Tiffany> if you're building a game built out of set pieces, you can use float quite safely

[00:56:14] <Tiffany> you can go out a couple hundred thousand units before precision loss hits
[00:56:17] <fkaa> minecraft starts to go wonkers at +- 2m iirc
[00:56:30] <Tiffany> fkaa: minecraft switched to double coordinates
[00:56:39] <Tiffany> in older versions of the game, it went bonkers at around 500k out
[00:56:46] <fkaa> oo, i'm out of the loop it seems
[00:56:57] <Tiffany> in newer versions, it arbitrarily caps the edge of the world at 30 million out
[00:57:00] <Tiffany> there's a few bugs
[00:57:04] <Tiffany> some parts of the game still use floats
[00:57:13] <Tiffany> such as tnt, particles, falling sand
[00:57:15] <Tiffany> those are all quite buggy
[00:57:22] <Tiffany> bug moving around and placing blocks is completely fine
[00:57:41] <aatch> Kerbal Space Program uses a moving origin that jumps to the current position if you get more than ~3000m away from the origin.
[00:57:54] <Tiffany> 30 million is where float has an epsilon of 1, by the way

[00:58:19] <Tiffany> I heard it can lead to your craft in other areas being knocked unstable
[00:58:35] <Tiffany> if they're unloaded I think their orbital calculations continue fine? or they just get frozen?
[00:59:04] <aatch> Tiffany, that's unrelated. They have an "on-rails" system that uses calculated orbits.
[00:59:11] <Tiffany> ah
[00:59:37] <aatch> All of those calculations are done using double-precision floats (while the Unity physics engine is single-precision floats).

[09:13:15] <eddyb> might be much easier to use one of the existing GL tracing tools
[09:13:22] <OneSadCookie> particularly since a lot of the functions were structured such that the cause had been lost long before the error was set

[13:31:58] <scape> I tried latest beta too, both for git and crates for conrod
[13:33:13] <Layl> try "cargo update"
[13:33:18] <Layl> then build again
[13:33:31] <Layl> if that doesn't work, probably something broke
[13:34:21] <scape> yea no luck
[13:34:53] <scape> always such a pain to try out a new lib in rust, everyone is on a different version it seems :(
[13:35:21] <Layl> by far not as much a pain as trying out a new lib in C
[13:35:32] <scape> hah
[13:35:50] <scape> it'll be good when 1.0 hits
[13:35:59] <Layl> I'm currently working on being able to break away from conrad
[13:36:10] <Layl> because I don't like the piston dependency and I want some specific features it doesn't have
[13:36:51] <scape> well i wanted to try elmesque, bc elm is cool and simple it seems. but conrod supposedly is using elmesque now, at least the git version seems to have a dependency
[13:37:03] <scape> conrod does have some nice stuff out of the box it seems
[13:37:29] <Layl> conrod uses elmesque yea
[13:37:34] <scape> maybe i should just try elmesque for now, have you given that a try?
[13:39:12] <Layl> I haven't
[13:39:41] <scape> elmesque relies on piston libs, still doesn't build :-\
[13:39:48] <scape> i'm so impatient sometimes hah
[13:40:34] <Layl> huh piston isn't building?
[13:40:35] <Layl> that's odd
[13:40:52] <scape> vecmath isn't, i'm not sure which libs depend on that would have to look

[14:26:31] <scape> tomaka: rust says it's skipping incompatible lib, I have latest freetype dll too
[14:26:52] <tomaka> scape: you're probably using the 32bits version of the library with the 64bits compiler, or the contrary
[14:27:03] <scape> ah i see thanks, i'll check
[14:27:22] <Layl> since it's a pain to get a 64 bit version of freetype for windows, it's probably that you're using a 64 bit compiler for a 32 bit dll
[14:27:27] <Layl> and not the other way around
[14:27:56] <scape> Layl: how do i get the 63bit dll? I didn't even see it specified on the site
[14:28:13] <Layl> iirc, you need to build freetype from scratch to get a 64 bit dll for it on windows
[14:28:14] <scape> 62*
[14:28:28] <scape> djgese dang i'm crosseyed :D
[14:29:03] <Layl> gtk's download site only provides 32 bit ones for windows I think
[14:29:16] <scape> i see an experimental 64bit
[14:29:21] <scape> i'll try that
[14:29:26] <kvark> Layl: nice! first screenshot?
[14:29:33] <Layl> kvark, yep
[14:29:46] <Layl> no font rendering yet, that's just a static picture
[14:30:18] <kvark> doesn't look impressive just yet, but I imagine a good underground architecture behind it ;)
[14:30:34] <Layl> not really
[14:30:45] <Layl> it's just got the decent basis to build upon
[14:30:56] <Layl> I can add font rendering without even touching the rendering layer
[14:31:05] <Layl> though I probably want to add some helpers

[15:44:27] <mtsr> kvark: Still working on the code, but some quick answers to your questions: Enum is not a bad idea, thanks. The unsafe transmute on the thread_local should be safe, since the thread local is only ever accessed by the scheduler running on that specific thread. The Arc<Mutex<Receiver>> is simply to turn the normally Multiple Sender Single Receiver channel into a Multiple Sender Multiple Receiver channel with locking. There is one scheduler per
[15:44:27] <mtsr>  thread which resides in the thread_local ENV. I need to clean up the code to make it more clear, I guess.

[17:36:33] <rsaarelm> I had utterly atrocious compile times when I tried to build release binaries for 32-bit Windows a while back, compared to 64 bit. Is there some known problem there?

[17:37:36] <rsaarelm> I guess 32-bit is the sensible default for casual Windows downloadables though.
[17:40:05] <ytain> 32bit is more common for apps that are not complicated, while 64bit is more common for apps that are complicated and require a lot more memory than 3GB can provide from a 32 bit environment, like Autodesk Maya, 3DSMAX etx
[17:40:07] <ytain> etc

[22:45:47] <stjahns> bvssvni: do you know if it's possible to define custom conrod widgets outside of the conrod crate? It didn't seem like it last night, but maybe I just wasn't grokking things properly
[22:46:29] <bvssvni> stjahns: it is possible, but currently it uses a generic parameter instead of Box<Any>
[22:46:56] <bvssvni> stjahns: I want it to use Box<Any> because it makes simpler to combine custom widgets from different libraries
[22:47:29] <stjahns> ahh cool, I'll try giving it another shot when my head isn't mysteriously throbbing with pain :/
