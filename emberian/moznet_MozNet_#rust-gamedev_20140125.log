[02:59:40] <Amaranth> photex: bjz's sdl2-rs seems much better structured but it's only ffi, no rust wrapper (yet?)
[03:00:00] <bjz> Amaranth: I want to make a really nice sdl wrapper
[03:00:08] <bjz> but I just haven't had the time
[03:00:14] <Amaranth> Understandable
[03:00:33] <Amaranth> I'm not comfortable enough with rust styles to do it, I think
[03:00:55] <Amaranth> I did a big chunk of rust-sdl2 but that was just following its existing style and rust-sdl style mainly
[03:00:56] *** Joins: samx (sami@moz-D9DA5773.dyn.optonline.net)
[03:00:56] <bjz> glfw is nice, because it is so simple, but sdl is good because valve is supporting it, and it has good joystick stuff
[03:01:10] <Amaranth> sdl2 is only the only one with a sane text input API :)
[03:01:18] <bjz> yep
[03:01:34] <Amaranth> Considering how much people care about unicode in rust land I figure that should be a big selling point
[03:01:51] <bjz> if you want to collaborate on making an awesome SDL wrapper, let me know
[03:02:05] <bjz> I do think that is is important to keep the ffi separate
[03:02:08] <Amaranth> Did you generate these ffi files?
[03:02:14] <bjz> no, by hand :P
[03:02:19] <Amaranth> In rust-sdl2 they're separate, sort of
[03:02:26] <bjz> I don't trust generators :P
[03:02:27] <Amaranth> In the same files but in a separate module
[03:02:47] <Amaranth> Which does force your API to look a lot the C one but for bindings that is usually a good thing
[03:03:03] <bjz> I'm thinking the actual wrapper might be structures differently, but I dunno
[03:03:15] <Amaranth> Well, it doesn't force it but it does make it easier to go that way
[03:03:24] <bjz> having the same sort of modules is good
[03:03:33] <Amaranth> One thing that is tricky to deal with is that technically rust-sdl2 is shutting down incorrectly
[03:03:43] <bjz> yeah?
[03:04:04] <Amaranth> It uses the Drop trait for cleaning up surfaces and GL contexts and such but you have to manually init and quit the subsystems (just like you're doing so far)
[03:04:23] <bjz> see, servo wants to get onto Android, but currently glfw isn't ported to that
[03:04:25] <Amaranth> But that means you are cleaning up your surfaces after you've otherwise shut down
[03:04:37] <bjz> so they have to use glut -_-#
[03:04:50] <bjz> (they use glfw on the desktop)
[03:05:03] <Amaranth> SDL2 seems to be okay with this but it's not right and probably really fragile
[03:05:14] <bjz> yep
[03:05:21] <bjz> agreed
[03:05:46] <Amaranth> I don't know how to solve it though without making you do manual cleanup of your surfaces
[03:06:00] <bjz> I have some ideas.
[03:06:14] <Amaranth> Or making a global wrapper object that handles the init and does the shutdown in Drop
[03:06:23] <Amaranth> And that hands out surfaces too
[03:06:30] <bjz> but yeah, I would need help doing up examples and stuff to test the wrapper
[03:06:50] <bjz> yeah
[03:07:33] <bjz> you could do something like std::unstable::finally
[03:07:33] <Amaranth> Well, so far everything I've wanted to work on other than the rust-sdl2 bindings hasn't happened so I can't make any promises
[03:07:43] <bjz> ah ok
[03:07:52] <bjz> what have you wanted to work on?
[03:07:53] <Amaranth> I mean, I have the time and I'd like to help

[03:08:32] <bjz> ooh
[03:09:30] <Amaranth> Now I've instead been thinking of doing something like https://github.com/anholt/libepoxy instead of working on gl-rs
[03:09:40] <Amaranth> But again, I don't know that I'll ever get to it, motivation is hard
[03:09:54] <bjz> motivation takes practice

[03:10:08] <bjz> well, not at once
[03:10:16] <bjz> but have multiple things on the go
[03:10:33] <bjz> then when you get bored of one, go onto something else for abit
[03:11:06] <bjz> do you think it's worth working on a new sdl wrapper? or am I just being pointlessly NiH
[03:11:25] <bjz> I'm a stickler for beautiful APIs
[03:11:29] <Amaranth> Well, I like your ffi setup and I'm curious to see how you handle events
[03:11:55] *** Joins: rdn (rdn@moz-3FCD2726.tk)
[03:12:03] <Amaranth> The rest of it is more basic 1:1 C->Rust mapping you can slap out basically as fast as you can test it
[03:12:34] <Amaranth> So not really much point in doing more than once but you've already done one of the two tricky bits so you may as well go on with it
[03:12:43] <bjz> yeah, that's a tricky thing. I was thinking of just going down the route of copying the stuff out of the union into an rust enum
[03:12:56] <bjz> might be the safest way

[03:13:17] <Amaranth> Heh, that's exactly how rust-sdl and rust-sdl2 handle events (I copied from rust-sdl)
[03:13:23] <bjz> heh
[03:13:26] <bjz> yeah
[03:13:36] <bjz> do you have an iterator for the events?
[03:13:55] <Amaranth> No, you just poll or wait just like in C and get one event per call
[03:14:10] <Amaranth> I don't think anything else is appropriate
[03:14:22] <bjz> I was thinking of doing it sort of like the chan API
[03:14:36] *** Quits: dmac (Adium@moz-99EF2EE6.hfc.comcastbusiness.net) (Quit: Leaving.)
[03:14:56] <bjz> you can ask for the next event in the event buffer, and get back an Option
[03:15:30] <bjz> or you can iterate until all the events have been flushed from the event buffer
[03:15:55] <Amaranth> So you're going to emulate a channel calling SDL_PollEvent each time you try to get something from it?
[03:16:11] <bjz> no
[03:16:19] <bjz> I dunno
[03:16:42] <bjz> I think it would be better if event polling was up to the user, no?
[03:17:04] <Amaranth> I've got this bit of code I wrote ages ago that shows how to handle properly pausing on webOS when your card loses focus, I'm not sure anything but direct poll/wait access would be able to handle such a case
[03:17:06] <Amaranth> https://github.com/amaranth/pdk-mainloop-example/blob/master/src/main.cpp
[03:17:39] <bjz> tbh, I need to look at the sdl api again - it's been awhile since I have
[03:18:03] <Amaranth> Ignore the frame limiter that uses SDL timers, that was stupid
[03:18:10] *** Joins: onelson (owen@18CF7301.95770028.5B6BFE7D.IP)
[03:19:21] <Amaranth> Basically it uses SDL_PollEvent until it gets a notice saying the window lost focus then it switches to SDL_WaitEvent so it blocks and stops the app entirely so you don't waste battery running the game in the background
[03:19:43] <bjz> interesting - pretty cool
[03:20:13] <o11c> I can imagine if you're writing a library, there might be *some* annoyed people, but that's the right thing in general ...
[03:20:19] <Amaranth> I got sick of people asking how to limit their game to 30 FPS and how to pause when they lost focus
[03:20:30] <Amaranth> So I made them an example :D
[03:21:00] <bjz> writing wrappers is abit of an art
[03:21:12] <Amaranth> o11c: I can think of a bunch of nuances that would make forcing this on the user via the wrapper a bad thing
[03:21:22] <jeaye> bjz: heh
[03:21:39] <bjz> the interesting thing with rust is how to encapsulate it into a trusted interface
[03:22:00] <bjz> Unique<T> is basically a wrapper over malloc/free
[03:22:13] <o11c> Amaranth: true, but it could be done by a explicit call, i_want_control_over_defocused_pause_dammit();
[03:22:15] <bjz> luckily malloc/free is super simple
[03:22:46] <bjz> something like SDL has tons of undocumented lifetimes flying around
[03:23:05] <Amaranth> I think emulating an iterator for SDL_PollEvent is a cool idea though
[03:23:21] <Amaranth> I mean it basically is one anyway
[03:23:41] <bjz> Amaranth: yeah - I made implemented the iterator for ports, and I <3 it
[03:24:00] <bjz> Amaranth: for msg in port.iter() { ... }

[03:48:33] <o11c> the file-by-file way then

[03:49:18] <bjz> it would be a pain, but a full rewrite would be quite risky

[03:58:06] *** Joins: pepper_chico (pepper_chi@moz-13107F6.dsl.telesp.net.br)
[03:58:17] <bjz> the idea was you could pass around a pointer to the gl struct, then call the function like, gl.Foo(...)
[03:58:24] <Amaranth> I'm guessing this is an optimus problem
[03:58:49] <bjz> would that solve the problem?
[03:59:01] <Amaranth> Like you've got an intel GPU that supports GL 4.2 and an nvidia GPU that supports 4.4 and in a single application you could have two contexts, one on each GPU
[03:59:39] <Amaranth> Basically all of the logic in gl-rs right now but duplicated for each GL context you have
[03:59:43] <o11c> theoretically you can do something like that on Linux too, just nobody does it
[03:59:55] <bjz> so my struct generator might be useful after all
[03:59:58] <Amaranth> Right this will probably be a problem on Linux soon actually
[04:00:14] <bjz> folks were saying "why on earth would you need multiple contexts"
[04:00:23] <bjz> but they probably came from linux land
[04:00:25] <Amaranth> I believe OS X solves the problem by only exposing the common feature set
[04:00:29] <bjz> yeah
[04:00:33] *** Quits: samx (sami@moz-D9DA5773.dyn.optonline.net) (Quit: This computer has gone to sleep)
[04:00:38] <o11c> (in linux, it's mangled copies and weak symbols)
[04:00:38] <bjz> at the expense of holding back the API
[04:00:59] <Amaranth> I suspect for mesa Linux will do the same but who knows what nvidia will do
[04:01:01] <bjz> so whilst our graphics cards can handle gl 4.3, we have to use 4.1
[04:01:04] <bjz> -_-
[04:01:11] <bjz> (no debug callback)
[04:01:19] <Amaranth> (random capitalization!)
[04:01:26] <bjz> ?
[04:01:33] <Amaranth> Me
[04:01:39] <bjz> oh heh
[04:01:56] <bjz> oh well, at least osx is up to 4.1 now
[04:02:18] <Amaranth> iirc nvidia's plan for linux is to have libGL.so be a proxy that can switch out backends on the fly
[04:02:39] <bjz> not that I'd use many of the features included since 3.2. but having up to date glsl is good 
[04:02:42] <Amaranth> So you can have mesa driving your intel GPU and when a program moves to the nvidia one its backend in libGL is swapped out
[04:02:49] <bjz> ah
[04:03:11] <bjz> it's super great that valve has pushed them to improve the linus situation
[04:03:15] <Amaranth> So what extensions you have available would change but your function pointers should all point to the same place
[04:03:17] <bjz> hah, linus
[04:03:28] <Amaranth> Since they just point to the proxy
[04:03:31] <bjz> "Fuck you NVIDIA!"
[04:03:47] <bjz> s/linus/linux/
[04:04:03] <Amaranth> Yeah I wouldn't be surprised if an optimus setup is something valve would like to make use of in a steam machine design
[04:04:03] <bjz> Amaranth: ah, nice!
[04:04:55] <bjz> Amaranth: I mean steam is going to be a propriatory OS though? Sort of like how OS X is built on Unix?
[04:05:25] <bjz> steam os I mean
[04:05:27] <Amaranth> Sort of, more like how webOS, Meego, Sailfish, etc work
[04:05:34] <bjz> I wonder how much they a putting back into linux development
[04:05:44] <bjz> hopefully more than canonical does
[04:05:58] <Amaranth> Linux kernel, closed source GPU drivers, open source plumbing layer, closed source UI layer
[04:06:11] <Amaranth> I guess Meego is all open source, bad example
[04:06:11] <bjz> ok
[04:06:18] <Amaranth> Jolla and webOS then
[04:06:31] <bjz> I'd be fine with that level of openess
[04:06:39] <bjz> it's a good compromise
[04:07:22] <bjz> but the linux folks could use the gpu drivers right?
[04:07:25] <Amaranth> They'll be using your basic desktop components like pulseaudio, dbus, xorg
[04:07:43] <bjz> they're also pushing sdl though, right?
[04:07:43] <Amaranth> The linux folks already have the GPU drivers, it's just nvidia and amd drivers like we have now
[04:07:53] <o11c> the funny thing is, open-source video drivers are finally getting good enough ...
[04:08:19] <Amaranth> o11c: Intel's drivers are really nice and their GPUs are getting to be Good Enough(tm) for a lot of things
[04:08:25] <bjz> yeah
[04:08:31] <bjz> funny about intel
[04:08:36] <Amaranth> But on the AMD side the drivers are only really competitive for the cards AMD no longer releases driver updates for
[04:08:54] *** Quits: pcwalton (pcwalton@moz-C07D5168.p2p.sfo1.mozilla.com) (Quit: pcwalton)
[04:09:09] <bjz> they actually seem to have the benefit of being integrated with the cpu (I think)
[04:09:09] <Amaranth> So with 3 years of time to catch up they've mostly matched the fglrx driver
[04:10:03] <Amaranth> Being integrated with the CPU with a shared memory pool certainly makes "uploading" to the GPU faster :P
[04:10:44] <bjz> cmryeah
[04:10:47] <bjz> woops
[04:10:47] <Amaranth> On the other hand they only have access to DDR3 memory so they are bandwidth constrained, Intel's solution was to slap 128MB of eDRAM on the die as an L4 cache shared by the CPU and GPU
[04:12:00] <Amaranth> Similar to how Microsoft handled bandwidth limits in the 360 and One but those require manual control over what goes in the on die RAM which can be good if you know what to do but otherwise bad
[04:12:45] <bjz> Amaranth: so yeah, anyway, you think a struct generator would be useful for gl-rs?
[04:13:00] <o11c> yes
[04:13:09] <Amaranth> Yeah, even if most people don't actually make use of it to support everything you need it
[04:13:16] <o11c> incidentally, that's what WebGL looks like I think
[04:13:37] <bjz> Amaranth: https://github.com/bjz/gl-rs/commit/4153b09c928482df6e30b0b13e320110a14b91ea
[04:13:55] <bjz> o11c: hmm?
[04:16:21] <o11c> var canvas = document.getElementById("mycanvas"); var gl = canvas.getContext("experimental-webgl"); gl.viewport(0,0,canvas.width,canvas.height);
[04:16:43] <bjz> ahh, nice
[04:16:47] <bjz> thanks
[04:17:15] <o11c> actually
[04:17:27] <o11c> for those who want to target a specific GL version
[04:17:35] <o11c> you should probably make a struct for each version
[04:18:02] <o11c> as well as one for latest+all_extensions

[04:27:46] <Amaranth> bjz: So the GLX specification actually requires the pointers returned from glXGetProcAddress() be context independent
[04:29:30] <Amaranth> What happens in GLX land is even if an extension isn't supported by the current context if it is supported by the implementation at all you'll get a valid pointer that just won't work until you switch to a context that supports it
[04:30:10] <Amaranth> How you'd ever figure such things out I'm not sure
[04:30:57] <Amaranth> Ah, it appears by implementation here they might mean the GL version it claims to support
[04:31:31] <Amaranth> Does that mean on xorg you might have GL 4.3 reported but not actually have all the extensions that make up GL 4.3 actually be available to use?
[04:31:53] <Amaranth> Ugh, I hate multi-GPU setups, I'm just going to never support them and pretend this problem doesn't exist :P

[06:13:21] <jeaye> :)
[06:13:39] <bjz> who is 'hasbecome' on tumblr? :P
[06:13:58] <bjz> they just added me :P

[06:14:39] <bjz> o/
[06:15:13] <photex> my tumblr isn't full of cool things 
[06:15:26] <photex> one little post demonstrating delaunay triangulation in CL
[06:15:38] <photex> but soon there will be more Rust entries! :)

[06:18:48] <photex> haha
[06:19:05] <bjz> :D
[06:19:24] <bjz> now, didn't anybody tell you to stay away from nehe?
[06:19:31] <photex> what's funny is that it's just so much easier to do simple visualizations with immediate mode
[06:19:37] <bjz> yes
[06:19:38] <photex> haha hey man, I come from waaay back
[06:20:03] * bjz jokes
[06:20:04] <photex> My first opengl apps were on SGIs

[06:20:52] <bjz> might be too basica for you
[06:21:04] <bjz> but they start going through the new pipeline

[23:08:04] *** Joins: squiddy (squiddy@moz-B55EC66.adsl.alicedsl.de)
[23:08:13] <onelson> thanks for all the infotweets
[23:08:19] <onelson> lots of reading to do now
[23:08:46] <bjz> Not exactly sure, just moving to a place where I could focus on the visual/artistic stuff would be awesome
[23:10:42] <bjz> JesseH: I'm happy to do design work on all levels, but things like game logic and computational geometry are cool, but at this point in time its a whole other rabbit hole
[23:10:51] <bjz> if that makes sense
[23:11:31] <bjz> ecl3ctic: yeah, I'm thinking it would be optimised less for building, more for exploring
[23:11:44] <JesseH> I've got to refresh my knowledge of rust, but i can help code wise. Whats the project about
[23:11:59] <ecl3ctic> bjz: Why not both!
[23:12:11] <ecl3ctic> I want my game to be about exploration
[23:12:25] <ecl3ctic> but some of the best parts of exploration are digging around and finding what's hidden
[23:12:29] <bjz> ecl3ctic: the exploration part is what interests me - creating systems that generate interesting landscapes to explore
[23:12:46] <bjz> and emergent interactions between things
[23:12:53] <ecl3ctic> Absolutely, same here
[23:13:34] <ecl3ctic> I want a world that feels alive
[23:13:46] <bjz> If you allow the landscape to be too easily shaped, folks tend to get settled and be afraid to leave their 'nest'
[23:14:22] <ecl3ctic> I find the problem in Minecraft is that you don't want to explore because you already know what you'll find
[23:14:27] <ecl3ctic> the generation is repetitive
[23:14:30] <ecl3ctic> and predictable
[23:14:38] <bjz> I wouldn't want to force it too much, but it would be nice to emphasise a more nomadic life style
[23:14:48] <Kjelle> My top down 2d game is coming along steady but slowly. Total rust newbie so everything takes a while :D
[23:15:53] <ecl3ctic> bjz: I've thought about games like that as well, where you just wander
[23:15:59] <ecl3ctic> and see what's over the next hill

[23:16:33] <ecl3ctic> Proteus was interesting
[23:16:37] <ecl3ctic> but I feel some sort of connection with the landscape is needed
[23:16:37] *** Joins: bjz (bjz@B398BE78.F804C29E.D35A31DF.IP)
[23:16:55] <ecl3ctic> let me retype that:
[23:17:17] <ecl3ctic> Proteus was interesting, but I feel some sort of connection with the landscape is needed
[23:17:22] <bjz> sorry
[23:17:31] <bjz> yeah, I agree
[23:17:39] <bjz> it's a tricky problem
[23:18:48] <ecl3ctic> now you're bringing back memories of some of previous game concepts...
[23:18:54] <ecl3ctic> where's my scapbook
[23:19:04] <ecl3ctic> scrap*
[23:19:34] <jeaye> Kjelle: Glad to hear it. :)
[23:20:30] <Kjelle> Having the classic "I got a list of abstract entities and need to find the player"-problem
[23:20:56] <bjz> ecl3ctic: anyway, I can't invite everyone on this project unfortunately - and I've tried collaboration before, and lots of times it's been difficult to get things to work out (time issues, diverging goals, language choice etc), but it would be good to find the right person
[23:21:02] <bjz> ecl3ctic: I hope you understand
[23:21:25] <bjz> ecl3ctic: but yeah, still looking
[23:21:48] <bjz> ecl3ctic: PM me if you are interested
[23:22:05] <bjz> And others as well!
[23:22:17] <jeaye> ;)
[23:22:18] * JesseH confuse
[23:22:27] <JesseH> :P
[23:22:34] <bjz> this is basically my long term plan
[23:23:14] <bjz> but yeah, gotta work upt to it in bits
[23:23:29] <bjz> as opposed to doing it all at once
[23:23:34] <JesseH> bjz, gotta repo or somethin?
[23:24:13] <bjz> JesseH: I have, but nothing of note. bits of C++ and Java code from a couple of years ago, and concept art

[23:36:12] <ecl3ctic> Abbott*
[23:36:46] <ecl3ctic> Asshole*
[23:38:42] <bjz> fffff
[23:38:59] <bjz> oh the interwebs doesn't matter
[23:39:21] <bjz> people just use it for watching videos right?
[23:40:04] <ecl3ctic> that's the part that really annoys me... they have no idea how much society depends on the internet for everything
[23:40:19] <bjz> are you aussie too?
[23:40:26] <ecl3ctic> yeah
[23:40:33] <ecl3ctic> Melbourne

[23:40:56] * bjz is collecting names of rusty folks in Melbourne
[23:41:24] <ecl3ctic> yeah somebody gave me a list of Aussies not long ago
[23:41:28] <bjz> wait, have I PMed you before?
[23:41:33] <bjz> might have been you

[23:41:55] <ecl3ctic> it was you or dbaupp
[23:42:03] <ecl3ctic> I've forgotten who's who too :P
[23:42:16] <bjz> heh
[23:42:40] <ecl3ctic> it was about a functional programming meetup or something
[23:43:12] <bjz> yeah, I try to use it as an excuse to meet up with folks
[23:43:46] <bjz> there is yet to be a PLT group, or a Rust group in melbourne
[23:45:30] <dbaupp> bjz: start one ;P
[23:45:42] <bjz> heh!
[23:45:45] <bjz> might do
