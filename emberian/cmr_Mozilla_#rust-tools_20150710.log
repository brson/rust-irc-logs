[19:10:52] <brson> acrichto: it may be possible to minimize the amount of scripting that rust-installer packages need to something that can be copy-pasted
[19:11:33] <brson> rust and cargo could output a configuration as part of 'make dist' and rust-packaging could turn it into installers

[20:08:55] <brson_> acrichto: "cargo install would facilitate sharing Rust code among users" is a bit unclear to me. i think cargo install is for *our* users, not *our users users* right? it's for rust developers
[20:09:21] <acrichto> oh right yeah I meant "users" to be developers in that sentnece
[20:11:10] <brson_> acrichto: is there a future where cargo install might install libs too? i'd like to e.g. preload stdx on a system
[20:11:30] <acrichto> brson_: there's a section in "alternatives" about that
[20:11:36] <acrichto> short answer: maybe, but I doubt it

[20:18:17] <brson_> acrichto: is there any future way to prebuild libraries in cargo?
[20:19:23] <acrichto> brson_: what would the motivation for that be?
[20:19:29] <acrichto> e.g. I'm not sure what problem that would solve
[20:19:33] <acrichto> other than build times
[20:22:47] <brson_> acrichto: it would make the first time compiling common crates go quickly
[20:23:24] <brson_> just like linking to std
[20:23:25] <acrichto> brson_: if it's purely just compile times then we could perhaps do that yeah, basically just cache compiles
[20:23:36] <acrichto> well the key part to std for me is that you don't declare you depend on it
[20:23:49] <acrichto> and you get precisely one version

[21:27:09] <acrichto> brson_: would you expect an RFC for cargo project templates? https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/1747
[21:28:44] <brson_> acrichto: i think no
[21:28:56] <acrichto> hm ok
[21:29:05] <acrichto> I kinda almost would
[21:29:12] <acrichto> but perhaps not all the way
[21:29:20] <brson_> it's tempting to for sure
[21:29:59] <brson_> but being outside of rust-lang/rust means it gets more leeway
[21:30:29] <brson_> maybe its spelled out in the rules
[21:30:42] <acrichto> hm true
[21:31:29] <brson_> idk. if you think it should it should
[21:32:05] <huon> it seems kinda bikesheddy, but also something that might benefit from feedback
[21:33:30] <acrichto> I think I may just advertise it a little more broadly when it gets close
[21:33:47] <acrichto> I'd basically be uncomfortable being one of three people with eyes on this feature before shipping it to everywhere
[21:48:58] <vadimcn> acrichto: re pre-built libraries, I dunno about *nix and OSX, but on Windows compilation of crates with non-Rust dependencies rarely goes smoothly (and you usually need to install mingw in order to compile any C/C++ code).   It would certainly make Windows experience much smoother in such cases.
[21:49:57] <acrichto> vadimcn: oh I don't think this was in the sense of us shipping binaries
[21:50:04] <acrichto> but rather in the sense of you don't recompile for all your projects

[21:50:13] <acrichto> e.g. all projects share the same copy
[21:51:34] <vadimcn> oh. too bad

[21:54:31] <acrichto> vadimcn: yeah, although you'd still have build scripts to compile native deps if necessary
