[00:32:12] <reem> can this get a needs-decision? https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues/1025
[00:32:33] <frewsxcv> YES +1 to that
[00:33:00] <seanmonstar> aturon: FromError is to become From<&Error>?
[00:33:11] <reem> please no
[00:33:24] <reem> that would be very bad
[00:33:39] <reem> you would lose so much information
[00:34:01] <seanmonstar> reem: ?
[00:34:37] <reem> seanmonstar: Right now you implement FromError for multiple error types
[00:34:55] <reem> seanmonstar: you would lose the ability to discriminate and have to just use the string-producing methods
[00:35:33] <seanmonstar> reem: ah. From<E> where E: Error?
[00:36:24] <reem> or we could forget the whole thing and just have try! use `From`
[00:37:20] <seanmonstar> sure
[00:37:32] <seanmonstar> end result that im interested in, tho, is that FromError goes away?
[00:38:06] <reem> it's stable right now so you should file an issue to replace with From
[00:38:07] <reem> http://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/error/trait.FromError.html
[00:38:36] <seanmonstar> yea it was stabilized a couple days ago, while the convert stuff was happening

[00:50:29] <scott> map_or_else looks like a kind of eliminator
[00:51:10] <scott> the eliminator for Result would take two functions like T -> U and E -> U and then take Result<T, E> to U
[00:51:23] <scott> map_or_else for Option is similar to that with E = ()
[00:51:40] <freebroccolo> yeah, I think so, looking at the docs just now
[00:51:59] <freebroccolo> I'd prefer if they were called elim or fold since the map part is confusing IMO
[00:52:15] <cmr> oh, my bad.
[00:52:21] <cmr> map_or_else must have changed meaning at some point.
[00:52:22] <scott> map is weird since it doesn't return Option<U>

[00:54:29] <scott> right, which is why it's weird that map_or_else doesn't
[00:54:59] <scott> on the other hand, it's like a composition of map and unwrap_or_else
[00:55:15] <reem> I see
[00:55:16] <scott> map_and_unwrap_or_else
[00:55:19] <scott> :P
[00:55:26] <cmr> map_and_then_unwrap_or_else :P
[00:55:33] <reem> you want map_or_else to be the same as map(..).or_else()
[00:55:34] <cmr> make it extra confusing, but also perfectly straightforward
[00:55:53] <reem> which makes me think we should just remove it :P
[00:56:06] <reem> it's already just a match statement
[00:56:11] <freebroccolo> if we had HKT it would be nice to have a foldable trait… I started to implement MonoFoldable once but it was basically just a different take on iterators…
[00:56:14] <scott> the convention in Haskell is to just name eliminators after the datatype, which is odd...
[00:56:17] <scott> maybe, either, etc

[00:56:32] <cmr> reem: well we have a lot of combinators that are just nicer-to-use matches.
[00:56:59] <cmr> (in fact, all of them?)
[00:57:16] <cmr> it's used exactly one in all of the rust repo
[00:57:26] <scott> freebroccolo: sort of makes sense that foldable would come out like iterators since foldable sort of means "list-like" and lists in haskell often serve as iterators

[00:58:11] <reem> Ya, but map, or_else, and_then, etc. all don't have one branch

[03:39:05] <theme> eh?
[03:39:33] <theme> interesting
[03:40:17] <theme> I feel that rust and go are often compared because they are both like java
[03:40:25] <theme> rust tries to be what java is supposed to be
[03:40:34] <theme> go tries to be a better and simpler java
[03:41:05] <bstrie> I think we could waste a lot of time arguing about what java is "supposed to be" :P

[03:47:16] <bstrie> "In the early 90s, extending the power of network computing to the activities of everyday life was a radical vision. In 1991, a small group of Sun engineers called the "Green Team" believed that the next wave in computing was the union of digital consumer devices and computers. Led by James Gosling, the team worked around the clock and created the programming language that would revolutionize our world – Java."

[17:50:52] <carllerche> aturon: a couple things. 1, to pack the trait object if it is small enough (avoid allocations) https://github.com/carllerche/bytes/blob/master/src/bytes.rs
[17:51:33] <carllerche> aturon: the second was in a tree data structure where the vtable pointer was repeated about 5x per node, I deconstructed it so that I could get the node to fit in a cache line
[17:51:46] <aturon> carllerche: ok, optimizations only
[17:51:50] <carllerche> sure
[17:51:57] <carllerche> but meaningful :P
[17:52:16] <aturon> stabilizing the struct would prevent us from evolving the representation of trait objects, which is a big commitment :)
[17:52:22] <carllerche> the bytes abstraction would take a hit w/o the optimization

[18:31:00] <Tobba> this is the generated asm
[18:31:34] <Tobba> it might be due to the asm since LLVM does pretty whacked out things around it, but I suspect it's just being LLVM

[19:12:04] <seanmonstar> reem: we actually only need it for performance, I think. Since we lookup by TypeId, we want to skip the check in Any.downcast
[19:12:07] <carllerche> seanmonstar: but that isn't future proof
[19:12:13] <seanmonstar> carllerche: eek
[19:12:17] <carllerche> yep
[19:12:28] <huseby> in the debuginfo-gdb tests
[19:12:31] <reem> seanmonstar: That's the TypeId concern, not TratiObject
[19:12:46] <huseby> is there a way to do condintional gdb-checks?
[19:13:03] <huseby> on bitrig, some of the gdb output is slightly different
[19:13:07] <reem> for TraitObject we can just transmute from &&Trait to &*mut(), deref to *mut (), then transmute to the appropriate type.
[19:13:23] <huseby> and instead of ignoring the whole test, I'd like to do a conditional gdb-check
[19:13:29] <reem> which should optimize to the same thing we do now
[19:13:32] <seanmonstar> reem: yea, I'm just saying what we use TraitObject for
[19:13:53] <seanmonstar> Is to skip the branch in Any.downcast
[19:14:11] <reem> seanmonstar: Oh you're saying that we only need it to omit the branches in the Any methods, otherwise we could just use those.

[20:37:15] <reem> aturon: Are we sure about this? https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/969#issuecomment-88233813 the non-extensibility of the current enum is unfortunate.
[20:38:13] <aturon> reem: i don't think the extensibility issue is so relevant; you can always introduce an additional trait that provides additional ways of seeking
[20:38:18] <aturon> reem: that has some additional advantages
[20:38:30] <aturon> because if you have an object that supports the options currently in Seek, but not the new options,
[20:38:35] <aturon> you'll get static checking for it
[20:38:38] <reem> Ya, I'm just skittish about building up APIs we are planning to cut down
[20:38:47] <aturon> not sure what you mean?
[20:39:04] <reem> if we want to introduce this other trait/manner of seeking then the current API will need to be deprecated
[20:39:18] <reem> it's not so bad
[20:39:58] <aturon> reem: no, that's not what i meant -- my point is that we'd want Seek along-side an additional SeekFoo trait,
[20:40:20] <aturon> which furthermore gives you a way to statically distinguish the types of objects that support each kind of seeking
[20:40:29] <reem> ah
[20:40:44] <reem> I see

[22:37:49] <ELD> Hey guys, I saw a reddit comment saying that if we wanted to contribute to Rust, to lurk in the #rust-internals channel and you guys would help out with getting started. I'd like to contribute in any way possible. I'm new-ish to Rust and just now finally diving in (even though I've followed the project since 0.10/0.11-nightly). I just don't know where to start with contributing. Thanks!

[22:51:25] <kmc> the mapping from static atoms to indices is just .get_index() on an OrderedSet
[22:51:39] <kmc> and we have to go the other way too
[22:51:53] <kmc> the mapping from strings to the static indices representing those strings, I mean
[22:52:28] <kmc> we have ambitions to ship h5e (and therefore string-cache) on 1.x in not too long
[22:52:44] <sfackler> simplest option would just be an Index<Type=usize> impl on the iterator
[22:52:50] <sfackler> feels like it could be pretty weird though
[22:53:07] <sfackler> actually yeah that feels gross
[22:53:12] <kmc> a .get_at_index() method on the set itself is fine
[22:53:15] <sfackler> yeah

[23:15:01] <acrichto> I'd really rather not go through and rewrap the whole codebase
[23:15:09] <steveklabnik> third option is to be more okay with non-similar styles
[23:15:24] <steveklabnik> because this hand-wrapping stuff to break my wonderful vim which does the right wrapping is a giant pain
[23:15:37] <acrichto> you could also set the wrapping to 80 in vim?

[23:15:47] <steveklabnik> but that's not the right style
[23:15:48] <acrichto> 80 is much more common in rust-lang/rust
[23:15:53] <acrichto> it's not clear that it's the incorrect style
[23:15:59] <acrichto> I don't think it's authoritatively wrong in any sense
[23:16:04] <acrichto> e.g. all rust code I read/write is 80
[23:16:04] * steveklabnik shrugs
[23:16:07] <steveklabnik> i prefer 80 too
[23:16:19] <steveklabnik> but at least i felt like the call for 100 was made a long time ago
[23:16:26] *** Quits: larhat (Adium@moz-9vj.vcf.204.37.IP) (Quit: Leaving.)
[23:16:34] <acrichto> it was never concrete one way or another
[23:16:39] <steveklabnik> maybe we should bump up figuring that out, because one or the other of us is doing tedius work for no reason
[23:16:43] <steveklabnik> heh
[23:16:43] <acrichto> one day we felt like we had to write down a number so we wrote down "100 max"
[23:16:53] <acrichto> then that eventually became "only 100" defacto, largely by accident
[23:17:02] <acrichto> but yes I think this should be decided before any sweeping changes are made
[23:17:09] <acrichto> and for now I'd just stick to the style that already exists in that file
[23:17:24] <acrichto> it's not as much of a problem as things like line-wrapping which can get really jarring
[23:17:33] <blaenk> we should change rust.vim to use 80 https://github.com/rust-lang/rust.vim/blob/f7aa0cafa7eb4ee31bccc95fb2fa33022ed8094c/doc/rust.txt#L56
[23:17:37] <acrichto> e.g. it's easy to transition between 80 and 100 codebases

[23:18:51] <ChrisMorgan> And 99, with a gentle preference for 79 if convenient, is what was decided on after quite some discussion.
[23:19:20] <blaenk> why 99 and not 100
[23:19:28] <blaenk> oh so 100 could be highlighted?

[23:20:36] <nrc> cmr: ping
[23:20:46] <tiffany> blaenk: for diffs
[23:21:00] <blaenk> 99 preferable to 100 for diffs?
[23:21:13] <tiffany> if the code is at 99, the diff will fit within 100
[23:21:19] <blaenk> I think regardless of choice of column wrapping limit, the fundamental problem is diffing in-source documentation. I think it's a pain point regardless of the choice
[23:21:32] <blaenk> tiffany: ah yeah
