[00:00:23] <naerbnic> The implementation is clear enough: save effectively clones the type into the Box, which is returned, then similarly copies over itself in all valid implementations.
[00:00:23] <scott> fn save(&self) -> Box<Self> would require Sized for Self since you would need Clone and Clone requires Sized
[00:00:49] *** Joins: Jesin (Jesin@moz-t88s6v.cc.lehigh.edu)
[00:01:01] <naerbnic> scott: Right, and as such, you couldn’t have a unique pointer to an unsized type, which is kind of too bad
[00:01:43] <scott> you can have Box<T> where T: !Sized but they have to be made by casting from other things
[00:01:47] <naerbnic> Basically, I want a form of existential type
[00:01:49] <scott> like Box<T> => Box<Trait>
[00:01:54] <naerbnic> And I don’t think Rest really has that
[00:02:03] <scott> the problem with Clone is that it returns a by-value Self
[00:02:12] <naerbnic> Right, which needs to be sized, of course
[00:02:30] <scott> I wonder if you could make an object-safe version of Clone that returns Box<Self> always

[03:37:25] <mkomitee> When designing a library in rust, which is considered more idiomatic for the name of a struct in a module named foo, Bar, or FooBar?  On the one hand, foo::Bar is nicer than foo::FooBar, but if people use Bar and import it into their own module, they'd lose the foo context entirely and access it as just Bar. For some common struct names, that could be odd.

[04:01:52] <borromakot> ugh.  I'm at a loss here.  I can't understand how this line manages to never return `let _ = io::copy(stdin, process.stdin.as_mut().unwrap());`
[04:01:57] <scott> dzyp: to do what it looks like you want to do, you probably should use split_at like GBGamer suggested, and not UnsafeCell

[04:03:00] <Verdagon> in which case itll continuously copy, and keep waiting until theres more to copy, instead of just copying what’s *in* the buffer
[04:03:01] <scott> dzyp: also it's unusual to take Vec arguments instead of slices like &mut [T] and &[usize]

[04:04:26] <dzyp> the parent function is a function that takes a vector to sort it, is it more idiomatic to just take a &mut [T] instead?
[04:04:37] <borromakot> stdio::copy does block while reading.  But it would basically only never return if there is an unlimited number of bytes in stdin, which I guarantee it isn't.
[04:05:07] <Verdagon> in other languages, stdin often acts like there’s an unlimited number of bytes
[04:05:11] <Verdagon> that is, until you press ctrl+D
[04:05:19] <Verdagon> it wouldnt surprise me if rust did the same thing
[04:05:21] <borromakot> sorry, in the case up there, stdin is just a Read buffer.
[04:05:24] <Verdagon> sorry i cant speak with certainty >_>
[04:05:32] <Verdagon> ah, no idea then
[04:05:34] <scott> dzyp: the parent probably ought to take &mut [T] as well. it's more flexible than &mut Vec<T> because it could be used to sort a whole Vec, part of a Vec, part of an array, etc
[04:05:36] <borromakot> stdin is just the variable name that I want to BE the stdin for what I'm doing.
[04:05:52] <dzyp> scott: good point, making that change

[04:48:27] <blaenk> I think it just doesn't show up on rustdoc
[04:48:38] <blaenk> iirc
[04:48:38] <blaenk> cause the docs are built on linux
[04:48:41] <tamird> is there any way to have an optional token in a macro? in particular i want my macro to taken an optional `pub`
[04:48:56] <blaenk> I think you create a separate macro match arm
[04:49:08] <FreeFull> Sgeo_: How so?
[04:49:12] <Brochacho> blaenk: rustc says it can't find it is why I ask
[04:49:16] <tamird> blaenk ah, okay

[04:49:55] <GBGamer> iirc, one has a comma at the end, one doesn't
[04:50:01] <Sgeo_> FreeFull, well, would Rust reject trying to impl the same trait for the same struct twice? On the one hand, the impls would all be identical anyway, on the other hand, why would there be such an exception?
[04:50:19] <Sgeo_> tamird
[04:50:24] <Sgeo_> oops tried to search scrollup
[04:50:58] <FreeFull> Sgeo_: Well, right now it doesn't let you create a trait where Self isn't used in some way

[06:15:15] <darkfox> Vec<&Trait> might be a potential canidate...
[06:15:18] <p1start> darkfox: Well, Boxes introduce an extra level of indirection
[06:15:34] <FreeFull> Boxes also mean allocation on the heap
[06:15:52] <bstrie> if someone wanted to do an `execv` in rust they'd probably want to use `Command` from the stdlib, yeah?
[06:15:56] <FreeFull> & introduces indirection too, but doesn't force usage of the heap, and doesn't handle allocation/deallocation
[06:16:00] <p1start> So to e.g. call a method on the 5th trait object in the vector, you have to dereference twice (once to get the Box<Trait> in the Vec, once to get the data behind the Box<Trait>)

[06:16:51] <reem> darkfox: If you can avoid the Vec, then you can avoid trait objects, which is more flexible and faster. That said, without more context I can’t really recommend one route or the other.
[06:16:57] <bstrie> scott: pretend that I have no idea what execv does, because that's true. what would I use?
[06:17:01] <scott> it spawns subprocesses which is fork+exec on linux

Modular transports for a router - here each transport implements a trait 'Transport' with methods that are used to interact with the transport.

[06:22:50] <darkfox> reem: Structure is mostly unwritten :P I'm working on the modular structure/backbone right now - cargo managed features will define which transports are to be compiled in; then the various transports are simply available to iterate through, initiate and communicate with - and on shutdown, close them down cleanly.

[07:31:58] <cmr> soma: yeah, if you have recursion anywhere where a glob import is involved it will break everything.
[07:32:10] <bstrie> what's the idiomatic way of concatting two string slices

[07:34:43] <bstrie> give me a method
[07:34:50] <reem> bstrie: depends how much you care about perf, simplest thing is `a.to_string() + b`, fastest is `let mut both = String::with_capacity(a.len() + b.len()); both = both + a; both = both + b;`
[07:34:56] <ChrisMorgan> bstrie: why not go for `let mut x = String::with_capacity(a.len() + b.len()); x.push_str(a); x.push_str(b); x`!
[07:34:59] <reem> I think there is push_str also instead of + iirc

[07:35:37] <reem> I posted the with_capacity thing first, you posted push_str first
[07:35:55] * ChrisMorgan is still sad `x += a;` doesn’t work yet
[07:36:24] <ChrisMorgan> If we had an impl Add<&str, Output = String> for &str…

[11:20:44] <terpstra> what is the difference between "foo".to_owned() and "foo".to_string() ? the first seems to just copy it to the heap... i am i reading this right that to_string() calls into write_fmt?!
[11:20:54] <Mutabah> terpstra: Yes
[11:20:55] <cmr> terpstra: yes, you are.
[11:21:01] <cmr> to_string works on lots of types.
[11:21:09] <cmr> (any that implement Display/ToString)
[11:21:10] <Mutabah> terpstra: to_string is essentially 'format!("{}", self)'
[11:21:14] <terpstra> why do all the examples use "dfsdf".to_string() then? it is quite a bit slower i assume ?
[11:21:35] <Mutabah> cmr: Is the current accepted method String
[11:21:37] <Mutabah> cmr: Is the current accepted method String::from()?

[16:21:43] <mindtree> it's flippin' cool
[16:21:44] <steveklabnik> yod4z: you compile the code for a specific architecture, so the code generated will wlays be different. and as Ms2ger says, you can conditionally compile code too
[16:22:03] <phaylon> yod4z: first things that would come to mind is: there's conditionals like Ms2ger said, there's inline assembler, and IIRC there's parts of the stdlib that are platform specific (usually behind abstractions, but stuff might depend on something only available on linux)
[16:22:36] <yod4z> ok, but
[16:22:44] <xeviox> can I get some feedback on this? http://is.gd/J84LhO (I don't like the .unwrap() in the destructor,  but I can't think of a better solution)

[16:23:00] <yod4z> special instructions for a particular architecture (x86). how would I call these from rust?
[16:23:02] <bluss> so you can collect into anything inside the Result..
[16:23:05] <Ms2ger> Iterators really are a part of Rust that doesn't seem terribly noteworthy at first, but gets more amazing the more you use them

[17:52:36] <filsmick> What I understand from the recent issue: with thread::scoped, you can refer to variables from the enclosing stack frame and be assured the references will be valid as the scoped thread cannot outlive the enclosing scope because the destructor of the JoinGuard will run before the enclosing stack frame is destroyed. Well, that's what we believed, as it's possible to prevent the destructor from ever running with reference cycles - sin
[17:52:37] <filsmick> ce the thread doesn't join in time, it can access freed memory. Am I understanding this right?

Am I just missing something here, or do I really have to drop down to libc if I want to exec()?
[19:39:37] <jshs> there's a difference between /std and /std/

[23:23:51] <XMPPwocky> i.e. giant_vec + small_vec is going to be much faster than small_vec + giant_vec

[23:31:41] <ChrisMorgan> So Vec::new() is practically a free operation.
[23:31:56] <bstrie> what am I even doing
[23:31:59] <bstrie> this isn't python
[23:32:13] <scott> bstrie: looks like vec! always creates an exact-sized vec, but if you push to it, it doubles its capacity
[23:32:17] * XMPPwocky hisses at bstrie

[23:32:52] <bstrie> scott: I sort of figured that vecs would first go up to the next power of two, and only then start doubling
[23:33:09] <bstrie> but that probably doesn't buy you anything, maybe
[23:33:14] <bstrie> might be friendlier on the allocator? dunno
