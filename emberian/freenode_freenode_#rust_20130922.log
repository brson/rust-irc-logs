[05:16:19] <jeaye> Hey, man. Good to see you here. :)
[05:16:27] <evincar> Thought I'd try it out.
[05:16:34] <jeaye> It's goin' alright, thanks.
[05:16:42] <jeaye> How're you and the kitten?
[05:17:07] <evincar> Good. I got dinner with strager and went back to my place *ostensibly* to work on it.
[05:18:24] <jeaye> Oh nice. He's helping?
[05:19:18] <evincar> He mostly sanity-checks my design ideas.
[05:19:39] <jeaye> That can be invaluable.
[05:21:19] <jeaye> evincar: Dinner plans tomorrow? We should meet up.
[05:22:29] <evincar> Sure, I heard you moved.
[05:23:34] <jeaye> Yeah, just a few blocks. The gf and I didn't want a roommate anymore.
[05:24:19] <jeaye> Does Kitten have user-defined types now? :D
[05:24:46] <evincar> Nope, just the typedef thing. I haven't made significant progress lately.
[05:25:27] <evincar> Just a bunch of small things here and there.
[05:25:54] <jeaye> I know that feel, bro.
[05:26:13] <evincar> Incremental progress is still progress though.
[05:27:16] <jeaye> Undoubtedly.
[05:29:45] <jeaye> evincar: Been using any Rust?
[05:30:41] <evincar> Looking at it for design ideas. ;)
[05:31:04] <jeaye> Ah, good reason.
[06:17:32] <evincar> jeaye: So if I have an object in x, and I move from x into y, then it's a compile error to use x?
[06:18:14] <evincar> (Supposing an owned box.)
[06:19:28] <evincar> It seems like uniqueness typing is at odds with names.
[06:25:22] <jeaye> Yup
[06:25:56] <jeaye> If you want to keep x around and check if it's moved or not, you'll have x be Option<T>
[06:26:07] <evincar> I have recently grown fond of the term "goto for data" referring to variables. :P
[06:26:33] <evincar> As in, it's a powerful thing, but also readily abused.
[06:26:43] <jeaye> heh
[06:26:44] <evincar> And structured things with less power can be easier to reason about if you don't need the full generality.
[06:29:17] <jeaye> I'm _still_ getting used to Rust's variables.
[06:29:42] <evincar> How do you mean?
[06:31:21] <jeaye> Move semantics in Rust are very different than in C++, as you've found. Referencing is different, copying is different, borrowing is absolutely different.
[06:31:42] <evincar> Is it an annoyance that moves are implicit?
[06:32:01] <jeaye> At first, hell yes.
[06:32:14] <jeaye> But I'm almost liking it now.

[06:35:56] <evincar> It's more like OCaml with less cruft.
[06:36:39] <evincar> A small functional language where you can look at some code and easily compile it at -O0 in your head.
[06:37:12] <bjz> neat
[06:37:24] <evincar> Most Kitten instructions have an analog in x86 that's between 0 and 3 instructions long.
[06:37:45] <evincar> So it's pretty easy to understand the performance characteristics of code.
[06:37:55] <evincar> Or at least it would be if I could finish any of the backends.
[06:38:16] <bjz> so are you aiming for a language that sits right atop assembly? you know - leaves no room below?
[06:38:39] <evincar> More or less.
[06:38:49] <evincar> The idea is to make low-level programming feel like high-level programming.
[06:38:52] <bjz> inline asm?
[06:39:22] <evincar> No, it should be unnecessary.

[06:41:21] <evincar> D and Go are nice but in a slightly different problem space, I think.

[06:46:54] <bjz> evincar: what do you think of mr stepanov?
[06:47:37] <evincar> bjz: Nice guy. I emailed with him once upon a time about generic programming.
[06:47:47] <bjz> oh neat
[06:47:59] <evincar> It was a pretty brief exchange.
[06:48:41] <evincar> Basically I was coming to the realisation that generic programming is lovely, and you can't do it in most languages, but you can't actually do it very *well* in C++.
[06:48:58] <evincar> Which of course was exactly his position.
[06:49:08] <jeaye> Where can you do it well, do you think?
[06:49:14] <bjz> evincar: Been flicking through his book and have been watching his Amazon presentations. I sympathise a lot with his school of thought.
[06:49:28] <evincar> jeaye: That's the thing, I don't think there is a credible alternative at the moment.
[06:49:47] <jeaye> Then what're your gripes with C++'s implementation?
[06:49:48] <bjz> jeaye: in a lightweight form? D or C
[06:49:51] <evincar> Haskell gets you most of the way there, but typeclasses conflate genericity with runtime dispatch.
[06:50:17] <bjz> jeaye: but you get the dreaded template explosions
[06:51:42] <bjz> jeaye: they are adding concepts in C++14, wich seem to be an amazing feat that Bjane and Co. have pulled off. Still not as much as they or Stepanov wanted though. (no axioms)
[06:52:12] <evincar> Concepts are a step in the right direction.
[06:52:19] <bjz> but they are still saddled with the horrifying complexities and vestigual cruft
[06:52:33] <evincar> The fact is that templates are a language for generating code in an ad-hoc way.
[06:52:54] <bjz> evincar: http://www.youtube.com/user/A9Videos/videos
[06:52:55] <evincar> You typecheck the aftermath of the combinatorial explosion.
[06:53:04] <bjz> evincar: yep

[06:54:35] <bjz> evincar: Will be watching you language much more closely now. (I subscribed to you repo notifications on GH a while back)
[06:55:31] <bjz> evincar: even if you don't settle on the C++ style of generic programming, you seem to recognise the power that it gives

[06:58:41] <bjz> :P
[06:59:01] <bjz> is that a consideration? or not so much
[06:59:02] <evincar> evincar: Cheap interop with C, first of all. Foreign imports *and* exports.
[06:59:08] <evincar> Ergh
[06:59:09] <evincar> bjz:
[06:59:11] <evincar> ^
[06:59:14] <evincar> I can autocomplete.
[06:59:37] <bjz> np
[06:59:53] <evincar> Yeah, so if your language can call C code, that's lovely. You can write applications in it.
[07:00:07] <evincar> You can use OpenGL and SDL and PCRE and all the goodies.
[07:00:33] <bjz> yes
[07:00:38] <evincar> But if you want to write libraries, then you need to solve the more interesting problem of being callable as though you were C.
[07:00:45] <bjz> yes
[07:01:40] <bjz> evincar: you also need a reasonably small runtime
[07:02:53] <evincar> bjz: Yeah, preferably with little to no initialisation and shutdown.
[07:02:59] <SiegeLord> Being callable as if you were C doesn't sound much more interesting than the reverse...
[07:03:05] <bjz> evincar: what is your approach to memory management and GC?
[07:03:39] <evincar> SiegeLord: Ah, but it is! If you have a good way to do foreign exports, then you can start taking the place of C for those libraries.
[07:03:57] <bjz> SiegeLord: it is very interesting if a language wants to potentailly take on C on its own terms
[07:04:05] <evincar> SiegeLord: You can say "I give you performance and safety, and interop with me is as easy as with the C libraries".
[07:04:18] <evincar> "And" is a lovely conjunction.
[07:04:28] <SiegeLord> ::shrug:: it doesn't sound revolutionary to me
[07:04:47] <evincar> bjz: Cycle-free language with incremental reference-counted collection.
[07:04:47] <SiegeLord> Now if you did C++ interop, then it'd be something else
[07:05:25] <evincar> SiegeLord: For a functional language, I'm not sure that makes much sense.
[07:05:38] <bjz> SiegeLord: but it's hard, because C++ is such a poor citizen
[07:05:49] <bjz> SiegeLord: it wants to 'be the world'
[07:06:55] <SiegeLord> And in a way, it is... and languages suffer due to not being able to interface with it
[07:08:12] <evincar> SiegeLord: If a functional language exports C-compatible functions and types, C++ can still use them.
[07:08:42] <evincar> You can generate C++ wrappers for those things, I suppose.
[07:08:50] <bjz> SiegeLord: it's a problem that I think can only be solved by C apis. any other approach risks crippling the language.
[07:08:56] <evincar> For instance, replacing typeclass dictionaries with vtables in some cases.
[07:10:09] <bjz> evincar: what do you think of region based appoaches, and linear types?
[07:11:07] <bjz> evincar: eventually you do need GC/RC for some things, but the beauty of those is that the are zero cost
[07:11:38] <bjz> evincar: I know that could add considerable compexity though
[07:11:38] <SiegeLord> I'm just saying that a new language without C interop is unthinkable... it seems odd to even mention it :P
[07:11:48] <evincar> bjz: I find substructural types interesting but unique references seem the most useful.
[07:12:08] <SiegeLord> I made C-accessible libraries in D, but I take it you're not quite interested in that language ;)
[07:12:18] <evincar> bjz: Reference-counting in Kitten is intended to be an optimisation to avoid copying.
[07:12:32] <bjz> evincar: ok
[07:12:46] <evincar> bjz: Region-based memory management is emninently practical but also not so theoretically interesting.
[07:12:49] <evincar> To me anyway.
[07:13:06] <evincar> SiegeLord: Were we ever talking about a language without C interop?
[07:13:31] <evincar> SiegeLord: Including C++ interop is the thing in question.
[07:14:34] <evincar> *eminently, goodness I can't type tonight.
[07:15:08] <bjz> evincar: the thing that I like about it in Rust is that allows me memory saftey, whilst still allowing me to visualise how things fall away at compile time.
[07:16:59] <bjz> evincar: I guess the challenge is doing this kind of stuff in a functional language. I know Rust has difficulties when you want to start implementing functional data structures for example
[07:17:59] <bjz> the lifetimes/ownerships become too challenging to work with - you basically just end up using @
[07:18:57] <bjz> evincar: I would be able to be of more use if I was better versed in type theory, but I'm just a dumb student :P
[07:19:40] <evincar> Yeah, I've had the same problem in C++ starting from unique_ptr and needing to change to shared ownership down the line.
[07:19:49] <bjz> evincar: http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/master/tutorial-borrowed-ptr.html
[07:20:13] <evincar> Somewhere around here I have an owned_ptr which is copyable if its object type is copyable.
[07:20:17] <evincar> It uses new.
[07:20:43] <bjz> evincar: yeah. unique_ptr has runtime overhead right?
[07:20:58] <evincar> So borrowed pointers are the only way in Rust to write code that's polymorphic wrt pointer type?
[07:21:09] <bjz> isn't it basically a form of RC?
[07:21:19] <evincar> shared_ptr is atomically reference counted.
[07:21:34] <evincar> It also does an extra allocation for the reference count if you don't use make_shared.
[07:21:48] <bjz> I think so. Re polymorphic pointers
[07:22:09] <evincar> unique_ptr is almost zero overhead because it is exception-safe.
[07:22:35] <evincar> So no worse than writing exception-safe code using raw pointers.
[07:22:46] <evincar> And a lot better for your sanity.
[07:22:49] <bjz> ok cool
[07:23:18] <bjz> evincar: still doesn't offer as much of the safetey guarrentee as rust does
[07:23:23] <bjz> unfortunately
[07:23:37] <evincar> It can't.
[07:23:53] <bjz> yep, ofc
[07:24:22] <bjz> evincar: I guess all I'm saying is, people will be most interested in the overhead of your approach to memory management. that's why they're using C++ or C. I don't know how high that is on your agenda
[07:24:52] <evincar> Oh, fairly high.
[07:25:01] <bjz> evincar: for a game engine I don't want pauses
[07:25:08] <bjz> that leads to bad reviews
[07:25:13] <bjz> :)
[07:25:22] <evincar> Naive RC is about 30% slower than your average GC, 40% slower than a production-quality one.
[07:25:31] <evincar> You can close that gap entirely with a few simple optimisations though.
[07:25:59] <bjz> yeah?
[07:26:09] <evincar> Namely, use fewer bits for the refcount, optimise out RC updates, and make objects that are "born dead" (RC=0) which become alive only when they escape.
[07:26:38] <evincar> Also, to reduce pauses you can use an incremental collector, which can also run concurrently.

[07:42:20] <evincar> And with the recent death of Manfred von Thun, and Slava Pestov occupied with other things, there are no real leaders.
[07:42:49] <evincar> Oh...I could do it pretty quickly if I had more motivation.
[07:43:25] <evincar> Most of my time outside work is spent sleeping and recovering from interacting with the world.

[07:44:38] <evincar> The main things to be done are finishing the C backend, which is quite segfaulty, and adding a way to do FFI declarations.

[07:45:39] <evincar> :(
[07:46:09] <evincar> Kitten solves that. ;)
[07:47:39] <evincar> Of course, Rust has managed closures too.

[07:55:22] <SiegeLord> Can't return them from functions though, but that's a lifetime error

[20:41:11] <bjz> might want to ask on the official channel
[20:42:00] <bjz> the fns/types in libc have exports, so you don't need to do the full name

[20:42:59] <bjz> its difficult - they don't show up well on the docs :(
