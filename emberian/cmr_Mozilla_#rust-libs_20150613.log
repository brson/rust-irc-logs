[03:10:02] <burntsushi> aturon: per your advice, i went to the rfcs repo to find one to shepherd, but they had all been assigned! i'm afraid my trigger finger was a bit too slow. i'd like to get some experience shephering though---is there one i could steal?

[22:09:12] <SimonSapin> Are hash values meaningful outside of one program execution? https://github.com/servo/rust-url/issues/117
[22:11:34] <bluss> our most famous use of them is for random-keyed hashing in hashmaps so I never thought of them as constant
[22:12:18] <SimonSapin> bluss: but is the randomness in the hashing itself, or is it "added" by the map?
[22:12:45] <bluss> the hash state is keyed explicitly by the map. The docs for std::hash::hash has a clue, it says
[22:12:52] <bluss> Hash a value with the default SipHasher algorithm (two initial keys of 0)
[22:12:58] <bluss> which means it always uses the same key
[22:13:18] <bluss> the algorithm uses a defined endianness for its data etc so that part should then be stable
[22:14:15] <bluss> I mean the person in the bug uses std::hash::hash which uses a constant zero key
[22:17:38] <bluss> SipHash should have no platform dependence but maybe some types' Hash impls have?
[22:33:39] *** Joins: ryanhiebert (ryanhiebert@moz-nsd5kl.ks.cox.net)
[22:57:37] <SimonSapin> I was only speculating, about platform dependence
[22:58:33] <WindowsBunny> SimonSapin: I'm pretty sure hashes were never intended to be meaningful outside of a single program execution
[23:00:36] <bluss> well they are made consistent using that function
[23:01:31] <bluss> what happened here was that some type changed what bytes it emits to the hash API, so any hashing function would behave the same -- the hash would change
[23:01:53] <SimonSapin> so, should changing hash values of a library type be considered a breaking change?
[23:03:48] <bluss> I don't know really, probably not a breaking change
[23:04:56] <WindowsBunny> SimonSapin: Only if the library stated its hash values were stable
