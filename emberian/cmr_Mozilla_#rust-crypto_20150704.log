[01:41:42] <Ilari> Does it include all the ciphersuites that never should have been there?
[01:56:56] <Ilari> Or the features nobody actually had done any security analysis on (and then proved to be completely insecure once somebody did)?
[02:02:42] <Ilari> Or stuff they were specifically warned about and turned out to be insecure just as predicted?
[02:03:09] <Ilari> Or "this is probably not exploitable" (famous last words).
[02:27:33] <kmc> lol
[02:27:38] <kmc> or the features that were deliberately added to make the protocol less secure
[02:28:09] <kmc> yes, X.500 is famous as the thing that LDAP is more "lightweight" than
[02:28:51] <Elaine> which is saying something, as LDAP is anything but L as far as I'm concerned
[02:29:04] <Elaine> X.500 is... tediusly large.

[02:34:56] <Ilari> Heck, MD5 was conclusively shown to be broken in 2004. Yet it was added to TLS 1.2 in 2008 (the earlier versions always paired it with SHA-1)?
[02:35:10] <Elaine> wat?

[02:53:43] <Elaine> Ah, already decided?
[02:54:02] <Elaine> I saw someone mentioned recently in #phc that there wasn't a decision but that it'd be announced as passwords15
[02:55:28] <bascule> there's basically a decision, yes

[03:41:42] <mcpherrin> bascule: sweet!
[03:41:53] <Elaine> One of my more time-consuming side projects has been implementing various crypto on an arduino and observing the leaks
[03:42:05] <mcpherrin> I should do .. what Elaine just said ;p
[03:42:16] <bascule> we are in the fortunate position of designing our own SoCs
[03:42:19] <Elaine> thinking of doing a RISC-V impl
[03:42:21] <Elaine> yeah
[03:42:57] <Elaine> How is square, as a work environment? ;)
[03:49:49] <Elaine> The FPGA on my parallella can fit a RISC-V core.
[03:54:14] <Elaine> should get that oscope up too, to measure power sidechannels.
[03:54:24] <Elaine> timing should be relatively easy with good crypto

[13:51:07] <Tiffany> I setup HPKP
[13:59:22] <Ilari> Tiffany: BTW, here is off top of my head some of the worst stuff from TLS (no surprises): http://codepad.org/VB8babST
[14:00:44] <Ilari> Tiffany: What does SSL labs think about it?
[14:00:59] <Tiffany> it doesn't give me any extra score, but it does test for it and show it at the bottom of the page
[14:01:32] <Tiffany> I have most of those things in my list, but they're not quite the same
[14:01:46] <Tiffany> were they really warned before it was revealed that CBC mode was completely borked in SSL 3.0?
[14:03:06] <Ilari> They were warned about the flaws in block mode in TLS (SSL 3.0 is even more broken here).
[14:03:30] <Ilari> AFAIK, that happened during 1.0 process (and yet even 1.2 has broken block mode).
[14:04:27] *** Quits: Tobba (Tobba@moz-o13d22.bredband.telia.com) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[14:04:33] <Tiffany> it was worked around somehow though, wasn't it?
[14:05:41] <Ilari> Well,  security fix extension for block mode was published in 2014.
[14:05:59] <Ilari> And then there are nonstandard workarounds.
[14:06:38] <Tiffany> does the workaround work for SSL 3.0? or is that different
[14:07:15] <Ilari> IIRC, there is workaround for SSL 3.0, but nobody implements it and they just dropped SSL 3.0 (FF39 removes SSL 3.0 support).
[14:08:11] <Ilari> THS fix does not work for SSL 3.0.
[14:09:43] <Ilari> Some of the faults listed are still unfixed.

[17:41:06] <Tiffany> fun fact: atheme (and presumably all of its forks) will *always* fall back to plaintext password storage if no crypto algorithms can be found
[17:41:14] <Tiffany> and the way it's implemented means that you can login using password hashes
[17:41:20] <Tiffany> at least, I'm pretty sure
[17:42:08] <Tiffany> the supported hashing algorithms is pretty awful too
[17:42:22] <Ilari> Hmm... Let's see if Simon will propose anything for signatures... :-)
[17:42:31] <Tiffany> plaintext, unsalted MD5, unsalted SHA-1, PBKDF2, PBKDF2-v2
[17:43:34] <Tiffany> it checks every single hash provider when checking passwords
[17:43:41] <Tiffany> including the 'fallback' provider which is plaintext
[17:43:46] *** Joins: dcb (textual@moz-j72nfe.ca.comcast.net)
[17:43:54] <Tiffany> so you provide the hash of a password, and bam, it matches the fallback impl
[17:44:00] <Tiffany> it doesn't store the hashing algorithm alongside the password hash
[17:44:24] <Tiffany> or if it does, it ignores it
[17:44:28] <Tiffany> oh, it also supports crypt(3)
[17:44:39] <Tiffany> I don't know which one it chooses by defaut
[17:44:45] <Tiffany> it's whichever one is first in the list

[22:41:22] <Ilari> Also, let's see if Curve25519 in TLS draft is updated to include Curve448 before the submission cutoff (the comment period ends one day before the cutoff...)
[22:59:19] <Ilari> Hmm... Wonder if the third known online signature construct (forking) can be made secure or not.
[23:02:18] <Ilari> That is, r = H(m||joiner||seed), h = H(m||joiner||rB), where joiner might depend on m.
[23:06:49] <Ilari> With carefully chosen joiner and suitable hash, that would amount to compression function invocation.
