[20:05:36] <lkuper> interesting -- I'm looking at std::tuple.  it provides tuples of length 1, 2, etc.  most of the code is macro-generated.  I'm not sure what the best way is to go about adding docs in that case.  can docs be macro-generate too?!

[20:17:14] <jensnockert> Urgh, now I did a make clean and it is still failing /o\
[20:17:39] <jakub> So SmallIntMap has a method called get() which is just find().unwrap(). I was going to move it as a default method on the Map trait but then I recalled the current convention is to have methods return an Option and make users use unwrap() explicitly.
[20:17:59] <jakub> I understand this is a doc sprint but seems like a good opportunity to do a bit of an API cleanup as well
[20:18:17] <jakub> Is it OK to just remove SIM::get(), then?

[20:33:12] <lkuper> From the comments on #4361, descriptive style ("Converts a byte to a string.") seems more popular than imperative style ("Convert a byte to a string.").  So I'll go with that.  But it would be nice to have an official decision.
[20:34:05] <olle> /// Returns the contained stream,/// Gets an immutable reference to the stream inside,/// Gets a mutable reference to the stream inside

[20:48:47] <olle> Noted.
[20:50:18] <olle> Right or wrong - should docs be divulging things like "/// Wrapping output stream, number of colors, and TermInfo."
[20:50:32] <olle> (All those fields are priv.)
[20:50:58] <jensnockert> Probably not.
[20:51:45] <olle> Should one even document pub struct Somethings?
[20:55:07] <mcpherrin> Probably
[20:55:52] <olle> I saw some small wordings, that are probably helpful, so I condensed to "/// Wraps stream"

[20:57:04] <jensnockert> Unless you have infinite memory!
[20:57:05] <olle> I wonder, is there a name for Rust types that do .flush and .write?
[20:57:32] <esummers> olle: Maybe those should remain under `#[doc(hidden)]`.  Sometimes it is nice to output private docs when working on an implementation.
[20:58:09] <olle> esummers: I'll put in #[doc(hidden)] then - it was not there.

[21:01:00] <lkuper> In std::str::raw, strdup_uniq has its own lang_item.  It looks like this: https://gist.github.com/lkuper/9589829
[21:01:16] <lkuper> Should there actually be a docstring for it or should it be #[doc(hidden)]?
[21:01:57] <lkuper> And I'm not sure what to say other than "Create a Rust string from a *u8 buffer of the given length" 
[21:02:27] <brson> lkuper: lang items can be private now so I'd say just make it priv
[21:02:33] <lkuper> all it does is call from_buf_len.  is there a purpose of having a separate function that I don't get?
[21:03:11] <esummers> olle: lkuper: I think maybe not a good way to do it.
[21:03:50] <lkuper> esummers: hm?
[21:04:33] <esummers> lkuper: mixing.  I don't think you can put both hidden and non-hidden on a single item
[21:05:19] <lkuper> brson: ok, I can make it priv.  just wondering why it exists at all since it just calls from_buf_len
[21:11:12] <lkuper> esummers: I don't think you can do that, either...I'm not sure what you're talking about, though, I wasn't following your conversation with olle.
[21:12:18] <brson> lkuper: i don't think there's a particular reason
[21:14:19] <esummers> lkuper yeah, #[doc(hidden)] is all or nothing.  There was discussion of private fields in docs for a struct.  I was wondering if just those comments could be private.  I like generating private (internal) docs when figuring out how libraries work with other doc generators like doxygen.  Not really a big deal though.  Probably doesn't come up enough.
