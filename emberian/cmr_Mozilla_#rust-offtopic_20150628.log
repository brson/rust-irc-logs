[00:53:59] <Tiffany> okay
[00:54:23] <aatch> Tiffany, given that it's part of the reason you can't play as a female on Rust because.. well, you can imagine...

[00:55:30] <niconii> apparently there's plans to add female characters as of recently
[00:55:48] <aatch> Astrum|Lap, you start completely naked and anatomically correct.
[00:56:13] <niconii> the rationale for allowing only male characters was something like "naked dudes are just funnier"
[00:56:37] <Tiffany> I don't suppose they will let you choose the sex of your character
[00:57:09] <Astrum|Lap> anatomically correct? so... uncircumcised? =P

[00:58:05] <Astrum|Lap> weird asymmetry

[01:06:44] <aatch> This is mostly from experience on Halo.
[01:06:57] <Astrum|Lap> I ran servers where the general rule was not to directly attack other people
[01:08:57] <Astrum|Lap> or I should say verbally attack other people
[01:09:11] <aatch> Astrum|Lap, that's reasonable. I tended to just ignore the insults being thrown my way and just slaughter the other team.
[01:09:36] <aatch> If I'm a "faggot" for being better than you, bring on the gay sex!
[01:10:02] <Skyler> how do you explain the phenomenon of women pretending to be men? if the sexism isn't as bad as it's made out to be
[01:10:34] <Skyler> iirc something like 2/3 of women have concealed their sex while gaming online
[01:10:41] <Astrum|Lap> aatch: I've definitely grown a pretty thick skin... I mean I used to frequent the TribalWar forums
[01:10:42] <aatch> Skyler, probably because it does feel like being picked on for a specific trait.
[01:11:00] <Astrum|Lap> that place can be unimaginably vitriolic
[01:11:27] <Skyler> aatch: what's the difference between it feeling like that and that actually being the case?
[01:11:44] <c74d> The package manager for Arch Linux is still `pacman`, right? Or did they change their package manager recently too?
[01:11:50] <Tiffany> it's still pacman
[01:11:55] <aatch> Skyler, I'm ginger, and I was bullied when I was younger. Looking back, the fact that they used my hair colour as ammunition was irrelevant, but at the time it felt like I was picked on for *being* ginger.
[01:11:56] <Astrum|Lap> Skyler: I think women get more attention in games in general, both good, bad, and neutral
[01:12:04] <Tiffany> although if you want to install packages from the AUR you might want to install aura
[01:12:19] <c74d> Tiffany: thanks
[01:12:21] <zofrex> I've definitely seen cases where girls have been singled out for more abuse due to being girls
[01:12:28] <niconii> i think it's easy to say "i don't think it's as bad as it's made out to be, because i don't see it that much" if you're not the one affected by it constantly
[01:13:13] <niconii> it's natural that you're not seeing it as often; you're not the one it's happening to
[01:13:37] <Astrum|Lap> well... what is the solution?
[01:13:40] <Tiffany> I don't really know how bad it is honestly
[01:13:41] <Skyler> aatch: is it fair to say that had you not been red haired, you might not have been bullied?
[01:13:44] <Tiffany> I've never played battlefield online
[01:13:47] <Tiffany> or other games like it
[01:14:04] <Tiffany> when I do play games online, they're often in isolated corners where I don't see many randoms
[01:14:11] <Astrum|Lap> Skyler: I'm amazingly average and I was bullied
[01:14:14] <aatch> Skyler, I don't know for certain, but I was a weird kid, I was probably bullied because I didn't fit in.
[01:14:15] <Astrum|Lap> not red headed
[01:14:28] <Astrum|Lap> and yeah, I was weird
[01:14:36] <Astrum|Lap> (which oddly enough helped me out later...)
[01:14:57] <Tiffany> or games where it's easy to blend into a crowd
[01:15:03] <Skyler> the point remains: if 2/3 of women obscure their sex to avoid bullying, they are being bullied because they are women
[01:15:16] <Tiffany> not a 4v4 match where if you kill someone 3 times in a row by coincidence they notice and get very mad
[01:15:31] <Astrum|Lap> Skyler: define 'obscure their sex'

[01:16:22] <niconii> Astrum|Lap: you don't have to do much to "obscure your sex", people just assume male as the default
[01:16:27] <zofrex> I changed my nick to a female nick on another IRC network and immediately started getting more abuse than normal
[01:16:27] <Tiffany> I've never been good at coming up with usernames
[01:16:42] <Astrum|Lap> though I have seriously considered switching my pseudonym to Astraea, which is feminine
[01:16:48] <Tiffany> there are some places on irc where I just don't go because of that zofrex
[01:16:52] <niconii> Astrum|Lap: case in point: i've had to correct people about my gender a number of times even in here
[01:16:59] <Tiffany> most of the older networks are full of vitriol, like efnet
[01:17:05] <Tiffany> and some channels are nasty, like #archlinux on freenode
[01:17:52] <Tiffany> there were a few occasions when I was in a public channel, randoms would show up and immediately PM me and ask for sex, because I was the first female name in the user list
[01:17:55] <Astrum|Lap> Tiffany: a woman I know from playing CSS ended up borrowing my name on Steam because she didn't like hers, heh
[01:18:31] <Tiffany> I don't remember which channels exactly, but I think it happened on freenode
[01:18:37] <Astrum|Lap> niconii: it can be hard to identify gender and use the proper pronouns
[01:18:52] <Tiffany> I'm actually not sure which pronouns I should use with elaine
[01:18:57] <Tiffany> is elaine a girl name? I guess it is
[01:18:58] <Astrum|Lap> and yeah, the deafult is man, which is unfortunate
[01:19:14] <Skyler> "they" is the modern safe pronoun
[01:19:32] <niconii> Astrum|Lap: i'm fine with *gender-neutral* pronouns if someone doesn't know i'm a woman
[01:19:54] <niconii> Astrum|Lap: but usually i'm just assumed to be a man
[01:20:00] <Astrum|Lap> niconii: don't take this the wrong way, but I do slip up from time to time
[01:20:22] <Tiffany> oh I had no idea niconii
[01:20:24] <Tiffany> or maybe I forgot
[01:20:25] <aatch> I tend to randomly-assign genders, normally influenced by the username.
[01:20:28] <Astrum|Lap> and it can be a bit irritating if I'm attacked for it (I will generally apologize)
[01:20:56] <niconii> Astrum|Lap: slipping up is okay, as long as you're sorry about it it's fine
[01:21:05] <aatch> So I will sometimes assume someone is a woman just because I mentally picture them as such.
[01:21:08] <Astrum|Lap> I try to use gender neutral pronouns, though sometimes my brain just says, "*psst* use 'him'!"
[01:21:12] * zofrex is trying to convert to using "they", it's easy to slip up on occasion though
[01:21:22] <Skyler> I don't speak for all misgendered people, but as long as you're genuinely understanding, your apology will probably be accepted
[01:21:38] <Tiffany> I will usually avoid using pronouns at all unless I really have to do grammatical backflips to do so, and in which case I will fall back to they

[01:39:51] <Astraea> honestly I'm surprised we can communicate at all
[01:40:10] * c74d typically uses Wiktionary to look up International Phonetic Alphabet transcriptions of words
[01:40:16] <Astraea> there's the denotation of a word, the connotation that the speaker is giving the word, and the connotation the listener is receiving the word as
[01:40:32] <scott> I also use wiktionary for pronunciation all the time.
[01:40:45] <Astraea> actually... I guess the denotation can vary as well
[01:40:48] <scott> (When it has them, which isn't always.)
[01:42:07] <Astraea> for instance if I say "hey guys" to a group of people consisting of more than just men, I could be connoting just a general "hey people" not meaning to be gender specific
[01:42:23] <Astraea> but people in that group can believe the connotation is different
[01:42:28] <Astraea> we are strange creatures
[01:43:01] <niconii> "hey guys" is kind of a fuzzy area
[01:43:08] <Tiffany> Clearly every word needs to be wrapped in json to explain the connotations 
[01:43:23] <XMPPwocky> why not toml

[01:43:30] <Astraea> pfft, xml
[01:43:37] <niconii> i personally avoid it, but because so many people mean it in a gender-neutral way, it's not something i go after people for
[01:43:54] <Tiffany> same
[01:43:58] <scott> Yeah, you really have to choose your battles if you care about gender-neutral language.
[01:44:16] <brandonson> Tiffany: so, { "phrase" : "Hey guys!", "connotations" : { "guys" : "people", "Hey" : "Hi" }}?
[01:44:34] <Astraea> I think the base problem is that our language evolves organically, we don't sit down and design it with any specific goal in mind
[01:44:37] <Astraea> it just kind of... happens
[01:44:40] <Astraea> leads to a lot of weirdness
[01:44:43] <XMPPwocky> https://xkcd.com/191/
[01:44:47] <Tiffany> More complex than that, presumably 
[01:45:01] <XMPPwocky> Astraea: hey, there's no need to pick on C++
[01:45:11] <Astraea> lol
[01:45:15] <brandonson> haha
[01:45:16] <aatch> Well, if you go on the attack every time somebody says something you interpret as a problem, you'll end up working against your own cause.
[01:45:46] <niconii> { "phrase" : "Hey guys!", "connotations" : { "guys" : "people named Guy", "Hey" : "food for horses, also I never learned how to spell" }}
[01:46:03] <Tiffany> I tried learning lojban but lost interest
[01:46:38] <Astraea> I'd like to learn ithkuil but it scares me
[01:46:45] <scott> I've learned a bit of Esperanto and barely looked at Lojban. I don't think Esperanto wins much on being unambiguous or gender-neutral, though.
[01:47:11] <scott> Easy to learn (for English speakers, at least).
[01:47:20] <Tiffany> Defaulting to male is pretty bad
[01:48:18] <c74d> There's Ido, a fork of Esperanto (that I think had support from the Esperanto founder but failed to overtake it) that makes the language gender-neutral-by-default (among other things).
[01:49:20] <scott> Unfortunately, just like with programming languages, popularity inertia is more powerful than technical merit.
[01:49:48] <niconii> i dabbled a bit in lojban; learning a whole new language is a lot of time and effort though
[01:49:57] <c74d> More so than programming languages, I'd think?
[01:50:01] <niconii> and especially when it's one almost no one speaks...
[01:50:13] <Astraea> I was never good with natural languages
[01:50:24] <Astraea> programming languages make a lot more sense to me
[01:50:49] <scott> I find learning Esperanto made it easier for me to learn German and French and vice versa. All these European languages share so many roots.

[01:51:14] <scott> (Not that I know German or French particularly well.)
[01:51:27] <Astraea> I took a couple years of French in high school, oddly enough I dreamed in French last night... 
[01:51:33] <c74d> I'm just learning everything that comes out of beta on Duolingo, plus some others.
[01:51:57] <Tiffany> I should try learning a natural language
[01:52:00] <scott> I took French from grade 1 to 12 and came out with beginner knowledge of it.
[01:52:06] <Tiffany> So complicated though
[01:52:14] <scott> They really didn't push us very hard in those classes.
[01:52:38] <scott> On the upside we went to Germany and France on a class trip once.
[01:53:43] <c74d> (Currently, that's German, Swedish, Dutch, Danish, Spanish, Turkish, French, Italian, Portuguese, and theoretically Irish.)
[01:54:05] <scott> I noticed Esperanto was in beta on duolingo. I might try that out.
[01:54:42] <scott> I also want to start learning Arabic, Hebrew, Japanese, and Russian, and to restart French and German... someday... maybe...
[01:54:53] <Tiffany> I don't know which to pick 
[01:55:04] <scott> Especially the first four since they all use non-latin alphabets and would be really different to me.
[01:55:06] <Tiffany> German, maybe
[01:55:56] <Tiffany> I only know a handful of Germans 
[01:56:11] <c74d> I was also learning Standard Mandarin Chinese and Lojban, but I slacked off on those.
[01:57:00] <Astraea> I've always wanted to learn German
[01:57:02] <Tiffany> Japanese would be helpful for reading these websites I keep running into
[01:57:09] <aatch> Depending on what happens with my sister, I might put some effort into learning German.

[01:58:57] <c74d> You can't respond with "No"?
[01:59:02] <c74d> :p
[01:59:16] <Astraea> I mean respond in a meaningful way, I know how to say no, yes, one beer please
[01:59:18] <Astraea> the basics
[02:00:59] <aatch> Astraea, that'll get you pretty far, just need "where is the train station?" and you're set.
[02:01:46] <c74d> Maybe add asking for a lavatory too.
[02:03:32] <c74d> I think I've effectively given up on French though, and maybe Danish and Portuguese, out of not feeling up to pronouncing them.
[02:04:03] <Quxxy> c74d: In year 8, we were all forced to do 6 months of French and 6 months of Japanese
[02:04:06] <brandonson> c74d: My french knowledge basically extends to 'Je ne parle pas francais.'
[02:04:22] <Quxxy> At the end of my mandatory 6 months of French, I had the teacher compliment me on my excellent accent
[02:04:35] <c74d> (In the case of French and Portuguese, it's volitional production of nasal phonemes that particularly intimidates me.)
[02:04:38] <Quxxy> She said that she knew TAFE students who couldn't pronounce French as well, and asked where I got it from
[02:04:53] <niconii> c74d: i don't know much german anymore, but with my very limited vocabulary, i can put together "Wo muss ich scheiße?"
[02:05:00] <Quxxy> I had to admit I was just apeing John Cleese's Frenchman from Monty Python and the Holy Grail

[06:53:24] <eddyb> http://is.gd/bVEpUk
[06:53:28] <Tobba> it doesn't seem like a soundness violation but
[06:53:48] <Tobba> it's a bit weird
[06:53:48] <eddyb> OH
[06:53:54] <eddyb> Tobba: I know why this is fine
[06:54:15] <eddyb> Tobba: because it will only cause errors at the callsite if the default is actually picked
[06:54:29] <eddyb> that's nuts
[06:54:51] <eddyb> kinda like SFINAE
[06:55:16] <Tobba> I'll open an issue
[06:55:42] <woboats> that's bad though because the call site could be in a client crate
[06:56:00] <eddyb> Tobba: so there's an implicit obligation that if you use the default (which you cannot right now because there's no inference fallback yet. I guess you could if you had more than one type parameter)
[06:56:02] *** Joins: Lilly (Lilly@moz-pfkvo9.bredband.comhem.se)
[06:56:16] <eddyb> woboats: and that changes things... how?
[06:56:27] <eddyb> in that specific case there's no way to instante the function with the default
[06:56:46] <eddyb> *instantiate
[06:56:58] <woboats> eddyb, bad in the sense that it would be better for the lib not to compile than for someone who possibly can't fix it to get an error
[06:57:02] <Tobba> it seems like a massive backwards compat footgun
[06:57:17] <eddyb> woboats: sure they can fix it
[06:57:24] <eddyb> woboats: they can provide an explicit type
[06:57:51] <eddyb> woboats: and at this point there is no way to call that function and have it use the default

[06:59:29] <eddyb> :|
[06:59:46] <eddyb> didn't realize that was stable now
[07:00:13] <woboats> Well, I'm just saying that the best thing would be for there to be an error at the site of the type error rather than at the call site.
[07:01:26] <eddyb> woboats: yeah, but that's backwards incompatible
[07:01:46] <woboats> :-\
[07:01:47] <eddyb> and actually limiting in the future
[07:02:00] <Tobba> !gh 26633
[07:02:01] <rustbot> [Issue 26633] <open> Type parameter defaults are not checked correctly <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/26633>
[07:02:02] <eddyb> it's possible a breaking change will be made, but there's something tempting about it
[07:02:45] <woboats> how would it be limiting?
[07:04:01] <eddyb> because you can't say "have a default only if Self: Bar"
[07:04:31] <woboats> oh, that's interesting.
[07:04:50] <eddyb> it doesn't break bounds because it's not inside the function
[07:04:54] <eddyb> it's still part of the signature
[07:05:01] <woboats> syntactically that's very unclear though
[07:05:20] <eddyb> woboats: everything is clear as day if you've dealt with SFINAE :P
[07:05:58] <eddyb> so you could imagine fn foo<E = <Self as Bar>::A>(_: E) { } meaning fn foo<E = if Self: Bar {<Self as Bar>::A}>(_: E) { }
[07:06:10] <eddyb> though the latter is not valid syntax and might never be
[07:06:19] <woboats> right
[07:06:27] <woboats> It just reads more like a malformed expression than a conditional like that
[07:06:33] <woboats> to me at least
[07:06:48] <eddyb> well, not only SFINAE
[07:06:58] <eddyb> but also function argument defaults in languages which support them
[07:07:05] <eddyb> and which don't limit them to constants
[07:07:44] <eddyb> I *believe* function(a, b=(++a), c=(alert("foo"), b=0, 1)) {} is valid in ES6
[07:08:09] <eddyb> though those get evaluated inside the function and not in the caller
[07:08:15] <eddyb> in C++ defaults get evaluated in the caller
[07:09:02] <Tobba> hm
[07:09:05] <eddyb> so only omitting an argument with a default would evaluate the default which might fail - but otherwise it would be outright ignored
[07:09:10] <Tobba> I don't think type parameter defaults get used very often
[07:09:20] <Tobba> I'm running into another bug where it ignores the default :/
[07:09:32] <eddyb> Tobba: you're probably doing it wrong
[07:09:41] <eddyb> can I see?
[07:10:05] <Tobba> but convoluted, but in the gist I sent, fix the read_all to have "as Read" instead
[07:10:13] <Tobba> the default gets ignored *sometimes*
[07:10:17] <eddyb> Tobba: as I said, that method won't use the default
[07:10:21] <eddyb> there's no way to trigger that
[07:10:21] <Tobba> and yo uget a wacky typeck error
[07:10:47] <eddyb> if you have more than one type parameter and you specify all but the ones with defaults, then it would work
[07:11:06] <Tobba> huh, what
[07:11:19] <eddyb> there's a plan (and accepted RFC) to use defaults in inference
[07:11:24] <eddyb> which would probably work for you
[07:11:44] <Tobba> so the defaults don't actually get used? :/
[07:12:22] <Tobba> or rather, inference completely ignores them
[07:13:05] <eddyb> inference never used them
[07:13:23] <eddyb> well, I had a patch that did and maybe nmatsakis had it on some branch as well
[07:14:07] <eddyb> Tobba: we will be able to do FnvHashMap::new() whenever that is implemented
[07:14:16] <eddyb> (generic on H and bound by H: Default)
[07:14:22] <Tobba> :D
[07:14:27] <eddyb> Tobba: even move hashmap from std to libcollections
[07:14:43] <eddyb> UFCS ensured that was possible, inference defaults finishes the job
[07:15:13] <eddyb> Tobba: it's also a prereq for allocator support
[07:15:40] <eddyb> I don't think we'll get generic modules in Rust 1.*. at least not before HKT
[07:16:08] <eddyb> so we'll likely have to live with an allocator type parameter
[07:16:22] <Tobba> I think an allocator type parameter is fine if defaults actually start... working
[07:16:28] <Tobba> there are other weird things about them as well
[07:16:35] <eddyb> Tobba: best part? liballoc could re-export all of the collections and just add the default
[07:16:40] <eddyb> liballoc or even std itself
[07:16:49] <Tobba> if Box was Box<T, Allocator=SomeDefault>, Box<T> will error as it stands
[07:16:54] <eddyb> the collections could live in libcore
[07:17:06] <eddyb> or keep libcollections and make it depend only on libcore nad maybe libunicode
[07:17:15] <eddyb> Tobba: why?
[07:17:19] <eddyb> Tobba: that actually works
[07:17:20] <Tobba> I don't know
[07:17:23] <eddyb> see HashMap
[07:17:25] <Tobba> it didn't last time I tried it
[07:17:29] <Tobba> or maybe it's only broken on methods
[07:17:49] <eddyb> Box::new would be broken if the impl was on Box<T, A> and not Box<T>
[07:18:09] <eddyb> Tobba: anything where you are not required to supply type parameters is semi-broken
[07:18:18] <Tobba> playbot: fn foo<A, B=usize>(a: A, b: B) { } foo::<u32>(0, 0)
[07:18:19] -playbot- ()
[07:18:22] <Tobba> huh
[07:18:25] <eddyb> semi- because you still get the defaulting behavior if you have more than one type parameter
[07:18:26] <Tobba> looks like someone fixed it

[14:25:31] <kimundi> well damn
[14:28:07] <ogham> the o-rings were too cold

[14:29:48] <ogham> welp
[14:30:07] <WindowsBunny> And this was to the ISS
[14:30:22] <WindowsBunny> so now those atronauts are gonna have to wait for the _next_ rocket before they get more supplies
[14:30:38] <WindowsBunny> so um, who else currently supplies the ISS?
[14:31:27] <ogham> It makes me appreciate the fact that I can just fix a bug and recompile my program to run it again, rather than having to send things into space

[14:34:43] <WindowsBunny> the previous flight to the ISS also blew up midflight
[14:34:45] <WindowsBunny> Spacecraft control failed before reaching ISS; loss of mission
[14:34:51] <Tiffany> they do have simulations though
[14:35:12] <WindowsBunny> so... the ISS better have sufficient supplies stockpiled
[14:35:18] <ogham> yeah, even Rust compile times aren't that bad
[14:36:37] <WindowsBunny> Tiffany: Also the fact that bits can and do flip quite frequently due to radiation
[14:37:02] <WindowsBunny> and that even with fancy error correction memory, non-correctable errors still occur
[14:37:30] <Tiffany> the errors are usually detectable though
[14:37:55] <WindowsBunny> even still you have to write your code to detect detected memory errors and account for them

[17:31:40] <c74d> that was better than I expected
[17:32:07] <c74d> transcoding this AVI file to WebM took it from 1.7 GB to 17 MB
[17:34:09] <XMPPwocky> wat
[17:34:15] <c74d> seems to have fixed the audio choppy-ness, too
[17:34:29] <c74d> it still has graphical artifacts, thouh
[17:34:43] <Tiffany> where the hell did you get that  badly encoded of an AVI file, c74d?
[17:34:44] <zofrex> audio choppiness can happen in AVI files when the audio is VBR
[17:35:05] <zofrex> that's a possible reason why the audio got fixed when you converted it
[17:35:34] <c74d> Tiffany: someone who wanted me to put it on a website
[17:36:01] <Tiffany> did they record it using fraps or something?
[17:36:17] <c74d> according to libav, it was made with "Adobe Premiere Pro CC 2014"
[17:36:21] <XMPPwocky> maybe it was CBR accidentally instead of VBR with a high max bitrate?
[17:36:43] <zofrex> based on the compression gains it sounds like the source video was uncompressed
[17:36:56] <Tiffany> that's why I mentioned fraps, zofrex
[17:37:10] <zofrex> ahh
[17:37:18] <Tiffany> it does compress, but it's a really cheap compression mainly to get the video recording within the window of HDD write speeds
[17:37:35] <Tiffany> it's lossless too iirc
[17:37:53] <Tiffany> live H.264 pretty much requires you sacrifice a whole CPU core

[18:13:11] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: Nice!
[18:13:14] <Quxxy> I should have said: by "parsed" I mean "constructed the features map from the preprocessor directives"
[18:13:32] <Quxxy> Basically, it's the part that works out, for a given line of code, what conditional directives apply
[18:13:54] <Quxxy> Which is how it knows that, for example, STRICT in minwindef.h is only defined for WINAPI_PARTITION_APP
[18:14:15] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: Don't all platforms support that partition though?
[18:14:41] <Quxxy> If I remember correct, App is *almost* a clean subset of Desktop
[18:14:49] <Quxxy> But it's not just that

[18:27:58] <fkaa> why can't people agree on one standard
[18:28:35] <fkaa> metal uses c++11 for its shading language, come on
[18:31:03] <WindowsBunny> fkaa: spir-v is so great
[18:31:17] <WindowsBunny> why couldn't metal use that???
[18:31:28] <fkaa> apple™
[18:31:40] <Quxxy> Because metal predates spir-v?
[18:31:40] <fkaa> no, but hopefully they will support vulkan later on
[18:31:45] <fkaa> FINGERS CROSSED
[18:33:05] <fkaa> speaking of, been thinking of making a spir-v disassembler
[18:33:15] <fkaa> in rust!
[18:33:22] <Tobba> Metal kind of made sense for mobile devices but uh
[18:33:28] <Tobba> apple pushing it for desktops is just bad
[18:34:32] <Tiffany> apple is being gross with using metal over vulkan
[18:34:59] <Tobba> I think Vulkan is going to be released soon, so they could just have implemented a preliminary version, waited and then implemented the final version and have it all ready
[18:35:21] <Tiffany> apple is a khronos member, tobba
[18:35:25] <Tiffany> they have access to the draft spec
[18:35:26] <fkaa> they're not allowed to disclose anything though
[18:35:27] <Tobba> instead we now have 2 standards, and I'm sure they'll have sub-par Vulkan support
[18:35:32] <Tobba> Tiffany: exactly
[18:35:41] <fkaa> so it wouldn't make much sense to anounce it at wwdc
[18:35:42] <Tiffany> vulkan is coming out at the next SIGGRAPH, which isn't even that far away
[18:35:55] <Tiffany> it's in august
[18:36:04] <Tiffany> it's literally like 5 weeks away
[18:36:43] <Tobba> fkaa: well yeah they don't have to announce it at the WWDC
[18:36:58] <Tiffany> one isn't a standard tobba
[18:37:03] <Tobba> or they could say "we're planning to support Vulkan when it's finalized"
[18:37:05] <Tiffany> it's like directX all over again
[18:37:08] <Tiffany> except nobody is going to use it
[18:37:17] <Tiffany> because apple does not have a stranglehold on the market like microsoft does
[18:37:19] <kimundi> oh, vulkan relase in 5 weeks?
[18:37:41] <fkaa> doesn't help that they made it a obj-c api
[18:37:47] <Tiffany> kimundi: they haven't officially announced that it would be at SIGGRAPH, but previous GL releases have been at SIGGRAPH, and they said it would be "later this year" earlier this year
[18:37:58] <kimundi> heh, ok
[18:38:39] <kimundi> so, hypothetically speaking, how long might it possibly take from that point on for implementations to appear in my arch pacman repository? :P
[18:39:29] <fkaa> depends on vendor i assume?
[18:39:47] <fkaa> intel already has it working on linux from what i've heard
[18:40:08] <Tobba> is it going to be provided via Mesa somehow or will it be done separately?
[18:40:18] <fkaa> 0 clues
[18:40:27] <Tobba> I'd like to say "after a few years because nobody gives a shit about graphics on linux" but Intel actually do, damn
[18:40:53] <fkaa> hopefully others will follow suit
[18:41:10] <Tobba> remember when nvidia said they'd release open GPU specifications (and never did)?
[18:41:16] <fkaa> SteamOS being the main reason i'd say
[18:41:26] <Tiffany> tobba: they said they would again
[18:41:48] <fkaa> does mesa have an irc channel?
[18:41:50] <Tiffany> kimundi: nvidia will probably have day-one driver updates for it
[18:41:56] <Tiffany> they did with GL
[18:41:59] <fkaa> i quite dislike mailing lists
[18:42:09] <Tobba> Tiffany: now we might get documentation for the second best understood structure!
[18:42:14] <whipsch> its-happening.gif ??
[18:42:16] <Tiffany> I remember after the GL 4.5 announcement, the next day I was installing the nvidia driver that implements it
[18:42:55] <Tiffany> tobba: I know valve contracted lunarG to make an intel driver, but idk if that's an entirely new driver or what
[18:43:31] <Tobba> interesting
[18:43:42] <Tobba> I'm not quite sure why they'd do that, but nonetheless
[18:43:44] <Tiffany> it only supports ivybridge and later
[18:43:50] <Tiffany> which is a problem, since I'm stuck on sandybridge
[18:43:57] <Tobba> :/
[18:44:24] <fkaa> unrelated: does anyone actually use C11?
[18:44:46] <Tiffany> I wanted to once fkaa, but compilers had not yet fully supported it at the time
[18:44:50] <Tiffany> if the need arises, I will switch
[18:45:10] <Tiffany> I think I already compile all my code with it, so I might accidentally be using a C11 features without realising
[18:45:15] <fkaa> feels like C is mostly C99, whereas C++ is always talked about with the latest version
[18:45:30] <Tiffany> there's still a huge amount of code in C89
[18:45:38] <fkaa> will it be C++20 after 17?
[18:45:44] <Tiffany> probably
[18:45:48] <fkaa> 2.0!!
[18:45:51] <fkaa> almost
[18:45:53] <Tiffany> 11 -> 14 -> 17, the obvious continuation is 20
[18:46:20] <Tiffany> C++17 has a lot of exciting features
[18:46:37] <fkaa> smarter pointers?
[18:47:15] <fkaa> not even sure what c++14 brought other than better constexpr
[18:47:33] <huon> generic closures
[18:47:44] <Tiffany> C++14 wasn't a big update
[18:47:50] <XMPPwocky> how do generic closures even work
[18:48:02] <huon> XMPPwocky: higher ranked types
[18:48:02] <Tiffany> it did bring binary literals, digit separators, and make_unique though
[18:48:07] <Tiffany> which are all very convenient
[18:48:11] <huon> Rust can do it now too
[18:48:13] <XMPPwocky> huon: but what's the representation
[18:48:23] <Tiffany> https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=forums&srcid=MTc1NDc3NTUyODUyOTc0MTkyOTUBMTExNzY5NTk0OTYwMjgzMDc4NzYBcDJPYmgzMWVENjBKATAuMQEBdjI
[18:48:43] <huon> trait FnGeneric { fn call<Args...>(&self, args: ...); }
[18:48:51] <fkaa> i thought modules were a no-no
[18:49:02] <huon> (although we need a trait for each generic closure type)
[18:49:05] <fkaa> i even saw a hitler video about it
[18:49:23] <fkaa> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND-TuW0KIgg
[18:49:27] <eddyb> huon: not exactly, but yeah
[18:49:38] <huon> eddyb: what is not exactly?
[18:50:05] <eddyb> I bugged niko about having fn types (not the pointer types) generic unless explicit type parameters were passed

[18:50:12] <Tiffany> modules are a TS right now I think fkaa
[18:50:15] <Tiffany> they might make into C++17
[18:50:22] <huon> eddyb: we need higher ranked types for it to work
[18:50:36] <eddyb> huon: you know what's really cool? we actually don't :D
[18:50:50] <eddyb> in the sense that Default::default would implement FnOnce() -> T forall T
[18:50:54] <huon> eddyb: how do you write a function taking a closure that is generic over the second argument?
[18:51:14] <eddyb> it's just a simple type implementing an infinity of traits, which is allowed
[18:51:31] <eddyb> huon: well, that's a different feature
[18:51:34] <huon> e.g. pass fn foo<T>(x: u32, y: T) generically in to `fn bar(f: F) where F: ...`
[18:51:49] <huon> it's not a different feature :P
[18:52:56] <eddyb> you can have a value which implements Fn traits for an infinity of arguments or return types (actually, I'm not so sure about the return types now...)
[18:53:34] <eddyb> without being able to write a function which can take such a value without declaring up-front a finite set of traits which it will use the value with
[18:54:08] <huon> the former is kinda trivial :P
[18:54:13] <huon> the latter is far more interesting
[18:54:27] <eddyb> well, we could have the former but there were some screwups
[18:54:39] <eddyb> *could have had
[18:54:43] <eddyb> not sure how well they can be rectified now
[18:54:49] <huon> having concrete types makes things not-higher-ranked
[18:55:25] <eddyb> wouldn't it have to work with trait objects for it to be higher-ranked?
[18:55:53] <eddyb> nevermind
[18:56:15] <eddyb> F: for<'a> Fn(&'a T) *is* higher-ranked so presumably so is F: for<T> Fn(T)
[18:56:22] <huon> yeah, exactly
[18:57:10] <eddyb> I'm trying to compare its implementation complexity with HKT

[22:05:51] <RC9> :/
[22:06:11] <RC9> piston uses at least 3 different types of number
[22:06:14] <RC9> depending on where you are
[22:06:18] <RC9> and its painful
[22:09:37] <eddyb> RC9: ikr?
[22:09:52] <RC9> i thought the -size numbers were designed explicitly to cut down on this lol
[22:10:10] <RC9> probably has something to do with interop with the underlying libraries, if i had to guess
[22:10:14] <fkaa> who was working on a better obj-c thing?
[22:10:18] <RC9> and no one's gotten to cleaning up the api
[22:10:28] <eddyb> I cba to use anything other than this https://github.com/eddyb/r3/blob/master/src/ui/mod.rs#L56
[22:10:30] <RC9> i should put that on my list of "things to do if i ever get bored being on the consumer side"
[22:10:42] <eddyb> besides, x: Px, y: Px reads good
[22:10:55] <eddyb> RC9: oh, integers
[22:11:08] <eddyb> I'd use usize for anything memory-bounded, u32 in other places
[22:11:12] <RC9> its relatively stable using f64s for floats
[22:11:16] <eddyb> signed only if negative makes sense
[22:11:20] <RC9> but then it uses i32 on vectors
[22:11:32] <eddyb> piston uses f64 for interpolation stuff
[22:11:42] <RC9> and... u32 on the window size struct
[22:11:43] <eddyb> idk idc f32 #worksforme
[22:11:51] <RC9> and im sure i could dig around and find more
[22:11:51] <eddyb> RC9: i32 vectors of what?
[22:11:56] <RC9> just for vector math
[22:11:59] <eddyb> huh
[22:12:01] <RC9> in vecmath library
[22:12:14] <eddyb> you mean, aside from f32 and/or f64?
[22:12:15] <RC9> though i dont know if that has more than the bare vector definitions, i havent dug around in it just yet
[22:12:27] <RC9> oh i should go look if there are even float vectors...
[22:12:45] <RC9> ok yeah it does
[22:12:51] <RC9> wow im silly
[22:12:57] <RC9> its a vector2<t>
[22:13:07] <RC9> now to go look at my own code, because theres a reason im using i32
[22:13:21] <RC9> oh yes, i32 because some Image stuff uses that
[22:13:36] * RC9 rubs temples
[22:13:40] <RC9> okay back to actual coding lol
[22:13:54] <eddyb> image sizes should be u32
[22:14:09] <RC9> well, specifically, setting src_rects
[22:14:18] <eddyb> well... yeah
[22:14:21] <RC9> which uses SourceRectangle from types which is i32...
[22:14:34] <RC9> im assuming its a generic type that needs to be signed elsewhere in piston
[22:14:42] <eddyb> actually, why would that be signed
[22:14:50] <eddyb> unless it does some wrapping magic
[22:15:09] <eddyb> at the OpenGL level, just don't use integers
[22:15:24] <eddyb> when dealing with the image directly, u32 should work
