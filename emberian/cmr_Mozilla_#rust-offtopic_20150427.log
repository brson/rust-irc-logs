[02:11:16] <niconii> so a few days ago i talked about zzt, this old text-mode dos game with a level editor that let you make your own games and stuff
[02:12:24] <niconii> i kinda want to write a zzt clone
[02:13:08] <niconii> the issue though is... like, it's a very primitive game, don't get me wrong
[02:13:11] *** Joins: kimundi (kimundi@moz-7st4bq.dip0.t-ipconnect.de)
[02:13:51] <niconii> but that's exactly it, zzt was so primitive that the people who made games for it were always looking for ways to push against its limitations by exploiting obscure bugs
[02:14:21] <niconii> which means to make a true zzt clone, it's not enough to make a clone that works correctly
[02:14:41] <niconii> i have to make a clone that's broken in exactly the same ways that zzt is broken...
[02:15:55] *** kimundi is now known as zz_kimundi
[02:15:58] <niconii> luckily i have a decent test bed in the form of the zzt encyclopedia, which was basically a huge collection of those sorts of exploits
[02:16:10] <niconii> it'd be pretty challenging though
[02:18:57] <niconii> but it could be fun
[02:19:32] <c74d> You haven't mentioned this game here recently that I recall.
[02:20:14] <c74d> Ohh… you did, but as “ZZT”.
[02:21:11] <niconii> ah, yeah, i don't capitalize things consistently at all in irc
[02:21:28] <niconii> sometimes i capitalize acronyms, sometimes i just don't really bother...
[02:21:37] <c74d> Interresstinng… I didn't realize my memory was that case-sensitive. (Normally I'd easily be able to remember someone mentioning something earlier.) 
[02:22:37] *** zz_kimundi is now known as kimundi
[02:25:54] <niconii> it's kinda funny, i was watching this earlier: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaMHdsa7Bi8
[02:26:05] <niconii> it probably looks hilariously primitive to someone not familiar with zzt, but
[02:26:42] <niconii> having had grown up with this thing, and being accustomed to its limitations, like
[02:27:08] <niconii> i am legitimately blown away by music persisting from screen to screen
[02:27:50] <niconii> this is just something unheard of in zzt, and it's so silly that it even impresses me, but
[02:28:30] <niconii> like seriously, i want to know how the hell they managed it

[03:55:46] <niconii> why is this such a hard problem to solve
[03:59:07] <niconii> hell
[03:59:25] <niconii> why do we live a world where websites can *disable my right-click*
[03:59:42] <niconii> and *inject links into stuff i copy to my clipboard*
[04:00:16] <niconii> and *hijack my key-combinations*
[04:00:29] <c74d> Don't let the website run JavaScript?
[04:00:53] <niconii> yeah
[04:01:05] <niconii> but i'm surprised javascript's even allowed to do that shit
[04:02:20] <niconii> i'm also surprised i can't selectively allow or disallow what javascript can do
[04:02:52] <niconii> seems to be just "let javascript do whatever the fuck it wants, whenever the fuck it wants" or "remove javascript entirely"
[04:03:00] <c74d> Why? JavaScript is for Web-applications nowadays, and “desktop” applications are allowed and expected to handle right-clicks and key-commands.
[04:04:16] <niconii> there's a difference between handling right-clicks and disabling them entirely...
[04:04:42] <c74d> I expect it would be easy enough to write a Chrome extension/Firefox add-on that injects JavaScript that selectively deletes bits of the standard APIs (easier than blocking JavaScript entirely, at least).
[04:04:58] *** Joins: swgillespie (swgillespie@moz-rn1.vmq.232.104.IP)
[04:06:06] <c74d> Or maybe some/all browsers make the standard API objects read-only, I don't know.
[04:06:49] <c74d> niconii: What if you Shift-(right-click)?
[04:07:29] <c74d> That makes my Chrome instance ignore site-customized right-click behavior.
[04:08:08] <niconii> unfortunately i don't have a site to test that on
[04:08:20] <c74d> Google Drive is what I used.
[04:08:21] <niconii> i've encountered it before, but i don't remember exactly where
[04:08:46] <niconii> hmm, okay, yeah, that works
[04:09:00] <niconii> it's not obvious by any means, but it works
[04:10:25] <c74d> I doubt it's documented, but it's also in Xterm and whatever Ubuntu's default terminal emulator is (with s/JavaScript/the program running in the terminal/ ).
[04:11:06] <geofft> niconii: popups as in new (OS-level) windows, or things within the same tab occluding useful content? 
[04:11:18] <niconii> geofft: the former
[04:11:38] <niconii> geofft: from click-hijacking, seems like
[04:12:03] <geofft> huh, I feel like I get more false positives (pop-up blocker blocking actual things I want) than false negatives these days 
[04:12:10] <geofft> at least in Chrome, all platforms 
[04:15:34] <c74d> I'd like an option in Chrome (a flag, most likely) to make it open all new windows as new tabs. Only a handful of websites give me pop-ups, and I guess any unwanted ones get blocked because I only see wanted ones (or I just don't go to websites that would show unwanted ones), but the wanted ones are annoying because their windows are less than fully-functional, with nothing but the
[04:15:35] <c74d> address bar, the content, and the standard window decorations.
[04:18:19] <FreeFull> It is an option in Firefox
[04:19:11] <FreeFull> niconii: Firefox has an option to not let javascript disable right-clicking
[04:19:21] <c74d> Eh, it's not something I'd switch browsers for.
[04:20:30] <FreeFull> Firefox can have 300 tabs open at a time without its GUI squishing them into pixel-thin slivers

[04:44:10] <c74d> I once saw someone complain that Firefox's performance degraded when it went over 65535 open tabs.
[04:47:48] <niconii> oh geez
[04:47:59] <niconii> there's people who are bigger tab fiends than i am? that's surprising
[04:48:34] <niconii> i used to have around 100 tabs on a regular basis
[04:48:41] <niconii> sometimes up to 200
[04:54:19] <c74d> I tend to have 10..30 tabs open nowadays, but not too long ago my main computer had a small enough amount of RAM that I generally stayed under ten to avoid thrashing.
[04:55:04] <niconii> that's kinda why i've been cutting down on tabs recently, actually
[04:55:27] <niconii> my desktop's motherboard crapped out and now i'm on a fairly old laptop
[04:55:47] <FreeFull> Rigth now I have 78 tabs open
[04:56:09] <ChrisMorgan> I’m not aware of having gone over about 400.
[04:56:31] <niconii> like, a 2008 laptop, i think it is
[04:56:35] <FreeFull> The most I've had was somewhere over 600
[04:56:50] <FreeFull> On my old laptop with 768MB of RAM, 450~
[04:56:54] <c74d> Goodness, why.
[04:56:59] <ChrisMorgan> Wow, only 68 at present.
[04:57:20] <FreeFull> I was very happy when Firefox 4 came out, with support for not loading all the tabs at startup
[04:57:35] <ChrisMorgan> Tree Style Tab <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tree-style-tab/> is a great extension to make it all more manageable, too.
[04:58:03] <c74d> oh wow someone else who angle-brackets URIs!
[04:58:26] <ChrisMorgan> c74d: I often, but not always, do.
[04:58:46] <ChrisMorgan> There’s an RFC somewhere that recommends angle brackets for such demarcation.
[04:58:58] <c74d> IETF RFC 3986, Appendix C.
[04:59:31] <FreeFull> I like having horizontal space
[04:59:42] <ChrisMorgan> I’ve found things are normally (but not always) a bit better about angle brackets than parentheses, so I tend to use them in IRC.
[04:59:46] <FreeFull> If I had a bigger monitor maybe I'd give tree style tabs a go
[05:00:13] <ChrisMorgan> FreeFull: if you feel your horizontal space too valuable, never try using Tree Style Tab, because you’ll probably never be willing to go back to horizontal tabs.
[05:00:22] <ChrisMorgan> It is just *so* much better.
[05:01:21] <FreeFull> I mean, I only have 1366 pixels horizontally
[05:01:42] * ChrisMorgan has 1920 here on his laptop
[05:01:54] <c74d> Why have so many tabs open? How does one *use* six hundred websites simultaneously, unless almost all are there as bookmarks or to be read later?
[05:02:11] <c74d> s/websites/Web-pages/
[05:02:24] <FreeFull> That's how I use tabs. I often open up something for later
[05:02:45] <FreeFull> 450 was back when I was reading tvtropes
[05:03:06] <FreeFull> Tree-style tabs would probably be perfect for exploring tvtropes or wikipedia
[05:03:54] <c74d> Why tabs for that, though? I tend to save the URIs of “read later” pages in text files, and there are browser extensions for storing them in browser databases instead. Less volatile than tabs, at least.
[05:05:58] <taryn> FreeFull: me too
[05:06:22] <c74d> I'll admit that Wikipedia and TV Tropes (and the c2.com wiki, and likely other wikis…) have resulted in me doing that with tabs, but I never let them accumulate that much.
[05:06:23] <FreeFull> Tabs aren't volatile, though
[05:06:49] <FreeFull> Truth is, I'll look at a tab for a bit, and then forget about it, and then open more
[05:12:20] <WindowsBunny> I dislike seeing tabs open that I don't need
[05:12:28] <WindowsBunny> so I'll often clear out tabs all the time
[05:13:23] <c74d> Tabs may not be volatile nowadays in that browsers will re-open them on restart (which I use), but I've lost them often enough anyway to not want to rely on that — e.g., my main computer becomes inoperable, I switch to a secondary computer, and the secondary computer doesn't have the login credentials to sync tabs (and worse, bookmarks, history, other login credentials…) from my
[05:13:25] <c74d> previous session.
[05:14:41] <FreeFull> I don't even have a secondary computer

[16:37:16] <lahwran> well. sort of. I think its documentation isn't.
[16:37:34] <lahwran> the language itself doesn't seem remarkably less noob-friendly than C
[16:37:49] <lahwran> seems like a good first language, if you're motivated and won't stop when it gets difficult
[16:37:53] <lahwran> which is the same thing I'd say about C
[16:38:16] <Lurkin> There just doesn't seem to be enough documentation for somebody who hasn't written code before.
[16:38:29] <lahwran> yeah, the documentation isn't trying to be for new programmers yet

[16:43:06] <lahwran> :)
[16:43:07] <Hannibal_Smith> Lurkin, I would start from http://wiki.osdev.org/Memory_management
[16:43:11] <lahwran> whoa
[16:43:12] <lahwran> um
[16:43:20] <Hannibal_Smith> And then see about things like heap, stack...
[16:43:23] <lahwran> if Lurkin is a beginning programmer, that's probably going to be rather advanced
[16:43:35] <scott> wikipedia usually isn't great for first-time technical learning
[16:43:38] <lahwran> Lurkin: feel free to read that link, but just don't feel bad if you are confused by things there
[16:43:40] <lahwran> that isn't wikipedia
[16:43:46] <mrmonday> Lurkin: google stack and heap, there's lots of resources on the topic, eg http://stackoverflow.com/questions/79923/what-and-where-are-the-stack-and-heap
[16:43:46] <scott> oh
[16:43:56] <GaryOak_> I still don't understand Virtual Memory :(
[16:43:57] <scott> osdev is even worse, yeah :P
[16:44:17] <Lurkin> Oh paging, I get that.
[16:44:22] <Hannibal_Smith> Personally I found osdev articles usually well written
[16:44:23] <mrmonday> there's a Rust specific guide for the stack and heap, I don't know that it's in the official documentation yet though
[16:44:30] <Hannibal_Smith> (that is why I usually link that site)
[16:44:36] <Lurkin> Thank you all
[16:45:00] <scott> Lurkin: essentially, the stack is some memory set aside for the program to store function arguments and local variables. the really important thing about the stack vs. the heap is that allocating things on the stack is extremely fast and cheap
[16:45:29] <GaryOak_> Is stack technically in RAM, or in CPU cache?
[16:45:31] <mrmonday> GaryOak_: what don't you understand? there are plenty of people here who can help you figure it out, it's not too complicated
[16:45:36] <lahwran> GaryOak_: that's not a meaningful question
[16:45:41] <GaryOak_> ok haha
[16:45:45] <scott> CPU cache is transparent from this point of view
[16:45:51] *** Joins: sigma (sigma@moz-ohog4c.range86-135.btcentralplus.com)
[16:45:52] <GaryOak_> gotcha
[16:45:55] <lahwran> GaryOak_: cpu cache is not actually under a program's control
[16:46:05] <Hannibal_Smith> Lurkin, I passed to you that link because you have to first think in terms of visual memory, and then how that is segmentated (stack, heap, data, code..)
[16:46:07] <lahwran> cpu cache looks like just-part-of-ram, except mysteriously faster
[16:46:28] <lahwran> and what part of ram is in cpu cache changes any time you access ram, afaik
[16:46:51] <GaryOak_> mrmonday: I just remember a test I took on virtual memory addressing that most of the class failed
[16:46:53] <scott> it changes if you do a cache miss
[16:46:59] <mrmonday> ah
[16:47:06] <lahwran> scott: oh, right
[16:47:10] <lahwran> if you access *actual* ram
[16:47:18] <mrmonday> a lot of OS concepts are really straight forward, just really hard to explain well
[16:47:32] <mrmonday> virtual memory is no exception
[16:47:42] <GaryOak_> the devil is in the details, when it comes to OS
[16:47:48] <Hannibal_Smith> So Lurkin your heap is not "all the ram that your code can access" because in the same virtual memory space will live also other things
[16:49:03] <Lurkin> I see...there's a few layers of abstraction between what I was thinking and what actually is.
[16:49:10] <scott> most programs treat the heap as an infinite source of memory (up until the point they get OOM-killed by the kernel)
[16:49:13] <GaryOak_> Can memory pages be a sliding window, on what memory to return?
[16:49:44] <scott> page tables can be set up to do basically whatever you want with pages
[16:49:49] <scott> even non-contiguous mapping
[16:50:10] <scott> (depending on the CPU architecture, of course)
[16:50:12] <GaryOak_> so are virtual memory pages pulled from all over the actual memory space?
[16:50:21] <tiffany> c74d: you might be happy to hear that hexchat distributes downloads over https and they are now signed with gpg
[16:50:23] <GaryOak_> like the contents?
[16:50:37] <Lurkin> They're pulled from the disk I thought, depending on how long ago they were accessed
[16:50:46] <Lurkin> Dependent on OS
[16:50:58] <scott> Lurkin: yes, all modern desktop OSes do that
[16:51:48] <Lurkin> Too cool

[17:00:42] <GaryOak_> why would you need a boxed int?
[17:00:55] <GaryOak_> Isn't an Int fixed size?
[17:01:06] <mrmonday> generics in Java require T : Object
[17:01:12] <scott> Java generics can only store Objects, since they don't do monomorphization like Rust and C++
[17:01:21] <GaryOak_> Ohhh
[17:01:27] <mrmonday> so if you want a generic parameter which is an int, you have to box it

[17:02:58] <Lurkin> Why isn't ArrayList<Integer> the same as ArrayList<int>  what's the difference between Integer and int? Don't they both mean a number?
[17:03:31] <GaryOak_> Integer is a type, int is a number
[17:03:37] <scott> they are both types
[17:03:53] <scott> Integer is a subclass of Object, though, and int is not an Object at all
[17:04:09] <GaryOak_> Integer is an Object, int is an int
[17:04:18] <scott> Java's int vs. Integer would be like i32 vs. Box<i32> in Rust
[17:04:26] <scott> roughly speaking
[17:05:09] <niconii> (except there's no real purpose for Box<i32>, since generics in rust don't have the same restrictions as in java)

[17:09:39] <sillesta> Lurkin: Integer is basically like `class Integer extends Number { int value; }` and then the compiler does some magic so that `new Integer(5) + 5 == 10` is valid
[17:11:20] <Gankro> niconii: no purpose is an oversimplification. Trait objects and fixed location for raw ptrs are two simple usecases.
[17:11:44] <Gankro> In fact trait objects is literally the usecase in Java :P
[17:12:04] <Lurkin> Why do you have to tell the compiler that the first 5 is an integer but not the second 5 or the 10?  I'm really sorry, if you have another beginners doc to read through I would be really stoked to read it.
[17:12:17] <Gankro> Lurkin: Type inference
[17:12:38] <sillesta> (don't actually use `new Integer(5)` in java, it's bad!)

[17:23:01] <scott> it may be true in Java due to an optimization, but I'm not sure if that's standard-specified behaviour
[17:23:04] <GaryOak_> Don't you need to use .equal in Java for types?
[17:23:09] <scott> yes
[17:23:27] <GaryOak_> so that each type has to specify it's own equality
[17:24:51] <scott> Java was silly and put .equal on Object and made == do pointer comparisons, so equality is a big mess
[17:25:33] <sillesta> it gets more interesting when java does autoboxing for you: http://ideone.com/hPz4vk

[20:34:01] <scott> public class GenericList<T> where T : Employee
[20:34:09] <scott> you're right, syntactically quite similar
[20:34:54] <cmr> scott: the technique was invented by MLton I believe
[20:34:57] <scott> traits are a fairly different beast from classes with inheritance, though
[20:35:05] <scott> (Employee is a class in the above example)
[20:35:17] <cmr> in an actual type system, that is, template instanciation doesn't really count as anything
[20:36:16] <scott> monomorphization is just an implementation detail, really. but it's an important detail
[20:37:11] <zwarich> scott: it's not just an implementation detail, because it requires that you do not have an unbounded number of potential runtime types
[20:37:37] <zwarich> Haskell type classes allow that, for example, so you can't monomorphize Haskell type classes in a compliant manner
[20:38:15] <scott> yeah, I suppose it does limit your design
[20:38:28] <scott> it's also hard to see how higher-ranked types could work with monomorphization
[20:39:21] <scott> e.g. fn foo<F>(f: F) -> (i32, char) where F: for<T> Fn(T) -> T { (foo(42), foo('x')) }
[20:39:40] <scott> needs to instantiate F for two different types
[20:41:02] <reem> scott: it knows both Ts at compile time though, so that’s fine
[20:41:17] <reem> Box<for<T> Fn(T) -> T> is the problematic (and probably illegal) case
[20:41:29] <scott> hmm
[20:42:54] <scott> I'm still unsure how it would work, since I could pass any number of different functions to it with the same type
[20:44:45] <scott> e.g. fn id<T>(x: T) -> T { x }  fn id2<T>(x: T) -> T { println!("yo"); x }  let fn_ptr = if runtime_bool { id } else { id2 }; foo(fn_ptr)
[20:45:46] <scott> it needs to generate id<i32>, id<char>, id2<i32>, id2<char>. maybe this still isn't really problematic, but I'm not convinced it would always work out

[23:47:12] <taryn> heh, my friend manages to ICE gcc and clang often
[23:50:03] <tiffany> I've managed to get a few cosmic bit flips to cause reproducible clang+gcc crashes
[23:50:08] <tiffany> I think I reported like 1 bug in clang
[23:50:14] <tiffany> I don't know if anything ever came of it
[23:50:31] <tiffany> I've hit dozens of ICEs in rustc when I was actively writing rust
