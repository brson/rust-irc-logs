[02:08:07] <herrwolfe45> hi - i am trying to get rust 0.8 to build on darwin/10.8.6 and am having difficulty. After much of the build takes place it calls xcode and produces an error. Is there anything special that needs to be done on os x, like specifying where xcode tools can be found?
[02:10:28] <herrwolfe45> ignore my question - it is my inexperience with xcode

[16:09:04] <scythe-> So destructors are mentioned in the tutorial, but I don't get a whole lot of guidance on how to write one.
[16:09:14] <scythe-> Where is this documentation (assuming it exists)?
[16:09:24] <bjz> it's the Drop trait
[16:09:44] <bstrie> it's a good point though, is it actually mentioned in the docs anywhere?
[16:09:57] <bjz> struct A; impl Drop for A { fn drop(&mut self) {} } }
[16:10:49] <bjz> bstrie: yeah, must not have been put back in since dtors were removed
[16:11:07] <bstrie> since dtors were removed... fourteen months ago
[16:11:43] <bjz> hehe yup
[16:15:17] <scythe-> okay. and i've got an enum in a box that i want to match, like: let ~num = stuff; match(num) { ~Foo => stuff(), ~Bar => otherstuff}
[16:15:44] <scythe-> would i do it like this or is it match(*num) {Foo => stuff(), Bar => otherstuff()}
[16:16:56] <bstrie> I think you can do it like either
[16:17:06] <bstrie> not 100% sure though

[16:17:28] <bstrie> there's not really any idiomatic way for that case
[16:17:31] <bstrie> do whatever feels natural
[16:19:48] <scythe-> okay.
[16:20:13] <scythe-> if i may make a suggestion, the tutorial should show some examples of complete programs that use the idioms instead of just snippets
[16:20:21] <scythe-> or link to, rather
[16:21:19] <scythe-> i guess rosettacode is good for that sort of thing
[16:22:02] <scythe-> maybe i should read the spec ;3
[16:24:45] <bjz> scythe-: and of course, the spec is out of date :)
[16:25:15] <bjz> scythe-: and the idioms are still being discovered :)
[16:26:18] <bjz> scythe-: I believe the style guide suggests dereffing before matching, like match *num {

[16:41:17] <scythe-> or rather {End(int), Segment(int, ~BigNumber, int)}, sorry, forgot the syntax for a second
