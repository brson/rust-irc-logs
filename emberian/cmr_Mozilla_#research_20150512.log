[03:38:43] <roc> khuey: yay!!!
[03:45:49] <jdm> roc: is there a way to use a non-terminal debugger?
[03:45:53] <jdm> gud-gdb or something?
[03:47:54] <roc> I haven't tried, but "rr replay -s 9999" should start a replay and listen on port 9999 for gdb to attach. Then you should be able to attach any gdb front-end
[03:48:23] <roc> but note
[03:49:14] <roc> rr predefines some useful gdb macros: https://github.com/mozilla/rr/blob/master/src/GdbServer.cc#L64
[03:49:25] <roc> including overriding some gdb commands to work better with rr
[03:49:33] <jdm> interesting
[03:49:40] * jdm will give it a try
[03:50:03] <roc> in particular the target-async commands are essential if you want reverse-exec to work
[03:50:28] <jdm> presumably if I put all that in a script and load that it should have the same effect?
[03:50:30] <roc> in fact they may be essential if you want gdb to work at all
[03:50:32] <roc> yes
[03:50:52] <roc> I guess we should have an rr command to print that script
[04:00:21] <roc> OK, I just pushed to master a new rr command "rr gdbinit" to do that :-)
[04:00:22] <jdm> roc: huh, my gdb doesn't recognize target-async
[04:00:29] <jdm> :)
[04:00:45] <roc> did you try both "set target-async 0" and "maint set target-async 0"?
[04:01:25] <jdm> roc: the regular set works
[04:02:56] <jdm> and yet I still can't use run to restart the replay

[04:08:16] <jdm> is that a rr record rr record whatever you want?
[04:09:44] <roc> hmm?

[04:11:23] <jdm> that was my assumption, but perhaps I'm wrong?
[04:11:25] * jdm checks the output
[04:11:44] <roc> that would imply you compiled rr with -fstack-protector

[04:13:44] <roc> ok I'll try building with that

[04:13:46] <jdm> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Features
[04:18:33] * jdm is obviously missing something in the macro setup
[04:18:51] <jdm> I put that block into a file and ran `source gdb.macros` before `target remote :9999`
[04:19:04] <jdm> but I can't use commands like `run`, because `target remote` doesn't support them

[21:47:14] <aturon> which is definitely being done right now but in a somewhat more ad hoc way
