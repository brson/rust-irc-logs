[00:05:52] <cmr> Seldaek: rustdoc_web is way better than go's doc generator I think.
[00:05:59] <cmr> ...better than most doc generators I've seen tbh
[00:06:11] <cmr> On par feature-wise with doxygen for basic docs, while being a *lot* prettier
[00:09:20] <Seldaek> I think doxygen lacks readability as a feature, it's not just about prettiness :)
[00:11:34] <Seldaek> but anyways, I'm glad to hear.. hope I'll find time this weekend to fix some stuff, got to work on other stuff as well though
