[18:07:17] <edunham> acrichto, meet ericholscher, and vice versa
[18:07:42] <acrichto> ericholscher: hello!
[18:07:43] <edunham> ericholscher is one of the original authors of readthedocs and we're chatting about the parallels between it and what you've been talking about for crates.io docs
[18:07:51] <ericholscher> acrichto: hi :)
[18:07:52] * acrichto gasps
[18:08:12] <edunham> also he knows how to do cross-referencing between multiple projects like we were speculating about :)
[18:08:26] <acrichto> nice!
[18:08:38] <acrichto> right now our strategy is pretty terrible there
[18:08:38] <ericholscher> aye -- and we're looking at doing something similar with PyPI
[18:08:45] <acrichto> generating a gargantuan JS file which holds all the knowledge of the world
[18:09:30] <acrichto> rustdoc is also particularly bad in the areas of:
[18:09:34] <ericholscher> acrichto: yea, its hard to do if you want to do it globally without some kind of external lookup mechanism 
[18:09:39] <acrichto> 1) platform specific docs (e.g. windows vs unix docs)
[18:09:52] <acrichto> 2) multiple versions (e.g. viewing docs for 1.0.0 and 1.2.0 of a lib)
[18:10:07] <acrichto> ericholscher: yeah so right now rustdoc generates a totally static website
[18:10:15] <acrichto> but I have a feeling we'll eventually move away from that in the future
[18:10:43] <ericholscher> is this a goal for rustdoc itself, or for the hosted packages on Cargo?
[18:10:54] <ericholscher> i think a static site makes a lot of sense for a specific package
[18:11:11] <ericholscher> but you need something in back of it, ala RTD, to handle the management of versions/search/etc
[18:11:40] <acrichto> it's kinda nebulous currently
[18:11:49] <acrichto> I don't think we want rustdoc to diverge too much in terms of implementation
[18:11:57] <acrichto> but I agree the needs are quite different
[18:12:09] <acrichto> ah and we're also hamstrung a bit by our "let's only do markdown" mantra
[18:12:15] <acrichto> in that cross-links between modules and projects is hard
[18:14:34] <ericholscher> yea, i'm curious about the markdown thing
[18:14:42] <ericholscher> what kind of markdown? :)
[18:14:52] <acrichto> currently just hoedown
[18:15:06] <acrichto> but there's a rust written markdown parser we're considering switching to
[18:15:09] <acrichto> which implements the commonmark spec
[18:15:12] <ericholscher> goood
[18:15:23] <acrichto> I also think the only major extension we're using is tables
[18:15:25] <acrichto> (in hoedown)
[18:15:49] <ericholscher> I've been poking around the commonmark extension spec, and once that gets formalized, we'll be able to support a lot more interesting stuff in commonmark
[18:15:57] <ericholscher> but it's still a little ways off
[18:16:09] <ericholscher> and it will make markdown start to be as complex at rst, so people will probably hate it :)
[18:16:15] <acrichto> lol
[18:16:22] <acrichto> but at least it started simple!
[18:17:07] <ericholscher> I'd love to talk more, or get involved in helping with the rust doc stuff though -- We'd love to support it well on RTD if nothing else
[18:17:15] <acrichto> sure!
[18:17:21] <ericholscher> and let thing party folks use Sphinx/RTD if they want more power
[18:17:25] <ericholscher> third*
[18:17:49] <acrichto> if there's a "thing" that rustdoc should be doing to ease uploads or anything like that feel free to open an issue
[18:17:51] <acrichto> (against rust-lang/rust)
[18:17:59] <acrichto> and if you've got any questions feel free to ping me here any time :)
[18:18:02] <ericholscher> we've also added commonmark support to Sphinx -- but again the commonmark doesn't give you any of the fun stuff, because there is no extension markup
[18:19:04] <ericholscher> so things like :doc: and :rust:struct:`ref` wouldn't work 
[18:19:18] <ericholscher> which is sad
[18:19:45] <ericholscher> we might implement the commonmark spec current proposal, so that we can get some nicer referencing though -- we'll see
[18:20:22] * acrichto is excited
[18:20:29] <acrichto> I'd love to have easy cross-linking in Rust docs
[18:21:33] <ericholscher> totally
[18:22:10] <ericholscher> I'll poke around with rustdoc today, just to understand it more
[18:22:18] <ericholscher> is https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/documentation.html the best doc?
[18:22:40] <acrichto> ericholscher: yeah that probably is our best docs
[18:22:44] <edunham> also we should talk to aturon about potentially "outsourcing" this to a contractor once we've scoped the task
[18:22:48] <acrichto> although... I may not classify them as the best *possible* docs :)
[18:22:57] <edunham> (yay for the perpetual tradeoff between "done free" and "done now"
[18:22:58] <edunham> )
[18:23:01] <acrichto> who knows!
[18:23:13] <acrichto> if rustdoc gets 100x better I'm always happey :)
[18:23:35] <edunham> I don't yet know how the budget fits together regarding that kind of thing
[18:25:40] <ericholscher> hmm, where is the rustdoc source?
[18:25:44] <ericholscher> is it in the tree
[18:25:45] <ericholscher> ?
[18:26:01] <ericholscher> https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/src/librustdoc looks like
[18:26:29] <acrichto> ericholscher: yeah that's it
[18:26:31] <ericholscher> the main thing I'd be curious about is if there a JSON output for rustdoc instead of HTML
[18:26:46] <acrichto> there is, but I think it's currently broken
[18:26:51] <acrichto> e.g. it just panics rustdoc
[18:27:37] <ericholscher> haha, okay :)
[18:29:57] <ericholscher> rustdoc does look like a great tool though
[18:30:05] <ericholscher> love the doctest-type stuff
[18:30:13] <ericholscher> always wish that caught on more in the python world
[18:31:16] <acrichto> yeah that's one thing I've always been super happy about with rustdoc
[18:31:22] <acrichto> I only wish it integrated better with play.rust-lang.org
[18:31:27] <acrichto> b/c right now only the stdlib can make use of play
[18:31:34] <acrichto> crates.io crates aren't available on play so they can't be used :(
