[04:37:07] <WindowsBunny> Rust has a very centralized community
[04:37:43] <WindowsBunny> It's so centralized that it's really weird when you find someone who uses rust who isn't part of the community
[04:38:09] <Peach> Are any of you familiar with Jonathan Blow's attempt to make a programming language for gamedev? It's basically similar to rust
[04:38:14] <Elaine> Yes
[04:39:29] <Dabo> I think something designed explicitly for game development might be a tad bit less explicit with things than rust xD
[04:39:43] <Dabo> depends on who you're targeting I guess, but still
[04:40:21] <jpernst> yeah, being memory safe isn't a goal of his language
[04:40:33] <Peach> For those who haven't seen Jonathan Blow's language here's an overview - https://sites.google.com/site/jailanguageprimer/  a reddit page https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/2kxi89/jonathan_blow_a_programming_language_for_games/ 
[04:40:35] <Peach> and a LONG video  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH9VCN6UkyQ
[04:40:57] <Peach> Basically, for those that have heard of it,
[04:41:29] <Peach> I was wondering if you had any comments or ideas, because I'm essentially trying to make a game dev language myself
[04:41:35] <Peach> Rust is a huge inspiration
[04:43:10] <Elaine> Jai is primitive IMO.
[04:43:26] <Peach> Correct
[04:43:31] <jpernst> CTFE is a feature i hope rust gets
[04:43:35] <Elaine> (My perspective is that of a PL researcher)
[04:44:13] <jpernst> jai has some interesting features, but i disagree with him that memory safety isn't important for games
[04:44:27] <Elaine> Creating a language for gamedev is even worse than creating an engine, in terms of ever shipping a game :P
[04:44:32] <jpernst> a while back there was a remote code execution exploit for image sprays in tf2
[04:44:44] <jpernst> this kind of thing will only become more important as time goes on

[04:51:43] <jpernst> not surprising at all

[04:56:26] <XMPPwocky> but yeah, basically where i'm going is "being able to iterate fast is important, but being able to iterate fast *and not get all your users pwned* is extra important"
[04:56:38] <jpernst> yeah
[04:56:49] <Elaine> Iterating fast is not one of Rust's strengths IME
[04:56:51] <Peach> <Elaine> what goals do you have for your language?"  User friendly-er than a scripting language like Python/Javascript, yet has Zero Cost Abstractions and runs as fast as idiomatic C/C++; Fast compilation time, and a high level library that includes widely used math libraries and algorithm used in game and graphics development
[04:57:04] <Peach> And low level programming support
[04:57:08] <XMPPwocky> Elaine: yeah, this is not /specifically/ a rust article
[04:57:12] <Elaine> Peach: Good luck! Those are some tough constraints.
[04:57:23] <Elaine> XMPPwocky: sure, but given the context of #rust-gamedev, I think it's an important point!
[04:57:38] <XMPPwocky> hah, yeah
[04:57:40] <Elaine> Rust is lovely for getting solid, efficient code that won't get your users pwnt, but...
[04:57:46] <Elaine> it takes a while to make!
[04:58:00] <Peach> I'm already pretty far along surprisingly :D It's nice to design a language and again Rust is a major inspiration
[04:58:06] <XMPPwocky> that's true, but making small modifications is *usually* pretty ergonomic
[04:58:10] <Elaine> Yeah, definitely.
[04:58:20] <Elaine> But getting the right abstractions in place can be tough.
[04:58:20] <jpernst> for me the jury is still out if that's actually intrinsically a property of rust, or if it's just that rust is so different that it's harder to write in until we adapt
[04:58:23] <XMPPwocky> unless it turns out that it requires changing how you handle mutability entirely and you have to rewrite half the engine
[04:58:26] <XMPPwocky> :P
[04:58:30] *** Joins: genbattle (genbattle@moz-4v0.gkd.16.182.IP)
[04:58:43] <Elaine> jpernst: I've been doing rust for almost 3 years now and I'm pretty sure it's just an intrinsic property.
[04:58:51] <RC9> i would like to say
[04:58:52] <Elaine> It *does* get much easier, but the ramp-up cost is still there.
[04:59:01] <RC9> that your article applies more to multiplayer games xmppwocky :D
[04:59:21] <XMPPwocky> RC9: any game with multiplayer or, really, any form of UGC
[04:59:27] <RC9> yeah
[04:59:51] <RC9> but in the spirit of being pedantic the bit about " the worst that could happen from breaking memory safety is a crash" technically applies to local only games
[04:59:52] <RC9> lol
[05:00:26] <XMPPwocky> and if you have a single-player game in C, you're probably not going to rewrite it if you add in MP or UGC
[05:00:51] <Peach> What I never see explored is using a graphical IDE to assist in the design of a programming language; even in 2015 language still seem rather command line centric
[05:00:55] <RC9> thats very true
[05:01:03] <RC9> Peach, have you seen game maker
[05:01:13] <RC9> or unity :P
[05:01:32] <XMPPwocky> or smalltalk :P
[05:01:52] <XMPPwocky> well, squeak
[05:01:52] <Peach> Heh, yes I have; but their scopes are centered toward general purpose high performance multi media applications
[05:01:59] <Peach> *aren't
[05:02:04] <RC9> true
[05:02:18] <RC9> theres an article i kind of read that talked about that
[05:02:24] <RC9> but i dont remember where i read it D:
[05:02:32] *** Joins: zacstewart (zacstewart@moz-dt6.k3d.191.67.IP)
[05:08:37] <Peach> So basically I have a core idea - I browse tons of github projects of people making games, and I usually see that a LOT of projects consist of 80% setup code. By setup code I mean defining math libraries, vector classes, implementing widely understood physics algorithms, etc.
[05:09:55] <Peach> (Again I'm talking about natively compiled high performance game engines, mostly written in C/C++)
[05:10:20] <Peach> all of this "setup" code is basically redundant across projects and is sort of a barrier to entry, and there's many external libraries to facilitate setup,
[05:10:33] *** Quits: zacstewart (zacstewart@moz-dt6.k3d.191.67.IP) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[05:10:57] <XMPPwocky> https://xkcd.com/927/
[05:11:04] <Peach> but everyone wraps external libraries in slightly different ways, and in the end there's a lot of duplicated effort across projects
[05:12:56] <Peach> So if there were a language that provided a clean and organized system for commonly used functionality, it would make it easier to just code only interesting things that are actually unique to one's project
[05:13:49] <Kingsqueee> https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/
[05:13:49] <sp3d> that's generally the idea behind libraries
[05:13:49] *** Quits: bdero (bran@moz-0e2lk5.sns9.e6pb.0197.2601.IP) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[05:15:06] <jpernst> also, redundancy in itself isn't necessarily bad
[05:15:16] <Peach> well a vec3 class and dot and cross
[05:15:26] <sp3d> the problem is that lots of innocuous-looking decisions will break reusability
[05:15:28] <Kingsqueee> never underestimate the rewards of doing it yourself
[05:15:30] <jpernst> ultimately, abstractions are expressions of thought, and not everyone thinks in the same way
[05:15:33] <Elaine> Vec3 considered harmful (SIMD! SIMD! SIMD!)
[05:15:38] <Elaine> :P
[05:15:43] <jpernst> so having multiple differing implementations of something can actually be benefitial
[05:16:04] <Peach> vec3 class with dot and cross etc. is an example of something that gets remade without any change
[05:16:10] <sp3d> I would *love* explicit SIMD to go the way of the dodo
[05:16:23] <Elaine> sp3d: in favor of ISPC, for example?
[05:16:27] <Peach> it's a core concept that isn't really beneficial to have different implementations
[05:16:40] <sp3d> ISPC?
[05:16:44] <Elaine> https://ispc.github.io/
[05:17:18] <sp3d> I'd prefer to see languages provide powerful tools based on separation of computational semantics (what answers you get) from data layout
[05:17:23] <jpernst> but making another language for it is exactly a differing implementation
[05:17:27] <Elaine> I'm just curious what you'd like explicit SIMD to be replaced with
[05:17:43] <Peach> But yes, I know about Unity, Unreal, external libraries, game maker,
[05:17:51] <XMPPwocky> sp3d: isn't that johnathan blow's thing
[05:17:52] <Peach> it's really a different niche I'm talking about here
[05:17:55] <XMPPwocky> it seemed pretty neat
[05:18:08] <jpernst> i think D has an interesting approach to SIMD, at least in some ways
[05:18:15] <Peach> high performance, entirely open source, user friendly from the ground up
[05:18:16] <sp3d> I had heard a liiitle about SOA vs AOS in relation to that I think
[05:18:24] <sp3d> which is definitely a nearby topic
[05:18:30] <jpernst> it allows you to perform operations on an entire array at once, allowing the compiler to vectorize it
[05:18:40] <sp3d> but yeah, control over data layout is going to be necessary for a very very long time coming, so automating it entirely isn't feasible
[05:18:41] <Peach> designed to have a consistent inter design, and no royalties
[05:18:45] <Elaine> sp3d: I feel like that sort of separation would be... challenging to formulate in a useful way.
[05:18:46] <XMPPwocky> also i liked that paper about replacing general-purpose with special-purpose optimizing compilers- where you define optimizations as transformations on a syntax tree and explicitly invoke them. of course doing some optimizations might be... not so easy without, say, ssa
[05:18:47] <jpernst> you can do a[] + b[] and it will SIMD-add them together, etc
[05:18:54] <sp3d> Elaine: it does sound pretty hard
[05:19:25] *** Quits: SHC (quassel@moz-94r.faf.213.117.IP) (A TLS packet with unexpected length was received.)
[05:19:56] <sp3d> but where Rust makes you interleave data layout and specification of what operations to perform (by making indirection, representations, and boxing very explicit) you're basically forced to overspecify some stuff
[05:20:33] <sp3d> or else you lose the ability to reuse code and explicitly use SIMD in some places and regular variables in others
[05:20:44] <Elaine> Right, I can see why you'd want to use some modelling approach to it, and then a search in the model space for efficient programs, ideally composing well with the rest of the program...
[05:20:46] <sp3d> s/and/and you/
[05:20:50] <Peach> You guys aren't going be the type that tries to shut down new project ideas, right? A common trend of programmers is that they write off any form of new ideas
[05:20:53] <Elaine> But like, that's hard.
[05:20:59] <sp3d> definitely
[05:21:06] <Elaine> Peach: I'm not, at least :D I hope you continue.
[05:21:10] <Peach> :D
[05:21:11] <sp3d> I just think it's the next step forward after languages like Rust
[05:21:21] <Elaine> Peach: is your work so far available publically?
[05:21:22] <XMPPwocky> i think if you had programmers that wrote off new ideas they wouldn't be in a rust channel?
[05:21:37] <Kingsqueee> Peach: how is what you're suggesting different from something like cgmath or nalgebra?
[05:21:52] <Elaine> Kingsqueee: It'd be integrated well with the rest of the environment.
[05:21:54] <Peach> Not yet Elaine, but the language is already being used
[05:21:57] <sp3d> new ideas are important, but understanding prior work is maybe more important
[05:22:00] <Elaine> cgmath and nalgebra are pretty janky, let's be honest.
[05:22:07] <Peach> Oh sp3d I know
[05:22:12] <Kingsqueee> 'integrated well'
[05:22:13] <sp3d> :)
[05:22:14] <Kingsqueee> :I
[05:23:18] <Elaine> There's some early language from the depths of IBM that I can't remember the name of, but I have the whitepaper around here somewhere, where symbolic algebra was part of the type system
[05:23:21] <Peach> Actually, existing work is what allows these ideas to come up. There are design decisions that can only be feasible today because of the endeavors of others
[05:23:22] <Elaine> And it was *lovely* for doing mathematics.

[05:34:02] <Peach> Yes there's libraries and game engines and high level libraries, but does anyone ever consider that something as basic as build systems can be a hinderance to testing out code?
[05:34:03] <Elaine> Plenty of languages care a lot about user experience, within their constraints... in Rust it's touted as "ergonomics" and is a primary concern in most design discussions
[05:34:51] <Peach> Does rust have a standardized cross platform build system Elaine ?
[05:35:04] <Elaine> Yes, it's called cargo, and it's also the package manager.
[05:35:38] <Elaine> (Cargo's build system is primitive in comparison to most, but it works extremely well for Rust projects)
[05:36:24] <jpernst> i'd say cargo is incredibly userfriendly and low friction
[05:36:29] <jpernst> in contrast to something like, say, cmake
[05:36:35] <Elaine> yeah, by eons

[05:37:46] <tomaka> the build system is actually nice instead of being a huge spaghetti
[05:37:51] <Elaine> yeah, I agree.
[05:38:01] <Elaine> it's not primitive in a bad way...

[05:38:26] * Elaine goes to bed
[05:38:37] <jpernst> cargo strikes just the right 95% case that nearly all libraries can use
[05:38:50] <jpernst> there will always be a long tail of complexity where some projects just always need more
[05:40:21] <jpernst> for me, things like cmake try to chase that tail way too far and sacrifice the common case in doing so
[05:41:16] <tomaka> I wonder what the 5% are

[05:43:13] <SiegeLord> I suppose you could just use it without external dependencies, but why use cargo at all then?
[05:43:21] <jpernst> i'd count anything where cargo is invoked by some other meta-build system as part of the 5%
[05:43:32] <tomaka> jpernst: I think they use mach just to download the correct rust nightly

[06:24:37] <tomaka> hmmm, Rust's SipHasher is so slow that for small containers looking through each element of a Vec is probably faster than a HashMap
[06:25:34] <eddyb> tomaka: isn't the hasher stuff stable?
[06:25:40] <tomaka> no
[06:25:42] <eddyb> default type params were stabilized, so...
[06:25:48] <tomaka> things in std::hash is stable but not in std::collections
[06:25:59] <tomaka> are*
[06:26:05] <eddyb> then why the heck were default type params stabilized with a couple of issues left with them?
[06:26:17] <eddyb> I thought that was the whole point

[06:29:36] <tomaka> it's probably better to just copy-paste the whole implementation of HashMap from the stdlib and replace the hasher manually

[06:30:16] <eddyb> tomaka: have you tried HashMap::default()?
[06:30:37] <tomaka> eddyb: the last template parameter of HashMap requires to implement HasherState, which is an unstable trait
[06:31:05] <eddyb> is DefaultState unstable?
[06:31:07] <tomaka> `impl<K, V, S> Default for HashMap<K, V, S> where K: Eq + Hash, S: HashState + Default`

[06:31:23] <eddyb> https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/librustc/util/nodemap.rs#L21
[06:31:47] <tomaka> rustc uses whatever unstable thing it wants
[06:31:58] <eddyb> it's not implementing HashState
[06:31:58] <tomaka> DefaultState is unstable too

[09:08:01] <tomaka> wow, bindless textures require far more changes that I thought in glium
[09:08:24] <tomaka> buffers must be able to contain non-static data for example
[09:08:45] <tomaka> uniform buffers can contain samplers, which isn't handled right now
[09:09:07] <tomaka> and I'm stuck because of the lack of plugins in Rust
[09:09:45] <tomaka> I have the implement_vertex! and implement_uniform_block! macros that act like #[derive] and implement the Vertex and UniformBlock traits on types
[09:10:08] <tomaka> for example when you write implement_vertex!(Foo, ...);  it expands to `impl Vertex for Foo { ... }`
[09:10:28] <tomaka> but let's say that you have `struct Foo<'a>`, then the macro doesn't work
[09:10:44] <tomaka> I have no idea how to fix that except by creating another macro `implement_vertex_onelifetime!` for example
[09:11:03] <tomaka> `implement_vertex_twolifetimes!`, `implement_vertex_threelifetimes!` :s
[09:13:46] <Kingsqueee> ew
[09:14:03] <Kingsqueee> tomaka: at least you could hide them behind the implement_vertex macro, right?
[09:14:16] <tomaka> how?
[09:15:14] <Kingsqueee> maybe I'm not thinking it through right

[09:15:35] <Kingsqueee> but couldn't you do that with different parameter length matches for the macro?
[09:16:52] <Kingsqueee> like, have Foo<'a, 'b, 'c> be captured by something like $foo:ident<$($lifetime:ident)*> or something?
[09:17:02] <tomaka> hmm
[09:17:03] <Kingsqueee> plaster the lifetimes back in

[18:19:29] <tomaka> WindowsBunny: do you think it's worth changing khronos_api to use consts instead of statics in order to make glutin compile with MSVC?
[18:19:38] <tomaka> or is the bug likely to be fixed quickly?
[18:20:04] <Peach> It's related to game dev

[18:27:19] <cods> ok, that's explain thing :)
[18:27:32] <tomaka> jpernst: "The GLSL portion of this extension removes the restriction that sampler
[18:27:32] <tomaka>     variables must be uniforms in the default block.  You can store a large

[18:28:22] <cods> ok, that was just a experiment anyway
[18:28:38] <cods> an*
[18:28:41] <tomaka> the problem is that DepthTest::Overwrite always disables depth tests

[18:58:23] <tomaka> abhi: and distinguishing between position and color in your code is also less error-prone compared to putting everything in a [f32; 5]
[18:58:49] <RC9> magina if you want someone to hand you a working source, look at https://github.com/RCIX/rustlike
[18:58:52] <magina> the docs/examples cite different versions of crate and the super-modularity approach makes navigating documents incredibly arduous. How do you figure out how a certain struct is implemented for example? (I don't want to sift through 10+ different repos/doc pages for one simple signature)
[18:59:28] <RC9> well i kind of... do the last bit :P
[19:00:11] <RC9> and to be fair it's made me take breaks multiple times
[19:01:10] <magina> ah, RC9 ty for the link, im glad you use a render/update event queue instead of the draw_2d shown in some of the examples (seemingly using newer crate versions?)
[19:01:21] <RC9> yeah the examples can be a mess
[19:01:37] <RC9> you might need to download and drop libfreetype into your rust /bin to compile that
[19:01:44] <RC9> but it should be a fairly understandable structure
[19:01:57] <RC9> theres an older commit which is much more blank slate but you may want to learn from whati  have now
[19:02:21] <magina> this makes sense to me so that's good haha, dw :) 
[19:03:20] <RC9> i almost screwed myself out of coding for a while, i updated to a recent nightly and blindly uninstalled the old one
[19:03:24] <RC9> forgetting about the libfreetype thing
[19:03:43] <magina> can I ask in laymans though, how is the modularity decided? -- To provide a concrete example I was looking into how Texture was implemented (which I consider to be core engine functionality) however it seemed tied to piston_window, with strange hooks lying in the specific graphics implementation (opengl_graphics for ex) and so forth
[19:03:45] <RC9> was pulling my hair out trying to find the right download then i realized rust installer didn't ever actually remove that bit :P
[19:04:21] <magina> I felt really dumb, am I just missing some key architecture notes on piston or is figuring things out a slow search process? xD

[19:04:29] <RC9> however
[19:04:39] <RC9> no wait texture is the one you want, thats the actual image
[19:05:12] <RC9> and actually i think the class youll need is in opengl_graphics >.>
[19:05:42] <magina> well, there's texture in the context of decoding png's into memory, but also a texture in terms of a renderable object (both in different crates and documented differently in diff areas)
[19:05:50] <Elaine> magina: this is one of the reasons why I don't advise people to use piston... using glutin (or glfw or sdl2) directly with glium (or gfx or raw opengl) is eons nicer.

[19:07:40] <Elaine> They aren't engines, they're libraries
[19:07:55] <jpernst> glutin is more like, say glfw or sdl2
[19:07:57] <Elaine> There are no game engines in Rust right now -- piston isn't an engine either.
[19:08:25] <Elaine> *reusable/public game engines
[19:08:42] <zofrex> there's a small chance that I'm working on a basic 2D engine
[19:08:51] <magina> well, so long as it abstracts platform-specific window building and opengl access, I'm happy
[19:08:52] <zofrex> I'm not really sure what the hell I'm working on, or what it'll turn into

[19:09:39] <Elaine> eugh I need to work on joystick support
[19:09:43] <Elaine> I'll prioritize that this weekend
[19:09:52] <RC9> im mostly biased because i never understood glutin beyond getting the triangle rendering going :(
[19:10:01] <Elaine> glutin is only input/windowing
[19:10:05] <Elaine> are you thinking of glium?
[19:10:10] <RC9> ...probably
[19:10:15] <RC9> the naming, tomaka pls
[19:10:22] <Elaine> the naming is fine :P
[19:10:24] <fkaa> gliumutin
[19:10:27] <RC9> ^
[19:10:33] <jpernst> glutium
[19:11:04] <fkaa> might need to do some name changing when vulkan/metal arrives
[19:11:32] <fkaa> or split up the crate, which tomaka mentioned earlier i think
[19:13:50] <Elaine> depends on how the OSs implement it I guess
[19:14:02] <jpernst> yeah, it's all speculation until we actually get a vulkan spec
[19:15:14] <fkaa> vkutin?
[19:15:19] <fkaa> putin?
[19:16:55] <magina> whoa, glium is raw, thanks for the info guys :)
[19:17:32] <jpernst> oh cool, Arc has strong_count in nightly, that will be useful
[19:18:33] <fkaa> strong count?
[19:18:49] <Elaine> number of owning references
[19:18:55] <fkaa> oo
[19:18:55] <Elaine> (as opposed to weak (non-owning) references)
[19:19:10] <fkaa> gfx is using its own Arc because of that was missing before
[19:19:16] <jpernst> yeah
[19:19:24] <jpernst> i need it for the same reason gfx does
[19:19:32] <jpernst> i worked around it another way, but it's gross and i'd like to redo it

[19:38:26] <jpernst> had lots of problems in c# because it was impossible to control when say a Texture object was actually destroyed, you just had to remember to do it yourself, which i failed to do sometimes

[19:47:17] <abhi> tomaka: managed to fix that part (there was also a problem with the GLSL code)
[19:47:42] <abhi> tomaka: but now the problem is that a triangle is rendered instead of a rect
[19:48:18] <abhi> tomaka: could it be because of the TrianglesList primitive?
[19:48:50] <tomaka> Yeah
[19:49:08] <tomaka> if you use a TrianglesList, your vertices are grouped 3 by 3
[19:49:22] <tomaka> you should pass 3 vertices, or 6 vertices, or 9 vertices, etc.
[19:49:55] <tomaka> your C code is using an index buffer
[19:50:38] <tomaka> the  GLuint elements[] = {        0, 1, 2,        2, 3, 0    };
[19:51:09] <tomaka> `0, 1, 2` are the indices of the first triangle and `2, 3, 0` the indices of the secnod triangle
[19:51:21] <tomaka> the indices are the offsets in your list of vertices
[19:51:49] <tomaka> with glium, you do:  let index_buffer = glium::index::IndexBuffer::new(&display, glium::index::PrimitivesType::TrianglesList, &[0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 0]);
[19:52:05] <tomaka> and when you draw you pass `&index_buffer`

[20:12:28] <RC9> my tilemap class
[20:12:33] <RC9> is actually really good for rendering
[20:12:48] <RC9> so i think ill push it that way instead of trying to abuse it to store gameplay data
[20:13:43] <jpernst> bleh, hashmap doesn't have .retain, that's problematic
[20:14:37] <RC9> what does that do
[20:14:51] <Elaine> a by-value iterator that keeps the old allocation around
[20:14:54] <jpernst> keep or remove all elements in a collection based on a predicate
[20:15:48] <Elaine> that too
[20:16:09] <Elaine> oh I guess it doesn't yield the dropped items anymore
[20:16:23] <Elaine> did it ever?
[20:16:41] <jpernst> not that i recall, but who knows
[20:16:56] <Elaine> I thought there was a drain equivalent that did... oh well.
[20:21:47] <jpernst> i guess i'll just have to use a scratch vec and push all the to-remove keys onto it
[20:21:56] <jpernst> not thrilled with that, but can't think of any other way
