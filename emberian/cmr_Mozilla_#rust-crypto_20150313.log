[00:26:00] <Ilari> Lol at Michael's last post.
[00:27:30] <Dcoder> LTE is kind of a strawman, but yeah, it's an irrelevant "concern"
[00:31:10] <Ilari> Transmitting data is surprisingly expensive power-wise compared to computation.
[00:31:58] <bascule> hahahahahahaha
[00:32:00] <eternaleye> Eh, not so surprisingly IMO
[00:32:02] <bascule> that response is awesome
[00:32:27] <eternaleye> I mean, the inverse square law is a bitch

[00:33:22] <Dcoder> fig 1 says ethernet is on the nanojoule/bit scale
[00:35:28] <eternaleye> I really, really wish that all of the people with crazy custom quoting styles would take a knock on the head.
[00:35:45] <eternaleye> (Seriously, Paul Lambert? Seriously?)
[00:36:30] <Dcoder> it annoys me greatly when there's no space between quote and reply
[00:37:12] <eternaleye> Agreed
[00:37:13] <Ilari> And then there are replies where wrapped lines lack quotation marks, so colorizing what is quoted and what is not doesn't work.
[00:37:49] <Ilari> Shows up a lot in Watson's posts.
[00:38:12] <eternaleye> And then there are the people who put quotes 1.) immediately after reply without newline 2.) use custom quote characters and 3.) Preface their _own_ statements with [Name], as single long lines.
[00:38:19] <eternaleye> Those people I want to *stab*
[00:38:30] <eternaleye> er, replies immediately after quotess
[00:38:31] <bascule> I like when Dan Brown responds only with S/MIME
[00:38:41] <eternaleye> Eh, knode supports that just fine
[00:39:02] <eternaleye> It just marks it as being signed with Oxignature, and can't verify authenticity (yellow)
[00:39:44] <Ilari> Warning: This is a digitally signed message   :-P
[00:40:03] * bascule tries to find Mike Hamburg's Twitter, finds this instead: https://twitter.com/michelhamburg
[00:40:12] <bascule> wtf
[00:41:27] <Ilari> What on Earth?
[00:42:14] <eternaleye> yet another joke account tweeting what a landmark "would tweet", news at 11.
[00:42:35] <Dcoder> lol
[00:46:42] <bascule> I spend a lot of time telling people at work that if they think crypto is the bottleneck, they're not using the right crypto, heh
[00:46:52] <bascule> in actuality, it's usually not the bottleneck, just the scapegoat ;)

[00:49:22] <Dcoder> i don't think i've heard anyone actually complain about P-384's performance, even
[00:49:29] <Dcoder> (outside CFRG discussions)
[00:49:37] <Dcoder> and that one sucks hard
[00:49:43] <tiffany> I don't think I've ever had anything bottleneck on encryption or descryption
[00:49:58] <tiffany> it's always disk IO, or network bandwidth, or the application processing the data
[00:50:32] <tiffany> although, homeomorphic encryption is still prohibitively expensive
[00:51:26] <eternaleye> I really look forward to when HE/garbled circuits/etc are computationally reasonable
[00:51:32] <Ilari> Are there Post-Quantum encryption / key exchange / signatures that aren't prohibitively expensive on realistic security levels? I think there are...
[00:51:44] <eternaleye> Ilari: IIRC, NTRU isn't half-bad on that
[00:51:56] <Dcoder> there's that rlwe key exchange of recently
[00:52:03] <eternaleye> Ilari: If supersingular isogenies hadn't turned out weak, they'd also be very shiny
[00:52:15] <Dcoder> https://github.com/dstebila/rlwekex
[00:52:20] <eternaleye> Ilari: Especially since SIKE basically behaved like DH
[00:53:23] <eternaleye> Dcoder: >> The sampling code is configured by default to use OpenSSL's PRNG to generate a seed and expand it using AES.
[00:53:25] <eternaleye> AUGH
[00:53:41] <eternaleye> Why must people _keep_ writing new userspace RNGs :(
[00:53:56] <Dcoder> because there's no default system good one
[00:54:02] <eternaleye> Dcoder: /dev/urandom
[00:54:03] <Dcoder> (like arc4random)
[00:54:10] <eternaleye> Dcoder: getrandom()
[00:54:21] <Dcoder> depending on the amount of data you're sampling, urandom can get slow
[00:54:29] <Dcoder> for key generation that's not a problem, of course
[00:54:35] <eternaleye> Yes.
[00:54:54] <eternaleye> Which is why you generate a key, use a stream cipher, and have done with it if you need _buckets_ of randomness.
[00:55:12] <eternaleye> And for anything less than randomness-by-the-tonne, you just use the system.
[00:55:37] <Ilari> Usually if one needs buckets of randomness, the randomness either doesn't really need to be crypto-grade or one is doing someing bit questionable.
[00:55:48] *** Quits: gleb (gleb@moz-3u1drv.rusanovka-net.kiev.ua) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[00:55:52] <eternaleye> That too
[00:56:06] <eternaleye> But personally, I'd favor always generating strong randomness
[00:56:12] <eternaleye> ChaCha is pretty damn cheap
[00:56:23] <eternaleye> And it avoids the pitfall of using a weak RNG blindly
[00:56:44] <Dcoder> the amount of randomness in the sampling there seems non-negligible 
[00:56:46] <tiffany> eternaleye: garbled circuits? you mean that perfect obfuscation?
[00:57:00] <tiffany> those are scary since they can be used for DRM and other such measures
[00:57:02] <eternaleye> tiffany: No, garbled circuits are a bit different
[00:57:05] <tiffany> oh
[00:59:35] <Dcoder> lattice-based crypto's security seems so...intangible
[01:00:37] <tiffany> what are garbled circuits? there's no wikipedia page
[01:00:52] <cmr> eternaleye: how is using a stream cipher significantly different than any other user-space rng?
[01:01:26] <Dcoder> Windows's CryptGenRandom is a userspace rng, btw
[01:01:33] <Dcoder> regularly reseeded with kernel entropy
[01:01:33] <eternaleye> cmr: The issue with most userspace RNGs is that they try to be *the* source of randomness, rather than a performance optimization
[01:01:54] <eternaleye> cmr: Thus my objection is to it being the default, rather than using a stream cipher as a random input
[01:02:17] <cmr> ok, sure
[01:02:26] <eternaleye> cmr: The system RNG is a single place things can be fixed if broken; the further from it you get the more points of failure are available
[01:02:55] <eternaleye> cmr: Thus, a very thin performance optimization of one stream cipher is the best tradeoff IMO, and even then only when necessary
[01:03:10] <eternaleye> cmr: That also avoids all the complexity of reseeding, etc.
[01:06:57] <Ilari> Crypto operations that need entropy are usually at least moderately slow (or have better replacements available).
[01:07:46] <eternaleye> Yep, which is why the stream cipher should be an explicit perf optimization by the programmer, rather than being done in the toolkit or library.
[01:09:47] <Ilari> In category of "better replacements" theere are things like CBC encryption.
[01:09:48] <eternaleye> tiffany: A good intro to garbled circuits: http://www.math.ucla.edu/~tdokos/notes_files/garbledCircuits.pdf
[01:15:38] <Dcoder> "As outlined above, our implementation needs a large amount of random data (e.g. we need 24 KiB of
[01:15:41] <Dcoder> random data each time we sample a small ring element)."
[01:15:47] <Dcoder> from the RLWE kex paper
[01:16:12] <bascule> "large"
[01:16:16] <bascule> I guess relative to ECC ;)
[01:16:42] <Dcoder> imagine you're getting those random bytes with DUAL_EC
[01:17:03] <bascule> hahahaha
[01:17:11] <Ilari> Of course, one could take some entropy from system and expand it using CSPRNG and then discard the CSPRNG. No reseeding required.
[01:17:24] <eternaleye> <Dcoder> imagine you're getting those "random" bytes with DUAL_EC
[01:17:26] <eternaleye> FTFY
[01:19:14] <Ilari> Wonder what would happen with security if one used DUAL_EC (with non-NSA P and Q) to generate ECDSA "nonces"... Would the bias be big enough to leak your private key? :-P
[01:19:14] <bascule> they're totally random. the NSA said so
[01:19:25] <bascule> hahahahaha
[01:20:21] <Dcoder> hmm don't think so, but that's a fun challenge
[01:26:35] <Ilari> Some hash functions also have 1/e weakening (always or with some input lengths).
[01:27:02] <Dcoder> which ones?
[01:27:11] <Dcoder> those weird number-theoretic ones?
[01:28:26] <Ilari> E.g. Happens in SHA-256 for fixed-length 64-byte input (and in SHA-512 for 128-byte input).
[01:28:45] <Dcoder> ooh, e as in the constant
[01:29:54] <Ilari> The problem being that compression function is being invoked with constant data and chain input as large as output, so statistically there will be fair amount of outputs that can't happen.
[01:30:15] <Dcoder> right
[01:35:40] <Ilari> What's the entropy decrease from that? ~2/3 bit or so?
[01:37:05] <Dcoder> around half a bit or so
[01:45:25] <Ilari> Wasn't there proposed TLS extension to make exploiting DUAL_EC backdoor with TLS easier?

[16:42:46] <Ilari> Allegedly there are "PCI compliant" sites that have SSLv2(!), SSLv3, TLSv1.0, with RC4 and single(!) DES.  (Gets 'F' on SSL labs).
[16:44:46] <tiffany> maybe they were PCI compliant in 2005
[16:46:15] <Ilari> Audited by Arthur Andersen? :-P
[16:46:30] *** Joins: brson (brson@moz-cfhap5.mtv2.mozilla.com)
[16:52:41] <Ilari> I get the feeling that thigns are not going to improve unless browser vendors begin exterting pressure on sites (and they won't). :-/
[16:55:01] <tiffany> and this is why most alternatives to TLS don't have fallback mechanisms or cipher negotiation, isn't it
[16:55:19] <tiffany> it's complicated and you get stuck with old broken ciphers
[16:55:41] <Ilari> There's certain problems to lacking cipher negotiation. And fallback mechanisms are just a horrible idea.
[16:59:15] <Ilari> Could SSLv3 have been competently designed when it was designed, so one could get to something modern just by new ciphersuites and other extension points (no security fix extensions)?
[16:59:47] <bascule> Ilari: nope, the nature of the web is fuck it, ship it
[17:00:06] <bascule> :D
[17:00:15] <bascule> at least we got SSLv3 off
[17:00:20] <bascule> now if we can get GCM on and RC4 off
[17:00:22] <bascule> that'd be cool
[17:00:27] <bascule> and perhaps kill TLSv1 too?
[17:00:59] <bascule> how about those implicit IVs
[17:02:04] <Ilari> This was "could have been competently designed". Obviously it wasn't. The key exchange is screwed up. The cipher modes are screwed up (including stream), etc...
[17:02:25] <bascule> JavaScript could've been competently designed too but that didn't happen cuz they had a 1-week deadline
[17:03:16] <bascule> oh god
[17:03:19] <bascule> reading the unbearable list
[17:03:21] <bascule> what is this crap
[17:03:39] <Ilari> Aren't MS reps quite involved with that effort?
[17:04:41] <Ilari> Well, apparently also some Google staff.
[17:04:50] <bascule> I don't know, but if Microsoft is involved I'm sure it'll turn out great
[17:05:42] <Ilari> My view of the effort: Zero-risk bias wankery.
[17:06:12] <bascule> I'm just like... but... but Macaroons!
[17:07:37] <Ilari> Also, if you can get into position to steal cookies from site that doesn't do anything dumb, you can do much nastier things anyway.
[17:10:33] <Ilari> bascule: Macaroons don't address what I view as the real issues with cookies.
[17:14:05] <bascule> you mean cookie cookies or bearer credentials in general?
[17:14:19] <Ilari> Cookies.
[17:14:25] <bascule> because one of the intended use cases of Macaroons is with wacky and wild client-side JavaScript that doesn't use cookies
[17:14:43] <bascule> Macaroons can live in DOM/JS land entirely
[17:15:39] <bascule> you can attenuate them in JavaScript, then make calls with short-lived Macaroons that are scoped to particular things
[17:15:48] <Ilari> I don't suppose it is possible to have JS code that is protected from other origins?
[17:15:48] <bascule> and yes I agree cookies are terrible ;)
[17:16:02] <bascule> umm, you kinda can with CSP *shrug*
[17:18:53] <tiffany> oh what, macaroons are something other than a kind of food cookie?
[17:19:05] <bascule> yeah
[17:19:21] <bascule> they're a chained HMAC-based bearer credential with this fancy "third party caveat" system
[17:19:38] <bascule> that lets you have a sort of DAG of credentials that forms a proof of authority! :o
[17:21:50] <Ilari> bascule: Looked for CSP directives in MDN, and didn't saw anything that would come to even close to being able to protect JS from other origins.
[17:42:49] <bascule> what do you mean "protect from other origins"?
[17:43:01] <bascule> you can set default-src 'self'
[17:43:10] <bascule> that will only load subresources from the same origin
[17:43:41] <bascule> and it will also disable the use of inline scripts
[17:44:05] <bascule> you can go a bit farther and do something like
[17:44:16] <bascule> script-src https://javascript.myawesomesite.com
[17:44:32] <bascule> and that will *only* allow scripts from that domain
[18:10:53] <brson> what news about rust crypto this week?
[18:23:00] <Ilari> Any plans about doing rest of the overflow stuff? And how to sanely do zeroextend/truncate between two module-level wrapping types?
[18:23:33] <Ilari> And any plans about stable version of volatile_set_memory?
[18:27:35] <bascule> yes please stable volatile_set_memory
[18:32:40] <Ilari> I think set_memory is already stable (with some name I can't even find in the docs).
[18:35:05] <Ilari> Ah, apparently std::ptr::write_bytes (had look at source code to verify that).
[18:36:07] <Ilari> So presumably volatile_set_memory could be std::ptr::volatile_write_bytes (or something).
[18:38:02] <Ilari> Also, why I can't find docs for std::ptr::write_bytes?
[18:43:09] <Ilari> bascule: You have any bikeshedding for name? :-)
[18:43:41] <bascule> std::ptr::volatile_write_bytes seems fine to me?
[19:04:08] <Ilari> How many lines of code would that change be? 2?
[19:10:48] <Ilari> One being changing volatile_set_memory to stable and the second being re-exporting it into core::ptr (where it gets re-exported to std::ptr by module re-export).
[19:57:25] <Ilari> bascule: Actually, I think the name of the WG is Tokbind. The "unbearable" is the mailing list name.
[20:17:47] <Ilari> Oh, Tokbind posted draft agenda for Dallas.
