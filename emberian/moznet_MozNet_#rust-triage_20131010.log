[17:00:53] <acrichto> I am here but I am missing video/mic
[17:01:32] <tjc> I am here but don't have video, so I can't tell who else is here =P
[17:01:43] <tjc> my vidyo on this machine still has this cool feature where I see modern art instead of people's faces
[17:01:51] <acrichto> how useful!
[17:02:05] <tjc> yeah, it enriches my life
[17:03:32] <acrichto> nominated bugs first?
[17:03:50] *** Joins: brson (brson@moz-BBE3ABD.mv.mozilla.com)
[17:03:51] <tjc> acrichto: Yes, once we get started
[17:03:55] <tjc> so far it's just me, you and brson
[17:04:02] <acrichto> oh I should mention I can hear you guys
[17:05:17] <brson> #4769
[17:05:20] <acrichto> is that even still there?
[17:05:38] <brson> acrichto: nope
[17:05:53] <acrichto> this is still at least a little relevant I think
[17:06:02] <tjc> 4809
[17:06:06] <acrichto> this doesn't need to be a public api though
[17:06:41] <acrichto> de-milestoned is what I'd vote for
[17:07:14] <tjc> 4819
[17:07:23] <acrichto> 116 comments, oh dear
[17:07:53] <tjc> 4921
[17:08:18] <tjc> 4928
[17:08:29] <acrichto> these are used to define what's an identifier
[17:08:53] <acrichto> I think it's ok not as a priority
[17:09:41] <tjc> 4955
[17:09:42] <acrichto> still relevant
[17:09:44] <acrichto> but not a priority
[17:10:02] <acrichto> this has to do with impl<T: Foo> Trait for T 
[17:10:11] <tjc> acrichto: 4955, you mean?
[17:10:13] <acrichto> yeah
[17:10:32] <tjc> 4956
[17:10:45] <acrichto> hurrah!
[17:10:52] <tjc> 4987
[17:11:37] <tjc> 5003
[17:11:43] <acrichto> cc the path rewrite bug
[17:11:48] <acrichto> but otherwise not a priority I think
[17:12:00] <tjc> acrichto: which # is the path rewrite bug?
[17:12:16] <acrichto> tjc: I commented
[17:12:20] <tjc> acrichto: cool
[17:12:21] <tjc> 5019
[17:12:31] <tjc> 5033
[17:13:11] <tjc> 5038
[17:14:04] <tjc> 5219
[17:14:16] <acrichto> this looks scary

[17:15:04] <tjc> 5221
[17:15:52] <acrichto> I think that this would need '<for Trait>'
[17:16:00] <acrichto> otherwise I agree it's done
[17:16:17] <tjc> 5257
[17:17:05] <acrichto> brson: that's no longer the case though, some things were fixed
[17:17:50] <acrichto> brson: 8545 fixed this for tuples/strings/such
[17:18:26] <acrichto> I'm of the opinion that this is closed, there were some lingering concerns though
[17:20:20] <tjc> 5258
[17:20:32] <tjc> 5283
[17:21:36] <tjc> 5300
[17:21:53] <tjc> 5301

[17:22:55] <tjc> 5370
[17:24:15] <tjc> 5372
[17:24:29] <acrichto> seems like a priority for &mut self
[17:25:04] <acrichto> this is a core data type and is very backwards incompatible
[17:25:40] <tjc> 5389
[17:25:41] <acrichto> this can be de-milestone
[17:25:51] <acrichto> kballard's already taking care of it
[17:26:16] <tjc> 5429
[17:26:26] <tjc> 5568
[17:26:47] <acrichto> tjc: well these already exist on hashmap
[17:26:50] <acrichto> they're just not in the Map trait
[17:27:02] <tjc> 5590
[17:27:08] <tjc> acrichto: then it should be easy to fix :-)
[17:27:24] <acrichto> I think that 5590 is pretty much done
[17:27:34] <acrichto> there have been a few pulls to convert to using default methods where appropriate
[17:27:41] <tjc> acrichto: done enough to close?
[17:27:45] <acrichto> I feel like so
[17:27:47] <tjc> kk
[17:27:51] <acrichto> specific instances should get specific bugs open
[17:28:09] <tjc> 5768
[17:29:00] <tjc> 5830
[17:29:12] <acrichto> tjc: I think this should be a priority
[17:30:07] <tjc> 5860
[17:31:58] <tjc> 5898
[17:32:10] <acrichto> I would like this to be a priority
[17:32:15] <acrichto> but I'm not sure if it's fixable
[17:33:11] <nmatsakis> acrichto: I have plans to fix it...
[17:33:13] <tjc> 5905
[17:34:26] <tjc> 5983
[17:35:37] <tjc> 6006
[17:36:35] <tjc> 6023
[17:36:47] <acrichto> tjc: it's a priority to make a decision
[17:36:58] <acrichto> we probably shouldn't make a decision right now
[17:37:17] <tjc> 6169
[17:37:34] <tjc> 6399
[17:39:28] <tjc> 6850
[17:39:30] <acrichto> priority
[17:39:38] <tjc> 6875
[17:39:51] <tjc> 7087
[17:40:01] <acrichto> there's like 2 or 3 bugs on this
[17:40:08] <tjc> 7098
[17:40:48] <tjc> 7140
[17:41:05] <acrichto> this'll get folded in with Gc<T>, right?
[17:42:08] <acrichto> tjc: brson: https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/7803
[17:42:15] <tjc> 7225
[17:42:27] <tjc> acrichto: oh, cool
[17:42:47] <acrichto> tjc: I think this is a priority
[17:42:54] <acrichto> if even just gettin path right
[17:43:00] <tjc> 7556
[17:43:11] <acrichto> util::swap is nice
[17:43:14] <acrichto> and util::replace
[17:43:22] <acrichto> everyting else is dubious
[17:44:03] <acrichto> tjc: I would be a little sad
[17:44:10] <acrichto> swap/replace is all I want though
[17:44:45] <tjc> 7830
[17:44:52] <acrichto> obsolete
[17:44:59] <acrichto> we have composition now
[17:45:03] <acrichto> this was strcat's pull
[17:45:04] <acrichto> tjc: ^
[17:45:22] <tjc> 7836
[17:45:31] <acrichto> it's a soundness issue

[17:48:18] <acrichto> this is a soundness issue
[17:48:20] <acrichto> tjc: priority
[17:48:41] <acrichto> that's the bug
[17:48:47] <acrichto> statics can't use outer type parameters
[17:48:58] <tjc> 9208
[17:49:07] <acrichto> it's a priority to make a decision
[17:50:23] <tjc> 9309
[17:51:16] <acrichto> tjc: nominated bugs?
[17:51:33] <acrichto> milestones are probably more important
