[00:08:01] <bascule> Ilari: sure, whatever, still unbearable ;)
[00:09:52] <Ilari> They are now discussing the scope of keys (across applications on the same device).
[00:12:17] <Ilari> I think it is pretty clear that the keys should be assoicated with the cookie jar (because those keys are used for accessing entries in it).
[00:13:53] *** Joins: brson (brson@moz-vhk65h.tmodns.net)
[00:14:53] <Ilari> That is, if two apps don't share a cookie jar, then it is pointless to share the keys.

[00:17:38] <bascule> Macaroons
[00:17:41] <bascule> anything else is silly
[00:17:51] <bascule> and all those discussions make me want to beat my face against my desk repeatedly
[00:17:59] <bascule> how should we derp this
[00:18:00] <bascule> derp a derp
[00:18:07] <bascule> what's a principal?
[00:18:11] <bascule> who has keys?
[00:18:14] <bascule> keys here keys there
[00:18:17] <bascule> who knows what's going on
[00:18:25] <bascule> who are these people on this group and how much crack are they smoking
[00:20:40] <Ilari> How is binding macaroons to client-generated keys and verifying such binding handled (I presume that involves third-party caveats somehow)?
[00:24:34] <Ilari> That is, third-part caveat that requires access to private key that only the client posesses in order to discharge.
[00:48:39] *** Joins: adu (ajr@moz-0foa9t.md.comcast.net)
[00:56:21] <Ilari> At least you can perform key pop much more easily with macaroons if one has mechanism like tokbind (assert the key as simple first-party caveat, instead of messy construction as third-party caveat).
[00:59:17] <Ilari> My main complaints about tokbind work are that once one is modifying clients, what about making something that is actually possible to use properly?

[03:14:01] <bascule> Ilari: seems unbearable ;)
[03:16:59] <Ilari> Also, it prototypes are currently using ALPN... Which doesn't exactly seem scalable.
[03:19:48] <Ilari> ALPN is intended to negotiate protocols (oh, and it is MS design), not protocol options, through some seem to think that using it for protocol option negotiation is ok.
[03:23:28] <Ilari> I think first Google came up with NPN in order to put SPDY and HTTPS on the same port. It used TLS in odd way (for server offers, client selects (encrypted)). MS came up with ALPN, which was much more conventional (client offers, server selects in clear) and that won out because it didn't do anything "odd".

[16:59:35] <bascule> oh god that
[17:08:27] <Ilari> Extensible structure representation is surprisingly tricky. The problem is that extensibility tends to create nested lengths, which are quite infamous for causing bugs.
[17:28:06] <bascule> yeah
[17:28:29] <bascule> needs more regular or context free grammars ;)
[17:41:26] <Ilari> Or if one doesn't have nested lengths, one tends to get possiblity of type mismatches and such.

[18:34:24] <Ilari> Recdescent parseable with one symbol of lookahead is about the most that can be realistically used.
[18:38:59] <Ilari> And what one wants here is small implementation security gap, not so much simplicity.
[18:40:32] <Ilari> Because implementation security gap is made of boobytraps.
[18:44:37] <Ilari> I would rather have ECDH curve stuff done by next TLS meeting. :-/
[19:08:54] <Ilari> And to do that, there is only time for one poll and that has to come rather quickly...

[19:58:12] <Ilari> And yeah, decent replacement for TLS in common usecases would sure be nice (especially as one could jettison legacy crap).
[20:07:45] <Ilari> Of course, whatever serialization format should have schemas that are machine-parseable, so one can do code generation for parsers.

[23:24:06] <Ilari> I think whatever extensible structure representation needs to be able to represent structures like TLS ClientHello (but maybe not its exact binary form).
[23:35:10] *** Joins: cmn (cmn@moz-r1h.buc.47.78.IP)
[23:44:16] <Ilari> Figured out a way to do extensible tagged unions (TLS ClientHello has one of those) without error recovery...
[23:47:45] <eternaleye> Ilari: Out of curiosity, what's your idea?
[23:48:30] <Ilari> Wildcard matches and require-sized ignore type.
[23:49:11] <eternaleye> Mm, how does it handle data following the union when a new member has been added (which may have increased the union size)?
[23:49:15] <Ilari> Hah, sketching something up, and e.g. uint32 is considered unsized type.
[23:49:55] <Ilari> This is despite it being fixed size (4 octets).
