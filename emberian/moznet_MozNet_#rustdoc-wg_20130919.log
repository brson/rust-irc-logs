[01:29:54] <acrichto> cmr: rustdoc_ng doesn't strip the doc-comment style from comment blocks
[01:29:57] <acrichto> is there a reason why?
[01:30:04] <cmr> acrichto: Example?
[01:30:11] <acrichto> umm...
[01:30:17] <acrichto> like if you comment "/// foo"
[01:30:23] <acrichto> then the value of the "doc" attribute is "/// foo"
[01:30:25] <acrichto> not "foo"
[01:30:33] <cmr> Ah, single lines?
[01:30:42] <acrichto> nah everything
[01:30:44] <acrichto> /// a
[01:30:45] <acrichto> /// b
[01:30:46] <cmr> *everything*?
[01:30:49] <acrichto> shows up as that literal string
[01:30:50] <cmr> Are you running the strip-comments pass?
[01:30:53] <acrichto> I'm not seeing stripping anywhere
[01:30:58] <acrichto> maybe not
[01:32:46] <acrichto> cmr: it's running
[01:32:51] <acrichto>  clean_comment_body
[01:33:01] <acrichto> loooks to be the relevant function
[01:33:10] <cmr> Grr, I'll take a look at it in a sec
[01:33:31] <acrichto> wait I may be reading it wrong
[01:33:37] <acrichto> this looks like it's doing what I want
[01:34:19] <acrichto>  /*! foo \n bar */ definitely fails though
[01:34:26] <acrichto> it keeps the "/*!" lying around
[01:34:43] <cmr> Yeah, I don't doubt that one.
[01:35:03] <acrichto> so perhaps I'm reading it wrong
[01:36:39] <cmr> acrichto: I have a killer headache, so I'm going to run home, I'll fix the bugs I know about in ~15 minutes
[01:36:49] <acrichto> cmr: oh man
[01:36:50] <acrichto> rest 
[01:36:52] <acrichto> don't work lol
[01:36:59] <acrichto> cmr: get better :(
[01:37:18] <cmr> pft, what would I do if I don't work?
[01:47:56] <acrichto> cmr: omg wtf lol
[01:47:59] <acrichto> wait
[01:48:00] <acrichto> no
[01:48:05] <acrichto> disregard me
[01:58:58] <cmr> acrichto: what was it?
[02:01:38] <acrichto> cmr: it was totally my fault
[02:01:41] <acrichto> my various changes
[02:01:48] <cmr> ok
[02:01:52] <cmr> Good to hear!
[02:37:34] <acrichto> cmr: hm actually, I think that fold_crate is actually running over the entire crate twice, and it's coincidentally working today because the first pass takes "/// foo" to "/ foo" and the second pass brings it down to "foo"
[02:38:26] <cmr> acrichto: really?
[02:38:31] <acrichto> cmr: yeah
[02:38:36] <cmr> yikes D:
[02:38:53] <acrichto> https://github.com/mozilla/rust/blob/master/src/rustdoc_ng/fold.rs#L93
[02:38:59] <acrichto> line 97
[02:39:05] <acrichto> and line 103
[02:40:08] <cmr> Wait, nothing should be turning from /// foo  to / foo
[02:40:11] <cmr> it should be stripping it all
[02:40:37] <acrichto> cmr: it's only one line comments I think
[02:40:50] <cmr> Mmm, that I'd buy
[02:42:04] <cmr> Yeah, that does look likes it's running on the whole crate twice.
[02:42:06] <cmr> Whoops!
[02:42:23] <acrichto> it's super fast though
[02:42:29] <acrichto> pandoc is gonna slow it down a lot
[02:43:17] <cmr> Would it be possible to do the pandoc stuff in another task, firing those off as it goes, and then fixing up the doctree at the end?
[02:43:44] <acrichto> parallelism does need to happen
[02:43:51] <acrichto> I think just processing items in parallel should really help
[02:44:03] <cmr> well the actual rustdoc_ng part is quite fast
[02:44:09] <cmr> it's pumping it through rustc that's slow
[02:44:09] <acrichto> oh yeah
[02:44:14] <acrichto> yeah :(
[02:44:22] <cmr> it'd help if we stopped after typeck
[02:44:25] <cmr> I meant to send a patch for that
[02:44:43] <acrichto> what would really help is a C api to pandoc
[02:44:52] <acrichto> thousands of process spawns are not helping us
[02:48:36] <cmr> I can't imgine why :P
[02:52:29] <cmr> acrichto: do you want me to send PRs to your tmp repo?
[02:53:06] <acrichto> cmr: diffs are probably the best
[02:53:14] <cmr> from that repo?
[02:53:50] <cmr> (also, did you know you can get a diff or patch from any github PR? Just append .patch or .diff to the url)
[02:54:00] <acrichto> github's pretty cool sometimes :)
[02:54:03] <acrichto> doesn't really matter
[02:54:08] <acrichto> I'll probably be merging it all by hand
[02:54:31] <cmr> Oh feh, still out of diskspace
[02:54:40] <cmr> And my hard drive is complaining about the 300GiB copy
[02:54:45] <cmr> Guess I'm going to bed then
[02:54:57] <acrichto> lol
[04:44:11] <acrichto> oh man parallel rustdoc completes in half the time
[04:44:22] <acrichto> still 22s for all of libstd :(
[04:45:49] <acrichto> hot damn 50s => 22s with 1 vs 10 workers

[09:04:23] <Seldaek> acrichto: hey, saw you started porting the code.. not sure this is the best idea if I'm still working on changes we'll have to keep it up  in sync
[09:04:40] <Seldaek> but cool otherwise
[09:05:17] <dbaupp> Seldaek: it might be ok if he ports a fixed revision and then "ports" the diff of your changes later?
[09:06:18] <Seldaek> yeah it's not impossible
[09:06:27] <Seldaek> just not the most ideal way of doing it I guess
[09:06:51] <dbaupp> yeah
[09:07:03] <Seldaek> then again if it's gonna be ported soon it also means my motivation to address issues on the js version goes down  :p
[09:07:15] <dbaupp> haha :)
[09:07:40] <dbaupp> I believe he's trying to get a rust-rustdoc_web into 0.8
[09:08:59] <Seldaek> eh well, anyway.. gotta go back to dealing with timezones :(
[09:09:18] <dbaupp> timezones are so much fun
[09:09:29] <Seldaek> I'm in TZ hell between JS & PHP & mysql 
[09:09:55] <dbaupp> trying to get them all to think in the same TZ/convert sanely? :(
[09:10:17] <Seldaek> well, it sort of works, there is just one issue in the pipeline I think it's the JS lib but I'm not sure
[09:10:49] <Seldaek> I just create a date in the client, POST, reload the page and it's offset by 2hrs (CEST)
[09:11:03] <Seldaek> seems fine in the DB & API response though
[09:11:17] <Seldaek> anyway hopefully it'll make more sense this morning than it did yesterday
[09:12:32] * dbaupp has had far too many tz problems in js
[09:13:10] <Seldaek> yeah I'm using moment.js which does add a lot of sanity to the whole Date wreck in js
[09:13:21] <Seldaek> but still TZ fun is fun
[09:13:47] <Seldaek> that's one thing php actually does amazingly the whole date/time stuff
[09:39:54] <Seldaek> acrichto: when you get a sec, try to pull & run, I now do synchronous template rendering and filesystem writes, hopefully fixes your issue

[11:29:19] <dbaupp> Seldaek: well written libraries are nice <3
[11:32:00] <Seldaek> definitely
[11:32:09] <Seldaek> almost makes my job boring
[11:32:15] <Seldaek> just gluing stuff together :p
[11:33:44] <Seldaek> also building everything on UTC makes things a lot simpler

[13:52:03] <cmr> Seldaek: there's no way to close the search results?
[13:52:21] <Seldaek> no that's maybe a little problem right now:P
[13:52:37] <cmr> ok :p
[13:53:09] <Seldaek> well, F5 closes.
[13:53:18] <cmr> works for me
[13:53:44] <dbaupp> alt-f4/ctrl-w closes the search results too
[13:54:05] <dbaupp> as does pressing and holding the button with a circle with a line through one side
[13:54:20] <Seldaek> yes also you can close your eyes if you don't want to see them anymore
[13:54:33] <Seldaek> kids these days really, complaining about everything :p
[13:54:37] <dbaupp> sounds good
[15:10:34] <Seldaek> the other TZ issue is that acrichto is still sleeping :p
[16:05:48] <acrichto> Seldaek: cool, this is going to take a while so feel free to continue on the js version, I'll just have to catch up
[16:06:02] <acrichto> slight things are changing along the way as well, some intentional and some completely unintentional
[16:06:35] <acrichto> Seldaek: it does work now though!
[16:06:41] <acrichto> that appeared to be the problem
[16:09:43] <Seldaek> cool
[16:09:52] <Seldaek> that's a nasty thing out of the way
[16:10:15] <Seldaek> acrichto: I'll try to wrap it up tonight then and send a PR to rust if that still makes sense as an intermediate solution?
[16:10:28] <acrichto> totally
[16:10:31] <acrichto> sounds good to me
[20:18:17] <Seldaek> acrichto: any clue how pandoc is called by rustdoc?
[20:18:22] <Seldaek> it'd save me some digging :)
[20:19:03] <Seldaek> gonna try and integrate that quickly in the node version, then I can PR it
[20:19:05] <acrichto> no idea :(
[20:19:13] <acrichto> I'm using it in the rust version though
[20:19:17] <acrichto> just pass markdown over stdin
[20:19:22] <acrichto> and html comes out over stdout
[20:19:29] <Seldaek> ok
[20:19:29] <acrichto> with just executing the `pandoc` command
[20:19:37] <Seldaek> no args no nothing
[20:19:40] <acrichto> yeah
[20:19:47] <acrichto> how convenient :P
[20:20:19] <Seldaek> cool
[20:51:42] <Seldaek> acrichto: btw regarding spawning 20000 pandoc processes, I was thinking if done smartly we could bulk-process things in advance 
[20:52:07] <Seldaek> just concatenate a bunch of docstrings with a long random string as separator
[20:52:15] <Seldaek> run it all at once
[20:52:16] <Seldaek> then split
[20:52:31] <Seldaek> just random thoughts :p
[20:53:10] <acrichto> yeah that'd be nice
[20:53:13] <acrichto> not sure how we split it out
[20:53:20] <acrichto> Seldaek: how long does rustdoc.js take over libstd?
[20:55:40] <Seldaek> ~20sec for std+extra
[20:55:42] <Seldaek> but no pandoc yet
[20:58:55] <acrichto> interesting
[20:59:12] <acrichto> yeah pandoc slows things down by a lot
[20:59:20] <acrichto> I'm seeing 11s for libstd
[20:59:29] <acrichto> but I'm also not generating everything just yet
[20:59:33] <acrichto> working on traits right now...
[21:00:25] <acrichto> cmr: MethodItem vs TyMethodItem
[21:00:28] <acrichto> difference?
[21:06:23] <Seldaek> acrichto: regarding the split, I just means run through 100 elements for example, collect all their docblocks, join the vec on randstr, markdown it, split into a vec on <p>randstr</p>, re-loop over the 100 elements and replace their docblocks by the processed one
[21:07:41] <acrichto> yeah that would certainly speed up pandoc
[21:07:47] <acrichto> it'd be tough to orchestrate though
[21:07:58] <acrichto> don't worry about this for rustdoc.js
[21:08:37] <acrichto> predicate: &'r fnfn(&A) -> bool
[21:08:38] <acrichto> fnfn!
[21:09:47] <Seldaek> hah
[21:10:02] <Seldaek> no regarding pandoc I won't do it in the js version
[21:10:14] <Seldaek> was just saying because you may want to do it from the start might be easier
[21:10:25] <acrichto> it's tough though with ownership
[21:10:46] <Seldaek> hmm really?
[21:10:48] <acrichto> in theory it's possible
[21:10:55] <acrichto> at least in its current revision
[21:11:02] <acrichto> I parallelized everything which got a 5x speedup
[21:11:08] <Seldaek> you don't really have to take ownership I'd think
[21:11:09] <acrichto> which I think is good enough for now
[21:11:38] <Seldaek> so you have one read only Arc?
[21:11:59] <Seldaek> I'd think if you move a set of elements in each task it should work out well
[21:12:06] <Seldaek> but no idea how you did it I just skimmed over the code
[21:12:57] <acrichto> yeah you could have one task dedicated to rendering pandoc
[21:13:02] <acrichto> and it lumps together ~100 requests
[21:13:08] <acrichto> but how does it know when the last request comes in?
[21:13:30] <Seldaek> goddamn it node. running pandoc synchronously is gonna be hard:/
[21:14:07] <Seldaek> acrichto: I don't get your question
[21:14:20] <acrichto> Seldaek: it's fine if rustdoc_web doesn't initially use pandoc
[21:14:32] <acrichto> if you batch requests, then you process them all on the 100th one
[21:14:38] <acrichto> which means that if you only send 50, it blocks forever
[21:15:02] <Seldaek> ok then screw pandoc I guess, it'll save me some nerves (and sleep;) 
[21:15:23] <Seldaek> acrichto: oh I see. I meant more like, send it a batch of elements at once in a vec
[21:15:48] <acrichto> yeah but each child task only really knows about one at a time
[21:16:21] <Seldaek> might be best to create like 10 tasks, split everything in 10 (you have it all indexed already from the get go no?) 
[21:16:34] <Seldaek> then dispatch a 10th to each task and let them do their thing
[21:16:50] <acrichto> maybe
[21:16:54] <acrichto> I'm not *too* worried about this right now
[21:16:58] <acrichto> we really need C bindings anyway
[21:17:01] <acrichto> which will render this moot
[21:17:07] <Seldaek> it won't be as efficiently parallelized of course, but if it makes pandoc faster it might end up faster overall
[21:17:16] <Seldaek> fair enough;)
[21:18:09] <Seldaek> I just like to think up crazy solutions 
[21:18:15] <Seldaek> you don't have to listen to me :p
[21:19:32] <acrichto> lol
[21:19:37] <acrichto> man the awesome part about rust though
[21:19:41] <acrichto> is that if it compiles
[21:19:45] <acrichto> it's probably going to work :P
[21:20:00] <acrichto> my parallelization of rendering worked on the first compiler
[21:20:02] <acrichto> compile*
[21:20:04] <acrichto> which made me super happy
[21:22:49] <Seldaek> that is neat
[21:23:41] <Seldaek> I "grew up" as a dev writing mostly php so hacky-solutions-that-just-get-shit-done are in my blood :p
[21:24:01] <Seldaek> I do like the compile errors for a change though
[21:29:14] <Seldaek> acrichto: also I have to say, single-quotes for html attributes makes me cringe, but I understand that it's a lot easier with rust strings
[21:29:29] <acrichto> yeah :(
[21:29:35] <acrichto> I want that new string literal synta
[21:29:37] <acrichto> syntax*
[21:29:41] <Seldaek> heh yeah
[21:29:45] <Seldaek> it'd be very timely
[21:30:30] <acrichto> one might even say that it's a coincidence...
[21:33:54] <Seldaek> ah damn, creating anchors isn't as easy as it sounds given the current mess I made
[21:34:03] <Seldaek> maybe I'll leave it for the rust impl as well
[21:42:47] <Seldaek> cmr: got an example of an impl for a trait? 
[21:42:56] <Seldaek> acrichto: ^
[21:43:14] <acrichto> what do you mean?
[21:43:31] <Seldaek> looking for a trait that has an impl ... for TraitFoo 
[21:43:36] <Seldaek> just to verify some doc output
[21:43:41] <Seldaek> I think this exists?
[21:43:42] <acrichto> hashmap does lots fo that
[21:43:46] <Seldaek> thanks
[21:45:00] <Seldaek> acrichto: err, hashmap is a struct though?
[21:45:27] <acrichto> you can't have an impl on a trait?
[21:47:52] <Seldaek> acrichto: this for example https://github.com/mozilla/rust/blob/master/src/libstd/iter.rs#L741
[21:48:08] <Seldaek> rustdoc_ng says it's implemented on Iterator
[21:48:27] <Seldaek> it's not really I guess
[21:48:28] <acrichto> oh that's tough
[21:48:40] <Seldaek> but it should be shown on the Iterator page
[21:48:55] <Seldaek> and it is now :)
[21:49:34] <cmr> Well, it's implemented on any type that implements Iterator.
[21:49:45] <cmr> Does rustdoc_ng's json actually say Iterator, and not a generic?
[21:50:19] <Seldaek> no no it's a generic
[21:50:26] <Seldaek> but I now have insane parsing logic that collects all this
[21:50:31] <Seldaek> I don't know how anymore
[21:50:34] <Seldaek> but it seems to work
[21:50:44] <cmr> heh
[21:51:57] <cmr> acrichto: I do not remember what a TyMethod vs Method is anymore :\
[21:52:20] <Seldaek> there is some serious memory loss going on in this channel
[21:52:50] <Seldaek> seriously.. impl<A: IterBytes, B: IterBytes, C: IterBytes, D: IterBytes, E: IterBytes, F: IterBytes, G: IterBytes, H: IterBytes> of IterBytes for (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H)
[21:53:36] <cmr> Yes.
[21:53:39] <cmr> Aren't tuples wonderful?
[21:53:42] <cmr> Haskell has the same problem
[21:53:51] <cmr> They usually go up to, like, O
[21:53:55] <Seldaek> haha
[21:54:28] <Seldaek> maybe all those between (A) and (A, ..., H) should be doc(hidden)
[21:54:46] <Seldaek> it really looks awful :p
[21:58:02] <cmr> All of this method stuff was two months ago
[21:58:31] <cmr> And there was a full month I didn't touch rustdoc at all :p
[21:59:48] <cmr> "MethodProvenance"
[21:59:49] <cmr> That's new
[22:00:46] <cmr> TypeMethod
[22:01:07] <cmr> So
[22:01:14] <cmr> I think TypeMethod is the default methods on a trait.
[22:02:12] <Seldaek> is it "impl of Trait for T" or "impl Trait for T"? the latter right?
[22:02:27] <cmr> impl Trait for T
[22:02:37] <Seldaek> ok so I messed up and nobody noticed!
[22:03:30] <cmr> I can never remember if commas or semicolons or nothing go after default methods
[22:05:30] <Seldaek> I'd guess nothing 
[22:05:35] <Seldaek> since there's the body
[22:05:52] <Seldaek> and I assume rust is logical and perfect
[22:08:51] <cmr> For the most part, I find that to be true.
[22:09:03] <cmr> Rust is the language I always wanted to implement, but more coherent.
[22:09:27] <cmr> Although it lacks some of the user-defined operators I'd like, and more obscure metaprogramming
[22:09:45] <Seldaek> ok I'm doing some restyling on impls and all
[22:09:49] <Seldaek> this is getting better
[22:10:22] <cmr> acrichto: One that that would be really awesome for you to do
[22:10:24] <cmr> Is fix;
[22:10:26] <cmr> task <unnamed> failed at 'rustdoc_ng requires a #[link(name="foo")] crate attribute', /home/cmr/hacking/rust/src/rustdoc_ng/clean.rs:71
[22:10:38] <cmr> I have no idea how to solve that
[22:10:40] <cmr> .
[22:10:42] <cmr> Might pester tjc
[22:11:08] <acrichto> extern mod rustpkg
[22:11:10] <acrichto> :D
[22:19:21] <Seldaek> cmr, acrichto: new method list styling http://seld.be/rustdoc/master/std/ascii/struct.Ascii.html
[22:19:40] <Seldaek> less pre blocks, more readable I think
[22:19:58] <cmr> I agree
[22:20:07] <acrichto> nice!
[22:21:47] <Seldaek> I also colored fn names which make them stand out more
[22:21:57] <Seldaek> e.g. on http://seld.be/rustdoc/master/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html
[22:22:33] <Seldaek> and on that page you can also see that trait implementations are listed
[22:22:39] <cmr> Still not linkable ;P
[22:22:46] <Seldaek> at the very bottom before Implementors
[22:23:01] <Seldaek> no not linkable, I really don't know how to do this right now
[22:24:17] <Seldaek> it'd be nice though I agree
[22:24:42] <Seldaek> problem is if there are many times the same method name on one page, it's getting really nasty to track
[22:28:10] <cmr> http://seld.be/rustdoc/master/std/ascii/struct.Ascii.html
[22:28:23] <cmr> Full detail of automatically derived traits shouldn't be visible.
[22:28:39] <cmr> Like, it should just list that they're implemented, and marked as "Automatically derived"
[22:28:49] <Seldaek> how can I tell that?
[22:29:23] <acrichto> cmr: newtype structs, what's the ItemType inside them?
[22:30:22] <acrichto> oh, nvmd, found it
[22:30:33] <cmr> acrichto: struct Foo(T), the T, right?
[22:30:54] <acrichto> yeah
[22:31:44] <Seldaek> acrichto: if you do dumping of stuff, https://github.com/Seldaek/rustdoc_web/blob/master/rustdoc.js#L476-570 could be helpful
[22:31:57] <Seldaek> and the following render_* ones
[22:31:57] <acrichto> oh god
[22:32:03] <Seldaek> it's a bit scary
[22:32:12] <acrichto> ah yeah I had to implement it for types already
[22:32:12] <Seldaek> but it took me so long to go through it all, I guess you could benefit :p
[22:32:17] <acrichto> we have a lot of types...
[22:32:27] <acrichto> I need to put this work somewhere other than just my local computer lol
[22:32:36] <Seldaek> I have another fun one that's not committed yet
[22:32:51] <Seldaek> for extracting ids of impl targets
[22:33:11] <Seldaek> trying to wrap this up then commit & send PR & get sleep
[22:33:17] <acrichto> lol
[22:33:28] <cmr> I have a physics exam in 30 minutes that I'm moderately freaking out about.
[22:33:41] <acrichto> just remember F = ma
[22:33:47] <acrichto> you can derive like everything else from that
[22:33:49] <cmr> We haven't gotten to dynamicws yet!
[22:33:52] <acrichto> unelss it's tiny things
[22:33:52] <cmr> We're doing kinematics.
[22:33:57] <Seldaek> cmr: ignore fear and help us debug insane rustdoc stuff :p
[22:34:05] <Seldaek> set your priorities straight!
[22:34:09] <cmr> I know right :P
[22:34:49] <Seldaek> it's exactly why I didn't go study CS
[22:35:01] <Seldaek> I am way too crappy at setting priorities
[22:35:24] <cmr> I do all my homework (to the extent possible) on weekends.
[22:35:30] <cmr> usually all saturday and most of sunday
[22:35:31] <Seldaek> it's 0.30 and it seems like a great idea to try and display impls on primitives right now :p
[22:35:35] <cmr> but the rest of my week is fairly stress-free
[22:36:07] <Seldaek> eh well, keep it up I guess
[22:36:48] <Seldaek> also I always forget this chan is logged, I should stop talking shit :p
[22:37:11] <Seldaek> I guess there is plausible deniability
[22:37:17] <cmr> acrichto: thanks so much for helping out with rustdoc, btw
[22:37:25] <acrichto> cmr: it's my pleasure :)
[22:37:29] <acrichto> haven't done like anything yet lol
[22:37:43] <Seldaek> if anything you got us back on track a bit
[22:37:44] <cmr> well, you integrated it into the makefiles, which is something I've been dreading
[22:37:55] <cmr> I'd been blocked by that intimidation for a month ;(
[22:37:58] <acrichto> lol
[22:40:07] <acrichto> Seldaek: documentation for fields of a struct don't show up anywhere :(
[22:41:01] <Seldaek> that is correct
[22:41:28] <acrichto> Seldaek: also http://seld.be/rustdoc/master/std/fmt/struct.Formatter.html
[22:41:43] <acrichto> the "Arguments" header isn't clear that it's attached to "pad_integral"
[22:42:06] <Seldaek> yeah maybe the docblock should be indented one deeper
[22:42:27] <Seldaek> and h1s in docblocks should be smaller really
[22:42:35] <Seldaek> I'll fix this up in a bit
[22:43:38] <acrichto> Seldaek: yeah also http://seld.be/rustdoc/master/std/option/enum.Option.html is kinda tough to read
[22:43:44] <acrichto> it's not clear what's what
[22:44:54] <Seldaek> definitely
[22:51:43] <Seldaek> cmr: you never answered above, how do Iknow which trait impls are derived?
[23:15:46] <Seldaek> YAY!
[23:16:03] <Seldaek> impl Char for char & other primitive impls are showing up
[23:24:20] <Seldaek> acrichto: alright, fixed your h1, indenting and struct field doc issues
[23:24:29] <Seldaek> see links you pointed out above
[23:24:58] <Seldaek> maybe not perfect yet, but huge improvements tonight I'm happy
[23:25:32] <Seldaek> especially listing impls on http://seld.be/rustdoc/master/std/str/index.html & friends is awesome 
[23:25:44] <Seldaek> that was the last big missing piece to beat current-docs
[23:26:07] <acrichto> yeah those look better!
[23:26:12] <acrichto> I'm not a big fan of the multicolored links
[23:26:17] <acrichto> links should look like links :(
[23:26:43] <acrichto> we have lots of stuff that's a link, but it's not clear that they're all links
[23:26:48] <acrichto> but anyway, minor issues
[23:26:54] <acrichto> I have a lot of catching up to do lol
[23:27:06] <Seldaek> I think it's kinda nice once you're used to it to know what type it is from the color
[23:27:15] <Seldaek> but yeah maybe it's bad
[23:27:20] <Seldaek> time will tell I think
[23:29:08] <Seldaek> acrichto: the diff ;) https://github.com/Seldaek/rustdoc_web/commit/94f8f5bc3866752d294c9a329dc7c0a6e23400b3
[23:29:26] <Seldaek> this extractId fn is what I meant earlier
[23:29:36] <Seldaek> really nasty :/
[23:29:57] <acrichto> oh god so many lines
[23:30:07] <acrichto> it can be done!
[23:30:44] <Seldaek> acrichto: where should I put it in the rust tree?
[23:31:35] <Seldaek> eh src/rustdoc_web I guess
[23:32:19] <acrichto> Seldaek: hmmm... I'm actually not entirely sure
[23:37:08] <Seldaek> ok
[23:37:12] <Seldaek> https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9347
[23:37:16] <Seldaek> I'll update if needed
[23:37:46] <acrichto> 2,877 additions
[23:37:47] <acrichto> damn
[23:38:10] <Seldaek> we'll talk another day about the integration I guess
[23:38:16] <Seldaek> really gotta sleep now.. almost 2am
[23:38:23] <acrichto> lol
