[07:56:58] <niconii> hmm, so i decided to see how converting "ﬂavor" to uppercase fared in a few other languages
[07:57:34] <niconii> it seems in ruby and perl, it yields "ﬂAVOR"
[07:58:10] <niconii> but python, elixir, and (surprisingly) javascript all do the right thing and yield "FLAVOR"
[08:04:05] <niconii> it seems go has both ToUppercase and ToUppercaseSpecial, but the latter is for language-specific differences, and both functions are one-to-one

[08:09:14] <niconii> it's gotta be ones with built-in uppercase methods, there's no point testing something like C where i'm sure there's *some* library that does it
[08:09:54] <Mutabah> niconii: well, I think C has something like that in the standard library
[08:10:29] <niconii> does it?

[08:17:54] <niconii> lua doesn't either

[08:18:10] <Twisol> Swift probably does if ObjC does
[08:18:58] <niconii> oh, huh, there was another language called swift before apple named their language swift
[08:19:18] <niconii> so they did exactly what google did with go
[08:20:46] <Twisol> Did there happen to be an earlier Rust?
[08:21:19] <niconii> doesn't seem like it
[08:21:25] <Twisol> I'm also trying to think of any Microsoft languages that might've overtaken a name, but nothing seems to stick.
[08:21:51] <Twisol> Eh. Weird late-night tangent, sorry.
[08:22:00] <niconii> i can't imagine "rust" would've been a popular name for a programming language ;)
[08:22:54] <Mutabah> Twisol: No, but there is a game of the same name :D
[08:23:05] <Twisol> Just like Go. ;D
[08:23:14] <niconii> ahaha, that's right, yes, there is that
[08:23:36] <Twisol> I posted the Rust 1.0 blog post to my team's Slack
[08:23:41] <niconii> which is why kids keep mistaking /r/rust for the game's subreddit :D
[08:23:43] <Twisol> people were wondering why I brought up a video game
[08:24:03] <niconii> and then yelling at us for features
[08:25:26] <niconii> i think bstrie mentioned that he's gotten demands from people to give /r/rust to them
[08:26:50] <niconii> anyway, i guess the difference is that we predate the video game, rather than the other way around
[08:27:18] <Twisol> That's true enough
[08:27:58] <niconii> we're not as mainstream and hip though :(
[08:28:24] <Twisol> Give it time. :D
[08:28:56] <bstrie> Swift was also a language before Swift was a language
[08:29:09] <bstrie> as was Go
[08:31:23] <niconii> but C was a completely original name
[08:32:02] <Twisol> except that it was (literally) B++
[08:34:19] <niconii> i wonder what started the fashion of naming languages after random words, anyway
[08:35:46] <Twisol> Wikipedia has an interesting timeline of programming languages: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_programming_languages
[08:35:59] <niconii> in the past it seemed to be more acronyms/abbreviations like FORTRAN, COBOL, or BCPL
[08:36:18] <niconii> there was BASIC, but even that one was an acronym

[15:13:27] <fmtq> Mozilla hates success
[15:14:37] <Tiffany> lexical borrow checking, tobba?
[15:15:15] <VShell> the idea that borrows end at the end of a {block} - that borrows are tied to blocks. I believe.
[15:15:22] <Tiffany> oh
[15:15:26] <Tiffany> that's unfortunate
[15:15:43] <VShell> (honestly, it makes it easier to think about them that way than something more complicated.)
[15:16:15] <Tiffany> having lifetimes be tied to an object seems like it would be more intuitive though
[15:16:36] <Mutabah> It would be
[15:16:46] <Mutabah> but it'd be VERY complex for borrowck
[15:16:54] <Tiffany> I was thinking there had to be a downside
[15:16:54] <Mutabah> And the current model works well enough for most cases

[15:19:21] <Tobba> VShell: except when you have multiple scopes
[15:19:24] <Tobba> it's a complete clusterfuck
[15:19:51] <Tiffany> it makes it difficult to embed borrows in heap objects, doesn't it?
[15:19:56] <Tobba> it becomes literally impossible to use a let statement, so you have to duplicate the code for each usage instead
[15:20:00] <VShell> Tiffany: actually, the idea that a lifetime is ~roughly equivalent to a block is nice.
[15:20:07] <Tobba> and you need dumb temporary blocks to constrain the lifetime so it doesn't fly all over the block
[15:20:13] <Tobba> temporary scopes*
[15:20:17] <VShell> Tobba: mmm. I've not come across that yet.
[15:20:47] <Tobba> like, let (a, b) = { let borrow = foo(); (borrow_something.a(), borrow.b()) };
[15:21:16] <Tobba> except this hack doesn't extend across scopes and then you need to revert to even more hackery
[15:22:42] <Tobba> Mutabah: it shouldn't be that complex to just track the last damn usage of something
[15:23:06] <Mutabah> I dunno really
[15:23:15] <Mutabah> I haven't seen the borrowck code, or know the algos it uses
[15:23:47] <Mutabah> It hasn't been impelmented (despite being a longstanding problem) is either because it's ancient code, or it's a hard probelem
[15:24:11] <Havvy> Or it's back-compat.

[15:37:32] <bluss> is :: a comment?
[15:37:33] <Havvy> But then, that's because I don't understand the operators `:` and `::`.
[15:37:56] <Tobba> bluss: binding
[15:38:26] <Tobba> it binds "foo" to "bar: bar * 5" (a lambda) in the expression "foo 20"
[15:38:50] <Havvy> Ah, so it's the `in` keyword in Nix then?
[15:39:03] <Tobba> pretty much
[15:39:52] <Havvy> It's readable once you know what the operators are.
[15:40:17] <Tobba> I think it should be easily modifiable given a bigger chunk of it
[15:40:20] <Havvy> I would totes write it as `foo = (bar: bar * 5) :: foo 20` personally.
[15:40:39] <Tobba> yeah that's clearer
[15:41:04] <Havvy> Or possibly... `{foo = (bar : bar * 5); } :: foo 20`   if it's possible.
[15:41:29] <Tobba> there's another sugar that I haven't implemented yet: { foo = (bar: bar * 5) } -> foo 20
[15:41:43] <Tobba> (I'm not exactly sure about the choice of that arrow yet)
[15:42:05] <Havvy> I'd rather have the keyword `in` used instead of punctuation though.
[15:43:54] <Tobba> "foo = (bar: bar * 5) in foo 20" causes "in foo" to look a bit grouped, but I guess it's clearer

[17:45:05] <eddyb> how does that text update without breaking selection?
[17:45:14] <eddyb> is this is a chrome improvement?
[17:45:23] <eddyb> usually selection is canceled when the backing elements update
[17:48:02] <WindowsBunny> eddyb: The selection only partially breaks if the edge of the selection is in the number
[17:48:44] <eddyb> yeah, it's a span
[17:48:57] <VShell> eddyb: if you only select the number, it does cancel... I'm going to guess the answer is that selecting the rest causes Chrome to store "Serving up over <span/> comments." as the selection.
[17:49:47] <eddyb> VShell: selections are defined as a "cursor" range
[17:50:09] <eddyb> where the "cursor" is a node and an offset (for a text node)

[20:25:02] <Zoxc> eddyb: I just added myself to wheel and nix-env -i sudo
[20:25:07] <cmr> eddyb: in theory you could set up Chromium (the GL proxy that VirtualBox uses) on any guest/host combo.
[20:25:12] <eddyb> Zoxc: how did you add yourself to wheel?

[20:26:43] <eddyb> Zoxc: how you enable sudo without installing it manually https://gist.github.com/eddyb/adfe2c4ef1a7adec75e7#file-configuration-nix-L92

[20:29:47] <Zoxc> Probably
[20:29:55] <eddyb> Havvy: fun. I have small changes to rustup to make it work
[20:30:01] <Zoxc> https://nixos.org/nixos/manual/sec-user-management.html
[20:30:27] <eddyb> "NixOS supports both declarative and imperative styles of user management." oh, right
[20:30:34] <eddyb> last I heard, one of them was going to be ditched
[20:30:56] <eddyb> If you set users.mutableUsers to false, then the contents of /etc/passwd and /etc/group will be congruent to your NixOS configuration. For instance, if you remove a user from users.extraUsers and run nixos-rebuild, the user account will cease to exist. Also, imperative commands for managing users and groups, such as useradd, are no longer available.
[20:30:57] <Havvy> If one was going to be ditched, it'd be the imperative (nix-env -i) version, but I would hope not.
[20:31:18] <eddyb> nix-env -i is package management, not user management
[20:31:42] <eddyb> Zoxc: when I installed NixOS, it behaved as if users.mutableUsers = false
[20:31:43] <Havvy> Oh, right, user management. There I would expect imperative styles to be changed to updating the declarative version.
[20:32:04] <Havvy> eddyb:  Well, if nixpkgs nightly actually updated, I wouldn't be building Rust...but something or another is failing.
[20:32:57] <Zoxc> Now the cursor is no longer trapped, but it doesn't correspond to the host cursor, which is worse than trapping it :/

[20:45:11] <eddyb> hmm
[20:45:17] <cmr> but it's all configurable -- the reason sudo even exists in the presence of su is that it has thoroughly configurable policies.
[20:45:36] <whipsch> mouse.vusb.enable = "TRUE" mouse.vusb.useBasicMouse = "FALSE" Zoxc

[20:46:39] <whipsch> that might work for you, dunno
[20:47:28] <eddyb> Zoxc: so, when I installed NixOS, I had to go through configuration.nix to define an user

[20:49:37] <cmr> You can set one though.
[20:49:47] <cmr> It can't be just meta though, it needs to be paired with something.

[20:53:02] <cmr> Yeah the universal keybindings config is one of the reasons I think Plasma/Qt/we is truly superior, UX wise.
[20:53:50] <eddyb> hmm, Hyper still gives me Meta for win key
[20:53:55] <eddyb> (what does it even mean?)

[21:05:25] <XMPPwocky> and everything *after* that trailing space is a string, which is then curried into the actual function

[21:06:58] <XMPPwocky> so stuff like ls -al /dev | grep sda 
[21:06:59] <XMPPwocky> would work
[21:07:03] <eddyb> Havvy: the unstable channel is named nixos
[21:07:14] <Havvy> So then it'd be "nixos.sublime3"
[21:07:25] <eddyb> nixos.pkgs.sublime3
[21:07:39] <eddyb> pkgs is mandatory AFAIK
[21:07:55] <eddyb> I've never changed it btw
[21:08:07] <eddyb> I guess it's because I didn't install it from a release

[21:59:26] <Diggsey> found this, which explains it: https://reference.wolfram.com/language/tutorial/TheRepresentationOfDerivatives.html
[21:59:47] <Diggsey> wolfram is using a custom notation
[22:00:12] <Diggsey> (a pattern in the derivative of such functions)
[22:00:39] <eddyb> f(g(h(x)))' = f'(g(h(x))) * g(h(x))' = f'(g(h(x)) * g'(h(x)) * h'(x)
[22:00:45] <eddyb> does that look more like a pattern :P?
[22:02:25] <Diggsey> yeah, I also have to calculate the values for all possible "i" at the same time :P
[22:02:54] <eddyb> the derivative of (f_1 . f_2 . f_3 . ... . f_n) is the product (f_1' . f_2 * f_3 . ... f_n) * (f_2' . f_3 . ... f_n) * (f_3' . ... f_n) * ... * f_n'
[22:03:23] <eddyb> where f * g = \x -> (f x) * (g x)

[22:04:31] <eddyb> in my case, f_i is \x -> f(x, x_i)

[22:06:17] <eddyb> Diggsey: so, for plus it's just... 1?
[22:06:33] <Diggsey> yes
[22:06:40] <eddyb> oops, I have a * between f_2 and f_3 in my expansion instead of .
[22:07:47] <eddyb> (f_2 . f_3 . ... f_n) * (f_3 . ... f_n) * ... * f_n

[22:10:21] <Diggsey> eddyb: ok, so given f(x0, x1) it looks like I just need to give the algorithm "d/dx0(f(x0, x1))" and "d/dx1(f(x0, x1))"
[22:10:46] <eddyb> Diggsey: since it's foldl, can't you just get one of those?
[22:11:16] <Diggsey> it seems both foldl and foldr need both
[22:11:29] <eddyb> doesn't seem right
[22:12:11] <Diggsey> first it's used like so: f(c, x), and then later it's used as f(f(c, x), y)
[22:12:21] <Diggsey> in the first one it's on the right
[22:12:28] <Diggsey> in the second one it's part of the left param
[22:12:32] <eddyb> oh
[22:13:06] <eddyb> Diggsey: so my f_1 would be f(c, x) while the rest are f(x, x_i)
[22:13:22] <eddyb> and f_1 only shows up once in the whole thing
[22:13:30] <eddyb> fair enough
[22:13:32] <Diggsey> I think so :P
[22:14:52] <Diggsey> eddyb: this shows the most complicated case (now that I know what the f^(...) notation means): https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=d%2Fdx+f%28f%28f%28f%28c%2C+w%29%2C+x%29%2C+y%29%2C+z%29
[22:15:45] <cmr> Diggsey: now, what's the derivative with respect to plus ;)
[22:16:29] <Diggsey> cmr: well the whole point was to avoid having to figure that out, now my algorithm can do it given the knowledge that the derivative of plus on its own is 1

[22:38:15] <Tobba> I tried epdfview and it sucks
[22:38:18] <cmr> I use pdf.js, as sad as it sounds.
[22:38:28] <Tobba> I don't think pdf.js supports bookmarks
[22:38:33] <cmr> otherwise I just use mupdf or if I'm feeling frisky, evince.

[22:40:09] <Tobba> cmr: it looks like pdf.js does have the index, never noticed that before, it also doesn't let you collapse parts of it

[22:58:09] <cmr> I've noticed a fair amount of missing icons in breeze.
[22:58:11] <eddyb> hmm, I wonder if they load the settings from kde5
[22:58:13] <cmr> but idgaf.
[22:58:40] <eddyb> cmr: it's going to be so much easier for them to make new icons, though
[22:58:44] <eddyb> kind of a shame, really
[22:58:48] <eddyb> oxygen was such an involving project
[22:59:00] <Tobba> not referring to the missing icons, referring to the fact that there's 3 buttons that change the size of the icons but the bar itself takes up a tenth of the screen and can't be resized
[22:59:05] <cmr> right.
[23:00:33] <eddyb> cmr: http://wstaw.org/m/2012/10/01/computer-laptop.png

[23:01:26] <c74d> eddyb: a KDE-Key?
[23:01:28] <eddyb> oxygen looked really good to me, but it was getting tiring with all the details

[23:01:44] <eddyb> not a photo of a laptop

[23:02:32] <Tobba> insane amounts of visual noise and more gradients than an early 2000s icon theme on an acid trip
