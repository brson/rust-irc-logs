[04:29:06] <niconii> i remember seeing something on the web a few months back or so that was like
[04:29:54] <niconii> it started as an extremely minimalistic game? and people voted on features to add
[04:30:02] <niconii> i can't remember what it was called though
[04:30:54] <niconii> it was like, strictly linear, you were an @ a la roguelikes, all you could do was hit right to move forward or left to move back
[04:32:27] <niconii> think it was on github, actually...
[04:33:33] <niconii> wasn't anything big, it was like some experimental thing

[05:02:33] <bombless> niconii what kind of game?
[05:03:09] <niconii> just a dead-simple web game, like
[05:03:27] <niconii> roguelike-esque, if roguelikes were one-dimensional
[05:03:34] <niconii> everything was text
[05:03:53] <niconii> there wasn't really much "gameplay" per se last i saw of it
[05:05:27] <niconii> unfortunately i don't have much concrete knowledge of it or i'd have probably found it already...
[05:07:25] <niconii> it's not a big deal though, i was just curious if it got anywhere

[06:54:09] <bstrie> Havvy: linesprint
[06:54:30] <Havvy> Granted, I haven't played DCSS in over two years now.
[06:54:38] <Havvy> I beat it once.
[06:54:51] <bstrie> I haven't really played it in a long time either, it's changed a *lot* though
[06:54:54] <bstrie> the devteam is great
[06:55:02] <Havvy> Yeah. They keep making it easier.
[06:55:24] <bstrie> they're removing a lot of the bullshit, which has the unfortunate side effect of making things easier
[06:55:43] <bstrie> like, item destruction is gone
[06:55:46] <bstrie> that's so nice
[06:55:51] <bstrie> but makes the game easier
[06:56:17] <bstrie> corrosion is now a temporary status effect instead of a permanent debuff, which is the same
[06:56:20] <bstrie> and so on
[06:56:27] <bstrie> I honestly can't complain, there's lots of good stuff too
[06:56:37] <bstrie> zigs now stack in difficulty, or something
[06:56:53] <bstrie> so if you want a challenge, have fun with that
[06:57:11] <Havvy> I dislike the corrosion change, since it's impossible to get corrosion unless you go for a couple specific runes.
[06:57:27] <bstrie> jellies corrode you. jellies are in D
[06:59:02] <bstrie> and because of that, previously the best strategy for doing D as an early character was to always carry around a stack of stones, *just* so that you could kite jellies while pelting them
[07:00:04] <bstrie> because engaging them in melee would just ruin your equipment forever
[07:00:48] <Havvy> Ah. Sounds like a reason to just remove that effect off of jellies.
[07:01:04] <bstrie> that's less interesting than just changing the effect
[07:02:23] <bstrie> by the time you're ready to tackle the parts of the game where corrosion happens all the time, there's a good chance you'd found an item that prevented corrosion
[07:02:43] <bstrie> so by removing it from jellies you'd have effectively removed the effect from the game entirely
[07:02:46] *** Quits: brson (brson@moz-uf6fgd.tmodns.net) (Quit: leaving)
[07:03:09] <bstrie> making the effect less severe also encourages people to go to those branches early
[07:03:58] <Havvy> Hmm, fair enough.
[07:04:22] <bstrie> I agree that it's a challenge to balance long-term strategy with short-term tactics
[07:05:35] <bstrie> I don't know of any roguelike that actually does strategy very well. mostly you just react in the moment and deal with it
[07:06:09] <bstrie> pretty much every roguelike has farming to some capacity, which can completely nullify strategic concerns if it's not too tedious to do
[07:06:22] <Havvy> DCSS tries to kill off farming.
[07:07:46] <bstrie> DCSS is way less farmable than most, but pan is still infinite and zigs still exist (though changes to zigs may have made farming much more dangerous, I dunno)
[07:08:07] <bstrie> I should play brogue
[07:08:24] <bstrie> no, I should do rust stuff for the next week. then I can play brogue
[07:08:58] *** Joins: eerie (eerie@moz-rll6i6.red.bezeqint.net)
[07:10:09] <Havvy> bstrie:  Nah. Play Brogue and then do Rust stuff once Rust 1.0 hits.
[07:10:16] <bstrie> just rewrite brogue in rust
[07:10:21] <bstrie> that way I can feel productive
[07:11:00] <Havvy> But then I'd have to rewrite libtcod into Rust.
[07:11:12] <bstrie> I think there's a rusty termbox thing somewhere
[07:11:46] <Havvy> libtcod isn't termbox I don't think.
[07:12:23] <eddyb_> ohhhh you know what?
[07:12:24] <bstrie> the tcod website is down
[07:12:38] <huon> Havvy: https://github.com/tomassedovic/tcod-rs ?
[07:12:48] <eddyb_> say you have a function f that you want to trace. you breakpoint it
[07:13:02] <eddyb_> you get a -> b -> c -> f
[07:13:26] <Havvy> huon:  Oh, cool.
[07:13:30] <eddyb_> some time in the future, the breakpoint triggers again and you get the exact same stacktrace
[07:13:55] <eddyb_> how do you know whether the a, b or c invocations are the same ones, or newer ones?
[07:14:18] <XMPPwocky> eddyb_: context?
[07:14:29] <bstrie> eddyb_: precise full-program instrumentation?
[07:14:34] <eddyb_> neither
[07:14:39] <bstrie> or: just have each function increment a counter in TLS
[07:14:51] <XMPPwocky> eddyb_: break on return from C?
[07:15:01] <eddyb_> XMPPwocky: context may be hidden in deep memor
[07:15:07] <eddyb_> or even infinite loops
[07:15:12] <XMPPwocky> Deep Memory?
[07:15:12] <eddyb_> *memory
[07:15:14] <XMPPwocky> right
[07:15:15] <XMPPwocky> hm
[07:15:27] <XMPPwocky> eddyb_: if it's an infinite loop, they are the same invocations
[07:15:31] <XMPPwocky> or else your stack'll smash
[07:15:35] <eddyb_> deep as in gigabytes you can't diff a million times per second
[07:15:41] <eddyb_> XMPPwocky: wrong!
[07:15:45] <XMPPwocky> do you have a solution
[07:15:58] <eddyb_> you can breakpoint the instruction after every call site
[07:16:11] <XMPPwocky> right, that's why I said break on return
[07:16:17] <eddyb_> if it trips, the next time around it will be a new invocation
[07:16:26] <eddyb_> XMPPwocky: oh I read C not c
[07:16:32] <eddyb_> oops
[07:17:23] <eddyb_> I guess just c would suffice, if you ignore unwinding
[07:18:34] <eddyb_> but assuming you can control a debugger programatically, this trick would easily prove its usefulness
[07:18:58] <XMPPwocky> recently i had a need to trace through the SEH chai
[07:19:02] <XMPPwocky> and find everything that's called
[07:19:10] <XMPPwocky> it's amazingly hard without a scripptable debugger
[07:19:44] <eddyb_> I almost want to hook up my half-assed UI to gdb-server
[07:20:12] <XMPPwocky> Immunity Debugger is pretty neat, but idk if it's FOSS
[07:20:42] <fkaa> semi-rust-related: how do you start a website then send data to the server, which updates the site for the user 
[07:20:58] <fkaa> does the client have to request the data 
[07:21:13] <eddyb_> hehe yes
[07:21:29] <eddyb_> fkaa: but it's worse than that
[07:21:39] <eddyb_> USB works the same way
[07:23:07] <eddyb_> while server push might be a thing (WebSockets are duplex if you want to use them), USB devices still have no way of notifying the host about anything
[07:23:16] <eddyb_> unless I missed something in 3.0
[07:23:53] <eddyb_> I recall that opening all the rs files from rust-by-example in rid3, it would use around 2GB
[07:24:03] <fkaa> ?
[07:24:11] <eddyb_> I need to figure out what's wasting all that space
[07:24:41] <eddyb_> writing a debugger for that might be overkill
[07:25:15] <fkaa> i want to hook up a website on a local port, send some info from another program to it, and display it on the site in realtime
[07:25:44] <eddyb_> fkaa: "the site" as in, an HTML page?
[07:25:58] <fkaa> yeah
[07:26:22] <eddyb_> if you're streaming data at < 100ms intervals, you prpbably want WebSockets
[07:27:15] <fkaa> i don't suppose there's something like socket.io for rust?
[07:27:33] <eddyb_> there should be a crate for web sockets
[07:27:56] <eddyb_> mkay, so 120 small files just past type checking ends up using 2GB. that is, what, less than 20MB per instance
[07:28:38] <eddyb_> probably why it went unnoticed
[07:29:18] <eddyb_> let's see if I still have that cool gdb tracing script
[07:29:28] <fkaa> i found https://crates.io/crates/websocket-stream and https://crates.io/crates/rustic-io
[07:29:46] <XMPPwocky> hmm
[07:29:55] <XMPPwocky> looks like immunity is'nt free software
[07:30:08] <XMPPwocky> it's pretty good though
[07:32:07] <eddyb_> 185MB for 10 files
[07:32:38] <eddyb_> 348MB for 20 files
[07:32:45] <eddyb_> that's hello world files btw
[07:32:50] <XMPPwocky> uh
[07:32:51] <XMPPwocky> what
[07:33:00] <eddyb_> XMPPwocky: constant factor
[07:33:12] <eddyb_> I'm guess libstd metadata
[07:33:19] <eddyb_> *guessing
[07:33:25] <XMPPwocky> what fun
[07:34:01] <eddyb_> 346MB for fn main() {}
[07:34:15] <eddyb_> hmm, so it doesn't need the println invocation
[07:34:56] <eddyb_> in an error state it's using nothing, good
[07:35:44] <eddyb_> 3MB difference between error state and no_std
[07:36:02] <XMPPwocky> what does massif sya
[07:36:03] <XMPPwocky> say
[07:36:16] <eddyb_> massif is largely useless for rustc
[07:36:21] <XMPPwocky> oh?
[07:36:49] <eddyb_> it might work here because I am starting a thread, running only the passes I care about and keeping the data alive
[07:37:29] <eddyb_> okay, 22MB is definitely the baseline of rid3
[07:37:52] <eddyb_> and one file using libatd adds 16MB to that
[07:39:08] <eddyb_> *libstd

[09:08:51] <bstrie> coherence checking only ever rejects programs, so we can coherence check concurrently with speculative linking!
[09:09:53] <WindowsBunny> bstrie: Why don't we do checks concurrently like that?
[09:10:08] <bstrie> because nobody's bothered to so far
[09:10:29] <bstrie> theoretically we could go through and do an analysis of which compiler passes depend on which other ones and make things fully concurrent

[09:11:23] <bstrie> nope. not yet
[09:11:40] <bstrie> there was a patch for parallel codegen last year but it was super buggy
[09:11:54] <bstrie> part of the post-1.0 speedup effort will be to revive it
[09:11:54] <XMPPwocky> i recall that
[09:11:57] <XMPPwocky> everybody was super hyped
[09:11:58] <XMPPwocky> and then
[09:11:59] <XMPPwocky> :(
[09:12:30] <bstrie> anyway, there are huge avenues for optimization
[09:15:13] <eddyb_> I don't think the parallel stuff was super buggy
[09:15:21] <eddyb_> just that something broke it
[09:15:33] <eddyb_> most checks produce no output
[09:15:42] <eddyb_> including borrow checking
[09:16:09] <eddyb_> the answer to "why we don't do it" is because "nothing is thread-safe"
[09:16:21] <XMPPwocky> hm
[09:16:36] <XMPPwocky> because of all the @mut?
[09:16:46] <eddyb_> you and Tiffany, lol
[09:16:47] <WindowsBunny> rust claims to provide thread safety

[09:16:58] <XMPPwocky> eddyb_: what
[09:17:06] <eddyb_> @mut was gone last year around this time
[09:17:20] <eddyb_> @ was removed last autumn
[09:17:33] <WindowsBunny> I remember @ dieing :D

[09:17:50] <XMPPwocky> eddyb_: i now
[09:17:52] <XMPPwocky> know
[09:17:58] <eddyb_> Rust prevents you from sharing it across threads
[09:17:59] <XMPPwocky> but now it's Rc<RefCell<_>>
[09:18:05] <XMPPwocky> and seems to be a 1-1 translation :P
[09:18:10] <eddyb_> no it's not
[09:18:22] <WindowsBunny> Rc doesn't clean up cycles after itself
[09:18:27] <eddyb_> @ was less efficient and did cycle collection
[09:18:42] <bstrie> WindowsBunny: neither does Arc, which is thread-safe
[09:18:46] <XMPPwocky> eddyb_: i mean in the source
[09:18:56] <eddyb_> anyways
[09:18:57] <XMPPwocky> what i was told is that when @mut was dying
[09:19:09] <WindowsBunny> bstrie: So?
[09:19:10] <XMPPwocky> there was basically a s/@mut foo/Rc<RefCell<Foo>>/ in rustc
[09:19:17] <eddyb_> you can't use mutexes in the compiler, that would be suicidal
[09:19:20] <XMPPwocky> and thus you have nothing being Send/Sync
[09:19:27] <XMPPwocky> and possible panics 
[09:19:28] <bstrie> WindowsBunny: we must not be arguing about what I think we're arguing about :P
[09:19:37] <WindowsBunny> bstrie: We aren't
[09:20:02] <WindowsBunny> bstrie: We're actually doing a rust metaphor for bunnies
[09:20:15] <eddyb_> RefCell is not sanely replaceable for thread safety
[09:20:21] <eddyb_> Cell *kinda* is
[09:20:43] <eddyb_> atomics are less suicidal, especially if you relax them enough
[09:20:44] <bluss> XMPPwocky: @mut had runtime mutability checking too
[09:21:02] <XMPPwocky> bluss: that's ture
[09:21:03] <eddyb_> we need a whole bunch of lock-free data structures for the compiler
[09:21:38] <bstrie> wondering now how much unsafe code is still in the compiler
[09:21:39] <eddyb_> and abstractions based on "append-only"
[09:21:40] <XMPPwocky> at least rustc's whole "everything is a sidechain on the AST" approach is amenable to multithreading
[09:21:40] <bstrie> let's see
[09:21:58] <eddyb_> bstrie: very little, outside of interacting with LLVM
[09:21:58] <XMPPwocky> I could see it almost taking a functional datastructure approach
[09:22:10] <XMPPwocky> or append-only
[09:22:16] <eddyb_> bstrie: the worst part was middle/ty.rs
[09:22:34] <eddyb_> XMPPwocky: grep for "remove" or "pop" in rustc :P
[09:23:01] <eddyb_> we already have a whole bunch of maps and vectors that we don't ever remove from
[09:23:06] <eddyb_> and there's also arenas
[09:23:41] <eddyb_> to which you can take two approaches: atomics or thread-local
[09:23:46] <XMPPwocky> is there a name for a datastructure that is a "b-tree for linked lists"
[09:23:47] <bstrie> 313 uses in librustc_trans
[09:23:57] <XMPPwocky> basically, TypedArena except you don't get &mut, but you can traverse it
[09:24:02] <XMPPwocky> and append with &
[09:24:07] <eddyb_> bstrie: LLVM
[09:24:34] <eddyb_> XMPPwocky: @T :P
[09:24:46] <XMPPwocky> heh
[09:24:48] <eddyb_> and its cycle collection
[09:24:56] <XMPPwocky> eddyb_: no, but what i meant is
[09:25:08] <eddyb_> ffs
[09:25:15] <XMPPwocky> all you *really* need for this append-only stuff
[09:25:27] <eddyb_> LLVM recompiled for some reason and killed libcore
[09:25:32] <XMPPwocky> is a TypedArena that uses atomics for pointers between chunks
[09:25:36] <XMPPwocky> and traversal
[09:25:38] <eddyb_> I had librustc built q_q
[09:25:44] <XMPPwocky> which isn't hard when you know the chunk layout

[09:25:47] <eddyb_> now it does it all again
[09:25:59] <eddyb_> XMPPwocky: why traversal?
[09:26:06] <XMPPwocky> eddyb_: well, you might not even need that
[09:26:21] <eddyb_> oh you want a building block
[09:26:24] <XMPPwocky> i actually had an implementaiton of this but it was like 0.11
[09:26:41] <eddyb_> doesn't work that well for HashMap
[09:26:46] <eddyb_> besides!
[09:27:14] <XMPPwocky> all problems in computer science can be solved by applying lock-free hash tables
[09:27:15] <eddyb_> rustc puts integers or pointers in data structures
[09:27:18] <XMPPwocky> it's a fact
[09:27:42] <XMPPwocky> P != NP, but they have a hash collision
[09:28:11] <bstrie> as long as we're rewriting the compiler to make it parallelizable can we also rewrite it so that it can actually emit aliasing data to llvm pls
[09:28:34] <eddyb_> if you replace all the Rc uses with arenas, you will have &T and integers
[09:28:47] <eddyb_> so the arenas have to be thread safe
[09:29:10] <XMPPwocky> eddyb_: thus the call for a thread-safe arena :p
[09:29:13] <eddyb_> and then you might need some thread-safe append-only collections
[09:29:21] <eddyb_> but!

[09:37:11] <eddyb_> bstrie: you take the context, borrow everything immutably to create a second context, and pass that to N passes in parallel
[09:37:26] <eddyb_> that doesn't require any new abstractions
[09:38:38] <eddyb_> bstrie: can also fork-join in an individual pass, dividing its time by the number of cores (approximately)
[09:41:09] <bstrie> eddyb_: I'm looking at the time-passes output now. does every pass that ends in "checking" not produce any output other than rejecting a bad program?

[18:55:57] <Tiffany> I'm not very surprised by access being given to /etc/passwd
[18:56:05] <Tiffany> it's probably running in a vm, and /etc/passwd is harmless regardless
[18:56:12] <Tiffany> at least
[18:56:15] <Tiffany> not as harmful as /etc/shadow
[18:56:26] <Tobba> yeah, /etc/passwd is usually world-readable
[18:56:33] <Tobba> but it's also kinda revealing
[18:56:35] <Tiffany> although mumble mumble enough rope to hang yourself with
[18:56:53] <Tobba> for example I can see theres a "rust" user
[18:57:38] <Tobba> and that's about the only thing on that box, it seems, so I guess it's in a VM

[18:58:57] <eddyb> fucking nasm
[18:59:04] <Tobba> nasm > gas
[18:59:06] <eddyb> it has a decent macro system

[18:59:25] <JustAPerson> nasm's macros are kinda scary
[18:59:33] <JustAPerson> it has like an 11-stage parser or something
[18:59:37] <eddyb> lel
[18:59:45] <Tobba> they remind me of C macros and the errors kinda suck, but it's alright
[18:59:49] <eddyb> I just want a variadic macro
[18:59:55] <Tobba> oh dear.
[19:00:11] <eddyb> the problem is perfect forwarding
[19:00:47] <eddyb> call print does push print; call
[19:01:04] <Tobba> why are you writing a printf macro in nasm
[19:01:13] <eddyb> I want call print, "foo" to push "foo" before doing the rest
[19:01:17] <eddyb> Tobba: no
[19:01:35] <eddyb> I'm writing an assembler in nasm macros
[19:01:44] <eddyb> well, I did that, trivial stuff
[19:01:44] <Tobba> uh oh
[19:01:50] <eddyb> I want half a language
[19:02:04] <eddyb> because I can't think concatenatively
[19:02:12] <eddyb> (Tiffany will kill me)
[19:02:26] <Tiffany> what's so hard about it
[19:03:34] <eddyb> well, first off
[19:03:47] <eddyb> nasm won't let me put more than an instruction per line
[19:04:10] <Tobba> semicolon?
[19:04:15] <eddyb> because "foo" print call is *almost* perfect
[19:04:21] <eddyb> Tobba: shut the fuck up
[19:04:25] * eddyb tries
[19:04:48] <Tobba> lol
[19:04:48] <JustAPerson> semicolon is comment in nasm isn't it?

[20:03:41] <eddyb> 15 people there, nobody talking
[20:03:58] <eddyb> I explain my problem (with macro-generating macros)
[20:04:01] <Tobba> thats kinda to be expected
[20:04:13] <eddyb> then realize I can work around the issue I have
[20:04:43] <eddyb> by storing data associated with the outer macro in a "variable"
[20:04:53] <eddyb> based on the generated macro name
[20:05:03] <eddyb> and I can query it via %?

[20:11:33] <eddyb> wait, that is for define stuff
[20:11:39] <eddyb> :|
[20:11:50] <eddyb> pls werk
[20:13:13] <eddyb> this is a disaster
[20:13:44] <eddyb> it works with multiline macros... but it's the outermost :|

[20:37:52] <eddyb> lol, fasm makes really simple files
[20:38:32] *** Joins: Kingsquee (kingsley@moz-3fm07c.bchsia.telus.net)
[20:42:47] <FreeFull> eddyb: fasm has a policy of command-line flags not changing anything about the output (other than producing an extra file with debug information, when you use that flag)
[20:43:04] <FreeFull> So everything that affects the final result is declared in the .asm files themselves
[20:43:59] <FreeFull> It's output also defaults to a plain binary containing 16-bit x86 opcodes (because it started as an assembler that ran under MS-DOS)
[20:45:57] <Tiffany> good old COM
[20:56:09] <FreeFull> What about COM?

[20:56:45] <eddyb> fasm is nice so far... let's see how it does against my pseudoasm
[20:56:52] <Tiffany> a file format for executables used on MS-DOS
[20:56:58] <Tiffany> just a dump of machine code, all in a single segment
[20:57:02] <Tiffany> no header
[20:58:05] <eddyb> FreeFull: can I have multiple instructions on the same line?
[20:59:38] <FreeFull> eddyb: No idea
[20:59:52] <FreeFull> Semicolons are comments
[21:00:00] <FreeFull> Let me look at fasm.tt

[21:52:58] <Tobba> sadly that may not work due to the exponent part "spilling" into the mantissa since the math is a bit funky
