[02:34:37] <yuriks> what is the meaning of ' ? (Seen in several places) I haven't been able to find anything about it in the docs
[02:34:49] <[mm]> yuriks: It denotes a lifetime variable
[02:35:15] <[mm]> danilolekovic: There isn't any now, but there could be.
[02:35:24] <kimundi> danilolekovic: In time, there probably will be. But for now, syntax higlining is all there is
[02:35:48] <danilolekovic> Thank you
[02:36:16] <kimundi> yuriks: The ' itself has no special meaning besides differentiating a lifetime name form a type parameter name

[03:06:55] <sfackler> is it intended for extern mod statements outside of the crate root to be ignored?
[03:08:16] <benh> I don't think they get ignored, but they probably scope the extern mod relative to the mod they're in
[03:08:25] *** Joins: earlzlap (earlz@moz-9E279EAD.neo.res.rr.com)
[03:08:51] <benh> so you have to prefix paths into the extern mod with the path to the mod containing the extern mod item in use items

[03:09:37] <sfackler> oh, that makes sense
[03:09:49] <yuriks> the typing rules for str terrify me :(
[03:10:27] <sfackler> I was thinking that an extern mod introduces a new root module, but I guess it works the same way as a normal mod declaration
[03:10:33] *** jorendorff_away is now known as jorendorff

[03:11:40] *** Joins: kellogh (timkellogg@moz-704A74D.hsd1.co.comcast.net)
[03:13:19] <yuriks> how str isn't an actual type
[03:14:04] <yuriks> I don't really understand what would be the equivalent to C's literals, which are const char* and have infinite lifetime. I guess they don't exist, right?
[03:14:17] <benh> &'static str
[03:14:18] <sfackler> a &'static str is like that
[03:14:50] <sfackler> hopefully dynamically sized types will be added soon so str will be a more normal type
[03:16:47] <yuriks> so is 'static a special lifetime?
[03:16:57] <benh> yeah
[03:17:05] <sfackler> yep, it's a lifetime that's valid for the entire execution of the program
[03:20:16] <yuriks> is there a structure like C++'s std::vector in the standard library?
[03:20:31] <benh> ~[T] vectors are kind of like that
[03:20:36] <yuriks> I just realized vecs seem to be immutable
[03:20:46] <benh> you can put them into 'mut' slots and they aren't
[03:21:07] <benh> something like let mut v = ~[1, 2, 3]; v.push(4); ought to work
[03:21:08] <yuriks> er, I mean, they're fixed size. Sorry
[03:21:15] <sfackler> rusti: let mut f = ~[]; f.push("hi");
[03:21:18] <yuriks> oh, push?
[03:21:22] * yuriks digs into the docs deeper
[03:21:39] <yuriks> I was trying std::vec::append_one
[03:22:28] <sfackler> take a look at OwnedVector. It has the length extension methods: http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/master/std/vec/trait.OwnedVector.html
[03:22:51] <yuriks> I literally just found that xD
[03:22:54] <dbaupp> that works too, but it's kinda weird. it just takes a ~[], places it in a mut slot, calls push, and then returns the ~[], i.e. it does mutates it. (it's designed to allow for a more "functional" style.)
[03:22:57] <yuriks> I had only looked in MUtableVector
[03:23:03] <dbaupp> (that == append_one)
[03:23:31] <yuriks> dbaupp: yeah, semantically it returns a new vector with the extra element, swallowing the old one
[03:24:00] <dbaupp> yuriks: exactly
[03:24:03] *** Joins: icarot (yaaic@moz-F791C96D.hsd1.ca.comcast.net)
[03:25:40] <yuriks> is a dummy { } block the correct way to force unborrowing of a value?
[03:25:59] <sfackler> you can also throw away the refrence sometimes
[03:26:01] <dbaupp> dunno about correct, but it's the one I use
[03:26:03] <sfackler> let _ = my_reference;
[03:26:03] <yuriks> (in my case, I have a hash_map I consult with .find_mut, then later I want to do other stuff with it)
[03:26:13] <dbaupp> sfackler: does that actually work?
[03:26:28] <sfackler> it's syntactically correct, at least
[03:26:40] <yuriks> doesn't seem like it
[03:26:43] <sfackler> I think the idea is that it's supposed to specifically destruct too
[03:26:46] <sfackler> maybe it doesn't
[03:27:07] <yuriks> I'll use the block
[03:28:22] <dbaupp> sfackler: it might work with &mut, but & doesn't move when passed around, so `let _ = imm_ref;` is essentially the same as `ignore(imm_ref);` which leaves imm_ref still useable afterwards.
[03:28:50] <sfackler> oh, right
[03:31:13] <dbaupp> hm, it probably doesn't work with &mut either, since reborrowing happens.
[03:32:55] <sfackler> &mut doesn't move? It seems like it'd have to
[03:34:14] *** jorendorff is now known as jorendorff_away
[03:35:06] <dbaupp> it does, but it can be reborrowed, i.e. `&mut *x`... I think this happens implicitly sometimes... I'm not 100% sure of the details.

[05:34:53] <dpc> Yeah. I'm trying to eliminate it, because it's getting in a way.
[05:35:28] <dpc> My object is "geometry", and I'm doing geometric operations like "rotate" "transform" etc. Passing it around is ugly.

[17:24:45] <Leo`> all my patterns except the first are seen as unreachable

[17:25:53] <Ms2ger> I think I know this one

[17:26:31] <Leo`> oh yeah I see
[17:26:33] <Leo`> no cmr 
[17:26:43] <Ms2ger> cmr, it'll treat the name as a binding instead, probably
[17:26:44] <Leo`> since the identifier is not known
[17:26:46] <Leo`> it is bind
[17:26:47] <cmr> ohhhh, yeah
[17:26:49] <Leo`> instead of compared
[17:26:51] <Leo`> thx Ms2ger 
[17:26:55] <Leo`> should have though of this
[17:26:56] <cmr> that's annoying

[17:26:59] <Leo`> thought*
[17:27:02] <Leo`> yeah
[17:27:05] <Ms2ger> I've hit it before myself
[17:27:19] <cmr> Leo`: can you open an issue for that and cc @cmr ?
[17:27:28] <Leo`> cmr: what is the issue ?
[17:27:31] <Leo`> I mean
[17:27:33] <Leo`> what should be the right behaviour ?
[17:27:58] <Ms2ger> It could definitely get a better error message :)
[17:27:59] <cmr> Leo`: it should tell you that the pattern is acting as a binding, and suggest a `use` if it finds a variant with that name somewhere in the module tree
[17:29:16] <Leo`> maybe we should import the enum value names at the same time as the enum type name itself
[17:29:22] <Leo`> or do something like C++ enum classes
[17:29:34] <Leo`> where value name are in the namespace of the enum type
[17:29:39] <Leo`> Enum::Value
[17:29:49] <cmr> `enum mod` has been suggested countless times
[17:29:58] <Ms2ger> That's annoyingly verbose, though, IMO
[17:30:08] <cmr> Ms2ger: it lets you glob import the variants
[17:30:18] <cmr> rather than `use path::to::mod::{V1, V2, .............}`
[17:31:09] <kimundi> I've also run into that issue ages ago. It's one of at least ten weird special failure cases that can happen in a pattern match :P
[17:31:15] <Ms2ger> cmr, Enum::Value, I meant :)
[17:31:56] <Ms2ger> Otoh, maybe then we'd make the values shorter...

[18:16:23] <kimundi> Not really, sadly :( As much as we'd want it otherwise, windows is currently a kinda broken second-tier platform, at least what setting up the build environment is concerned
[18:18:06] <kimundi> I can at least tell you that installing ubuntu in a virtual machine gives you a working rust development environment with nightly builds pretty fast, but that doesn't really solve the problem sadly.

[19:54:14] <cmr> due to a limitation of the type system, we can't have impl<T: TotalOrd> Ord for T

[19:55:56] <cmr> it is

[23:46:24] <strcat> ercxx: it uses atomic reference counting so it will be slower than std::rc, if you don't need to share data between tasks
[23:47:27] <strcat> and the mutable versions have to do locking
[23:47:34] <ercxx> are they pretty much the same otherwise?
[23:47:50] <ercxx> Or, does rc replace @?
[23:48:16] <cmr> Rc replaces @
[23:48:27] <strcat> Rc and Arc are pretty much the same, the difference is atomic reference counting
[23:48:35] <ercxx> Thank
[23:48:35] <strcat> RcMut is much different than the mutable versions of arcs
