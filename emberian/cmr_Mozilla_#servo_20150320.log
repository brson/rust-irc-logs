[00:06:49] <gw> njn: depending on the context, using Atom may be relevant (no borrow check issues are you're just copying 64 bit handles to interned strings)
[00:07:06] * njn looks up Atom

[00:08:01] <mbrubeck> hmm, docs are pretty sparse, nevermind. :/
[00:08:07] <Manishearth> someones should define a dummy macro in string_cache called atom!() to give it docs
[00:08:25] <Manishearth> njn: we have a bunch of pre-cached strings

[00:21:58] <mbrubeck> If curr_seg_name is allocated in this function, then it's going to be deallocated when the function returns

[00:35:14] <njn> mbrubeck: how can I get a &[&str] from a Vec<String>?
[00:35:59] <njn> map, maybe?
[00:36:01] <mbrubeck> njn: You'd need to do something like vec.iter().map(|x| x)
[00:36:25] <mbrubeck> and then collect the results into a Vec, and then borrow a slice of that.
[00:37:04] <njn> thus effectively copying the vec, which I'm trying to avoid
[00:38:16] <cmr> njn: String and &str have different sizes, so you can't slice the Vec.
[00:38:39] <cmr> The usual workaround is to make whatever you're doing consume an Iterator<&str>, so you don't need to collect
[00:39:42] <mbrubeck> njn: working example: http://is.gd/uE789V
[00:39:43] <cmr> Or, make it a &[T] where T: Str
[00:40:00] <cmr> and it can do as_str() or whatever it's called these days as necessary.
[00:40:08] <mbrubeck> njn: Another option is to make things consume Cow<str>, which can be either &str or String
[00:40:21] <mbrubeck> if you need both in the same vector, e.g.

[00:48:46] <kmc> what do y'all think of this approach for abstract reftests? http://jsfiddle.net/34o8qowd/
[00:49:12] <kmc> if we inject this JS in the same page at the same viewport size in Servo and Webkit (thinking PhantomJS) or Gecko, will the results be comparable?
[00:49:30] <kmc> we can do fuzzy matching pretty easily
[00:49:48] <kmc> we can track our mean squared error as a metric :P
[00:50:17] <mbrubeck> kmc: I like it!
[00:52:02] <mbrubeck> kmc: It's weaker than reftest at catching some graphics bugs, but it can also catch e.g. tree construction bugs that pixel-based reftest wouldn't.
[00:52:10] <mbrubeck> since you get both the geometry and the structure
[00:52:21] <kmc> yeah. it basically targets layout bugs and not painting bugs
[00:52:33] <kmc> I want to build an automated layout test case reducer using this
[00:53:02] <kmc> then we can spider the web and harvest layout bugs

[00:54:58] <kmc> yep :)
[00:55:11] <Manishearth> kmc: see-reduce?
[00:55:12] <kmc> and the servo tech demo we release this year can have a "This page looks wrong" button
[00:55:26] <kmc> Manishearth: I like it ^_^
[00:56:14] <kmc> if we get a bug report and the reftest doesn't find anything, that's useful information too

[03:41:48] <jdm> kmc: we do not
[03:42:22] <jdm> kmc: it would be worth creating a general "inject these JS files in order into every page load" mechanism for servo
[03:42:32] <jdm> figuring out the right time and place in which to do so is interesting
[03:42:51] <mwu> jdm: btw, do you know if anyone is working on a sm upgrade right now?
[03:42:58] <jdm> perhaps right before dispatching the load event
[03:43:19] <jdm> mwu: "anyone" is me, and the answer is no-ish
[03:43:24] <jdm> mwu: why do you ask?
[03:43:42] <mwu> jdm: oh, I might try it
[03:43:51] <jdm> mwu: #4338 is the series of remaining steps
[03:43:51] <crowbot1> Issue #4338: Upgrade SpiderMonkey - https://github.com/servo/servo/issues/4338
[03:43:57] <mwu> yup, saw it
[03:44:18] <jdm> the rebase is going to be a slog
[03:44:20] <jdm> this is known

[03:45:03] <jdm> I'm planning to tackle the upgrade as a Q2 goal, but if you want to coordinate that would be swell
[03:45:24] <mwu> cool
[03:46:02] <mwu> I'll have to read a bunch of code to learn what i need to learn, but if I really dig into it I'll let you know

[10:32:37] <gfxmonk> Hello folks. I'm new to servo, working on my first PR. I think I've done what my reviewer (@Ms2ger) instructed, but not 100% sure.
[10:32:45] <gfxmonk> Should I discuss it here with a gist or something, or is it normal to just keep pushing commits to a PR as part of the back & forth?
[10:32:55] * Ms2ger wanders in
[10:33:12] <Ms2ger> Just pushing is fine with me
[10:33:24] <gfxmonk> cool :)
[10:34:02] <SimonSapin> gfxmonk: pushing new commits on the same branch makes them show up in the review tool
[10:35:15] <barosl> SimonSapin, Oh, that sounds a good feature to be added to Homu

[10:43:49] *** Joins: canhtak (canhtak@moz-kcs.u0t.149.5.IP)
[10:44:44] <SimonSapin> barosl: it also helps splitting up the review between reviewers
[10:44:49] <gfxmonk> @Ms2ger thanks. I presume the commit messages don't need to be terribly descriptive for nit fixes, since it'll be squashed before merge?
[10:45:18] *** Quits: canhtak (canhtak@moz-kcs.u0t.149.5.IP) (Client exited)
[10:45:19] <barosl> Yeah... So in Rust, when we r+ a PR, all the changes are assumed to be "reviewed", so if the author adds more commits, the diffed results will be considered "not reviewed"
[10:45:41] <SimonSapin> gfxmonk: If you use `git commit --fixup <hash of some earlier commit>` it picks a commit message for you that makes squashing easier with `git rebase -i --autosquash`
[10:45:52] <barosl> I'm not sure if this helps the reviewers, but it's worth trying
[10:45:53] <Manishearth> barosl: bors shows the number of commentsand the latest comment
[10:45:58] <SimonSapin> autosquash will automatically default for "fixup" instead of "pick"
[10:46:01] <Manishearth> we could do tht on homu
[10:46:03] <Manishearth> *that
[10:46:09] <Manishearth> would beuseful for Rust at least
[10:46:21] <Manishearth> easier to find stuff to review
[10:46:22] <barosl> Manishearth, Yeah, but what I'm thinking of is displaying the diff itself (using the Web interface)
[10:47:02] <gfxmonk> SimonSapin: Thanks, I think it's too late for this PR (already pushed 2 commits that should be squashed), but I'll keep it in mind next time.

[10:48:55] <SimonSapin> how is it ambiguous?

[10:49:28] <barosl> More than the originally planned feature set
[10:49:56] <barosl> But it seems that the Rust people find them useful, so...

[10:53:35] <SimonSapin> fwiw we’d like to switch to homu for Servo, but I think that’s orthogonal to Critic v.s. other review tools

[10:54:09] <barosl> Ah, that's definitely a concern
[10:54:19] <SimonSapin> how so?
[10:54:34] <barosl> Having two similar features at a time
[10:54:51] <barosl> Of course Homu's would be inferior!
[10:55:38] <SimonSapin> Critic by itself is great, but GitHub integration was bolted on later and is a bit fragile
[10:55:56] <SimonSapin> especially because it can not decide to reject a push
[10:56:06] *** Joins: jviereck (Adium@moz-pqri8u.dclient.hispeed.ch)

[10:58:52] <barosl> Of course the CI conept Rust is using limits the pushes against the master branch, but I believe review tools like Critic work on a PR not on a specific branch, right?

[11:08:31] <Ms2ger> gfxmonk, yep
[11:09:58] <Ms2ger> barosl, the issue is with force-pushing
[11:10:15] <Ms2ger> barosl, in the original setting, critic could reject force-pushes, because it owned the git repo
[11:10:37] <barosl> Rejecting force-pushes to the master branch?
[11:10:57] <Ms2ger> No, the feature branch
[11:11:19] <barosl> Uhm, but isn't the feature branch owned by the individual authors? How can Critic reject such pushes?
[11:11:24] *** Quits: caitp (caitp@moz-lmogh4.cable.rogers.com) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[11:11:26] <Ms2ger> On github, it can't
[11:11:30] <barosl> A-ha
[11:11:33] <barosl> That makes sense
[11:11:52] <barosl> So Critic was originally used on something like... uhm, self-hosted Git?
[11:11:57] <Ms2ger> Yeah, at Opera
[11:12:01] <barosl> I see
[11:12:05] <SimonSapin> barosl: Critic was designed to own the repository you push to for review, and needs special handling of rebase
[11:12:26] <barosl> That sounds complicated! I wonder how they implemented it
[11:12:37] <Ms2ger> It's all open-source :)
[11:12:45] <Ms2ger> gfxmonk, looking great, you can squash now
[11:14:50] <Ms2ger> barosl, have you had time to look at the rebase-rather-than-merge idea?
[11:15:22] <barosl> Ah, not yet. Sorry! It definitely is in mind, but I haven't had time for it yet
[11:15:30] <gfxmonk> lol @ the seal of approval :)

[16:27:01] <Savago> SimonSapin: ping? It is about the idea of adding a new CSS property in servo.
[16:27:11] <SimonSapin> Savago: yes
[16:27:17] <Savago> I got something to work, but I’m unsure if that is the right way of doing things: https://github.com/Adenilson/servo/commit/efa86a0c7cdc4f2f80aef46d16dfbe228c946f43
[16:27:47] <SimonSapin> Savago: yeah, I saw that and it looks right
[16:27:50] <Savago> So the property is -test-milkshake-flavor and can only have 3 values { chocolate, banana, strawberr }
[16:27:59] <Savago> berr/y
[16:28:03] <SimonSapin> You asked about the initial value. For ${single_keyword(…)}, it’s the first keyword
[16:28:29] <Savago> So, chocolate is the default flavor?
[16:28:43] <SimonSapin> yes

[16:35:58] <Savago> Coolio. I feel it might be interesting to also describe properties that touches gfx/ code (e.g. like the Blur filter). Maybe in a second section on the article?
[16:36:28] <Savago> SimonSapin: and maybe describe media queries too?
[16:37:04] <SimonSapin> I think it’s fairly orthogonal: the style system provides a computed value for every property for every element, what happens after that is entirely the concern of the rest of the engine
[16:37:40] <SimonSapin> Adding a new MQ is much less common than adding a new property. Also it’s being rewritten completely https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5265

[18:12:46] <Manishearth> ah
[18:13:34] <larsberg> Ms2ger: I think we should chat with aturon about what the status of ''Deadlines" is; we may have to plan to build our own if it's not a priority.
[18:14:06] <larsberg> Last I heard there were some issues related to the design of timers in the stdlib in a way that worked across platforms (i.e., also on Windows), which has been a serious feature complication in the past.
[18:15:42] <aturon> larsberg: Ms2ger: aturon here
[18:16:00] <aturon> we plan to get relative-time-based timeouts on sockets + condvars in the 1.0-ish timeframe
[18:16:11] <SimonSapin> aturon: what’s wrong with durations?
[18:16:16] <Manishearth> larsberg: btw, is pushing Windows a good Q2 goal, or is that something that's iffy and not what we really want now
[18:16:46] <aturon> SimonSapin: the Duration type has received a few complaints --
[18:16:49] <larsberg> Manishearth: Probably not, given all the other stuff on our proposed Q2 plate. I think the e-mail thread on dev-servo is already about 400% overbooked :-)
[18:17:11] <aturon> SimonSapin: it allows negative durations, the method names are pretty verbose, and it doesn't interop extremely well with timespec

[18:18:02] <aturon> SimonSapin: (basically, his thinking is that you want separate notions of duration-like types for (1) things like timeouts or benchmark measurements and (2) periods that integrate with calendar arithmetic)

[18:18:47] <aturon> Ms2ger: do socket timeouts (via sockopt) cover your needs?
[18:19:18] <Ms2ger> Dunno
[18:19:51] <larsberg> Ms2ger: I assume we'd have to ask jdm, since he wrote most of the devtools stuff?

[19:04:07] <SimonSapin> pcwalton: also, if other browsers have had bugs not being fixed all these years… maybe it’s a rare enough case that nobody cares?
[19:04:14] <pcwalton> indeed :)
[19:04:58] <pcwalton> regarding the corners, what WeasyPrint and WebKit do is that they sort the display items so that borders that "stand out" more (according to the spec definition) are painted on top of borders that stand out less
[19:05:06] <pcwalton> this works except when you have alpha or dashing/dotting
[19:05:15] <pcwalton> or transparent border-image I guess
[19:05:26] <SimonSapin> I can easily imagine this kind of thing being an enormous time sink :)
[19:05:38] <pcwalton> yes, that's one of the reasons I'm not doing it now

[19:05:48] *** Joins: {-}grant ({0}grant@moz-63ubas.in.charter.com)
[19:06:00] <SimonSapin> Ms2ger: kill it
[19:06:05] <pcwalton> what Gecko does is to clip the corners out and apply the override rules in the spec to determine which corner wins by comparing diagonals
[19:06:20] <pcwalton> this looks better but doubles the amount of override checks you have to do
[19:06:29] <pcwalton> and also makes your clipping regions more complex which makes painting slower
[19:06:51] <pcwalton> I am currently doing nothing, because the spec doesn't say what to do
[19:07:08] <SimonSapin> I think that’s fine
[19:07:18] <pcwalton> it looks ugly in some cases but we can discuss what to do
[19:07:22] <kmc> cgaebel: I'm thinking about extracting some of your zero-copy work as a UTF-8 rope library backed by ROIobuf
[19:07:24] <pcwalton> anyway this patch has gotten over 2,000 LOC already
[19:07:41] <pcwalton> and my inclination is to decide what to do in a followup
[19:07:48] <kmc> does that seem sane? do you know of anything already like that?
[19:09:21] <SimonSapin> Macros… macros everywhere…

[20:50:26] <pcwalton> but it's getting close, hopefully I can get it in over the weekend!
[20:50:52] <pcwalton> then it's just transitions for the magic "all standard properties used by >=50% of Web sites" mark

[20:54:38] <pcwalton> though that thing is pretty old and might just be busted
[20:55:25] <pcwalton> request for tool: something that processes the output of -Z dump-display-list and creates a matching HTML/CSS document that should render exactly the same (using abs pos)
[20:55:32] <pcwalton> it'd be nice for quickly creating reftests
[20:55:38] <gw> jack: since the transforms landed we have a lot more stacking contexts (at least on the pages I test with), and I think there are some remaining bounds issues with stacking contexts. might be related

[21:18:03] <jack> Is it expected we reflow 3x per image?
[21:18:10] <Ms2ger> Manishearth, okay if I finish #5271?
[21:18:10] <crowbot> Issue #5271: unsafe_blocks -> unsafe_code - https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5271
[21:20:23] <gw> jack: ReceivedReflow also seems to force a non-incremental layout? :|
[21:20:38] <jack> That is the bug that pcwalton supposedly fixed right?
[21:21:03] <gw> oh maybe, I am on a slightly old branch
[21:21:08] <pcwalton> jack: DL optimization should optimize out a lot of the solid colors
[21:21:23] <pcwalton> I had a patch that stopped painting them if they were transparent though
[21:21:26] <pcwalton> I forget if that ladned
[21:21:28] <pcwalton> landed*
[21:23:39] <gw> jack: it does look like every time the image cache is asked for an image, it forces a reflow, even if the image state is still not ready, if I'm reading the code right. we should add image cache task to q2 perf tasks
[21:23:51] * jack tries to trim this down to a two slide test case
[21:23:58] <pcwalton> the image cache task really needs a rewrite
[21:24:01] <pcwalton> it's *very* old
[21:24:10] <pcwalton> has a lot of workarounds for ancient Rust limitations
[21:24:49] <gw> yea, could cut down a lot on the threads it spawns too

[21:28:51] <jack> tomaka: ping
[21:31:43] <pcwalton> I just ran across an instance of the same bug
[21:31:51] <pcwalton> seems to be stacking context related
[21:31:56] <pcwalton> probably the bounds of the stacking context are wrong
[21:32:19] <gw> pcwalton: probably an issue with global vs. stacking context relative space
[21:32:25] <pcwalton> ah, quite possibly
[21:32:45] <gw> pcwalton: theres a lot more stacking contexts being created since transforms landed in the pages I tested
[21:32:56] <pcwalton> that in itself may be a bug
[21:33:14] <pcwalton> it looks like it created a stacking context just because my table was absolutely positioned
[21:33:16] <pcwalton> which is wrong
[21:33:53] <gw> jack: I should have some time to work on glutin issues next week if you want to send me some particular bugs to look at
[21:34:55] <gw> pcwalton: I also found that a lot of css libs (like fontawesome) explicitly set transform (0,0) on things like each icon font class, which creates stacking contexts there too
[21:35:04] <pcwalton> ah, that is actually correct then
[21:35:11] <pcwalton> it's just that our handling of stacking contexts is wrong :)
[21:35:24] <gw> yes :)
[21:35:27] <pcwalton> lots of stacking contexts are actually good for perf because we can incrementally build display lists for them
[21:35:34] <pcwalton> … once we start doing that, of course

[21:38:29] <Ms2ger> larsberg, looks like mac builds got pretty asymmetric again (44 vs 27 minutes); can we try (tidy, ref, unit) and (content, wpt, cef)?
[21:38:30] <tomaka> You mean that servo is blocked by wait_events, so it doesn't draw on the window?
[21:39:27] <gw> tomaka: jack: I guess there is some x11 event for switching desktops that glutin could detect and send a refresh event?
[21:39:31] <tomaka> I'm not too familiar with x11, but win32 can trigger paint events in order to ask the application to redraw on the window
[21:39:41] <tomaka> I guess it's similar with x11
[21:40:05] <jack> Is there a way to see what events we're getting from X11?
[21:40:27] <tomaka> No, you only get the events that you ask for
[21:40:30] <tomaka> you need to specify a filter
[21:40:59] <jack> ah, so perhaps we are just missing one and filtering it out
[21:41:13] <gw> jack: tomaka: relevant? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3602805/xlib-event-when-window-is-moved-from-one-workspace-to-another
[21:44:29] <jack> Close. This isn't moving the window but changing the desktop that is on my screen.
[21:44:42] <jack> Servo is on #2 and if I swap to #1 and then back to #2, servo isn't redrawn.
