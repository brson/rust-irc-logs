[03:26:09] <eddyb> dammit I knew I should've tested this a longer time ago
[03:26:22] <eddyb> running the exact same command from the console works just fine

[03:27:47] <WindowsBunny> eddyb: The method Rust uses to panic isn't very nice in my opinion

[03:31:47] <WindowsBunny> eddyb: Oh, that's a fun error
[03:32:08] <eddyb> the way Rust is starting the process is fucking with it
[03:32:24] <WindowsBunny> eddyb: Are you using rustc to build a binary?
[03:32:29] <eddyb> yes
[03:32:33] <WindowsBunny> eddyb: Can you do rustc -V fine?
[03:32:47] <WindowsBunny> Because if its just building a library/binary, then it could be the linker it invokes
[03:33:09] <eddyb> rustc from cmd.exe works btw, you want me to make my thing use -V instead?
[03:33:37] <WindowsBunny> I want to know if having your thing invoke rustc without actually building anything runs fine

[09:06:16] <fmtq> :|
[09:07:07] <barosl> That's acceptable, I already did write bunch of them in C!
[09:08:36] <WindowsBunny> & is okay
[09:08:43] <fmtq> I do not approve of C
[09:08:47] <WindowsBunny> everyone from C++ knows how to use & and *

[09:11:13] <fmtq> $fuck
[09:11:36] <barosl> But in general Rust favors move to copy, so it implies *less* cost, no?
[09:11:58] <WindowsBunny> a move is a copy where the original is destroyed

[09:21:04] <fmtq> why does mut need sigils at all 
[09:21:06] <fmtq> I do not understand 
[09:21:20] <barosl> Wait...
[09:21:21] <bstrie> &foo and &mut foo are drastically different in semantic terms
[09:21:31] <barosl> Do we have a notion for *immutable move*?
[09:21:36] <bstrie> no
[09:21:58] * barosl thinks if it is needed
[09:22:00] <bstrie> mutability is determined by the owner
[09:22:29] <barosl> So after the ownership transfer, mutability loses meaning?
[09:22:46] <barosl> That's... well
[09:22:55] <bstrie> no, it just means that the new owner can do whatever it wants
[09:23:04] <bstrie> the new owner determines its own mutability
[09:23:04] <fmtq> (yes)
[09:23:30] <bstrie> if you don't want someone mutating something of yours, you need to retain ownership
[09:23:48] <bstrie> it's like, you can't sell a notebook to your friend but then be like, don't write in this notebook
[09:23:54] <barosl> Ah, I can prepend `mut` to the name of the parameter
[09:23:57] <bstrie> it's your friend's notebook, they do what they please
[09:24:00] <fmtq> bstrie: DRM
[09:24:15] <fmtq> you can sell a tractor and claim that the farmer doesn't own it because there's software on it

[09:24:27] <fmtq> top lel
[09:24:33] <bstrie> fmtq: then you're not selling, you're taking an immutable reference :3
[09:24:43] <bstrie> ownership is ownership, you don't own DRM's things
[09:24:47] <bstrie> that's the whole point
[09:24:55] <bstrie> you don't own those songs that you download
[09:25:04] <fmtq> I own the songs I download, trust me 
[09:25:05] <fmtq> ;) 
[09:25:10] <bstrie> then you can mutate them
[09:25:13] <bstrie> feels good don't it
[09:25:16] <fmtq> YES 
[09:25:31] <fmtq> haha we should discuss human culture terms in programming language ownership concepts

[11:41:12] <bluss> cool
[11:41:35] <ChrisMorgan> Fits well with how things like HashMap.insert(T) -> Option<T> work.
[11:41:49] <barosl> Yup, that reminds me of such APIs
[11:41:58] <bluss> and fits move semantics
[11:42:10] <ChrisMorgan> bluss: … which is, of course, why things like HashMap.insert do it.
[11:42:33] <huon> doesn't fit quite so well with, e.g. `let a; a = 3;` (and even worse with conditional uninitialisation)
[11:42:45] <ChrisMorgan> The only problem situation is where you have an unintialised, or potentially uninitialised, value. In such cases I guess you’d just forbid it. Easy enough.
[11:42:56] <huon> forbid... what?
[11:42:56] <huon> =
[11:42:57] <huon> ?
[11:43:13] <cmr> you'd just make the return type unit I'd think

[11:43:41] <huon> right.
[11:43:54] <ChrisMorgan> huon: we already say “you can’t use `x`, it might not be initialised”, so we’d just be adding a new rule “you can’t use `x = y`, x might not be initialised”.

[11:45:15] <bluss> let x = y; and x = y are different in Rust too, does Pony use `let`?
[11:46:28] <ChrisMorgan> Rust deliberately distinguishes between declaration and assignment. Partly for grammatical reasons, for the LHS of `let` is a pattern, while the LHS of assignment couldn’t be a pattern.
[11:47:06] <barosl> bluss, It uses a let/var dichotomy, much like Nim

[12:48:34] <Mutabah> Have fun guys!
[12:48:55] <Hannibal_Smith> I remember me some "newbies" Erlang dev who said that Erlang code is high performance...because there aren't any lock
[12:49:06] <Mutabah> (this coming from someone who has just written code that almost needed race annotations each line
[12:49:31] <Hannibal_Smith> They seems like to belive that an actual computer can run an Erlang vm in some magical mode

[12:56:37] <Hannibal_Smith> Seems like the only interesting feature
[12:57:57] <bstrie> naively I expect that it's aiming for erlang's niche

[14:01:01] <mrmonday> iirc, in D, you can use try {} to ignore an exception, no need for catch
[14:01:04] <barosl> Program output:
[14:01:04] <barosl> 0
[14:01:05] <barosl> ?!
[14:01:06] <Tiffany> its exception system is like checked exceptions in java
[14:01:13] <mrmonday> ugh :(
[14:01:16] <Tiffany> you either have to handle it immediately, or mark your function as throwing an exception
[14:01:20] <barosl> Tiffany, It silently prints 0
[14:01:32] <mrmonday> you'd think with it being a research language they'd have read the research about how terrible checked exceptions are? :>
[14:01:38] <barosl> Something is alarming in my mind!
[14:02:39] <barosl> <anon>:2:1: 2:4 error: attempted to divide by zero in a constant expression [E0020]
[14:02:46] <Tiffany> also, there's only one type of exception
[14:02:47] <barosl> Oh, Rust has a interesting compile time error
[14:02:55] <Tiffany> there's no IntegerOverflowException
[14:02:56] <Tiffany> just "error"
[14:03:17] <Tiffany> I'm not sure you can make an exception system much worse than this
[14:04:14] <barosl> mrmonday, Wouldn't deadlock be able to be statically detected? By using dependent type or whatever? I'm entirely ignorant to Pony, but it could also use similar strategy
[14:04:38] <barosl> Although "because no lock" is a silly thing to claim

[14:04:44] *** ChanServ sets mode: +o erickt
[14:05:40] <mrmonday> barosl: yeah, you can statically detect them using session types
[14:06:19] <mrmonday> which was my follow up question
[14:07:25] <mrmonday> I can't find any mention of session types in their paper though
[14:08:00] <mrmonday> and to the best of my knowledge, they can't statically guarantee deadlock freedom without them, unless, as Tiffany suggests, they're using a very specific meaning for deadlock
[14:08:17] <mrmonday> s/paper/papers/
[14:08:59] <Tiffany> would it actually be possible for rust to sanely recover from an OOM condition?
[14:09:00] <barosl> Regarding the sloppiness of handling division by zero in Pony, I highly suspect the latter is the case...
[14:09:20] <Tiffany> how likely is it that code will be doing allocations while the stack is unwinding?
[14:09:47] <cmr> Tiffany: what does "sanely recover" mean though?
[14:09:53] <Tiffany> it seems like one of your unlucky tasks would be minding its own business and then bam it OOMs and unwinds, and that frees up memory for other tasks to continue
[14:10:02] <Tiffany> presumably the other tasks would detect the failure and try to do something about it
[14:10:05] <cmr> ok.
[14:10:08] <Tiffany> which, honestly, would probably just cause more OOM
[14:12:36] <Tiffany> but yeah, the kind of guarantees this language makes
[14:12:51] <Tiffany> I would only trust a language like idris to actually be able to back them up
[14:13:07] <Tiffany> being able to statically reason about things like deadlocks, resource usage, etc

[15:02:47] <barosl> Hmm, what for?
[15:03:06] <barosl> Oh, not composing each slice into a char
[15:03:14] <barosl> I can see the rationale
[15:03:27] <bluss> you can filter on slices and then glue slices back together
[15:03:34] <bluss> the ones that are still adjacent
[15:05:02] <barosl> I found that Swift's String type is very rigid
[15:06:17] <barosl> It does not reveal any low-level detail, works perfectly by a grapheme cluster
[15:06:48] <barosl> Their Character type is actually a slice
[15:07:14] <barosl> I think this design could reduce programmers' mistakes by a huge margin
[15:10:30] <barosl> String/Character equality is also based on the canonical form of the grapheme cluster... Very nice

[16:39:42] <barosl> A few complaints were...
[16:39:45] <cmr> terpstra: I don't personally find nim very interesting.
[16:40:06] <barosl> 1) There's an implicit "result" variable, which stores a return value, and that has a default value of 0
[16:40:58] <barosl> So e.g. if you code like:
[16:41:12] <barosl>     if a < 0: result = 123
[16:41:18] <barosl>     elif a == 0: result = 456
[16:41:25] <barosl>     else: pass
[16:41:33] <barosl> It will silently return 0 if a > 0
[16:42:00] <barosl> I find this very, very worrying, but the designers of Nim explicitly said it was a valid feature
[16:42:45] <terpstra> on this blog post comparing the two, the rust version is often 2* longer.
[16:43:03] <terpstra> (this post: https://arthurtw.github.io/2015/01/12/quick-comparison-nim-vs-rust.html)
[16:43:33] <terpstra> (for small values of 2)
[16:44:10] <GaryOak_> barosl: that's a python feature too
[16:44:17] <terpstra> barosl, hmm. that is kind of strange.
[16:44:33] <barosl> GaryOak_, What? Python doesn't have such a thing like `result`
[16:44:37] <barosl> It only has `return`
[16:44:53] <GaryOak_> ahhh my bad I understand now
[16:45:10] <GaryOak_> that is not good, I just made that mistake
[16:46:11] <GaryOak_> I'm sure they will smooth the edges once/if more people start using it
[16:46:20] <terpstra> Nim has GC? ok. not interested any more. i use haskell or ocaml if i don't mind GC.
[16:46:37] <barosl> 2) Nim uses inclusive (closed) range for array slice, so `arr[0..2]` contains three elemeents, by default. But it also had exclusive range syntax, namely `arr[0..<2]`, which should contain two elements
[16:47:02] <barosl> But recently there was a bug found, namely `arr[0..<0]` doesn't work as expected
[16:47:42] <barosl> ...Because arr[0..<0] is converted to arr[0..-1] internally, and -1 indicates the end of the array, yielding all of the elements
[16:47:43] <terpstra> the x..y syntax of rust is actually NOT a good argument, IMO. it's quite unexpected.
[16:47:49] <barosl> So arr[0..<0] == arr[0..-1] == arr
[16:48:15] <terpstra> that is pretty hilarious, though!
[16:48:21] <barosl> I think this is a mild evidence of not carefully thought design
[16:48:47] <terpstra> why didn't they make [x..y] just be a range and step as long as x != y ?
[16:48:54] <terpstra> introducing a -1 seems silly
[16:48:55] <barosl> Dunno
[16:49:41] <barosl> Nevertheless they ended up making the index starting from the end explicit, namely `arr[0..^1]` which has the same meaning as `arr[:-1]` in Python
[16:49:51] <GaryOak_> I feel like python should have solved most of Nim's syntax problems
[16:51:08] <barosl> And there were many more semi-"gotchas" in Nim. They are all not *that* critical, but their existence in a pre-1.0 language is somewhat discouraging
[16:51:25] <terpstra> one thing that sucks about {}s in rust is that the tail of closing } } } } takes a lot of vertical space.
[16:51:38] <Astrum|Lap> barosl: I think it'd be more discouraging if it were a post-1.0 language
[16:51:47] <terpstra> in c++ this is not so obvious, b/c you need more stuff inside your {}s. in rust, though, i've had like 8 in a row
[16:52:54] <barosl> Astrum|Lap, lol Sure, but as I stated above they're not willing to fix subtle things (like the `result` thing), so I think the state of affairs will not change until 1.0 is released
[16:53:05] <terpstra> i only mention this, because in the code comparison of rust vs. nim, i think the rust programs are longer mostly due to closing }s
[16:53:14] <barosl> "Convenience over safety"!
[16:54:24] <Havvy> terpstra:  How long until we call it something-rustic-hell?
[16:54:31] <Havvy> Like there's callback-hell for Node.js
[16:55:05] <terpstra> in their comparison of wordcount, they have 13 closing } lines ... if you didn't have those, the rust version is only 36 lines long -- much closer to the nim 29
[16:55:05] <Tiffany> clearly you should do lisp-style closing
[16:55:08] <Tiffany> }}}}}}}}}}}}
[16:55:28] <terpstra> Tiffany, i hated this about lisp
[16:55:34] <terpstra> ML was such a relief! =D
[16:55:56] <barosl> terpstra, Clearly we should force anyone to ignore } when calculating LoC!
[16:56:16] * Havvy actually finds the `}`s useful.
[16:56:19] <Tiffany> I think sloccount ignores }s
[16:56:20] <terpstra> barosl, hah
[16:56:35] <barosl> I'll send a patch to GitHub!
[16:56:44] <barosl> Oh wait. This will reduce the diff number...
[16:57:00] <Tiffany> http://www.dwheeler.com/sloccount/
[16:57:16] <Tiffany> I guess it doesn't support rust
[16:57:41] <barosl> Is that used by GitHub?
[16:57:45] <bombless> https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2015/04/30/deprecating-non-secure-http/
[16:57:47] <bombless> Wow.
[16:57:49] <terpstra> maybe one could add haskell-style {} insertion to rust. bwaha
[16:57:59] <bombless> I think this is a little bit like the UEFI thing.
[16:58:10] <terpstra> bombless, snowden makes the nsa sad
[16:58:38] <terpstra> bombless, i don't understand the comparison?
[16:59:17] <bombless> terpstra: I think it prevent private use of a website/OS.
[16:59:20] <Tiffany> sloccount ignores about 10% of my C codebase
[16:59:54] <terpstra> bombless, not at all? i have ssl on all my private websites. just get a free cert from startssl.com or something.
[16:59:55] <barosl> bombless, The difference is that most people seem to be favor of deprecating HTTP... Personally I don't want to see it deprecated, even though I always set up my every server to be HTTPS only
[16:59:58] *** Joins: pcwalton (pcwalton@moz-l8ebtf.sfo1.mozilla.com)
[17:00:40] <barosl> terpstra, You can't easily afford a free SSL certificate if you're a company, though
[17:00:56] <terpstra> barosl, can't afford free???
[17:00:58] <barosl> At least for now. I heard Mozilla is trying to change that by establishing automated free CA
[17:01:01] <terpstra> personally, i wish https worked like ssh, though
[17:01:02] <Tiffany> bombless: for one thing, http is just restricted from hairy things, presumably such as webgl
[17:01:06] <Tiffany> not going away entirely
[17:01:09] <terpstra> i think central CA is bullshit
[17:01:10] <bombless> Free SSL certificate doens't sound secure anyway.
[17:01:16] <Tiffany> for another, you can create a self-signed cert and add an exception for it
[17:01:27] <Tiffany> in summer, there's going to be let's encrypt
[17:01:35] <barosl> terpstra, Sorry, I meant s/afford/acquire
[17:01:36] <Tiffany> but yeah
[17:01:55] <barosl> e.g. StartSSL provides a free certificate only for private uses
[17:01:59] <Tiffany> the whole dichotomy between unencrypted unauthenticated connections and authenticated encrypted connections is frustrating
[17:02:05] <terpstra> barosl, oh - i did not realize this
[17:02:20] <Tiffany> making https work like ssh wouldn't work
[17:02:24] <bombless> Hmm but let's try other ways to share data! Maybe through P2P. Just forget about HTTP.
[17:02:41] <Tiffany> ssh relies on there being only a few hosts you actually ssh into, and that you can verify key fingerprints through side channels
[17:02:50] <terpstra> i never understood why the ssh model was not good enough. as an attacker, you are really taking a risk if you try to MITM a handshake. if the clients already knew each other, you've been caught red-handed.
[17:03:02] <Tiffany> but that's the thing
[17:03:10] <Tiffany> have you ever verified the key fingerprint of a website?
[17:03:12] <Tiffany> would you?
[17:03:14] <Tiffany> how would you?
[17:03:24] <terpstra> the ssh model is to record what the key was last time
[17:03:26] <Tiffany> you send an email to the webmaster and hope they reply within a few days?
[17:03:27] <terpstra> and verify its the same
[17:03:34] <terpstra> i don't verify the fingerprint of servers i ssh into either
[17:03:36] <Tiffany> if you're visiting a site for the first time that does not help you
[17:03:44] <XMPPwocky> as we all know, email is an excellent and secure medium
[17:03:51] <terpstra> right, but as i said, if its the first time, a MITM is a big risk for the attacker
[17:03:56] <terpstra> he doesn't know its the first time
[17:04:34] <XMPPwocky> also, if a website reissues their certs or whatever
[17:04:39] <terpstra> and if its a website i've never been to before, i probably also don't care too much about it
[17:04:41] <XMPPwocky> there's huge potential for alert fatigue
[17:04:56] <terpstra> XMPPwocky, the site just signs the new cert with the old
[17:04:56] <XMPPwocky> that happens with ssl too, of course
[17:05:08] <terpstra> then you upgrade the stored key in your local cache
[17:05:11] <terpstra> no alert.
[17:05:16] <XMPPwocky> terpstra: aha, so if your cert gets leaked or heartbleeded or whatever it's impossible to revoke
[17:05:29] <terpstra> XMPPwocky, you can also revoke it when people arrive
[17:05:36] <terpstra> no need for a central revocation liust
[17:05:39] <Tiffany> this is never going to work for normal users
[17:05:56] <XMPPwocky> terpstra: and if i mitm the revocation...
[17:05:57] <terpstra> again, the premise is that the only attack is active traffic manipulating MITM ... and that is risky to get caught
[17:06:04] <Tiffany> they don't understand trust models or anything, they just want to view a website, and will mindlessly click through a yes/no dialog
[17:06:18] <XMPPwocky> ^ which also applies to most ssh connections
[17:06:39] <Tiffany> when I ssh into new hosts I usually make sure the fingerprint is correct, since I'm often talking to its owner over irc
[17:06:51] <terpstra> really? i never check
[17:07:03] <Tiffany> you might as well disable cert checking entirely
[17:07:04] <terpstra> i just assume that anyone who has the balls to MITM would have been caught
[17:07:08] <terpstra> i don't agree
[17:07:20] <terpstra> DH exchange completely covers snooping attacks
[17:07:26] <terpstra> it's only vulnerable to active MITM
[17:07:41] <terpstra> if you record the cert, you are also safe against future MITM
[17:07:57] <XMPPwocky> arp poisoning some wifi hotspot is not exactly difficult or challenging
[17:08:02] <terpstra> and anyone who dares to do active MITM against you will probably get caught 
[17:08:20] <terpstra> b/c most sites are not 1-offs, you've been there before
[17:08:20] <Tiffany> rural ISPs will often MITM all connections to insert advertisements or other things
[17:08:29] <Tiffany> pinning the cert does jack shit in that case
[17:08:31] <terpstra> Tiffany, they don't do this to ssl
[17:08:37] <Tiffany> they would if they could
[17:08:40] <terpstra> but they can't
[17:08:47] <Tiffany> they can't because the current model stops it
[17:08:48] <Tiffany> the ssh model does not
[17:08:50] <terpstra> oh - you mean they will MITM every connection?
[17:09:03] <GaryOak_> just like hotel wifi
[17:09:15] <Tiffany> hotel wifi or transient mitm is vulnerable to key pinning, yes
[17:09:20] <Tiffany> but persistent home connections aren ot
[17:09:42] <GaryOak_> because you are trusting the router at your home
[17:09:44] <terpstra> i'll grant that if you control every connection a device makes since it's "birth" you could MITM forever...
[17:10:05] <Tiffany> that's where authenticated encryption is important
[17:10:12] <terpstra> but, let's face it, SSL certs are not so much better
[17:10:23] <terpstra> it's pretty easy to get a certificate from these free providers
[17:10:32] <terpstra> you just need to snoop their email
[17:10:38] <Tiffany> you have to demonstrate ownership for the free providers
[17:10:47] <terpstra> if you had local cert caches, you'd be immune to this sort of trust breakdown
[17:10:57] <niconii> so, er, not knowing much about this subject, does it have to be an either-or thing? is there no way to get the benefits of both?
[17:11:02] <terpstra> Tiffany, demonstrating ownership = being able to intercept plain-text email
[17:11:09] <terpstra> so i don't even need active MITM to break ssl
[17:11:14] <terpstra> passive snooping is enough
[17:11:17] <Tiffany> some browsers pin keys for important sites like google and twitter, niconii
[17:11:35] <terpstra> niconii, sure - this i agree with
[17:11:35] <Tiffany> where did you get that idea?
[17:11:41] <Tiffany> they don't just email you a private key
[17:11:42] *** Joins: gsingh93 (gulshan@moz-qnbukr.mi.comcast.net)
[17:11:47] <terpstra> Tiffany, they sure do!
[17:11:53] <terpstra> Tiffany, they email you an activation code
[17:11:58] <terpstra> that confirms you control the domain
[17:12:07] <terpstra> and that's the evidence they use to sign the csr you provided
[17:12:15] <Tiffany> still
[17:12:17] <Tiffany> that's highly impractical
[17:12:27] <Tiffany> snooping home connections is way easier than snooping datacenter to datacenter links
[17:12:29] <terpstra> if i can read the email they sent to hostmaster@yourdomain.com IN PLAINTEXT --- i can break ssl
[17:12:34] <terpstra> are you kidding me?
[17:12:41] <Tiffany> you might as well just break into the server and put your content there
[17:12:49] <Tiffany> unless you're the nsa
[17:12:53] <terpstra> if it weren't illegal, i'd demonstrate how easy it is to get a bogus cert for a popular site
[17:13:08] <terpstra> not a BIG NAME site like google
[17:13:16] <Tiffany> alright, what is this magical method you have of snooping such connections?
[17:13:44] <terpstra> we're assuming i am doing a targetted attack on some company, yeah?
[17:14:13] <terpstra> so all i need to do is get pseudo-real-time access (4 hours latency is ok) to a mail box
[17:14:23] <terpstra> there's the usual usb sticks near the front-door approach
[17:14:32] <terpstra> there's just listening to the corporate wifi
[17:14:39] <terpstra> there's good old social engineering
[17:14:51] <terpstra> maybe a targetted phishing email or two
[17:14:56] <terpstra> i just need to see one email!
[17:14:58] <Tiffany> I don't know about other providers
[17:15:01] <Tiffany> but you don't need any old email
[17:15:04] <Tiffany> it has to be webmaster or postmaster
[17:15:11] <Tiffany> for startssl
[17:15:12] <terpstra> {host,post,web}master, yeah
[17:15:30] <Tiffany> seriously
[17:15:36] <Tiffany> going this far, you might as well just break into their own servers
[17:15:39] <Tiffany> you'd get further
[17:16:00] <terpstra> my point is: you are worried about an attack that is an active MITM
[17:16:08] <terpstra> you can break ssl with just a passive MITM
[17:16:13] <terpstra> between a CA and the target website
[17:16:24] <terpstra> i'll grant that the end-users connection is likely less secure anyway
[17:16:26] <Tiffany> it's a pretty impractical attack to carry out
[17:16:33] <terpstra> the nsa could do it easily
[17:16:40] <Tiffany> the nsa could do whatever they want easily
[17:16:48] <terpstra> they could not break the ssh model easily
[17:16:49] <Tiffany> they could walk right up to semantec and tell them to open their private key vault
[17:16:56] <terpstra> the ssh model is immune to the nsa
[17:17:04] <Tiffany> hand over a national security letter
[17:17:10] <terpstra> the nsa would not risk an active MITM b/c they could be easily caught
[17:17:21] <Tiffany> the nsa does risk active MITM on targets they care about
[17:17:27] <terpstra> (in the case the two parties had already met, unbeknownst to the nsa)
[17:17:43] <Tiffany> usually with devices like compromised routers
[17:17:54] <terpstra> the nsa does not want the target to realize they are being surveilled
[17:17:59] <XMPPwocky> and stuff like quantum insert would work just as well
[17:18:20] <Tiffany> key pinning really isn't a magical solution
[17:18:27] <Tiffany> what do you do if you want certificate revocation?
[17:18:29] <terpstra> i didn't claim it's a magical solution
[17:18:33] <terpstra> i just said it's better than the CA model
[17:18:35] <Tiffany> you just expect users to click through a scary error?
[17:18:55] <terpstra> click through a scary error?
[17:19:07] <terpstra> a revocation is signed by the key that is being revoked...
[17:19:29] <terpstra> there's no scary error. the client sees: signed(new key, and revoke this key)
[17:20:01] <terpstra> and ultimately niconii is right -- you should do both
[17:20:01] <XMPPwocky> terpstra: for the threat model where your attacker is unable to compromise the servers or do any sort of active MITM or anything like that, maybe
[17:20:33] <terpstra> key pinning should be the basis of your trust. the CA is some sort of fallback if you meet a site for the very first time.
[17:20:54] <XMPPwocky> butt this opens things up to just small-scale cybercriminals at coffee shops or whatever MITMing things
[17:20:56] <Tiffany> that is more reasonable
[17:21:20] <Tiffany> my preference would be to build a decentralised dns service which maps domain names to both IP addresses and keys
[17:21:47] <XMPPwocky> like dnssec but not terrible?
[17:21:55] <Tiffany> you could use the existing dns service, but then you move the trust from the CAs to the DNS servers

[17:27:07] <Tiffany> well, that's what namecoin uses
[17:27:12] <Tiffany> I don't know about blockchain
[17:27:16] <Tiffany> maybe using stellar
[17:27:28] <Tiffany> a blockchain would get unreasonably large
[17:27:57] <Tiffany> and would also necessitate mining coins to buy domains with
[17:28:02] <Tiffany> which is a waste of resources
[17:28:03] <XMPPwocky> i think something like a POS would work much better
[17:28:43] <Tiffany> there's a huge number of domains, and every time someone registers a new one, or updates their records, it permanently makes the blockchain larger
[17:28:51] <Tiffany> and every single client must have a complete copy of the blockchain
[17:29:17] <XMPPwocky> you can design things so you only need to keep headers
[17:29:31] <Tiffany> bitcoin's complete blockchain is something like 30 gigabytes, but most clients do something which makes it so they store less
[17:29:52] <Tiffany> the last time I used litecoin, its blockchain was 3 gigabytes
[17:30:09] <Tiffany> with stellar, it's optional for a node to keep a ledger of past transactions
[17:30:18] <Tiffany> in fact, it's optional for a node to even have a complete copy of the current state
[17:30:23] <GaryOak_> oooo stellar!
[17:30:40] <XMPPwocky> interesting
[17:30:42] <Tiffany> even better, the ledger isn't "live"
[17:30:51] <Tiffany> it could be stored on amazon glacier and only used when something horribly wrong happens
[17:31:09] <GaryOak_> doesn't the system take a consensus on the transaction before it goes through?
[17:31:16] <Tiffany> yeah
[17:31:28] <Tiffany> however, only a subset of nodes need to actually make a consensus
[17:31:35] <XMPPwocky> Tiffany: a trusted subset?
[17:31:40] <Tiffany> yeah
[17:31:53] <GaryOak_> I was reading the paper, but it's been a while
[17:31:57] <Tiffany> each node has nodes it trusts, and the intersection of all those nodes is the quorum that needs to reach consensus
[17:32:16] <Tiffany> it's not a perfect intersection though
[17:32:36] <XMPPwocky> Tiffany: how does it protect against sybil attacks
[17:32:44] <Tiffany> by choosing your trusted nodes
[17:32:46] <Tiffany> don't trust sybils
[17:33:03] <XMPPwocky> how do you know which is which?
[17:33:11] <Tiffany> by arrangement
[17:33:14] <Tiffany> for example
[17:33:20] <Tiffany> say this becomes a global standard for currency exchange
[17:33:27] <GaryOak_> because of the federated nature if a node is a sybil it doesn't cause the whole system to break
[17:33:32] <Tiffany> your trusted nodes would probably be financial institutions such as visa
[17:33:57] <Tiffany> you need to have at least two, I think
[17:34:00] <Tiffany> and more is better
[17:34:15] <XMPPwocky> Tiffany: ah, but you could also choose whatever node you want?
[17:34:19] <Tiffany> yeah
[17:34:35] <Tiffany> you want to choose the ones which are the most trustworthy
[17:34:48] <GaryOak_> It's like tiers of trust, credit card companies, to banks, to venders, to individuals 
[17:35:04] <Tiffany> large institutions are heavily regulated, which makes them somewhat trustable
[17:35:31] <Tiffany> your local bank is already trusted, so you might add them too, yeah

[17:49:38] <Tiffany> I suppose stellar is sort of close to this "Open-Transactions"?
[17:49:49] <Tiffany> people were talking about how stellar is based on ripple
[17:49:53] <Tiffany> I don't know anything about ripple
[17:50:04] <Tiffany> I don't think graydon worked on ripple
[17:50:28] <GaryOak_> Everyone is out to break the financial industry, but bitcoin got in first
[17:50:43] <fmtq> bitcoin is useful 
[17:50:53] <Tiffany> bitcoin did spark interest
[17:50:55] <fmtq> that's my whole story 
[17:51:07] <eddyb> burntsushi isn't here :/
[17:51:15] <Tiffany> it was rather instrumental in kickstarting the popularity of cryptocurrency
[17:51:18] <fmtq> it remains useful and likely always will, or whatever replaces it
[17:51:28] <fmtq> it being "the edge of controllable decentralised value storage" 
[17:51:35] <fmtq> there is value in that 
[17:51:56] <Tiffany> there's two things I found kind of interesting
[17:51:56] <XMPPwocky> except it's not very good at actually storing that value :P
[17:52:03] <Tiffany> there's freicoin, which is neither inflationary nor deflationary
[17:52:14] <eddyb> I was supposed to ask something
[17:52:18] <Tiffany> there's ethereum, which is trying to do digital contracts better than bitcoin ever could
[17:52:26] <fmtq> XMPPwocky: value in the sense of data.
[17:52:28] <Tiffany> they're both based on blockchains
[17:52:30] <XMPPwocky> ah
[17:52:35] <fmtq> yes, ethereum could replace bitcoin easily.
[17:52:40] <fmtq> particularly if bitcoin dumps 
[17:52:45] <fmtq> like returns to 2009 values
[17:52:49] <Tiffany> ethereum is still mined, which is meh
[17:52:50] <fmtq> (this time I mean USD) 
[17:53:08] <fmtq> Tiffany: better than centralised buyouts
[17:53:27] <Tiffany> it looks like the price of bitcoin is $236 right now
[17:53:43] * fmtq has like 30 BTC for reasons
[17:53:46] <Tiffany> it's been dropping steadily from that spike in january
[17:53:48] <GaryOak_> the stellar paper talked about not using 'proof of work'
[17:53:57] <Tiffany> I used to have half a bitcoin but I lost it
[17:54:06] <Tiffany> it was worth like $2 at the time
[17:54:09] <fmtq> I used to have 45 BTC more but I lose it 
[17:54:11] <fmtq> lost* 
[17:54:16] <fmtq> SO
[17:54:19] <fmtq> <_< >_>
[17:54:22] <Tiffany> it was given to me by someone I was talking to who got rich off bitcoin
[17:54:36] <fmtq> I got a laptop out of bitcoin so I'm happy.
[17:54:36] <GaryOak_> fmtq spent it on dogecoin
[17:54:44] <fmtq> GaryOak_: haha almost correct.
[17:54:49] <Tiffany> ugh
[17:54:51] <Tiffany> I don't like dogecoin
[17:55:01] <Tiffany> it was already worthless to begin with, and they made it inflationary
[17:55:02] <fmtq> I spent it on one of the cryptonote currencies
[17:55:06] <Tiffany> and somehow people take it seriously
[17:55:09] <fmtq> then nuked that laptop into space
[17:55:14] <GaryOak_> lol
[17:55:23] <fmtq> it was worth like $20k at the time 
[17:55:43] <Tiffany> it's named after a really tired meme
[17:55:57] <fmtq> shiiit I have to do some work
[17:56:00] <GaryOak_> dogecoin was more of a fuck you to banks I think
[17:56:02] <fmtq> people please be boring while I'm out 
[17:56:05] <fmtq> I'm tired of you being interesting 
[17:56:07] <fmtq> and keeping me here
[17:56:07] <Tiffany> oh
[17:56:10] <Tiffany> the price is higher than I thought
[17:56:17] <Tiffany> 1000 doge is $90
[17:56:22] <fmtq> haha what the fuck
[17:56:30] <fmtq> kill it with fire
[17:56:53] <fmtq> it competes with SEK for value!
[17:56:53] <Tiffany> it looks like you have to convert it to bitcoin first, before converting to USD?
[17:57:08] <Tiffany> wait what
[17:57:12] <Tiffany> the site is inconsistent
[17:57:17] <Tiffany> it says that it's $90 per megadoge
[17:57:21] <fmtq> lol
[17:57:22] <GaryOak_> hahahhaa
[17:57:44] <Tiffany> 1000 doge is 9 cents
[17:57:54] <Tiffany> oh okay
[17:57:58] <Tiffany> so it shows the current price in megadoge
[17:58:02] <Tiffany> and the calculator is separate
[17:58:06] <XMPPwocky> ALL HAIL MEGADOGE

[17:59:20] <Tiffany> the market cap is $11 million

[18:04:57] <Tiffany> one thing that's interesting to note about bitcoin is how it's much more stable now that it has a lot of value in it
[18:05:11] <Tiffany> when's the last time there was a serious price crash?
[18:05:27] <Tiffany> okay
[18:05:28] <Tiffany> to be fair
[18:05:38] <Tiffany> the price can still drop as much as 20% in a day
[18:06:05] <GaryOak_> Is it still true that like a large % of the bitcoins are held by a few people?
[18:06:17] <Tiffany> between january 11 and january 15, bitocin went from $267 to $177
[18:06:20] <Tiffany> well
[18:06:22] <Tiffany> sort of?
[18:06:35] <Tiffany> there's a huge number of bitcions owned by satoshi, since he mined the first several blocks
[18:06:36] <GaryOak_> If someone decided to inject a large amount back into the market, they could crash it again
[18:06:45] <Tiffany> but they have never once been moved
[18:06:48] <Tiffany> they're basically dead
[18:07:04] <GaryOak_> probably in an old laptop somewhere in a basement
[18:07:14] <Tiffany> the key might have been destroyed entirely
[18:07:30] <Tiffany> I mean unless bitcoin is some kind of world domination plan by satoshi
[18:07:46] <Tiffany> get everyone to use bitcoin, then show up with the largest pile of wealth in existence

[20:31:16] <fmtq> so I was drinking €2 peronis on the tourist island
[20:31:18] <UberLambda> the place is too crowded, yes
[20:31:29] <fmtq> and having €1.50 coffees to get into toilets
[20:31:36] <fmtq> because that much beer not ideal walking behaviour
[20:31:36] <UberLambda> ahaha
[20:31:58] <fmtq> I went through the dogehole
[20:32:04] <fmtq> that's where we had the hilarious tour guide
[20:32:13] <fmtq> "all of this wood is imported. Imported means stolen; fuck Croatia."

[20:34:00] <fmtq> they say you can't buy freedom, but Venice could have.
[20:34:04] <UberLambda> the problem were more about politics than anything else

[20:34:27] <fmtq> also fucking Lugarno is an expensive place
[20:34:33] <fmtq> that there Switzerland can fuck off.
[20:34:41] <UberLambda> lol
[20:34:45] <fmtq> although you cross the border from Switzerland to Italy and it's like entering a third world country

[20:35:44] <fmtq> UberLambda: your country is fucked due to systemic corruption and mafia domination 
[20:35:53] <fmtq> and I think the best thing for venice would be to go independent
[20:36:08] <UberLambda> fmtq: it would be... but they won't allow it
[20:36:10] <fmtq> because it's one of the only places left that still has the independence vibe, and its own culture
[20:36:14] <fmtq> how could they stop it?
[20:36:18] <fmtq> it's not like the army will do anything

[20:36:23] <UberLambda> they could, believe me
[20:36:25] <Tobba> north italy is still pretty okay
[20:36:28] <Tobba> iirc
[20:36:34] <UberLambda> but it's dragged down by the rest

[20:36:38] <fmtq> they're the next Spain.
[20:36:46] <UberLambda> yep. and that's pretty bad

[20:36:51] <fmtq> just sack the fucking Vatican 
[20:36:53] <Tobba> that's not going to go down too well
[20:36:58] <fmtq> they have a gift shop with more gold than some banks
[20:37:02] <UberLambda> industries that close, people that lose jobs
[20:37:03] <eddyb> cut the boot off before it infects the rest

[20:37:22] <fmtq> eddyb: a bunch of Swedes I met are going to Romania for a holiday
[20:37:26] <fmtq> I asked why
[20:37:32] <fmtq> their answer was dumb and they're going to get raped and murdered.
[20:37:52] <fmtq> Tobba: Swedes have no conception of "the world is bad" 
[20:37:55] <fmtq> why is this
[20:38:12] <Tobba> I have no idea why anyone from here would go to romania
[20:38:21] <fmtq> "cute little poor people" was almost the actual answer
[20:38:23] <UberLambda> I'd like to visit Canada one day
[20:38:29] <fmtq> UberLambda: it's not a real place.
[20:38:30] <UberLambda> but it's too far

[20:39:12] <eddyb> Romania is in EU :P
[20:39:21] <fmtq> yeah but I don't want to visit the poor people eddyb
[20:39:21] <Tobba> slovenia is pretty cool
[20:39:40] <fmtq> I don't want to have to distinguish romani and romanian beggar
[20:39:44] <UberLambda> and go to Trieste if you get there :P
[20:39:49] <fmtq> UberLambda: why
[20:39:58] <fmtq> I don't find anywhere very interesting
[20:40:01] <fmtq> I was bored in Amsterdam.
[20:40:07] <fmtq> like proper bored
[20:40:14] <fmtq> maybe I live wrong I dunno
[20:40:25] <UberLambda> fmtq: bored? in Amsterdam?
[20:40:32] <eddyb> fmtq: and I thought I could go on for a few weeks without feeling sorry for this fucking country

[20:41:12] <fmtq> I'm not single.
[20:41:19] <fmtq> Dutch accent is not sexy either way.
[20:41:23] <Tobba> that also ruins it a bit
[20:41:24] <eddyb> fmtq: if it wasn't for televisions hypnotizing people we might get up in arms about something and do something
[20:41:27] <fmtq> I basically just ate all the cheese, got drunk, watched my girlfriend get stoned
[20:41:33] <fmtq> laughed at her for being baked as fuck on almost no THC at all 
[20:41:43] <fmtq> got drunk at 9am
[20:41:46] <fmtq> then drank a lot of coffee

[22:26:08] <Tobba> which I'd guess was set up by some random person considering they had no auth
[22:26:09] <fmtq> lolo
[22:26:20] <fmtq> it was a public FTP
[22:26:24] <fmtq> sif the police pay for hosting
[22:26:35] <XMPPwocky> i feel like some of this is just because Shodan is a thing now
[22:26:37] <XMPPwocky> but still
[22:27:02] <fmtq> look
[22:27:04] <GaryOak_> you have to reg for shodan
[22:27:08] <Tobba> uh
[22:27:09] <GaryOak_> but still
[22:27:18] <Tobba> I found a massive 2U controller box for DSL lines
[22:27:21] <Tobba> on telnet.
[22:27:25] <Tobba> wat
[22:27:32] <fmtq> 💩
[22:27:37] <GaryOak_> hahaha
[22:27:39] <fmtq> the world is all about that now.
[22:27:48] <fmtq> my client doesn't even show it 
[22:27:50] <XMPPwocky> GaryOak_:only for some
[22:27:53] <fmtq> but I know it's there.
[22:28:10] <Tobba> I have the anniversary promotion under some weird username since when it was $20
[22:28:18] <GaryOak_> XMPPwocky: some queries?
[22:28:29] <Tobba> oop I'm in
[22:28:32] <Tobba> the password was "admin"
[22:28:45] <XMPPwocky> GaryOak_: idk
[22:28:49] <GaryOak_> oh
[22:28:57] <eddyb> 2U?
[22:29:07] <Tobba> http://wwwen.zte.com.cn/en/products/access/dslam/201405/t20140522_424169.html
[22:29:12] <Tobba> it's one of these
[22:29:21] <XMPPwocky> GaryOak_: you get only the first page of results
[22:29:31] <Tobba> and I popped it on the second try
[22:29:42] <GaryOak_> yeah
[22:29:45] <Tobba> (first try I actually checked the manual and read a "target:target" password line somewhere and tried)
[22:29:51] <Tobba> but that was all for naught, it's always admin:admin
[22:32:12] <GaryOak_> There was a lot of interesting Oracle hardware on there, probably because it's too annoying to configure the security features
