[00:00:29] <eternaleye> tiffany: If it only has two, check the Emulate3Buttons or whatever setting - then click them simultaneously, as in with your thumb on the boundary between them
[00:00:35] <eternaleye> tiffany: I made do with that for a while
[00:00:45] <eternaleye> tiffany: hilight + middle-click = ♥
[00:01:31] <eternaleye> (And if you do that with URLs in firefox and probably Chrome, middle-clicking to paste a URL goes to the URL)
[00:03:59] <tiffany> it looks like there's no falcon's eye package and the vulture package is broken
[00:04:13] <tiffany> there's a few things that stick out, like 'glhack' and 'nethack-x11'
[00:04:25] <tiffany> are those just shitty terminal emulators running nethack?
[00:04:38] <eternaleye> Nope
[00:04:46] <eternaleye> Nethack has a built-in Xaw version
[00:04:50] <eternaleye> Which can use tilesets
[00:04:57] <eternaleye> Not sure what glhack is
[00:05:04] <eternaleye> NoeGNUd is SDL-based, IIRC
[00:05:14] <eternaleye> (though it uses OpenGL to draw)
[00:06:33] <eternaleye> However, the one thing that's true of all Nethack frontends (IMO) is that every last one of them has _crap_ for a buildsystem.
[00:06:44] <eternaleye> Mainly because Nethack itself does.
[00:07:54] <tiffany> do they come with decent tilesets built in?
[00:08:04] <tiffany> or is it like dwarf fortress where everything is terrible no matter how hard you try to dress it up
[00:08:12] <eternaleye> tiffany: LIES AND SLANDER! :P
[00:08:23] <eternaleye> tiffany: But seriously, Obsidian is a pretty darn nice tileset for DF
[00:08:29] <tiffany> I got a pretty nasty headache the last time I tried to play dwarf fortress
[00:08:51] <eternaleye> tiffany: There are lots of painful tilesets for DF, several decent ones, and a few amazing ones.
[00:08:59] <tiffany> all the ones people suggested me were incomplete and seemed to reuse tiles in ways they probably shouldn't
[00:09:02] <eternaleye> tiffany: IMO, Obsidian is solidly in the latter category
[00:09:05] <tiffany> does df reuse symbols?
[00:09:10] <eternaleye> tiffany: Sadly, yes
[00:09:14] <tiffany> so that's why
[00:09:20] <eternaleye> tiffany: Though ToadyOne is cleaning that up gradually
[00:09:36] <eternaleye> tiffany: For instance, '.' is also a general "ground" tile
[00:09:45] <tiffany> by adding new symbols, or by making a new sprite in the tileset using the same default glyph?
[00:09:51] <eternaleye> tiffany: Hence why sentences look weird because the "." has a background
[00:10:02] <eternaleye> tiffany: The latter
[00:10:06] <tiffany> that's good
[00:10:16] <eternaleye> tiffany: The old style of tileset was just indexes into a 256-entry map
[00:10:21] <tiffany> what I really want is an isometric dwarf fortress
[00:10:39] <eternaleye> tiffany: The new style has symbolic sprites, which by default go to the same map, but can also be individual images
[00:10:42] <tiffany> and I don't think that one game that was in early access will suffice
[00:10:50] <sfackler> there's also stonesense
[00:10:53] <tiffany> you just can't replicate 10 years of game design easily
[00:11:16] <eternaleye> tiffany: Moreover from sfackler's statement, there's a DFHack module to make stonesense interactive.
[00:12:44] <tiffany> oh man
[00:12:49] <eternaleye> tiffany: http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Utility:Stonesense
[00:12:51] <tiffany> someone had suggested me stonesense before
[00:12:52] <eternaleye> >> As of June 2014, it is also possible to use Stonesense as a live overlay of the map in the main Dwarf Fortress window, replacing the usual 2D tiles. The DFHack command for this is "stonesense overlay". For best results, edit [segmentsize_z:2] in init.txt, and if you are unable to see the edges of the map with the overlay active try also decreasing the [segmentsize_XY] - normal values are 50 to 80 depending on screen resolution. 
[00:12:58] <tiffany> but I was saddened because it was just a screenshot tool
[00:14:05] <eternaleye> Here's the original announcement of the overlay: https://www.reddit.com/r/dwarffortress/comments/27a3zj/stonesense_overlay_is_live_unstable_incomplete_in/

[00:14:42] <tiffany> this is amazing
[00:14:49] <tiffany> I might actually be able to play dwarf fortress
[00:15:43] <tiffany> all the screenshots appear to be under windows, does this have a linux version?
[00:15:56] <tiffany> I know df itself does, but the nature of native application modding is tricky...
[00:16:10] <eternaleye> I think so
[00:16:23] <eternaleye> I'm pure-linux as well, but I run the classic 2d UI with a tileset
[00:16:42] <eternaleye> Though I do use DFHack, mostly for the quicksave functionality
[00:17:04] <eternaleye> And because of the built-in Dwarf Therapist equivalent
[00:18:10] <eternaleye> (which reminds me of what is possibly my favorite exchange from the DF forums)
[00:18:15] <eternaleye> >>> Now I'll have to admit I use Therapist like a filthy casual, though :c
[00:18:16] <eternaleye> >> Stop being a filthy casual and use DT like a normal DF player.
[00:18:49] <eternaleye> I love the "Look, we won't judge you for using the tools. We might judge you for using the tools _suboptimally_, but only in a joking manner."

[00:25:17] <eternaleye> tiffany: Dwarf Therapist is an absolutely indispensible tool for managing the enabled labors of your dwarves via a table-like interface, rather than the v-p-l dialogue horror
[00:25:43] <tiffany> oh

[00:27:03] <eternaleye> tiffany: DFhack gives a similar interface, but built into the game as an additional interface behind the dwarf list
[00:28:52] <tiffany> that sure does unravel all the complexity hidden in that nest of menus
[00:29:00] <tiffany> man, this game

[00:29:57] <eternaleye> Sort of like EVE Online is Excel: The MMO
[00:30:28] <tiffany> and Save the Queen is Excel: The Visual Novel
[01:26:30] <tiffany> oh
[01:26:52] <tiffany> so apparently this build of stonesense is for df 0.34.11 but I have 0.40.24
[01:26:57] <tiffany> how sensitive is df to version changes?
[01:27:11] <tiffany> modding in particular
[01:36:05] <cmr> tiffany: very, since they usually just parse its structures. if the ABI changes, everything breaks
[01:36:34] <tiffany> so I'll have to get DF 0.34.11 to play with stonesense?
[01:36:50] <tiffany> this reddit post is 10 months old though, maybe there's a newer version..
[01:37:02] <tiffany> all this information is really ad-hoc
[01:38:13] <tiffany> ah
[01:38:29] <tiffany> dfhack comes with stonesense, and has a version out for the one I have
[01:39:57] <tiffany> and there's an aur package
[01:45:04] <eternaleye> tiffany: There are prerelease versions
[01:45:21] <tiffany> eternaleye: uhh
[01:45:22] <eternaleye> tiffany: And yeah, the reddit post was (as I said) the original announcement of the overlay
[01:45:46] <eternaleye> tiffany: If you're on native (or multilib) 32-bit, building dfhack manually isn't hard either.
[01:46:07] <eternaleye> Though stonesense requires allegro, which some distros don't carry
[01:46:18] <tiffany> I'm on arch, and I do have multilib going
[01:46:31] <tiffany> this dfhack aur package doesn't seem horribly outdated though
[01:46:41] <eternaleye> Fair enough
[01:46:52] <eternaleye> There are also prebuilt versions on DFFD and such

[03:49:10] <bascule> it uses Weierstrass, which makes the field arithmetic difficult to implement correctly
[03:49:28] <bascule> and even the slightest bias in the RNG used for the nonces can completely leak the private key
[03:49:42] <bascule> which is why people push for deterministic nonces

[03:50:00] <Tobba> why does ECDSA specify which curve to use
[03:50:14] <bascule> it doesn't specify what curve to use... it's based on the Weierstrass coordinate system...

[03:50:27] <bascule> it can be used with many curves
[03:50:58] <bascule> for modern ECC signatures, Edwards curves seem to be highly preferred

[06:05:47] <bascule> Ilari: I still don't get what's wrong with channel ID aside from lack of adoption
[06:06:12] <bascule> channel ID seems to work well with something like Macaroons
[06:06:23] <bascule> because it punts all the work onto clients
[06:06:39] <bascule> so clients begin the Macaroon "dance" by going somewhere and getting a token with a third party caveat
[06:07:00] <bascule> and that token can encode the client's channel ID
[06:19:37] <Ilari> bascule: Well, AFAIK Channel ID is the basis of tokbind/unbearable work.
[06:20:11] <Ilari> bascule: Or one could add the channel id as first-party caveat (in non-federated scenarios).
[06:21:51] <bascule> yeah, what Macaroons would call a "contextual caveat" (which is really just a first-party caveat that binds the token somehow)
[06:22:05] <bascule> but Macaroons solve all the same problems so much more elegantly
[06:22:35] <bascule> for example, a proxy could request a Macaroon contextually confined to a particular channel ID that authorizes the proxy to act on behalf of a particular client
[06:22:58] <bascule> that Macaroon would include a third party caveat that requires the client to issue a discharge per-request
[06:23:34] <bascule> the client can then issue a unique discharge per request that authorizes the channel-bound proxy to perform some action using an immediately-expiring (say 5s or 1s or what have you) discharge macaroon
[06:23:40] <bascule> no CAS style challenge/response bullshit
[06:23:53] <bascule> the client can mint a unique discharge per request with 0-RTT
[06:24:31] <bascule> and yeah, unberable/tokbind seems like Channel ID 2.0
[06:24:40] <bascule> I'm glad they're actually... approaching it more like that now
[06:25:44] <Ilari> Wonder how the extension is arranged. Just capability advertisment or does it also include key transport and PoP.
[06:26:36] <bascule> it sounds like they have just promised to draft something in the form of an extension and that hasn't actually happened yet
[06:27:24] <Ilari> Yeah.
[06:28:33] <Ilari> Also, 301 and 302 are the two most screwy redirects in HTTP. Both have buggy implementations that react to those in different way than originally intended.
[06:30:32] <bascule> :(
[06:30:34] <bascule> then there's 303
[06:33:59] <Ilari> There are well-defined codes for the three sensible kinds of redirects. Temporary method-changing is 303, Temporary method-preserving is 307 (302) and Permanent method-preserving is 308 (301).
[06:34:52] <Ilari> Some implementations treat 302 like 303. And some implementations treat 301 as permanent method-changing redirect, which makes no sense.

[06:45:34] <Ilari> Aslo, wonder what attacks would become possible if client could assert arbitrary third-party keys.
[06:52:43] <Ilari> The only replacement that works if primary signature is checked is replacing the primary key, but asserting the original third-party key.
[06:53:58] <Ilari> Which means that since third-party key becomes part of token, the attacker can't then MITM that.
[07:00:50] <bascule> Ilari: with Macaroons, hopefully you split the authority up, make it short-lived, and confine the base credentials that define your authority in a particular context
[07:02:39] <Ilari> Hmm... The relevant case is where attacker controls the primary key but asserts tp key they don't control. The issued token will only be usable by who controls the tp key.
[07:04:08] <Ilari> I can't see any interesting applications either (from capability to be able to issue tokens for somebody else).
[07:04:23] <Ilari> *get tokens issued for somebody else
[07:05:02] <bascule> if it's a contextually confined (via channel ID) "first party" token with third party caveats, the attacker would have to control both the original macaroon and the client's TLS private key
[07:05:28] <bascule> which is kind of the whole point... hopefully the latter isn't something you're spraying all over the network
[07:05:44] <cmr> you'd hope...

[19:34:12] <bascule> Ilari: lol
[19:34:20] <bascule> Ilari: and CAS was supposed to be "Kerberos for the web"
[19:34:24] <bascule> except...
[19:34:42] <bascule> https://jasig.github.io/cas/development/images/cas_proxy_flow_diagram.jpg
[19:34:47] <bascule> it ended up looking like this
[19:41:19] <eternaleye> To be fair, Kerberos is no beauty-pageant winner either.
[19:45:21] <Ilari> When web browsers are involved, otherwise straightforward stuff turns into way too complicated mess...
[19:46:30] <kmc> lol
[20:06:28] <bascule> Ilari: that same workflow can be done so elegantly with Macaroons
[20:06:32] <bascule> also: Macaroons, Macaroons
[20:07:24] <bascule> Ilari: the proxy can hit the app and request a channel-bound (or otherwise contextually confined) Macaroon with a third party caveat saying it must contact the "CAS server" for authorization
[20:08:21] <bascule> the proxy can provide the user credential and the third party caveat from the Macaroon it obtained for itself to the "CAS server"
[20:08:32] <bascule> and the "CAS server" could mint a short-lived discharge
[20:08:45] <bascule> then subsequent requests can skip the "CAS server" for the lifetime of the discharge
[20:09:14] <bascule> that cuts 3 of the 5 requests out of CAS that it makes for EVERY SINGLE HTTP REQUEST
[20:09:17] <bascule> madness
[20:10:01] <bascule> like, the thing that takes 7 requests up top takes 3 with Macaroons
[20:10:06] <bascule> and the thing below takes 2 instead of 5
