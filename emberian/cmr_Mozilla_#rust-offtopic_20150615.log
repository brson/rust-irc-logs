[03:55:20] <cmr> I dunno, GuixSD seems like a contender.
[03:56:28] <cmr> plus it has a cooler shirt.
[03:58:33] <swgillespie> has anyone tried moving a windows install from one disk to another before?
[04:06:27] <c74d> GuixSD… *is* NixOS, but Lisp-ier and GNU-ier, no?
[04:06:37] <cmr> It's an entirely different package manager.
[04:08:39] <whipsch> swgillespie: do you mean a direct clone?
[04:09:03] <whipsch> if the hardware is different, it may complain and/or break
[04:09:12] <whipsch> regardless, it may require you to reactivate
[04:09:17] <whipsch> but that is usually automatic
[04:09:38] <swgillespie> whipsch: Ideally, yeah.
[04:09:51] <whipsch> it should generally work i think
[04:09:58] <whipsch> i cloned a windows xp machine and imported it to vmware
[04:10:03] <swgillespie> I'm trying to move it from a 26gb hard drive to a 512gb hard drive
[04:10:07] <whipsch> it wanted to reactivate but everything worked just fine after
[04:10:12] <swgillespie> hmm, ok
[04:11:13] <c74d> cmr: oh, it is? I'd heard from Nix people that it's based on Nix, but maybe I oughtn't've believed them?
[04:11:16] <swgillespie> welp, my machine fails to boot when I plug in the new drive

[04:13:13] <niconii> swgillespie: how'd you go about copying it over? there's the boot sector and all that to worry about too
[04:13:37] <swgillespie> niconii: I haven't copied it yet, but I was hoping to just do a direct copy
[04:13:37] <c74d> So no, GuixSD isn't exactly Lispy-GNUy-NixOS, but it seems to be quite close.
[04:13:59] <niconii> swgillespie: i think just straight-up dd will do the trick
[04:14:01] <swgillespie> but now I'm just going to give up since my machine is very unhappy righ tnow

[04:14:18] <swgillespie> unless I can dd on windows? then that would be perfect!
[04:14:19] <cmr> Guix uses the guts of nix but it's a fork.

[04:14:28] <cmr> http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/guix.git/tree/nix is the bits of nix they use.
[04:14:39] <whipsch> swgillespie: tbh in my experience, reinstalling windows and then reconfiguring/installing stuff you want has always been the better option :)

[05:59:16] <Astrum|Lap> ^
[05:59:18] <cmr> I browsed through the archives last week for a while and got like 1 or 2.
[06:23:37] <Wraithan> I put together a new blog today on a new domain, was wondering if anyone wouldn't mind reviewing my blog post to make sure it isn't stupid before I try to advertise it: http://iron-oxide.ninja/blog/2015/Jun/using-build-scripts-with-rust/
[06:25:09] <Wraithan> blog itself is still pretty rough too
[06:25:57] <cmr> the archives have links to months with no possts.
[06:26:11] <Wraithan> cmr: yes yes
[06:26:13] <cmr> and aigames.com is down.
[06:27:11] <Wraithan> oops, that was my bad lol
[06:27:43] <cmr> I think you should show the Cargo.toml at each step instead of describing just the differences.
[06:27:47] <Wraithan> refresh and the theaigames.com's link should be fixed
[06:27:48] <cmr> other than that the post looks fine.
[06:27:52] <Wraithan> each step?
[06:28:09] <Wraithan> like adding deps?
[06:28:30] <cmr> "I added build = "build.rs" to my Cargo.toml", "So I added it to my Cargo.toml under [dependencies]", "build-dependencies was what I wanted. So adding it there totally worked and I was trucking along"
[06:29:38] <Wraithan> ok
[06:29:47] <Wraithan> probably not all of it but at least the working ones
[06:29:50] <cmr> or at least show the final Cargo.toml
[06:30:26] <cmr> the only reason people are going to find that blog post is by googling "rust build script", and if they're googling that they're probably confused and want examples :)
[06:30:39] <cmr> also that competition looks super fun!
[06:30:48] <Wraithan> it is
[06:30:51] <cmr> I hadn't seen that site before.
[06:31:00] <Wraithan> just waiting for them to add rust as a language
[06:31:03] <Wraithan> submitted a starter bot
[06:31:41] <niconii> oh, haha, i didn't know .ninja was a tld
[06:31:44] <Wraithan> my node one was in the top 20s
[06:31:46] <Wraithan> niconii: ya
[06:31:46] <niconii> there's a whole bunch of them now
[06:31:56] <Wraithan> finally decided on a .ninja I wanted
[06:32:41] <cmr> there's a prof called "tino" at my uni, and one of my classmates bought tino.ninja and sent mail from "the@tino.ninja" challenging him to a duel during an exam. was pretty amusing.

[07:25:54] <XMPPwocky> is it correct to say that a timing attack reduces time to brute-force the secret from exponential in the number of characters, to linear? (assuming it's a character-by-character comparison)
[07:26:38] <cmr> I don't think it's still considered brute force once you use a side channel.
[07:26:55] <cmr> and getting a reliable signal from a potentially noisy side-channel can still be non-trivial.
[07:27:28] <XMPPwocky> sure, i mean in theory
[07:27:37] <cmr> eg http://tonyarcieri.com/cream-the-scary-ssl-attack-youve-probably-never-heard-of
[07:29:19] <cmr> I think you're right, for that specific kind of timing leak.
[07:29:41] <c74d> eddyb: how was it that you made NixOS build Linux without trying to enable all sorts of things you didn't need? handing it a manually-configured kernel configuration file?
[07:29:58] <XMPPwocky> doesn't x86 have some way to flag, in the page tables, "please don't cache this"
[07:30:23] <XMPPwocky> i know ARM does, it's meant for memory-mapped IO devices, but i guess x86 doesn't do as much MMIO stuff
[07:30:25] <Mutabah> XMPPwocky: iirc, yes. Not sure what layer that operates on
[07:30:56] <cmr> Mutabah: What, the P bit?
[07:31:01] <cmr> does that actually work?
[07:31:03] <XMPPwocky> okay, yeah, x86 has a "D" bit
[07:31:08] <XMPPwocky> > D, is the 'Cache Disable' bit. If the bit is set, the page will not be cached. Otherwise, it will be.
[07:31:12] <cmr> ah
[07:31:23] <Mutabah> *nod*
[07:31:25] <XMPPwocky> that seems pretty useful... if it actually works
[07:31:34] <Mutabah> I was more not sure what level of caching it bypasses
[07:31:37] <XMPPwocky> i might try and bench that, although since it's a TLB-level thing...
[07:31:53] <cmr> linux doesn't expose that, at least.
[07:31:59] <cmr> not sure about other kernels.
[07:32:07] <cmr> so you'd need to write a kernel module.
[07:32:08] <XMPPwocky> cmr: anything's possible with a custom kernel module and crying!
[07:32:18] <XMPPwocky> Mutabah: it's probably documented in some horrifyingly hairy app sheet you have to sign a TLB just to think about
[07:32:21] <XMPPwocky> er, NDA
[07:32:38] <XMPPwocky> three-letter acronyms are pretty much interchangable at 12:30AM
[07:32:43] <cmr> I doubt it, the precise behavior is probably specified in the SDM.
[07:33:28] <cmr> The solution to cache timing attacks is to use better crypto, not disable caching (and thus performance) :P

[07:35:01] *** Joins: jesopo (jess@lolnerd.net)
[07:35:10] <XMPPwocky> i wonder if one of the plethora of SIMD instructions has, like, a "swizzle" that's constant-time and big enough for a S-box for most ciphers
[07:35:52] <cmr> there are "swizzles" (called shuffles)
[07:38:05] <XMPPwocky> yeah, none of the registers seem big enough for a full S-box, and splitting it up would open the door for loads of new and interesting side channels

[07:39:29] <cmr> There's AES-NI though, so you don't need to use SIMD at least for AES.
[07:39:48] <XMPPwocky> right, but that's sort of cheating :P
[07:39:54] <cmr> Is it, though? :P
[07:40:42] <XMPPwocky> "oh boy, we can do all sorts of neat crypto with these general-purpose computers, except doing crypto on a general-purpose computer is terrible, so we'll do it in a dedicated hardware module!"
[07:41:05] <XMPPwocky> On ARM, of course, all bets are probably off?
[07:41:09] <cmr> Not all ciphers are annoying in software.
[07:41:23] <XMPPwocky> i vaguely recall some NEON extension for AES, but not sure
[07:41:35] <cmr> ARMv8 has AES.
[07:41:44] <XMPPwocky> ah, neat.
[07:42:13] <cmr> and there are crypto coprocessors too.
[07:42:20] <eddyb> c74d: I didn't make NixOS do anything like that :P
[07:42:38] <eddyb> c74d: which is probably why the builds took so long
[07:42:51] <eddyb> there is probably a config variable for it
[07:43:08] <XMPPwocky> eddyb: i accidentally tweaked a setting and made nix decide it needed to rebuild the entire system
[07:43:22] <eddyb> well, it's non-destructive :D
[07:43:33] <eddyb> you can SIGKILL the build and nothing bad will happen
[07:43:36] <XMPPwocky> luckily, the heat given off from my CPU saved loads on my heating bill
[07:43:38] <eddyb> you can even unplug your machine
[07:43:40] <eddyb> lol
[07:44:16] <XMPPwocky> eddyb: can't that, uh... "leak"?
[07:44:27] <XMPPwocky> like, i assume they just symlink things in when the build finishes
[07:44:35] <eddyb> yeah, just run GC
[07:44:48] <XMPPwocky> but if it gets suddenly aborted, where do all the temporary files live? /tmp ? GC only cleans out the actual Nix stor
[07:45:02] <XMPPwocky> i should probably clean out /tmp since NixOS doesn't do it on boot by default
[07:45:35] <cmr> easy solution to that is tmpfs.
[07:47:27] <eddyb> anything that finished building would be in /nix/store
[07:47:35] <eddyb> I'm actually not sure where builds live

[07:58:32] <c74d> There doesn't seem to be a NixOS configuration option for it.
[07:59:18] <c74d> XMPPwocky: you can make `/tmp` a tmpfs with `boot.tmpOnTmpfs = true` in `configuration.nix`.

[22:01:44] <XMPPwocky> so i could have, instead of a letter with two accents, a letter with an accent on top, then a space, then another accent

[22:13:13] <XMPPwocky> hm
[22:13:23] <XMPPwocky> can you write a "TypeErasedItems"-
[22:13:43] <XMPPwocky> constructed from &[T] where T: Foo; yields &Foo
[22:13:47] <XMPPwocky> mutable version if you're into that, too
[22:14:00] <XMPPwocky> basically, the actual iterator would forget the type of T
[22:14:26] <XMPPwocky> it'd have a stride in bytes, and a pointer to the vtable for Foo of each T
[22:14:37] <XMPPwocky> (which would be the same for all T, naturally)
[22:15:25] <XMPPwocky> and it would thus be totally allocation-free
[22:16:16] <dfockler> XMPPwocky: isn't that just like a Marker trait?
[22:16:35] <XMPPwocky> how so?
[22:16:53] <dfockler> because you are Marking the array with Foo
[22:18:03] <c74d> Are there any major improvements that Linux 4.0 is supposed to have made over Linux 3.18?
[22:18:11] <XMPPwocky> i'm sort of confused dfockler 
[22:19:34] <dfockler> XMPPwocky: well if you know Foo's are going in and Foo's are coming out, then what are you erasing?

[23:48:09] <eddyb> I hadn't realized I sometimes keep my hand more vertical than I should

[23:48:43] <eddyb> between subconcious expression and not paying attention to something I'm doing, I'll pick the latter tyvm :P
[23:49:22] <c74d> … how is that supposed to be “superiority”
[23:49:39] <Tiffany> because your hand covers their hand
[23:49:54] <c74d> if one's hand is vertical?
[23:50:26] <Tiffany> there is perhaps an ambiguity as to which way is vertical
[23:50:28] <dfockler> I'm having trouble figuring out the logistics of this
[23:50:48] <c74d> hm, I guess I'm ungroundedly assuming “vertical” to mean “perpendicular to the ground”
[23:51:14] <Tiffany> I was thinking maybe axis coming out of your palm
[23:51:20] <c74d> I suppose it could also mean— that
[23:51:29] <cmr> i think we need a video demonstration of your handshake, eddyb 
[23:53:51] <dfockler> Anyone else worried for when GitHub eventually goes public?
[23:54:11] <c74d> cmr: if one looks at “lonely” as (alone, dissatisfied with that)… I'd guess you meant inverting both, but just inverting one could give “annoyed by not being alone” or “enjoying being alone”.
[23:54:57] <Havvy> dfockler:  As long as it's easy to migrate away, nope.
[23:55:01] <c74d> dfockler: by the possibility of them eventually trying desperate, unpleasant tactics like SourceForge's installers?
[23:55:26] <cmr> dfockler: I'm not, I think github is a pretty shit service already compared to the alternatives, and git works everywhere.
[23:56:07] <c74d> The alternatives being Bitbucket and GitLab?
[23:56:28] <Havvy> I don't find BitBucket superior to Github.
[23:56:30] <cmr> I had phabricator in mind, but those also work.
[23:57:14] <dfockler> just that there is so much code infrastructure built around it, it's the age old 'corporations fucking people over' story
