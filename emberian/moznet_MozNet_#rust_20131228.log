[00:01:45] <csherratt> if you are comparing rust to c it is best to be using clang, preferably clang that was built from the same llvm as rustc. I have found gcc has fallen behind clang by a measurable amount in some tests.
[00:01:48] <acrichto> erickt1: ah I plan on writing up some stuff in an email once #[boot] lands, but no, there is no longer the idea of pinning a task in libgreen

[00:02:22] <acrichto> erickt1: the idea is to have the "pinned task" be the native 1:1 task

[00:15:37] <SiegeLord> Someone should make a new build system in Rust, ha
[00:18:21] <o11c> the problem is that nobody has solved the "push vs pull" question satisfactorily ... and most do pretty bad at separating rules from dependencies
[00:18:38] <aatch> I use tup, that works pretty well
[00:19:02] <o11c> I haven't found anything that works better than make, but make is stupid in some cases..
[00:19:46] <aatch> o11c, check out tup, it deals with rules vs. dependencies by inferring dependencies based on file activity
[00:20:12] <SiegeLord> That seems magical... and it doesn't do what a build system should do: abstract away filesystem interaction

[00:21:50] <o11c> aatch: I did look at tup, wasn't happy
[00:22:08] <aatch> SiegeLord, well it doesn't do that itself, it just run commands and expects it to produce a file.

[00:22:30] <SiegeLord> Well, it's a feature that a build system should have
[00:22:38] <SiegeLord> Also, iirc it had trouble installing files?
[00:22:41] <SiegeLord> Or was that redo
[00:22:42] <o11c> the two things I want in a build system (and have with my makefile are): support multiple binaries, and calculate all the deps for me so I never need to list them myself
[00:23:33] <aatch> I figured that a *build* system should probably just take care of, well, building.

[00:23:54] <o11c> how is that not what I said?
[00:24:08] <SiegeLord> Well, then I just need to find an install system, and a configure system ;P
[00:24:31] <o11c> I wrote my own configure system in python ... works pretty well, just needs more things to test for
[00:25:39] <aatch> SiegeLord, that's actually probably better in the long run. Trying to combine everything into one monolithic program makes something that isn't particularly good at anything.
[00:25:51] <SiegeLord> Yeah, I disagree
[00:25:54] <o11c> definitely agreed
[00:26:06] <SiegeLord> That's 3 things for the end user to install instead of 1
[00:26:26] * cmr uses cmake and ninja
[00:26:33] <o11c> cmake is ... bleh
[00:26:39] <o11c> who can stand writing that much?
[00:26:48] * cmr shrugs
[00:27:01] <cmr> I wrote it once and I rarely have to change it
[00:27:04] <o11c> not only if you're the developer, but every user who has to build the program
[00:27:06] <aatch> SiegeLord, because it's not like I have CMake, autotools, and a million tools installed already.
[00:27:25] <cmr> well it's an internal project, the only people building it are the developers
[00:27:37] <cmr> (proprietary)
[00:27:46] <o11c> I try to remember "is it cmake -D CXX_CMAKE_COMPILER or what?"
[00:28:03] <SiegeLord> ccmake ;)
[00:28:08] <o11c> SiegeLord: well, configure scripts are canonically bundled

[00:31:40] <o11c> it's not reasonable to expect all users to install uber-make once it gets written
[00:32:13] <SiegeLord> It's a pretty weak configure script if it does not change what is being built
[00:32:25] <SiegeLord> I don't see how you can get any savings in the general case
[00:32:40] <o11c> incidentally, all this argument is exactly why nobody has written a better build system
[00:32:43] <SiegeLord> Either your configure script does nothing but set the install prefix, or you need the full build system
[00:32:47] <o11c> because nobody agrees what it's supposed to do
[00:33:08] <o11c> SiegeLord: it's quite possible for a bootstrap to branch on configure options

[00:33:30] <o11c> but more importantly, export conditional definitions of CFLAGS and LDFLAGS
[00:34:15] <o11c> I should try to see if I can impleemtn make -j N in bash sometime ... but realistically, it's fine to say "if you want parallel builds, install uber-make"
[00:35:00] <o11c> (it's easy to implement make -j infinity)
[00:35:04] <SiegeLord> Is it? What good is this minimal build system then?
[00:35:31] <SiegeLord> "You can have a build experience that sucks, or you can get the real thing"... might as well get the real thing

[01:00:16] <rntz_> cmr: I don't really know what people mean by the distinction between coercion and casting.
[01:00:19] <pcwalton> @/~ -> & is also a coercion
[01:00:24] <rntz_> afaict it's a different distinction in every language
[01:00:50] <rntz_> ah, I see, you can do let-coercions. is that anything other than subtyping, though?
[01:01:01] <wycats_> Personal Computer Walton: can you explain what a let coercion is?
[01:01:02] <rntz_> like, can "let" let you do something that isn't a subtyping-coercion?
[01:01:06] <rntz_> ==wycats_
[01:01:12] <wycats_> what is an ==wycats_?
[01:01:17] <pcwalton> rntz_: yeah, it can convert @ to & and ~ to &
[01:01:21] <pcwalton> well, real subtyping involves satisfying constraints in the typechecker
[01:02:07] <speckle> I'm wondering if string literals will ever be automatically cast into owned strings, though I guess it's a fairly minor issue
[01:02:08] <pcwalton> whereas "let" coercion only happens when you have one manifestly typed position (e.g. a "let foo: Type = …") and a RHS of the "let" that doesn't match that type
[01:02:09] <wycats_> I hit some issues today that really made me want an easy way to coerce Option<~T> to Option<&T>, but I guess that needs to wait until the fixes for ~str and ~vec?
[01:02:20] <pcwalton> probably that should wait for DST

[01:02:46] <pcwalton> they're about as equally cheap
[01:03:06] <pcwalton> there has been discussion of taking subtyping out of the language and just using let coercion even for regions

[01:03:50] <rntz_> er, I mean, subtyping in what system?
[01:03:58] <pcwalton> well, just general System F + subtyping
[01:04:01] <pcwalton> I don't know the exact theorem
[01:04:13] <cmr> (when you either want a &'static str or ~str)
[01:04:22] <rntz_> I don't think system F has subtyping in any real sense. oh, maybe if you have implicit-instantiation-as-subtyping.

[01:04:30] <pcwalton> oh, I mean System-F-plus-subtyping
[01:04:31] <rntz_> yeah. and I guess Rust does, although it's prenex.
[01:04:34] <pcwalton> if you add subtyping to System F
[01:04:39] <pcwalton> then you get undecidable type inference

[03:22:46] <cmr> well you can't do it without a trait

[03:24:23] <cmr> no, you need `impl SomeTrait for Complex { ... }`, where SomeTrait defines the method.
[03:24:42] <cmr> The reason you need a trait is so that multiple crates can't create unresoable errors where they both try to define a method with the same name.
[03:24:54] <saf> So what I began with was:
[03:24:54] <saf> trait Factorial<T> {

[09:07:50] <polysics> hello!
[09:07:58] <polysics> I bet you hear this multiple times a day
[09:08:06] <polysics> but... rust vs erlang? :D
[09:08:31] <polysics> I know erlang decently, can someone please outline a few differences?
[09:09:49] <wycats_> Rust doesn't require a VM
[09:10:10] <wycats_> Rust doesn't require a GC
[09:10:28] <polysics> it looks far "smaller" in footprint, possibly smaller than C++
[09:10:32] <wycats_> confirm
[09:10:42] *** Joins: dredozubov (dredozubov@moz-1E374954.nationalcablenetworks.ru)
[09:11:05] <polysics> I am mostly interested in highly concurrent small operations, such as the ones that happen in telephony
[09:11:17] <polysics> Erlang is a good fit but sometimes it does feel unwieldy
[09:11:22] <wycats_> the Task model is similar to Erlang
[09:11:46] <polysics> and I dabbled in Go, finding the compactness enticing but the features themselves are not suited to that kind of task
[09:11:56] <polysics> so I was thinking, is Rust the perfect middle ground? :)
[09:12:44] <polysics> I think they should just release 1.0 so people gain confidence, it is not my case but I have been told "do not use Rust as it is not even 1.0"
[09:12:57] <polysics> while versioning is mostly bullshit anyway, just look at the Ruby versions :)
[09:13:37] <wycats_> polysics: I don't even know how to understand what you're saying :P
[09:13:39] <wycats_> Rust isn't stable
[09:13:55] <wycats_> if you want rock-hard stability, the pre-1.0 version number should tell you that you won't get that ;)
[09:14:16] <wycats_> but if you like what Rust has to offer: low-level control over memory, safety, high-level features, small footprint
[09:14:21] <polysics> yeah, that's a huge plus in favor of Erlang
[09:14:24] <wycats_> and are willing to put up with frequent changes
[09:14:29] <wycats_> then I'd say go to town!
[09:14:33] <wycats_> I have Rust in production wheeee
[09:14:50] <polysics> I have been following Elixir, and so far it has a breaking change every two weeks :)
[09:15:02] <wycats_> polysics: Elixir is pretty cool
[09:15:12] <wycats_> polysics: Rust's breaking changes are more frequent
[09:15:19] <wycats_> you have to be willing to ride master
[09:15:29] <wycats_> but the compiler leads you in the right direction
[09:15:36] <polysics> so the construct I should explore if I am trying to evaluate highly concurrent apps is the "Task"?
[09:15:45] <wycats_> yeah
[09:15:50] <wycats_> Tasks and Ownership
[09:16:08] <wycats_> polysics: the ownership model is a really good fit for concurrency
[09:16:21] <wycats_> basically every value can only have one owner at a time
[09:16:25] <wycats_> validated by the compile
[09:16:28] <wycats_> that includes Tasks
[09:16:34] <wycats_> but also even stack frames
[09:16:36] <polysics> is there a supervision model in some form?

[09:18:20] <wycats_> Result is an enum that can have Ok or Err
[09:18:22] <polysics> documentation looks quite good for a language at this stage
[09:18:29] <wycats_> heh... it has its ups and downs :P
[09:18:36] <wycats_> it could use better "getting started" docs
[09:18:53] <polysics> Go's docs are a good example
[09:19:16] <wycats_> looks like try {} is what you want

[09:20:44] * wycats_ feels lame
[09:20:45] <polysics> one thing I really do not like abot Erlang is having to state your types separately if you want type checking
[09:20:53] <wycats_> polysics: what do you mean by that?
[09:21:52] <polysics> -spec annotations
[09:22:25] <polysics> that is the main reason I am not sold on Erlang yet
[09:22:33] <wycats_> what is a -spec annotation?

[09:23:03] <polysics> http://learnyousomeerlang.com/types-or-lack-thereof
[09:23:21] <polysics> you basically tell the dialyzer (which is a static analysis tool) which types to expect

[09:23:29] <polysics> but it is not an integral part of the language
[09:23:38] <wycats_> in Rust everything is typed
[09:23:40] <polysics> and I greatly enjoy strongly typed languages :)
[09:23:42] <wycats_> you cannot opt out
[09:23:51] <wycats_> ah ok then you will really like Rust
[09:23:57] *** Joins: ofeldt (ofeldt@moz-BAAF4743.dip0.t-ipconnect.de)
[09:24:06] <wycats_> in particular the trait system is a pleasure for a strongly typed language
[09:24:12] <polysics> another probably oft-repeated question: why Rust instead of ye olde C++?
[09:24:19] <wycats_> polysics: safety
[09:24:25] <Ms2ger`> Speed!
[09:24:31] <wycats_> ha
[09:24:36] <wycats_> a wild Ms2ger` appears
[09:24:46] <polysics> I understand Rust is really fast
[09:24:46] <wycats_> he is probably much better equipped to answer these questions than me!

[09:25:20] <wycats_> (assuming the compiler isn't broken)
[09:25:22] <polysics> which is where I screw up for the most part :P
[09:25:31] <wycats_> also, the Rust type system is really rich

[09:26:06] <wycats_> we had a requirement to use native code

[09:26:21] <wycats_> options narrowed down to Rust
[09:26:22] <wycats_> :P
[09:27:23] <polysics> I will be forced to write some C in the near future, and I am already worried :)
[09:27:27] <wycats_> polysics: the lack of GC in idiomatic Rust programming makes it one of a handful of languages that even fits the bill for a lot of cases
[09:27:34] <wycats_> polysics: yes, Rust is a lot nicer
[09:27:45] <wycats_> polysics: you can dump an .so that looks like a C library
[09:27:47] <wycats_> but is totally safe
[09:27:52] <wycats_> yay #[no_munge]
[09:28:00] <wycats_> polysics: my project is actually a C extension for Ruby
[09:28:14] <wycats_> so basically Rust stands in for C
[09:28:16] <polysics> wait, what?
[09:28:29] <wycats_> ?
[09:28:33] <polysics> so I could write my extension in rust instead of C?

[09:40:56] <polysics> it is unfortunately easy to blackhole exceptions in threaded Ruby
[09:41:00] <wycats_> the type system is pretty nice
[09:41:01] <wycats_> polysics: yeah
[09:41:09] <wycats_> polysics: types in Rust are non-nullable
[09:41:15] <wycats_> there's the Option<> type
[09:41:15] <Ms2ger> polysics, I think Rust for Rubyists may be out-of-date at thus point

[13:20:37] <derek_c> is rustpkg supposed to work with remote packages?  I'm doing something like `rustpkg install github.com/alexcrichton/rust-compress` but it's complaining about path does not exist
[13:21:11] <diverse> benh: that would explain why the compilation is slow, all we have to do is make a multi-tasked(threaded) cp command :P

[13:36:17] <bjz> if you are doing vec stuff
[13:36:26] <benh> We don't really like uninitialized values since unintialized non-integral things tend to be unsafe :v
[13:36:33] <bjz> yup
[13:36:41] <bjz> with_capacity is safe btw
[13:37:17] <benh> It doesn't let you just read() into the vec tho since semantically it's still zero length...
[13:37:49] <bjz> benh: yep, because Rust vecs have a length and capacity
[13:38:21] <diverse> steveklabnik: how is your friend's tutorial doing?
[13:38:30] <benh> You could unsafely cast the vec to that repr struct and read into the pointer and then manually set the length i guess

[13:41:48] <bjz> benh: there is a function in vec to set the length

[14:09:47] <eddyb> whitequark: it might be a good idea to keep it an unsafe pointer so it doesn't escape into safe code. also, transmute can do a lot of evil, try not to use it if possible
[14:10:23] <whitequark> it's rougly equivalent to OCaml's Obj.magic, right?
[14:11:34] <whitequark> eddyb: by the way, your cast doesn't work:
[14:11:34] <whitequark> est.rs:8:22: 8:40 error: mismatched types: expected `&<V0>` but found `*i32` (expected &-ptr but found *-ptr)
[14:11:37] <whitequark> test.rs:8         volatile_load(0x12345678 as *i32)
[14:12:07] <eddyb> whitequark: it gives you a *T not a &T
[14:12:15] <bjz> whitequark: I normally try to wrap transmute up as tight as possible, normally in a wrapper function.

[17:17:45] <SiegeLord> What's the difference between #[boot] and #[start]?
[17:18:59] <SiegeLord> Adding an extern native; seems to have made native::start work
[17:19:14] <SiegeLord> I don't know if that's truly the right thing though, but it compiles so meh...
[17:19:24] <cmr> #[boot] calls #[start]

[17:19:41] <cmr> libnative is a bona fide library, need to extern mod it.
[17:19:48] <cmr> the runtime is outside of libstd now :)
[17:20:01] <SiegeLord> So if you don't do extern mod native; you don't start with a runtime?
[17:20:06] <SiegeLord> I find that very hard to believe

[17:56:42] <mitsuhiko> but i can promise you that the vast majority of things that people actually *want* to print a [u8] for, will at least partially have ascii values
[17:56:47] <mitsuhiko> anyone implementing a protocol parser will expect that
[17:57:00] <SiegeLord> Which apparently is a vast majority of people?

[17:57:29] <SiegeLord> There's a reason hex editors provide an option to decode in various formats aside from just ASCII
[17:57:51] <cmr> bstrie_mojitos: I don't see what the problem with the from_utf8 function is
[17:58:01] <mitsuhiko> well, right now the default print for a [u8] is just ugly and confusing
[17:58:07] <bstrie_mojitos> cmr: because :: is gross :P
[17:58:08] <mitsuhiko> and i doubt anyone appreciates it
[17:58:24] <cmr> And if you want escaping of non-ASCII things, something else is going to be more appropriate, probably in std::ascii
[17:58:32] <SiegeLord> The only ugly thing about it is the 'u8' suffix
[17:58:32] <achin> are you looking for something like how python2 displays strings?
[17:58:53] *** Joins: madmoose (Hat@moz-E1973371.nerp.net)
[17:58:54] <mitsuhiko> not strings but u8 arrays

[17:59:13] <achin> (in python2 a string and a bytearray are pretty much the same thing)

[18:01:12] <SiegeLord> I'd personally just remove {:?} :P
[18:01:24] <SiegeLord> I'd argue that it never provides useful/pretty output
[18:01:58] <cmr> It's fantastically useful when working on rustc and libsyntax
[18:02:17] <mitsuhiko> SiegeLord: nooooo
[18:02:21] <cmr> It's also nice to be able to have an "I don't really care" print mode so one doesn't have to implement anything for it.
[18:02:24] <mitsuhiko> i love it
[18:02:26] <SiegeLord> Only because the relevant things don't implement fmt::Default
[18:02:36] <mitsuhiko> repr() in python is awesome
[18:02:43] <SiegeLord> Then the output could be even more informative
[18:02:43] <mitsuhiko> and that's pretty much the same
[18:03:04] <mitsuhiko> the only problem with :? i have is that [u8] (which i use a ton) has a shitty debug output
[18:03:18] <cmr> it prints what it is: a vector of bytes
[18:03:41] <cmr> you could use a newtype and impl fmt::Default for it to get something else that isn't just a vector of bytes
[18:03:48] <mitsuhiko> ~[0u8, 1u8, 2u12, 98u8, 99u8, 13u8] is much inferior to b'\x0\x1\xcabc'
[18:04:22] <mitsuhiko> cmr: python3 wanted to print vector of bytes as integers, that was quickly undone
[18:04:33] <mitsuhiko> way, way, way too much u8 data is at least partially ascii
[18:04:53] <mitsuhiko> and if you ever used erlang you will notice how frustrating their "string" type is because it often stops printing things as ascii

[19:27:19] <pseudoku> acrichto: great! btw, i was wondering why we have to do this "let this = cast::transmute_mut(self);" instead of taking &mut self ? is this to work around the limitation of the type system/ borrow checker?
[19:27:58] <acrichto> pseudoku: it was an explicit decision to require '&self' for chans/ports
[19:28:17] <acrichto> the transmute wouldn't be needed if we took &mut self, but it's a real pain to take &mut self everywhere with little-to-no benefit
[19:28:55] <acrichto> &mut self mostly means "make sure there are no other borrowed references to self", but in this case we don't really do anything with that guarantee because the state between chans/ports are already shared
[19:29:13] <acrichto> it ended up being very little win for taking &mut self and a lot more pain, so I reverted it back to &self when I was rewriting it
[19:29:52] <pseudoku> that makes sense. thanks for the explanation

[19:40:14] <bjz> }
[19:40:47] <acrichto> that should work, libs aren't compiled to want green threads or native threads
[19:41:21] <bjz> so I'd have a separate pool for the lib?
[19:41:53] <acrichto> you'd have to manually initially span tasks into the green pool yeah
[19:41:55] <bjz> ie. glfw::Glfw uses channels internally

[19:42:11] <acrichto> that should work
[19:42:20] <acrichto> you basicaly have control over what's on the main thread and what isn't
[19:42:27] <SirSkidmore> okay, this may be really picky, but I'm not a huge fan of all of the .dSYM folders taht get created (not sure if that's just a Mac thing or not). Is there a way to avoid that?
[19:42:48] <acrichto> SirSkidmore: what version of the compiler are you on? It shouldn't be doing that on master unless you have -Z extra-debug-info
[19:42:59] <SirSkidmore> I'm on .8
[19:43:12] <bjz> acrichto: seems kinda weird that you require TaskOpts::new() for the default spawn
[19:43:25] <acrichto> SirSkidmore: ah, I'd recommned upgrading to master
[19:43:27] <bjz> SirSkidmore: use 0.9-pre - .8 is ancient
[19:43:36] <acrichto> SirSkidmore: although you'll also get bombarded with a lot of other changes
[19:43:55] <acrichto> bjz: yeah I could definitely change to spawn/spawn_opts, but as with before I didn't think it'd be used that often

[23:13:47] <fedvadie> Hi rust folks,
[23:14:25] <fedvadie> I am interested in a matrix library for rust. even if it is low level
[23:14:41] <fedvadie> c++ has a few good like eigen and blitz++
[23:14:47] <fedvadie> but are still hard to use

[23:15:19] <kimundi> fedvadie: Writing one or using one?
[23:15:28] <cmr> there's sebcrozet's nalgebra and bjz's cgmath
[23:15:54] <fedvadie> well using, writing one is above my skill set (now atleast)
[23:16:05] <bjz> cmr: cgmath and nalgembra are not like eigen
[23:16:34] <bjz> fedvadie: I'm not aware of a good, general purpose LA lib atm
[23:16:38] <fedvadie> bjz: how are they like numpy?
[23:16:43] <cmr> they're the only matrix libraries
[23:16:52] <cmr> if they're not appropriate, nothing is!
[23:16:57] <bjz> fedvadie: they are game focuesed
[23:17:26] <bjz> fedvadie: computer grapichs stuff
[23:17:28] <fedvadie> see I am interested in precise scientific LA libraries not gaming approximate , vector 3D stuff
[23:17:34] <bjz> yep
[23:17:45] <fedvadie> bjz : oops
[23:17:56] <SiegeLord> nalgebra had some dynamic vectors... but the library seems incomplete
[23:17:58] <bjz> we won't be able to reach the craziness of eigen, at least not yet
[23:18:10] <bjz> (if ever)
[23:18:14] <SiegeLord> Too many traits, not enough features :P

[23:20:07] <fedvadie> numpy (slow) or use C++ libraries like openfoam or low-level ones like eigen
[23:20:32] <SiegeLord> I always thought eigen was pretty neat... what makes it hard to use?

[23:23:53] <wycats_> how do you resolve conflicts if you import multiple traits that use the same name?

[23:25:50] <wycats_> how does that help?
[23:26:00] <wycats_> if TraitA has a method foo() and TraitB has a method foo()
[23:26:06] <cmr> Oh the method names, not the trait names.
[23:26:08] <wycats_> and both are implemented on SomeType
[23:26:10] <cmr> Yeah that's unresolvable.
[23:26:10] <wycats_> cmr: right
[23:26:13] <wycats_> O_O
[23:26:19] <wycats_> so use scoping?
[23:26:22] <wycats_> and cross your fingers?
[23:26:31] <wycats_> seems important to make it resolvable
[23:26:33] <cmr> It's why you have to import the trait to call the methods in the first place.
[23:26:41] <wycats_> obviously
[23:26:43] <cmr> (solving this problem)
[23:26:51] <wycats_> pretty sure that's a normal feature of trait systems

[23:27:10] <cmr> Remember that `use` can go inside functions and such... not sure if they can go inside any block.
[23:27:12] <wycats_> import TraitA::{ foo as bar } or something

[23:29:32] <bjz> SiegeLord: from my understanding, eigen uses heavy use of templates for maximum performance

[23:30:03] <bjz> SiegeLord: that of course can lead to template explosions, as with any templated C++ lib

[23:34:29] <bjz> which was a good thing

[23:35:35] <strcat> what's the point?

[23:40:17] <jhasse> right, only library additions IIRC
[23:40:21] <strcat> not just that
[23:40:47] <strcat> better constexpr, return type inference, generic lambdas, binary literals, digit separators (apostrophes!)

[23:42:50] <strcat> joelteon: rust doesn't have it...
[23:43:02] <joelteon> 1990*
[23:43:35] <strcat> they had to add it so you can return lambdas without boxing
[23:44:01] <strcat> because they have a unique type so you can't actually write a type, or a decltype expr evaluating to the same type
[23:44:37] <benh> Maybe we should add it so we can return weird iterators without spelling out the nested types :)
