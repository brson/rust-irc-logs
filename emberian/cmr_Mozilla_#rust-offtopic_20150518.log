[00:08:07] <barosl> Yeah, something like that

[00:08:46] <eddyb> you could make the $ non-copyable
[00:08:47] <Yurumechan> that might well be possible, but will confuse another set of users including other beginners

[00:09:07] <Yurumechan> doable
[00:09:15] <c74d> I might use ‘>’ as something that people not knowing Unix shells might more likely recognize as a command prompt, but I wouldn't bother suggesting that.
[00:09:28] <Twisol> I thought about that, but copying '$ foo bar' and only pasting 'foo bar' would be cause for a double-take, at least

[00:26:13] <Tiffany> oh
[00:26:19] <eddyb> anything from kde4 is more likely to depend on a gazillion libs
[00:26:25] <Tiffany> 5?
[00:26:33] <barosl> In fact I don't know what exactly redstone is, just heard that redstones are required to make a CPU in Minecraft previously
[00:26:37] <Tiffany> most of these packages are 5.10
[00:26:38] <eddyb> Tiffany: sad
[00:26:49] <Tiffany> barosl: so, there's a few things
[00:27:03] <Tiffany> there's redstone, which you can get in survival mode, and has a few basic logic elements
[00:27:19] <Tiffany> the redstone torch acts as a NOT gate
[00:27:28] <Tiffany> signals travel 15 blocks by default, with power levels for each block
[00:27:36] <eddyb> (and can encode 16 bits per signal if you use "analog" circuit elements :P)
[00:27:39] <Tiffany> then there's the repeater, which sets the power level to 15 and is 1-way
[00:27:44] <eddyb> err, 16 states, 4 bits
[00:28:03] <Tiffany> and then there's the comparator, which is a kind of funky thing
[00:28:14] <Layl> eeeh I've gotta be careful with transferring my domain since my email's on there
[00:28:17] <Tiffany> it acts as either a transistor or as an analog subtractor depending on its configuration
[00:28:28] <barosl> So redstones are not one kind
[00:28:30] <Tiffany> the most screwy thing about redstone is the absolutely arcane rules about how signals propagate
[00:28:35] <barosl> There are several kinds of redstones
[00:28:55] <Tiffany> there's only the one redstone dust, and it is used to craft certain devices, which fall under the category "redstone"
[00:29:10] <Tiffany> redstone torches are redstone dust on a stick
[00:29:31] <Tiffany> as for command blocks, they're only available if you play the game in creative mode
[00:29:39] <Layl> I wonder if the .moe domain for my project name is taken yet
[00:29:48] <Tiffany> they are a single block, which you can insert a command string into, the same you'd get from typing / in the chat
[00:30:04] <Tiffany> and there's several commands for manipulating things in the world
[00:30:09] <Layl> aw ot
[00:30:11] <niconii> moe moe kyun
[00:30:12] <Layl> *aw it's taken
[00:30:16] <Tiffany> and there is a scoreboard system which you can abuse the fuck out of to do math
[00:30:29] <barosl> lol
[00:30:33] <barosl> Scoreboard
[00:30:37] <Tiffany> command blocks can be activated by applying a redstone signal
[00:30:41] <Tiffany> which executes the command inside
[00:31:07] <GBGamer> barosl: have you ever seen any SethBling videos?
[00:31:17] <Tiffany> sethbling abuses a weird behaviour of the game which allows you to activate a command block 20 times per second without there being any visible change
[00:31:22] <GBGamer> because they're a very good way to see how these all work together
[00:31:24] <barosl> GBGamer, Nah, I'm pretty uninformed about the Minecraft magics
[00:31:27] <Tiffany> by alternating rapidly between redstone blocks and stone blocks
[00:31:48] <Tiffany> it's kind of amazing

[00:32:44] <GBGamer> I just am always surprised :P
[00:32:53] <GBGamer> I'll shut up now
[00:33:13] <Tiffany> in the case of this sethbling video, he implemented all of the listed functions as scoreboard voodoo, and then did a sort of iterative technique of teleporting each armour stand by a certain number of blocks and subtracting that value from the scoreboard
[00:33:15] <Tiffany> until each value is 0
[00:33:30] <Tiffany> since you can't teleport by a scoreboard value

[00:34:08] <Tiffany> you can choose which entity to teleport programmatically, but you can only teleport to either a constant absolute position or to a constant relative position
[00:34:25] <GBGamer> this would actually be very useful for high schoolers learning to graph
[00:34:31] <GBGamer> in 3d
[00:34:34] <Tiffany> I don't think it would

[00:35:12] <GBGamer> but in 3d space
[00:35:26] <GBGamer> that's the issue with graphing stuff today, it's all in 2d
[00:35:28] <Tiffany> wolfram|alpha can generate 3D images of graphs
[00:35:33] <Tiffany> you can't move around, it's from a fixed perspective
[00:35:34] <GBGamer> so 3d graphs are pretty terrible

[00:37:02] <barosl> Regarding piano, how does it make a specific sound?

[00:40:43] <Tiffany> they tend to get broken pretty fast
[00:41:22] <Tiffany> the credits warp falls into the category of breaking the game

[00:45:14] <Tiffany> which includes transactional databases, like sqlite, mysql, postgres, etc
[00:45:52] <Tiffany> the pokemon thing is usually a TAS that resets the game at one very specific frame while saving your inventory data
[00:45:52] <barosl> I'm sad that Rust will reduce the number of vulnerabilities that can be used to trigger a TAS!
[00:46:10] <Tiffany> which produces a buffer overflow in your inventory, essentially giving you a hex editor

[00:46:34] <Tiffany> arbitrary code injection

[00:46:56] <GBGamer> Tiffany: I very much enjoyed MLP's theme in pokemon yellow
[00:46:59] <Tiffany> rust won't stop your game from having sequence breaks
[00:47:17] <Tiffany> or from having accelerated backwards hopping a la source
[00:49:40] <barosl> Hmm, I wonder how many vulnerabilities triggering TAS are related to memory corruption (a la unsafe code in Rust) or logic bug (which can certainly also happen in safe Rust)
[00:50:13] <barosl> I think the former cases will be reduced if the game is written in mostly safe Rust
[00:51:03] <GBGamer> barosl: there really aren't that many memory corruption bugs in games anymore
[00:51:15] <GBGamer> the vast majority of them were in games written in assembly

[00:54:32] <Tiffany> yeah, even when there are memory corruption bugs these days, they aren't often as easily exploitable as just writing shell code using koopa shells
[00:55:06] <Tiffany> memory was tightly packed, carefully laid out, and had no kind of protection
[00:55:26] <Tiffany> there was almost always something after the end of a buffer for you to smash
[00:55:45] <GBGamer> you try writing games that run quickly on that hardware, and you'll likely have some memory bugs too
[00:56:55] <Tiffany> there weren't very many pointers either, so a very high percentage of the changes you can make to memory in older games resulted in a valid enough state for the game to continue
[00:56:57] <Tiffany> instead of crashing
[00:57:29] <GBGamer> they likely used a lot of static memory
[00:57:36] <Tiffany> they likely used entirely static memory
[00:57:42] <Tiffany> well, and stack
[00:57:45] <GBGamer> ^
[00:58:06] <Tiffany> stack was mostly used for the return addresses and parameters though, not really for storing buffers
[00:58:11] <Tiffany> it was often small
[00:58:15] <Tiffany> to save memory for everything else
[00:58:24] <GBGamer> well of course
[00:58:37] <Tiffany> if the game was written in assembly there's always the possibility of it not having a stack at all and being written entirely with jumps
[00:58:47] <Tiffany> which is pretty horrifying

[01:13:05] <GBGamer> back before the AFL/NFL merger
[01:13:27] <cmr> I know nothing about american football.
[01:13:50] <GBGamer> basically, the NFL was the big league for ~40,50 years
[01:14:05] <cmr> I don't really want to know anything about american football :P
[01:14:09] <GBGamer> then, the AFL came in and started fucking shit up for them
[01:14:12] <GBGamer> then they merged
[01:14:38] <GBGamer> :P
[01:15:10] <cmr> taryn: yeah it really seems that way.
[01:15:29] <taryn> 18
[01:15:46] <cmr> I don't really want to use libudev etc because I know I can do better outside of C, but it's too much of a pain to implement their dbus variant etc.

[03:14:21] <ChrisMorgan> The Rust 1.0.0 release announcement has ended up at #29 of all time thus far on HN, at 1340 points: http://www.hntoplinks.com/all
[03:14:42] <cmr> not bad.
[03:15:38] <c74d> Is it 1.0.0 or 1.0? I see people calling it 1.0.0, but everything official seems to say 1.0, and I don't recall Rust ever using three-number versions.
[03:15:59] <cmr> c74d: we use semver, and have since I think 0.10.0, which mandates three-number versions.
[03:15:59] <ChrisMorgan> c74d: Rust follows semver, so the actual release number is 1.0.0.
[03:16:11] <c74d> huh
[03:16:22] <cmr> However, colloquially, versions will be called 1.0, 1.1, ... because patches will be very rare and inconsequential.
[03:16:24] <ChrisMorgan> Common parlance uses 1.0, however.
[03:16:29] <c74d> So Rust is actually at 0.10.0?
[03:16:33] <cmr> no, 1.0.0
[03:16:38] <ChrisMorgan> c74d: since 0.10.0 we have used semver
[03:16:46] <c74d> Oh, 0.10.0 of Semver.
[03:16:52] <c74d> …or not
[03:16:53] <cmr> No, rust 0.10.0
[03:17:03] <ChrisMorgan> We had Rust 0.9, then Rust 0.10.0.
[03:17:17] <cmr> it was actually 0.11.0, bad memory.
[03:18:40] <c74d> so… the official release announcement uses the technically incorrect numbering.
[03:18:50] <cmr> yup!

[05:39:01] <c74d> A low-ranking city bureaucrat or something was trying to surreptitiously use the city government's new computer (a room-filling, tape-drives-and-blinkenlights type) to run some calculation that would prove… that his superiors were corrupt, I think. Then the computer dies, and the protagonists… take it to the cemetery to bury it? And then before they can bury it, it gets struck by
[05:39:03] <c74d> lightning and brought back to life, and finishes the computation. >_>
[05:40:43] <c74d> and they're only burying one refrigerator-sized piece of it, which somehow finishes the calculation without being connected to the rest of it <_<

[06:36:59] <GBGamer> that sounds better for me
[06:37:12] <GBGamer> I don't feel like dying to a terrible disease
[06:38:17] <mrmonday> I tried using duolingo once, but I found their Spanish stuff being Mexican infuriating
[06:38:43] <GBGamer> mrmonday: but Mexico is, no offense, much more important than Spain
[06:38:54] <GBGamer> Spain has been a minor power since the 1800s
[06:39:08] <mrmonday> sooo many differences to what I learnt in school :L
[06:39:11] <GBGamer> while Mexico is a growing regionary power
[06:39:21] <GBGamer> s/regionary/regional
[06:39:42] <mrmonday> GBGamer: that doesn't matter to me even a little bit
[06:39:48] <c74d> I keep Wiktionary at hand, and look up the pronunciations for different accents.
[06:40:02] <GBGamer> on the whole, Mexican spanish is more useful than Spanish Spanish
[06:40:44] <c74d> …and then I confuse their voice-recognition software by speaking at it with the wrong accent. :p
[06:41:17] <huon> GBGamer: I'm sure, if you're in Europe (as I suspect mrmonday might be), Spanish Spanish is more immediately useful
[06:41:37] <GBGamer> huon: ah, well that may be true
[06:41:46] <GBGamer> for the vast majority of people, tho
[06:41:58] <GBGamer> (i.e., not Euro not Afro)
[06:42:00] <mrmonday> yes, I'm in Europe, and I'm unlikely to ever go to Mexico, or spend significant time there (same goes for the Spanish speaking parts of the US)
[06:42:34] <huon> GBGamer: you mean, "for people in the Americas"? :)
[06:42:43] <GBGamer> huon: and Asia
[06:42:47] <GBGamer> (East)
[06:43:08] <GBGamer> so that's, like, 5 billion people
[06:43:11] <huon> mexico is a long way from east asia
[06:43:28] <GBGamer> but asians are much more likely to deal with Mexico than Spain
[06:43:30] <huon> (frankly, I imagine either spanish isn't so useful for asia)
[06:43:46] <mrmonday> I'm not opposed to learning Mexican Spanish, it's just that I've invested significant time into Castillian... and it's hard to re-learn the grammar given that I'm not even close to fluent
[06:44:14] <c74d> They have different grammar?
[06:44:25] <taryn> nope
[06:44:31] <taryn> c74d: but
[06:44:35] <GBGamer> so they're really like "Italian"
[06:44:41] <GBGamer> in that they're not really a language?
[06:44:42] <mrmonday> well, not exactly

[06:44:59] <GBGamer> or are they more united than "Italian"
[06:45:50] <GBGamer> random question: why is English so unified?
[06:46:03] <mrmonday> the main thing that frustrated me (if I recall) was having to explicitly say things like "yo tengo" rather than "tengo" etc
[06:46:10] <taryn> GBGamer: it is?
[06:46:24] <GBGamer> In Canada/US/UK it seems to be
[06:46:28] <mrmonday> define unified?
[06:46:28] <taryn> well
[06:46:35] <taryn> theres a large common subset 
[06:46:41] <bstrie> GBGamer: english seems unified because, unlike most dialects which have had thousands of years to form, english was spread very very recently
[06:46:54] <taryn> but there are regional accents that few can understand
[06:46:57] <whipsch> english only really varies with spellings
[06:47:08] <GBGamer> but from what I understand of Spanish, the changes are pretty large
[06:47:09] <whipsch> oh yeah, you get some strange accents too
[06:47:15] <whipsch> but for the most part it's consistent
[06:47:24] <huon> there's lots of regional phrases/words too
[06:47:27] <Mutabah> Yeah
[06:47:39] <mrmonday> I find it hilarious whenever anyone visits me, it seems no one can understand the Glaswegian accent, it's second nature to me though :p
[06:47:40] <GBGamer> like skookum

[06:47:55] <GBGamer> ah, I guess you're right

[15:09:18] <XMPPwocky> sure, but the code parsing that might run before the bios unloads all the interesting parts
[15:09:24] <XMPPwocky> resetting the BIOS password, for example
[15:09:40] <Mutabah> Actually, the BIOS is pretty simple...
[15:09:43] <Mutabah> (EFI is not)

[15:16:06] <Tiffany> if I hadn't already decided to not play games which come with malware built in, this would make me do so
[15:16:44] <XMPPwocky> FreeFull: not quite- there are certain flags in the CPU that once set cannot be unset, for example
[15:16:47] <XMPPwocky> (without a reboot)
[15:16:56] <XMPPwocky> including a fair bit of overclocking stuff
[15:17:19] <XMPPwocky> at least in Haswell
[15:17:30] <XMPPwocky> so the vendor picks what to set, and can roll out updates to parameters via a BIOS update
[15:18:02] <FreeFull> Ah, good point
[15:18:20] <FreeFull> An OS can override the BIOS, but then you do need to reboot
[15:18:52] <XMPPwocky> Tiffany: game companies are the LAST people i want installing what are effectively rootkits
[15:19:20] <XMPPwocky> well, the last non-explicitly-malicious people
[15:19:33] <WindowsBunny> I play MapleStory
[15:19:43] <WindowsBunny> and that comes with anti-hack funstuff
[15:19:45] <Tiffany> I think a lot of anti-cheat engines count as explicitly malicious
[15:20:07] <Tiffany> some of them will shutdown your system if they detect anything malicious, and lol false positives
[15:20:26] <Tiffany> they also are a serious smell for the game's codebase
[15:20:27] <WindowsBunny> GameGuard, HackShield
[15:20:42] *** Joins: Astrum|Lap (Astrum|Lap@moz-skcefh.co.comcast.net)
[15:20:43] <XMPPwocky> and when the engines *aren't* super intrusive, if there are any cheaters, the players tend to get up in arms about wanting a more intrusive AC!
[15:20:45] <Tiffany> since it usually means they halfassed their network protocols so badly that anyone can completely wreck a server by fiddling with cheat engine
[15:20:56] <XMPPwocky> even when that wouldn't really help all that muc
[15:21:04] <WindowsBunny> Tiffany: I remember when trying to hack maplestory many years ago and my computer would blackscreen shutdown :D
[15:22:24] <XMPPwocky> like, /r/globaloffensive generally wants VAC to go kernel-mode (even when that wouldn't help all that much- they're already doing lots of clever things without it)
[15:22:48] <XMPPwocky> another trap there is that third-party ACs are super intrusive, and the leagues that use them ban lots of cheaters
[15:23:12] <XMPPwocky> the fact that they have dedicated anti-cheat admins and that most cheats aren't designed to bypass them is ignored
[15:23:47] <XMPPwocky> ESEA's anti-cheat is doing the same thing that PunkBuster did a while ago that got them in trouble
[15:23:52] <XMPPwocky> scanning physical memory
[15:24:14] <XMPPwocky> "but wait, if I just make a .js file that sprays the heap with something that seems to be cheat files, will that get people banned?"
[15:24:23] <Tiffany> hahaha
[15:24:23] <XMPPwocky> probably in ESEA, definitely in punkbuster
[15:25:17] <XMPPwocky> Software anticheat is just fundamentally a losing battle- it's effectively the same thing as DRM, except that certain users actually benefit from it
[15:25:41] <XMPPwocky> the AC loads *after* the cheat, with less privileges (the cheat gets whatever it wants- since the user installed it deliberately!)
[15:25:58] <XMPPwocky> the user's probably OK with the cheat shutting the PC down or whatever if it detects the anti-cheat doing something different...
[15:27:06] <GaryOak_> There's so many cool things I can do with a computer, but right now all I want to do is play video games

[15:28:48] <XMPPwocky> i should get into that

[15:30:03] <GaryOak_> Zoxc: I think about 20,000 it's a pretty small city, starting to build a good downtown
[15:30:35] <Tiffany> I want to play cities: skylines but it doesn't work on my computer
[15:30:45] <GaryOak_> Aww how come?
[15:30:57] <Tiffany> the first time I ran it, it managed to run, but at a low fps for about 30 minutes
[15:31:04] <Tiffany> then my computer overheated and shut off, and now the game won't start
[15:31:06] <Zoxc> I need a new GPU for it 1440p @ 83 Hz is not easy
[15:31:17] <Tiffany> presumably it corrupted itself somehow
[15:31:28] <Tiffany> but I can't find any files that it could have corrupted
[15:31:28] <GaryOak_> oh weird, I know they fixed something that helped it running on Windows quite a bit
[15:31:49] <Tiffany> I tried deleting all of the non-asset files I could find, but it didn't help
[15:31:50] <GaryOak_> It was loading way faster and everything was smoother
[15:31:54] <Tiffany> and yes, I've tried verifying the steam cache
[15:32:08] <Tiffany> maybe they changed the save format or something
[15:32:14] <XMPPwocky> 83 hz?
[15:32:15] <Tiffany> iirc windows is really slow at loading lots of little files
[15:32:18] <XMPPwocky> that seems very specific
[15:32:29] <Tiffany> yeah 83hz is a weird framerate
[15:32:33] <Tiffany> is it a CRT?
[15:32:45] <eddyb> 1440p CRT? u wot?
[15:32:53] <GaryOak_> 4K CRT lololol
[15:32:55] <XMPPwocky> twist: it's the size of a city bus

[15:34:15] <Tiffany> I think I saw a thing once about building an electron scanning microscope in your garage using a CRT electron gun
[15:35:19] <XMPPwocky> there was an interesting DIY scanning array radar 
[15:35:44] <Zoxc> XMPPwocky: Wait it's 81 Hz, and it's because of the software DVI pixel clock limit on AMD's drivers
[15:35:54] <XMPPwocky> interesitng
[15:36:19] <Zoxc> also LCD, PLS
[15:36:24] <taryn> Zoxc: you should patch the driver
[15:36:40] <Zoxc> taryn: You can't patch drivers on Windows, stuff stops working
[15:36:52] <Tiffany> heh code signing
[15:37:08] <Tiffany> you know, I forgot about VAC
[15:37:36] <taryn> Zoxc: then patch it and either re-sign or use a collision
[15:37:51] <Zoxc> I'll get a NVIDIA GPU next probably =P
[15:37:54] <Zoxc> taryn: What?
[15:37:56] <Tiffany> I'm guessing VAC has some kind of linux version
[15:38:05] <XMPPwocky> Tiffany: they do, yeah, but it's probably not as godo
[15:38:06] <taryn> Tiffany: VAC is nice, I can keep a debugger attached for debugging w/o issue
[15:38:07] <Tiffany> but it's not like it can just get root or anything
[15:38:36] <XMPPwocky> taryn: uh, if you're careful. It scans around every 5 minutes
[15:38:41] <taryn> lol, imagine a VAC kernel module
[15:38:42] <XMPPwocky> if you run with -insecure +sv_lan 1 in launch options
[15:38:49] <XMPPwocky> it'll disable everything
[15:39:05] <Tiffany> it probably scans through /proc or something?
[15:39:13] <XMPPwocky> Tiffany: yeah, and without root you can just use /proc/foo/mem
[15:39:18] <Tiffany> the wikipedia page says it scans through "the computer's memory"
[15:39:22] <taryn> XMPPwocky: well, given that if you set an env var, it attaches gdb for you
[15:39:28] <XMPPwocky> taryn: huh.
[15:39:29] <Tiffany> which you need root to scan through processes other than your own
[15:39:38] <XMPPwocky> iirc there's a kernel patch to allow that w/o first ptracing it
[15:39:50] <taryn> XMPPwocky: anywho, using gdb was very helpful in tracking down a bl2 bug
[15:39:57] <XMPPwocky> bl2 doesn't even have VAC though?
[15:40:02] <XMPPwocky> borderlands 2 you mean
[15:40:05] <taryn> which, dispite me having reported it, and given an example patch was never fixed
[15:40:11] <XMPPwocky> Windows has syscalls designed to read/write other processes' memory, for some reason
[15:40:33] <Tiffany> is windows deliberately designed to be insecure, or what
[15:40:45] <XMPPwocky> something something nsa *spooky noises*
[15:40:47] <Tiffany> I wonder what VAC does if /proc isn't available

[16:20:12] <Sho> eddyb: nope but cmr mentioned you're working on something IDE-ish
[16:20:35] <eddyb> right, so, it's a small demo, nothing you can use for anything other than showing off
[16:20:47] <eddyb> Sho: https://github.com/eddyb/r3
[16:21:02] <eddyb> Sho: the PDF has some screenshots, but the quality isn't amazing
[16:21:15] <eddyb> I wish chrome had better history search
[16:22:01] <Sho> it would definitely be super cool for someone to start a real Rust-for-KDevelop project ... it does pretty fancy static analysis for C++ and Python, the former with its own parser+AST+DUChain impl, and the Python plugin reuses CPython's parser and maps it to KDevelop's DUChain
[16:22:19] <eddyb> I actually didn't tackle completion because it depends on things like https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/25390

[16:29:07] <Tiffany> a number of them do it, lahwran
[16:29:23] <eddyb_> and have to pull through the last two weeks
[16:29:23] <lahwran> I wonder if you could undetectably run windows in a hypervisor
[16:29:30] <lahwran> and then do cheating that way
[16:29:38] <Tiffany> I think some of them try to detect when they run in virtual machines
[16:29:45] <Tiffany> I don't know which ones, or if they are successful
[16:29:46] <eddyb_> easy
[16:29:50] <lahwran> it's one thing to run in a full vm
[16:29:50] <eddyb_> use qemu
[16:30:00] <eddyb_> fake PCI devices
[16:30:01] <lahwran> it's quite another to run in an almost-entirely-passthrough hypervisor
[16:30:12] <lahwran> vms typically have identifiable hardware
[16:30:23] <eddyb_> they don't have to work, just not make the driver cause a BSOD
[16:30:29] <lahwran> eddyb_: what
[16:30:43] <Tiffany> you can usually assume that if a computer has both a floppy drive and 4 gigabytes of memory, it's a virtual machine
[16:30:47] <eddyb_> qemu is quite nice for a C codebase
[16:30:53] <lahwran> what are you even saying, eddyb_ 
[16:30:54] <Sho> eddyb_: skimming the PDF right now, looks very cool
[16:31:10] <eddyb_> lahwran: fake the device tree of a real PC
[16:31:13] <eddyb_> in qemu
[16:31:16] <lahwran> oh
[16:31:53] <eddyb_> but then again, qemu doesn't have passthrough OpenGL AFAIK
[16:31:56] <lahwran> seems like it'd be dramatically easier to write a small hypervisor that passes everything through but can hijack ram
[16:32:05] <eddyb_> so not the best idea for a game
[16:32:07] <lahwran> yeah you'd need to pass through total control of the graphics card
[16:32:09] <lahwran> not just the graphics api
[16:34:39] <eddyb_> Sho: btw, the (tiny) scenegraph is statically typed

[16:39:02] <eddyb_> I have an acquired distaste for anything that vaguely resembles the DOM
[16:39:38] <eddyb_> in terms of nodes connected through pointers
[16:39:40] <Sho> eddyb_: I was hacking on a IRC text display widget implemented in Qt Quick's scenegraph a while ago, with texture sharing+atlasing for things like nicks, and just moving identical lines (like joins, say) in the scene when switching channels
[16:40:10] <eddyb_> ugh
[16:40:51] <eddyb_> that sounds like the DOM tricks I've employed for an older web-based editor attempt
[16:41:00] <eddyb_> just lower level
[16:43:47] <eddyb_> hmm, scrolling text could blit for the most part

[17:54:27] <Aerdan> Not really. If the tool does all the work of converting the information into a format I can use right away, that's a net win. Because it means I, a fallible human being who makes typoes, can spend time doing work that a tool cannot.

[18:10:49] <bstrie> 90s-style rpgs occupy a strange limbo where they're too unimpressive by modern standards to have AAA studios throwing millions of dollars at them, but they're still too much effort to make the genre appeal to indie developers

[22:17:42] <fmtq> I don't know where you live

[22:18:11] <Astrum|Lap> I used to live in las vegas
[22:18:21] <Sho> the lack of privacy is the weirdest thing about COMMUNIST SWEDEN to me
[22:18:34] <fmtq> people in Sweden leave their curtains open
[22:18:40] <Astrum|Lap> where grocery stores have slot machines
[22:18:47] <Astrum|Lap> and gas stations have vast selections of alcohol
[22:18:53] <fmtq> in Germany, truck stops have slot machines.
[22:19:01] <fmtq> and... vast selections of alcohol
[22:19:10] <Astrum|Lap> yeah well, every place has slot machines in vegas
[22:19:20] <Astrum|Lap> getting your hair cut? play slots while you wait
[22:19:24] <Astrum|Lap> waiting for your flight? slots
[22:19:31] <fmtq> how the fuck else would a city _in the fucking desert_ survive?
[22:19:36] <Sho> My mother's German boyfriend used to work for a slot machine maker for 35 years, I was always amazed they stayed in business
[22:19:36] <Astrum|Lap> picking your kid up from daycare? slots
[22:20:09] <GaryOak_> at the doctor, you guessed it, slots
[22:20:09] <Astrum|Lap> anyway, I still maintain I should marry rich or win the lotto
[22:20:12] <Astrum|Lap> it's a good plan
[22:20:25] <fmtq> shut up your plan is stupid
[22:20:29] <fmtq> i'm getting married for no reason

[22:22:57] <fmtq> there is some evidence I have a damaged brain

[22:23:57] <fmtq> but better, it's called "Oatly" here.
[22:23:58] <fmtq> OATLY
[22:24:06] <fmtq> I want to have a child and name it Oatly

[22:24:55] <Sho> Making almond milk is fun
[22:25:33] <VShell> I like almond milk.
[22:25:57] <Astrum|Lap> they sell dark chocolate almond milk at my local store
[22:26:04] <Sho> Mostly because it's just easy enough to be attainable for lazy people like me and the results are tasy in disproportion to the effort
