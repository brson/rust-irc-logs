[00:43:43] <Ilari> ... ~200k devices still vulernable to Heartbleed.
[00:52:52] <Ilari> Wonder how many of those are servers and how many are something else.
[00:54:06] <tiffany> probably most are embedded devices
[00:54:12] <tiffany> routers and printers exposed to the internet and such
[00:54:29] <tiffany> although that begs the question of how you would measure how many embedded devices are vulnerable

[05:09:05] <Dcoder> Ilari: non-binary koblitz means curves with endomorphisms
[05:09:17] <Dcoder> the "koblitz" nomenclature is not really accurate, but it seems to have stuck
[05:09:34] <Dcoder> namely gmaxwell was implicitly defending secp256k1
[05:12:26] <Dcoder> wrt Semaev's new algorithm, it's noteworthy that the constant factor decreased enough to make it "practical" from 2000 to 210
[05:13:28] <Dcoder> even if the attack required no memory it'd be simply a certificational attack, though
[05:32:16] <Ilari> Yeah, even the cutoff is too high to be practical.

[06:35:58] <bascule> Ilari: lol yeah
[06:37:01] <Ilari> I think MS only supports ORTC for p2p media, not SDP.
[06:42:03] <Ilari> Also, turns out some WebRTC implementations don't know how to handle IPv6 candidates (even to just to treat those as unusable).
[06:51:23] <Ilari> SDP is a mess.
[06:52:30] <Ilari> SBC vendors love it (job security).
[07:06:46] <Ilari> Wonder what the heck the Firefox ALT-SVC bug is. I can't seem to find description of what actually goes wrong.
[07:08:27] <Ilari> Couple possibilities that spring to mind: 1) Firefox can bundle https:// connections to oppsec http:// without checking that the certificate is valid. 2) ALT-SVC received from oppsec http:// connection is handled incorrectly.

[07:31:13] <Ilari> Or 3) whole certificate validation in presence of ALT-SVC is just busted.

[22:14:33] <Ilari> Okay, I think signatures will be another pretty strong consensus.
[22:32:42] <bascule> heh
[22:32:42] <bascule> yeah
[22:32:53] <bascule> was an oddly pointed question
[22:32:57] <bascule> "do we care about NIST?"
[22:32:58] <bascule> tl;dr: no
[22:33:46] <bascule> should we care about the Russian digital signature standard
[22:34:35] <Ilari> Curves not compatible anyway. :->
[22:39:38] <bascule> hahaha
[22:39:43] <bascule> let's make FrankenECDSA!
[22:55:38] <Ilari> One possible scheme (x is private key, M is message, public key is A, signature is (R,s)) : a=HMAC-H(x, "signature key"), A=aG, r = HMAC-H(HMAC-H(x, "nonce key"), M), R=rG, s = r + H(encode(R)|encode(A)|M)*a mod l.
[22:56:34] <Ilari> If G is basepoint of Ed25519 curve and H is SHA-512, that should be verify-compatible with Ed25519 signature primitive.
[23:00:05] <Ilari> Or if you like to troll TLS folks, put TLS PRF in place of those HMAC-H's.
[23:03:11] <Ilari> I.e. a=TLSPRF(x, "ecidsa signature key"), A=aG, r = TLSPRF(x, "ecidsa nonce key", M), R=rG, s = r + H(encode(R)|encode(A)|M)*a mod l.
