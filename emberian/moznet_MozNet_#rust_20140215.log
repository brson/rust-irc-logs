[00:19:48] <o11c> < strcat> if rust gets associated constants, associated types, integers as type parameters, single inheritance for structs, GADTs, HKTs, enum refinement, [...] then it's going to be pretty complex
[00:19:53] <o11c> but it's *needed* complexity
[00:20:05] <o11c> complexity is not automatically bad, it only needs to be questioned

[00:20:49] <tjc> I agree with strcat -- there's no such thing as "needed complexity" in a vacuum. the question is what principle(s) necessitate including it in the language.
[00:20:57] <strcat> some people seemed to have reservations about the interactions between HKT and default type parameters but I don't know exactly what the problems are with that

[01:26:41] <blaenk> in http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/0.9/tutorial.html#trait-objects-and-dynamic-method-dispatch , could draw_all's parameter type have been &[&Drawable]? does that make any sense? are there disadvantages from using that over &[@Drawable]?
[01:27:05] <blaenk> or can you not have an array of references, like in C++
[01:27:23] <blaenk> or vector, rather
[01:27:46] <blaenk> so perhaps &[~Drawable]?
[01:28:31] <Eridius> &[&Drawable] is legitimate
[01:29:03] <blaenk> ah okay. I'm still trying to understand the differences and when to use each, but oen thing I think I've learned is that & is the most 'universal', that it'll work with more things
[01:29:19] <blaenk> so what I'm wondering is if there was any particular reason for having made it &[@Drawable] there, any advantage over having made it &
[01:29:21] <kmc> & says that the allocation is somebody else's problem
[01:29:29] <blaenk> ah ok
[01:29:33] <kmc> it's "borrowed"
[01:29:51] <Eridius> blaenk: the tutorial on master uses &[~Drawable] instead: http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/master/tutorial.html#trait-objects-and-dynamic-method-dispatch

[03:12:13] <blaenk> I'm trying to make sense of how the tutorial says that visibility occurs at module boundaries. so if I have a module 'farm' with a public struct 'farmer' with private field 'age', I can access 'farmer' outside 'farm' but not 'age'. but within the 'farm' module, I can access the 'age'?
[03:13:27] <blaenk> to rephrase, I think I understand module visibility but what I'm confused about is how it relates to structure field visibility, if at all

[04:20:39] <jakerr> I'm thinking of a data structure I'd like. I wonder if it's something I need to build or if it already exists. It's a vector with copy on write elements that can be shared with multiple tasks. Tasks can only mutate elements not the vector itself. Once each task reports completion the edits are committed back to the original collection, however the commits are in inverse task-priority (an arbitrary priority that I keep track of in a
[04:20:39] <jakerr>  coordinating task) order.
[04:21:43] <jakerr> The priority logic doesn't need to be part of the data-structure, of course.
[04:22:17] <jakerr> So it's just a collection that you can mutate the elements, and at some point say 'commit' and the original backing data is updated?

[07:35:46] <Eridius> I suppose it makes sense that it can't call the generic method, because it needs to have access to the AST of the method in order to monomorphize it for the call in question

[09:27:45] <ChrisMorgan> huon: did you try asking GitHub if they could free up the username huon for you to move from huonw to huon?
[09:29:52] <eddyb> also, reddit :P
[09:30:34] <ChrisMorgan> I'm just about ask if they could release teepee, squatted since mid-2009, for the organisation for the new rust-http project. I found a handy clause in their ToS which would allow exactly this: "GitHub, in its sole discretion, has the right to suspend or terminate  your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the  Service, or any other GitHub service, for any reason at any time."
[09:31:33] <eddyb> h-tee-tee-pee?
[09:32:16] <ChrisMorgan> That's the derivation.
[09:32:25] <ChrisMorgan> It's the only name I've come up with that I actually like.
[09:33:20] <eddyb> now that I've added hyphens... "tea pee" is quite close... but teepee is a good name anyways :)

[09:35:48] <ChrisMorgan> diverse: there, it wasn't just you!

[15:34:01] <SiegeLord> These specific benchmarks are a bit silly... they should test stuff that you're legitimately unlikely to reimplement, like IO
[15:34:22] <SiegeLord> Or they should test the overhead of the language abstractions...

[15:40:35] <Matthias247> A meaningful benchmark would first warm up the VM and then start the timer and the code-to-benchmark
[15:41:21] <SiegeLord> Like if you're running a configure script on an OS with the applications being built in Rust, you want the startup time to be negligible

[18:02:51] <eddyb> Ms2ger: what exactly are you working with?
[18:03:03] <eddyb> then why did you use the word "allocate"?
[18:03:14] <eddyb> is it an Iterator<u16>?
[18:03:23] <Ms2ger> I've got a &[u16] representing a ucs-2 string, and I want case-insensitive hashing
[18:03:33] <eddyb> aaah
[18:03:49] <eddyb> so you have something like struct CaseInsensitive(Ucs2String)?
[18:03:59] <eddyb> or rather, Ucs2Slice
[18:04:04] <Ms2ger> So I don't actually have the vector I want to hash in memory

[20:34:18] <speckle> adridu59, I'd think it would be the same way you export other executables.  You can add the install folder of Rust to the PATH, or make a symlink in a folder like /usr/bin.  The question is which is the more appropriate method, and it would probably be better to ask the gurus for your OS.

[21:45:05] <kimundi> klzzvn: returning self.orders[0] would mean moving out the ~Order from index 0.
[21:45:32] <kimundi> And Rust enables you to do that by invalidating the whole vector in the process
[21:46:05] <klzzvn> kimundi: yeah, i think i get that... 
[21:46:18] <kimundi> if you want to only remove the first element, you'd need to either call the right method for that, or clone index 0 out of there.

All reference work with lifetimes, but if you want to express the "link" between two different references, you need to use this notation. The function can be read as "for all possible lifetimes 'a, the function first takes a mutable reference to something with lifetime 'a and retunrs a mutable reference to something else with lifetime 'a"

[22:25:17] <claude> speaking of syntax, can range_inclusive become part of the prelude?

[22:36:50] <andor> :\ well i guess i can still type foo(match bar { T(baz) => baz });
[22:37:19] <kimundi> andor: or write a method that does that
[22:37:47] <kimundi> Or "let T(baz) = bar;" etc
[22:38:22] <andor> code generation wise, is there any difference?
[22:38:37] <andor> between match and let deconstruct,
[22:38:43] <kimundi> shouldn't be
[22:39:23] <kimundi> After llvm is done with it, both should lead to the same assembly if it does the same on a language level

[22:44:12] <andor> if (foo.as_slice() == bar) autoborrowed bar
[22:44:41] <andor> match foo.as_slice() { bar => ..., _ => ... }; doesn't seem to

[22:55:40] <andor> hmm, this is odd, i'm using sodiumoxide, and it does some reexport magic to make things simpler, however...
[22:56:06] <andor> sodiumoxide::crypto::asymmetricbox reexports everything from another module
[22:56:16] <andor> basically it does:
[22:56:18] <andor> pub use self::curve25519xsalsa20poly1305::*;
[22:56:20] *** Quits: lpy (lpy@3481A86.D40F0E75.E99F7FDB.IP) (Ping timeout)
[22:56:20] <andor> pub mod curve25519xsalsa20poly1305;
[22:56:42] <andor> now, that module defines some structs, some statics and some functions, too
[22:57:04] <andor> at the top of my own file, i have: use sodiumoxide::crypto;
[22:57:25] <sfackler> wow, that's some module name
[22:57:29] <andor> and using `crypto::asymmetricbox::PUBLICKEYBYTES` compiles fine
[22:57:36] <andor> since it's reeexported
[22:57:47] <andor> however, if i do `use sodiumoxide::crypto::asymmetricbox::{PublicKey, PrivateKey};`
[22:58:02] <andor> it tells me there's no PublicKey and PrivateKey in asymmetricbox

[23:05:33] <Boreeas> don't know why i didn't see it
[23:05:47] <huon> andor: you need to use a fixed-length vector
[23:05:54] <huon> ~[] is dynamic

[23:06:39] <huon> andor: [a[0], a[1], ...]
[23:07:04] <Eridius> andor: you can create [0u8, ..PUBLICKEYBYTES] then copy data from your dynamic to your fixed-length
[23:07:17] <huon> andor: let mut v = [0, .. length]; for (out, val) in v.mut_iter().zip(your_twiddle_vec.iter()) { *out = *val }
