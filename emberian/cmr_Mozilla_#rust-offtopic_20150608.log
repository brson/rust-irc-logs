[03:36:15] <c74d> Hm. I wonder whether systemd's QR-code renderer can be used at the user level to copy arbitrary text to a smartphone.
[03:36:36] <XMPPwocky> why does systemd have a qr-code renderer
[03:36:51] <XMPPwocky> does it have an RSS reader and toenail clipper too
[03:37:40] <c74d> I doubt it has a toenail clipper; I don't know about a RSS reader.
[03:39:55] <Astrum|Lap> still, why does it have a qr-code renderer?
[03:40:41] <Astrum|Lap> I can see why there's controversy over it -_-
[03:41:10] <cmr> http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.redhat.fedora.devel/169082
[03:41:31] <c74d> I thought it was for links to error message explanations, but, Googling it, it seems to be for key exchange.
[03:42:56] <Astrum|Lap> "The QR code stuff is for showing a scannable QR code for the FSS sealing
[03:42:56] <Astrum|Lap> key. It's a gimmick."
[03:43:36] <Astrum|Lap> that's a long thread
[03:43:47] <Astrum|Lap> oh well, I don't care
[03:45:23] <c74d> I guess qrencode is a library, and I doubt I can get systemd to render an arbitrary QR code for me…
[03:47:57] <c74d> No, seems there's a qrencode program too.
[03:48:15] <c74d> Now, how does one connect a NixOS system to Wi-Fi?
[03:48:35] <XMPPwocky> c74d: install networkmanager and use nmcli, that's what i did
[03:48:54] <XMPPwocky> there's a wireless enabling option which works in some other way
[03:48:59] <c74d> wifi-menu not found; nmcli not found; could just use wpa_supplicant but I fear I'd mess with the magic…
[03:49:09] <c74d> XMPPwocky: oh, it doesn't come with that…
[03:49:21] <c74d> wait, how am I supposed to install NetworkManager?
[03:49:37] <XMPPwocky> c74d: networking.networkmanager.enable = true; in configuration.nix
[03:49:44] <c74d> …and then?
[03:49:50] <XMPPwocky> and then nixos-rebuild switch
[03:49:58] <XMPPwocky> and now you have networkmanager
[03:50:19] <c74d> Where does it get NetworkManager from though? It's not connected to the Internet.
[03:50:26] <XMPPwocky> ... that's a good point :P
[03:50:36] <XMPPwocky> try it and see? it may come locally
[03:53:08] <c74d> Eh, I'll just use wpa_supplicant. If the magic breaks… fine, it's just a temporary environment running off a live-SD-card.
[03:53:29] <c74d> (I prefer using wpa_supplicant directly, anyway.)
[03:53:29] <XMPPwocky> i don't think wpa_supplicant is included by default either
[03:53:35] <c74d> … D:
[03:53:49] <c74d> It is here.
[03:53:55] <XMPPwocky> possibly networking.wireless.enable = true; will fix that
[03:54:04] <c74d> At least, there's an executable by that name.
[03:54:42] <c74d> …oh, but Nix might not like me editing configuration files as if this was a normal Linux distribution.
[03:54:55] <XMPPwocky> apparently you can in fact edit /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf
[03:55:08] <XMPPwocky> c74d: as far as i can tell, anything that's generated isn't writable anyways
[03:55:21] <XMPPwocky> http://nixos.org/nixos/manual/sec-networking.html see section 10.6 for wireless info
[03:55:37] <XMPPwocky> looks like that wireless.enable setting just starts wpa_supplicant in system

[04:08:57] <c74d> …nixos-rebuild's build-vm command is impressing me enough that I was briefly tempted to just install NixOS.
[04:09:15] <cmr> Sounds like it makes a VM image from the current state of the system?
[04:09:20] <c74d> I guess it's not really all that difficult to implement though.
[04:09:49] <c74d> “Build a script that starts a NixOS virtual machine with the desired configuration.”
[04:11:21] <c74d> “The VM mounts the Nix store of the host through the 9P file system.”
[04:13:13] <c74d> I ran `nixos-rebuild test` (like `nixos-rebuild switch`, but doesn't try to change a supposed GRUB configuration), and now it's trying to download lots of stuff and failing. :/
[04:15:30] <c74d> `systemctl restart wpa_supplicant` (a blind guess, never having really used systemd before) seems to have worked, though.
[04:20:00] <adu> NixOS?
[04:20:16] <cmr> adu: it's an operating system built around the Nix package manager.
[04:20:30] <adu> "completely declarative"?
[04:20:38] <adu> how is that different from other linuxes?
[04:22:03] <adu> or other package managers?
[04:22:19] <c74d> I don't think they've achieved *complete* declarative-ness yet, but that would mean defining as much as one wants about the desired state of the system as configuration, rather than using programs to *imperatively* change the state of the system.
[04:22:45] <adu> like amazon cloudformation?
[04:22:58] <cmr> somewhat.
[04:23:49] <adu> I'm still a big fan of copying over a file of package names to a new server and running $(sudo apt-get install $(cat packages.txt))
[04:23:53] <c74d> E.g., defining what software one wants installed in configuration files, rather than using a command (which is still available) to install/uninstall software.
[04:25:03] <c74d> Okay, now that I've connected to the Internet, what was it that I was going to install…
[04:25:11] <c74d> …oh, of course, Rust.
[04:25:12] <adu> lol
[04:27:29] <c74d> …I regret giving my ZFS pool the relatively long name `zpool-e659a-0-1` now that I've realized that NixOS doesn't include the ZFS Bash-completion script.
[04:29:08] <adu> lol
[04:29:41] <adu> c74d: are you using zfs on linux or solaris?
[04:30:26] <c74d> adu: ZFS on Linux.
[04:32:41] <adu> huh, last time I checked it was solaris only
[04:33:23] <cmr> there's been ports for linux for awhile.
[04:33:41] <cmr> both in userspace via FUSE and in kernel land.
[04:33:48] <c74d> adu: <http://open-zfs.org>
[04:33:51] <adu> I see that, it looks like it dates back to 2013
[04:34:06] <adu> I think last time I checked was 2012
[04:34:45] <c74d> The FUSE version was allegedly awful and resulted in PR problems for the kernel-land version.
[04:35:00] <adu> I've been debating on using ceph or zfs for my home media server
[04:36:30] <c74d> Using Ceph is orthogonal to using ZFS.
[04:36:43] <adu> I've only got 5.5TB, so I could just get a 6TB drive
[04:36:44] <Astrum|Lap> I've never even heard of ceph
[04:36:50] <Astrum|Lap> and is zfs still a thing?
[04:36:57] <cmr> zfs is still a huge thing.
[04:37:03] <adu> ceph is huge
[04:37:03] <c74d> Astrum|Lap: certainly it is, why wouldn't it be?
[04:37:31] <Astrum|Lap> well... kind of from an OSX perspective, we've been waiting for zfs to replace hfs+ for... I dunno, 10 years? =P
[04:39:00] <cmr> feh, OSX
[04:39:32] <c74d> Apple OS X can't run software that's only for Microsoft Windows, that doesn't mean that software that's only for Microsoft Windows isn't a thing. :p
[04:40:03] <Astrum|Lap> c74d: okay, my question was a bit over the top =P
[04:40:04] <c74d> adu: I.e., Ceph runs *on top* of ZFS or whatever other filesystem you use.
[04:40:19] <Astrum|Lap> but I haven't followed fs development for a while now
[04:40:23] <adu> c74d: then I'm going to use both! :)
[04:43:25] <c74d> adu: If you're planning to run this system on Linux, the Linux distributions with the best support for ZFS are RHEL (which the main developer of the Linux port uses) and Gentoo Linux (which the second-most active developer is also a developer of), and seemingly NixOS (which seems to stay even more up-to-date than Gentoo despite not having a ZFS developer maintaining the packages).
[04:44:05] <adu> c74d: I am unfamiliar with all of those
[04:44:36] <Astrum|Lap> it's because gentoo is too busy compiling
[04:44:51] <adu> the only two I am confortable using are Debian and Fedora
[04:45:08] <c74d> (I think it's more that the Gentoo packager is too busy working.)
[04:45:46] <c74d> adu: I'd recommend Fedora, which is sort of the free version of RHEL.
[04:46:40] <c74d> Why do you need *distributed* storage for a home media server, though?
[04:46:49] <adu> c74d: why not?
[04:47:17] <adu> but also because it's hard to find a 10TB drive these days
[04:47:49] <c74d> mm, unnecessary overhead and complexity, unless your home media server is actually a cluster of servers.
[04:48:33] <c74d> ZFS is designed to easily manage arrays of multiple drives operated by a single computer.
[04:48:42] <adu> well it needs to have at least 5.5TB, but I imagine that once I've got it setup I will use more of it
[04:53:10] <XMPPwocky> after thirty minutes, i can now play music from mpd and watch youtube at the same time
[04:53:18] <XMPPwocky> why is linux audio so awful :(
[04:53:49] <Astrum|Lap> I don't know, but I'm going to blame creative anyway
[04:56:14] <c74d> adu: I recommend talking to the ZFS on Linux channel (#zfsonlinux, network chat.freenode.net, port 7000) about your system; they should be able to help you with planing it and installing and using ZFS (not now though, the channel's too much asleep).

[10:17:16] <eddyb> c74d: well, for example, there's this thing in the linux kernel... BFD? BFQ? something to do with filtering
[10:17:39] <eddyb> c74d: it's JITted but AFAIK it's not turing-complete
[10:17:51] <eddyb> c74d: if you were to implement that in hardware, it wouldn't be turing-complete either
[10:19:41] <mrmonday> BPF?
[10:19:49] <eddyb> yeah, thanks
[10:20:08] <mrmonday> Berkeley Packet Filter is the full name

[10:21:27] <mrmonday> no idea if they also do jitting or not
[10:22:24] <eddyb> and people laughed at the idea of JS JITting in the kernel

[10:27:01] <mrmonday> I hadn't actually thought of it like that... every example I've ever seen just makes a static byte array
[10:27:11] <eddyb> they're examples for a reason :P

[10:27:44] <eddyb> I'm expecting the typical usecase to be an adaptive firewall or something
[10:28:01] <eddyb> or reactive, I should say
[10:28:35] <eddyb> mrmonday: not indicative of real-world uses, maybe. they might still be good examples to get the thing working
[10:28:42] <eddyb> (and then you start generating bytecode dynamically)
[10:28:49] <mrmonday> I'm more of a "do everything in userland" kinda guy, which makes BPF useless anyway :3
[10:29:39] <eddyb> I do think a proper optimized filter is better
[10:29:59] <mrmonday> there's nothing to stop you doing that in userland though
[10:30:02] <eddyb> you get to use SSE to do crazy things and you may even get some of that for free from a compiler
[10:30:28] <mrmonday> really depends on the use case, I guess
[10:30:42] <eddyb> at which point you're IO-bound
[10:31:22] <mrmonday> all the networky stuff I've done recently you bypass the kernel as much as possible to get rid of the overhead of system calls/memory copying etc
[10:32:18] <mrmonday> makes it possible to saturate Nx10gig links, which you can't do with the stuff Linux provides
[10:33:13] <mrmonday> (actually, zero-copy AF_PACKET might manage it/get close to managing it, I haven't actually tried - I just went straight to netmap/DPDK)

[19:10:37] *** jackh is now known as Astrum|Lap
[19:10:44] <eddyb> you are weird
[19:10:49] <eddyb> there is already a jack
[19:10:53] <eddyb> he's a Servo dev
[19:10:59] <Astrum|Lap> what?!
[19:11:01] <Astrum|Lap> ugh
[19:11:10] <Astrum|Lap> everyone always has one of my names

[19:11:29] <Astrum|Lap> to be fair, jack isn't even my real name
[19:11:44] <eddyb> jack the ripper is not your real name?
[19:11:48] <Astrum|Lap> well yes, but I'd be jackh

[19:25:46] <XMPPwocky> eddyb: -Q won't work on shared libraries
[19:26:04] <XMPPwocky> iirc libwine.so breaks 
[19:27:07] <eddyb> oh
[19:27:10] <eddyb> why?
[19:27:23] <XMPPwocky> idk, i just had a similar problem
[19:29:07] <eddyb> Tobba: it's finding lots of paths in bc
[19:29:15] <eddyb> almost 500
[19:29:15] <dfockler> the amd proprietary driver failed on linux now I can only boot into safe mode :(
[19:29:35] <eddyb> yes, I am fuzzing a calculator
[19:29:54] <Tobba> lol
[19:30:00] <Tobba> eddyb: did you find any crashes yet
[19:30:05] <eddyb> I am slightly bored out of my mind
[19:30:09] <eddyb> Tobba: it takes longer than perl
[19:30:21] <eddyb> then again, I didn't start with /dev/urandom spew
[19:30:29] <eddyb> (which I did with perl)
[19:30:35] <Astrum|Lap> so has anyone gotten rust to work on ios?
[19:30:44] <Astrum|Lap> curious if anyone has looked into metal for rust yet
[19:31:02] <eddyb> Astrum|Lap: there a thread on reddit about writing a full GUI app for iOS in Rust
[19:31:13] <fkaa_> Astrum|Lap: there will probably be a gfx_device_metal

[19:32:47] <eddyb> XMPPwocky: grrr I just want to run wine under afl-fuzz -Q :(
[19:32:50] <cmr> Allow me to enumerate the current set of relevant graphics APIs: GNMX, DX12, DX9, OpenGL 2.1, 3.2, 4.5, GLES 2, 3, Metal, Vulkan, Mantle

[19:33:13] <XMPPwocky> ah, right
[19:33:38] <eddyb> meh I'm not sure I can crash bc
[19:33:42] <Astrum|Lap> cmr: mantle isn't relevant
[19:33:49] <XMPPwocky> i mean, wine crashes itself pretty well
[19:33:58] <eddyb> lol
[19:33:59] <cmr> Astrum|Lap: Studios are still porting engines to it, so I disagree.
[19:34:09] <Astrum|Lap> seriously?
[19:34:10] <eddyb> XMPPwocky: I wanted wine so I can fuzz windows programs
[19:34:17] <Astrum|Lap> I thought AMD wasn't really going to do anything with mantle
[19:34:18] <eddyb> XMPPwocky: though I'm not sure how to wrap them
[19:34:24] <Astrum|Lap> and a lot of the ideas were used in Vulkan
[19:34:39] <eddyb>   -f file       - location read by the fuzzed program (stdin)
[19:34:42] <cmr> Yes, both Vulkan and DX12 are based entirely on Mantle.
[19:34:45] <eddyb> okay, that solved that problem
[19:35:10] <eddyb>   -C            - crash exploration mode (the peruvian rabbit thing)
[19:35:13] <eddyb> huh
[19:35:17] <XMPPwocky> eddyb: it's super neat
[19:35:28] <eddyb> oh I guess I could use -C on the perl one
[19:35:28] <XMPPwocky> eddyb: it tries to find different ways to trigger the same crash
[19:35:31] <Astrum|Lap> hmm
[19:35:40] <Astrum|Lap> well, as a non-professional gamedev
[19:35:46] <Astrum|Lap> I don't have to worry about mantle =P
[19:35:55] <Astrum|Lap> just vulkan, metal, and dx12
[19:36:28] <cmr> Your GPU can't even run any of those graphics APIs, so that's a pretty aggressive stance to have.

[20:54:00] <Tobba> brilliant
[20:54:22] <eddyb> fmtq: this is sad https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ev5vx6Zb95I
[20:54:37] <WindowsBunny> Tobba: It just so happens that 420 is the number of unique .lib names in the Windows 8.1 SDK
[20:54:42] <WindowsBunny> Purely coincidental
[20:54:45] <cmr> Surely.
[20:55:32] <Tobba> I'm sure someone at MS will feel bad about adding another one at some point
[20:56:59] <eddyb> ogham: it registers no paths
[20:57:03] <eddyb> ogham: other than the initial one
[20:57:17] <ogham> eddyb: java, or afl?
[20:57:20] <eddyb> afl
[20:57:32] <eddyb> like it's running a command that ignores the input
[20:57:45] <eddyb> and HelloWorld.class in the cwd is getting modified
[20:57:54] <eddyb> and the java command works outside of afl
[20:58:25] <eddyb> qemu should be able to handle the JIT and whatnot
[20:58:32] <WindowsBunny> eddyb: friggin, I have a context object that I need to pass to RegisterWaitForSingleObject
[20:58:35] <eddyb> wine doesn't work, but wine does weirder things
[20:58:38] <ogham> I'm looking up what command I used
[20:58:41] <WindowsBunny> but I can't make the context object until I get the handle that RegisterWaitForSingleObject passes to me
[20:58:43] <WindowsBunny> Q_Q
[20:58:52] <Astrum|Lap> yay, memset in C++ code
[20:58:55] <Astrum|Lap> I am filled with confidence
[20:59:22] <WindowsBunny> Fuck it, I'm going to make the context object start with an invalid handle, and then call RegisterWaitForSingleObject a pointer to that handle in the context object
[21:00:27] <eddyb> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLprVF6d7Ug why is this not 8K for me?
[21:01:11] <WindowsBunny> eddyb: I see the options fine http://i.imgur.com/FPfZphH.png
[21:01:34] <eddyb> hehe
[21:01:49] <eddyb> WindowsBunny: flash or HTML5?
[21:01:55] <WindowsBunny> eddyb: html5 duh
[21:02:06] <ogham> 138          mp4        7680x4320  DASH video 26163k , 24fps, video only, 315.97MiB
[21:02:30] <eddyb> HTML5 used to suck for a few reasons for me
[21:02:32] <dfockler> it's still buffering...
[21:03:01] <eddyb> oh, yeah
[21:03:03] <WindowsBunny> It should take about 16 minutes to buffer for me
[21:03:11] <eddyb> the viewport is broken with HTML5
[21:03:17] <eddyb> it's smaller than the control bar
[21:03:28] <ogham> youtube-dl has saved my sanity
[21:03:33] <ogham> I hate playing videos in a browser
[21:03:34] <WindowsBunny> now to let it buffer
[21:03:46] <WindowsBunny> that makes me wonder....
[21:03:46] <eddyb> holy shit it's struggling
[21:03:59] <eddyb> WindowsBunny: ot
[21:04:06] <eddyb> WindowsBunny: it's loading for me faster than it's playing
[21:04:09] <ogham> I like how the video is 8K, and the audio is only 128k aac
[21:04:14] <WindowsBunny> xD
[21:04:21] <WindowsBunny> Oh cool, keepvid lets me download the video
[21:04:29] <dfockler> If this is the future, we'd better get faster internet
[21:04:32] <eddyb> WindowsBunny: it would buffer in a few seconds if the HTML5 player did unlimited buffering
[21:04:43] <eddyb> it's playing like shit tho
[21:04:51] <WindowsBunny> eddyb: I can't click the play button D:
[21:04:52] <ogham> eddyb: The command I used was `AFL_RS_CRASH_ON_PANIC=1 afl-fuzz -i ins -o outs -M fuzzer01 -t 600 -- target/debug/fuzz`. I don't know what -Q, -f, and -d do, though
[21:04:55] <WindowsBunny> as in, I click on it
[21:04:57] <WindowsBunny> and nothing happens
[21:05:22] <eddyb> ogham: but that's using stdin
[21:05:28] <eddyb> ogham: I have a thing which can't use stdin
[21:05:36] <ogham> then how are you trying to get input into it?
[21:05:39] <eddyb> WindowsBunny: your internets suck
[21:05:43] <eddyb> ogham: the -f flag
[21:05:51] <eddyb> ogham: it writes the data to a file of your choosing
[21:06:06] <eddyb> it's just that the executed command seems to act like it's always doing the same thing
[21:06:14] <ogham> QuickTime gives me an 8K video of nothing but black. gg
[21:06:20] <ogham> right
[21:06:32] <WindowsBunny> Okay, let's download it
[21:06:36] <WindowsBunny> and see how VLC handles it
[21:06:56] <ogham> you're fuzzing the .class file?
[21:07:54] <eddyb> yes
[21:07:59] <ogham> hmmmmm
[21:09:10] <ogham>   -C            - crash exploration mode (the peruvian rabbit thing)
[21:10:33] <WindowsBunny> RABBIT
[21:10:33] <ogham> eddyb: wait, where does it write the file to? current directory?
[21:10:52] <ogham> -cp . should do the same thing
[21:11:09] <eddyb> -cp isn't even necessary
[21:11:15] <eddyb> just me trying to force it to work
[21:11:37] <ogham> it shouldn't be
[21:11:44] <ogham> what if you run java -verbose:class ?
[21:12:00] <eddyb> under afl?
[21:12:24] <ogham> under java, it tells you precisely which files it's trying to load
[21:12:44] <ogham> I'm not sure if the problem is with afl or java
[21:12:52] <eddyb> yes but I cannot see that under afl
[21:12:59] <ogham> oh yeah
[21:13:03] <ogham> shit
[21:13:41] <eddyb> I cannot tell whether afl is broken or not :|
[21:13:47] <ogham> well, if it's failing every time, then you should be able to see the output in the outs directory
[21:13:48] <eddyb> or rather
[21:14:07] <eddyb> ogham: it's not crashing with AFL's definition of crash
[21:14:09] <ogham> if it's never failing then that's very suspicious
[21:14:11] <eddyb> it's just outputting an error
[21:15:18] <ogham> isn't that how it's supposed to work?
[21:15:25] <ogham> it outputs an error instead of crashing

[21:25:43] <eddyb> ogham: you can use qemu to run win32 apps in wine on arm linux

[23:06:51] <Tobba> you have to be a lot faster than this to speedrun it
[23:07:43] <panicbit> Tobba: Sure but you could start to train yourself and beat your own records :)
[23:08:24] <panicbit> You don't need to beat the #1 world record to speedrun a game
[23:08:54] <Tobba> sure, it's just that serious speedrunning of doom is riduclously fast
[23:09:15] *** bvssvni is now known as bvssvni_
[23:09:17] <panicbit> And intensive training takes a lot of time :/
[23:09:39] <bstrie> the key to having the #1 world record is to just pick a set of unique constraints
[23:09:56] <bstrie> fastest speedrun of quake while being force-fed bagel bites
[23:10:04] <cmr> lol

[23:13:46] <panicbit> I love how they took over pokemon, then the super gameboy and then the snes to stream the twitch chat to the snes

[23:14:18] <Tobba> also https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5VTWEQdVhA
[23:15:57] <eddyb> is afl disabling dlopen?
[23:16:02] <eddyb> is that what's happening?
[23:17:18] <Tobba> this video should also make you appreciate HL1s ceiling design
[23:18:33] <eddyb> can you fall towards the sky?

[23:18:42] <Tobba> yes, that'll probably get you stuck
[23:19:16] <Tobba> it's playable like that due to a patch which lets it consider the ceiling a floor (otherwise you just fall down towards the ceiling and get stuck)

[23:32:59] <WindowsBunny> Fucking finally, I got this concurrency hell sorted out, probably
[23:33:17] <Tobba> probably-maybe-kinda?
[23:33:18] <WindowsBunny> now I can work on the actual important part of interpreting the file notification change :D
[23:33:48] <WindowsBunny> Tobba: https://gist.github.com/faed87070282b3cb5d33
[23:34:13] <eddyb> Tobba: basically, I start afl-showmap (which is an easy way to test whether something can run under afl) under gdb and make it so when afl starts the process, I debug that process and afl runs unimpeded
[23:34:21] <eddyb> this is amazing
[23:34:44] <eddyb> okay, so...
[23:34:46] <eddyb> #8  0x00005555555cb8f7 in do_syscall (cpu_env=<optimized out>, num=<optimized out>, arg1=<optimized out>, arg2=<optimized out>, arg3=<optimized out>, arg4=<optimized out>, arg5=0, arg6=-163191768, arg7=0, arg8=0) at /home/eddy/Projects/afl/afl-1.80b/qemu_mode/qemu-2.3.0/linux-user/syscall.c:5573
[23:34:49] <Tobba> WindowsBunny: neat
[23:34:54] <eddyb> I can actually read that source :P
[23:35:06] <eddyb> pthread_exit seems broken in this case
[23:36:06] <cmr> WindowsBunny: and that's what you need to know when a handle is free?
[23:36:13] <eddyb> Tobba: so apparently the exit syscall is the wrong thing to use
[23:36:25] <WindowsBunny> hmmm
[23:36:26] <Tobba> doesn't that kill the whole process?
[23:36:27] <eddyb> Tobba: and _exit_group is actually the _exit
[23:36:31] <WindowsBunny> bah
[23:36:34] <WindowsBunny> even after all this
[23:36:35] <eddyb> Tobba: the exit syscall is actually pthread_exit
[23:36:36] <Tiffany> this is amazing
[23:36:41] <WindowsBunny> the wait object is still signalling Q_Q
[23:36:45] <eddyb> Tobba: it only kills the current thread
[23:36:52] <Tiffany> the speedrun bstrie linked
[23:37:02] <eddyb> Tobba: but this is unrelated
[23:37:07] <Tobba> Tiffany: ever watched freeman's  mind?
[23:37:09] <WindowsBunny> of course
[23:37:11] <WindowsBunny> that fixes it
[23:37:18] <Tiffany> I have tobba
[23:37:28] <Tobba> Tiffany: just imagine that voice constantly screaming when things start going really fast
[23:37:33] <eddyb> Tobba: but I found a comment in the qemu source which explains this for dummies
[23:37:36] <Tiffany> heh
[23:38:06] <WindowsBunny> OF COURSE THAT WOULD FIX THAT ISSUE
[23:38:10] <WindowsBunny> AFTER ALL THIS EFFORT
[23:38:12] <eddyb> so qemu's userspace stuff... handles the syscall interrupt and calls glibc functions
[23:38:27] <Tobba> sounds reasonable
[23:38:31] <WindowsBunny> (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
[23:39:11] <eddyb> Tobba: but afl does something and shared libs don't work very well
[23:40:45] <Tiffany> heh they used the infinite health glitch door
[23:40:59] <Tobba> probably saves a ton of time to do that
[23:41:02] <Tiffany> yeah
[23:41:08] <Tiffany> no need to stop and get suit power
[23:41:37] <Tobba> I love how all HL speedruns are on hard, because for some reason grenades fling you further if you take more damage from them
[23:42:46] <Tiffany> hah
[23:42:49] <cmr> that's totally physics.

[23:47:49] <dfockler> :\
[23:47:54] <WindowsBunny> dfockler: The only thing that the other thread does is call UnregisterWaitEx on a HANDLE
[23:48:13] <WindowsBunny> which is a thread-safe method and _blocks_ until the wait is fully cancelled
[23:48:19] <WindowsBunny> and any pending callbacks are done
[23:48:34] <dfockler> If you say so...
[23:48:38] <WindowsBunny> and I have WT_EXECUTEINWAITTHREAD which ensures only one callback runs at a time :D
[23:49:43] <eddyb> okay, so it reaches _dl_runtime_resolve
