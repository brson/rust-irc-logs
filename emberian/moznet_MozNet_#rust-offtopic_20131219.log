[04:47:57] <bjz> kvanb: o/
[04:48:13] <bjz> how did you find voyager?
[04:48:20] <kvanb> uh, github
[04:48:27] <bjz> heh :)
[04:48:39] <bjz> (was just curious which came first)
[04:48:45] <ChrisMorgan> bjz: I'll admit I find your website rather confusing
[04:48:50] <kvanb> I'm going to find myself eye-deep in all your libs soon :P
[04:48:53] <bjz> should post some rust work on there sometime
[04:49:02] <cmr> kvanb: that happens yeah
[04:49:04] <bjz> ChrisMorgan: yeah, it is abit odd :D
[04:49:10] <kvanb> So you'd be 18'ish or so based on the acceptance letter to RMIT
[04:49:12] <kvanb> unless thats old
[04:49:17] <bjz> ChrisMorgan: what is confusing?
[04:49:30] <bjz> kvanb: heh, I started late
[04:49:52] <kvanb> No I mean, unless the letter is old :P
[04:49:56] <bjz> kvanb: and now I have mega RMIT annoyance. I was so naive.
[04:50:08] <kvanb> I have 3 or 4 friends at rmit in compsci atm
[04:50:16] <kvanb> kevin bui, james wilkinson, mylan li if you know any
[04:50:50] <bjz> nah, don't know them
[04:50:56] <kvanb> whats the mega annoyance?
[04:50:57] <kvanb> :P
[04:51:00] <kvanb> why do you say naive
[04:51:28] <bjz> crappy course work. basically a software engineering course with a fancy name.
[04:51:51] <bjz> the maths is the best part but it's barely anything
[04:52:13] <kvanb> ahaha I don't feel your pain at all. I'm taking mechatronics engineering :C
[04:52:19] <kvanb> w/ double in computer science.
[04:52:38] <kvanb> so its like, 3 physics + maths every semester so far
[04:52:46] <cmr> yikes
[04:52:55] <bjz> neat!
[04:52:56] <ChrisMorgan> My understanding of the pair is that BCS is largely just a three-years-instead-of-four and not-quite-so-thorough BSE.
[04:53:03] <kvanb> I dislike it :P
[04:53:14] <bjz> the RMIT one is so lobotomised
[04:53:33] <kvanb> I heard they force you to do ruby in the first year
[04:53:35] <bjz> dunno if I'll make it through :[
[04:53:39] <bjz> nope
[04:53:39] <kvanb> you would have just finished your first year?
[04:53:43] <bjz> Java
[04:53:51] * kvanb goes into a stroke
[04:53:51] <bjz> UML
[04:54:29] <bjz> design pattern bullshit (important, but it shouldn't take up a half of the first year)
[04:54:38] <ChrisMorgan> Monash has finally moved away from Java being core once again. Now the basic programming stuff gets done in no language rather than in Java. I haven't looked into it, but it sounds a very interesting choice. Potentially even courageous.
[04:54:56] <bjz> wow
[04:55:00] <bjz> that is brave
[04:55:35] <bjz> wonder how long it will take for the students to revolt saying "why you no teach industry stuff"
[04:55:49] <bjz> which is half of the problem
[04:55:51] <ChrisMorgan> It has the potential to be much better or much worse, depending on how it's taught. I have no idea which it is.
[04:56:13] <bjz> they were all complaining about how stupid discrete math was -_-
[04:56:23] <bjz> well, not all
[04:56:32] <ChrisMorgan> I did find it a little depressing that by fourth year, over half of the BSE students (there were 22 of us) had not worked in any language but Java with the exception of C for one semester.
[04:56:38] <bjz> dang
[04:56:48] <kvanb> Haskell!
[04:56:59] <ChrisMorgan> Melbourne Uni taught Haskell when my eldest brother went there.
[04:56:59] <bjz> kvanb: Haskell isn't the world
[04:57:22] <kvanb> but it sure makes some industry programmers blue-faced
[04:57:35] <kvanb> I was talking to one the other day and he's like "what do you program?"
[04:57:43] <kvanb> I said Haskell and he bowed to me like I was a god.
[04:57:43] <bjz> ChrisMorgan: yeah, a few of the guys from MFUG went through the Melbourne uni course
[04:57:43] <dbaupp> bjz: obviously; Rust is the world. :P
[04:57:47] <kvanb> :P
[04:57:47] <cmr> hahah
[04:58:15] <kvanb> sydney teaches haskell in their compsci
[04:58:18] <bjz> ChrisMorgan: they were so bamboozled at the time apparently, why they were learning this stupid weird language
[04:58:19] <ChrisMorgan> My brother wouldn't have gone through Melbourne Uni if he'd been a couple of years later—by that time the Melbourne Model had spread to there...
[04:58:20] <kvanb> then C, then Java
[04:58:50] <bjz> ChrisMorgan: only later did they realise how good it really was, hence MFUG
[04:58:51] <kvanb> woops
[04:58:54] <kvanb> not sydney, my bad
[04:58:56] <kvanb> I meant ANU!
[04:59:01] <bjz> kvanb: nice
[04:59:34] <cmr> at my school they teach the two intro classes in C++, then one in java ("advanced programming concepts", CS II part 2), one in C (architecture), then there's proglang which is prolog+scheme+C, then it's "do what you want"
[04:59:57] <bjz> cmr: interesting
[05:00:07] <kvanb> "do what you want" is promising
[05:00:10] <cmr> quality of education here depends on whether you get the bad prof or not :)
[05:00:13] <kvanb> cmr: I've been here before
[05:00:16] <bjz> but I'm sure at least you guys had interesting lecturesrs.
[05:00:19] <kvanb> I remember you, actually.
[05:00:33] <kvanb> My nick was Aetherspawn the first time I came here wanting to hack the compiler, but lost time
[05:00:51] <cmr> Oh hey!
[05:00:57] <kvanb> :P
[05:01:00] <cmr> you're the ass who promised windows colors ;P
[05:01:09] <kvanb> lool you know I actually started
[05:01:18] <bjz> I only thought to look at the lecturers at RMIT when I started, and now I see they are completely not doing CS stuff :(
[05:01:21] <kvanb> but didn't get far XD
[05:01:29] <bjz> kvanb: nice!
[05:01:34] <bjz> kvanb: I remember you name
[05:01:46] <kvanb> shit, is that good or bad
[05:02:14] <bjz> kvanb: well, vaguely at least :D
[05:02:58] <kvanb> but yeah, I'm learning rust and I want to take it full time from here on in
[05:03:05] <bjz> cmr: yeah, even if the course is only semi-decent, I'm sure having a good prof would help immensly
[05:03:15] <bjz> kvanb: so game stuff?
[05:03:22] <kvanb> Haskell is too wierd for people to help me program anything with from experience
[05:03:32] <kvanb> and C++ isn't typeclassey enough
[05:03:33] <cmr> bjz: the java course could be great, but the prof just.. not a good teacher. Nice lady, but she shouldn't teach.
[05:03:53] <kvanb> 5 or so years later I still struggle to make -pedantic C++ play nicely with project structure
[05:04:21] <cmr> anyway I got an A and I never have to take it again
[05:04:28] <cmr> it was frustrating though
[05:04:46] <bjz> kvanb: I still respect C++, but I don't have a huge experience using it
[05:05:03] <kvanb> I like rust because it follows the C compilation model
[05:05:08] <cmr> bjz: how are you feeling wrt Rust vs Idris?
[05:05:14] <bjz> kvanb: it seems like lots of folks bash it without noticing the 10% that's good
[05:05:14] <kvanb> so using C/C++ along side is so trivial
[05:05:18] <cmr> kvanb: no it doesn't, not atall?
[05:05:28] <cmr> what do you mean by compilation model?
[05:05:30] <kvanb> afaik it produces object files?
[05:05:41] <cmr> well yes, but not per-file.
[05:05:43] <cmr> it's per-crate.
[05:05:49] <bjz> kvanb: the 10% that not many langs have tackled
[05:06:09] <cmr> bjz: I find myself liking C++ a lot.
[05:06:15] <kvanb> templates are a redeeming factor of C++
[05:06:19] <cmr> It's a footgun though
[05:06:49] <bjz> cmr: still hopeful, but I don't have the time to help. I still think that idris is a definite glimpse of the future.
[05:07:18] <cmr> dependant type systems look almost magical to my uninformed eyes.
[05:07:24] <bjz> cmr: but I'm sticking with Rust for now, probably going to do most of my stuff in it for the time being
[05:07:43] <cmr> bjz: that's good to hear, I depend on most of your libs :P
[05:08:34] <bjz> type systems like idris are the future. they're still in research mode, but if Rust has pushed the bar over C++, there will be langs that will push it even further.
[05:08:40] <kvanb> I wonder if I can `brew install rust` ..
[05:08:58] <bjz> kvanb: the build is 0.8 afaik
[05:09:07] <kvanb> oh! it does work
[05:09:10] <kvanb> excellent
[05:09:18] <bjz> kvanb: you need 0.9-pre
[05:09:24] <kvanb> How come?
[05:09:28] <bjz> to be productive, and to work with any libs
[05:09:34] <kvanb> oh.
[05:09:34] <cmr> and to get support :p
[05:09:39] <bjz> 0.8 is months out of date
[05:09:50] <bjz> treat it as a snapshot
[05:09:50] <cmr> 0.9 is in 3 weeks, so that's something
[05:10:09] <cmr> and thanks to acrichto we have some super awesome exciting things cooking..
[05:10:32] <bjz> kvanb: all of my libs are on 0.9-pre, covered by continuous integration
[05:10:46] <kvanb> good job to whoever implemented ranges and | in matching
[05:10:48] * ChrisMorgan thinks acrichto is probably the best hire Mozilla has made for quite some time
[05:10:54] <bjz> kvanb: so if you're looking for game stuff, you won't be able to work with them
[05:11:06] <bjz> +1 on acrichto
[05:11:20] <bjz> he's insanely awesome
[05:11:39] <cmr> all of the core dev team is awesome, but many of them don't have Rust as their only project
[05:11:45] <bjz> yeah
[05:11:59] <bjz> they have to juggle
[05:12:02] <ChrisMorgan> cmr: certainly. But acrichto was hired at just the time when what he's best at was needed most.
[05:12:07] <cmr> I agree
[05:12:26] <bjz> ChrisMorgan: yeah, pre 1.0 is a super important time
[05:12:49] <bjz> even juggling between Servo and Rust is tricky
[05:20:34] * dbaupp is *sure* that acrichto is multiple people
[05:22:31] <kvanb> pulling from git
[05:22:34] <kvanb> and building
[05:23:06] <kvanb> oh, whats the command for getting the submodules again?
[05:23:18] <cmr> ./configure
[05:23:20] <cmr> :P
[05:23:33] <ChrisMorgan> kvanb: it'll happen automatically
[05:24:20] <ChrisMorgan> Really, once you've done the first ./configure, make will run it again if it needs to—it's only if there are changes in the makefiles themselves that you may need to run make a second time (if the first fails fast, because it was using the old rules).
[05:25:09] <kvanb> oh I dont think it did
[05:25:11] <ChrisMorgan> (Plus the very occasional need to make clean if things have become broken.)
[05:25:46] <kvanb> fatal: Needed a single revision
[05:25:46] <kvanb> Unable to find current revision in submodule path 'src/llvm'
[05:25:47] <kvanb> configure: error: git
[05:25:50] <bjz> dbaupp: he owns slaves
[05:26:07] <bjz> dbaupp: connected by a hive mind
[05:28:16] <kvanb> I dont think thats supposed to happen
[05:28:44] <cmr> slavery or hive minds?
[05:29:35] <kvanb> Unable to find current revision in submodule path 'src/llvm'
[05:29:37] <kvanb> :P
[05:29:42] <kvanb> I deleted it and I'm rerunning ./configure
[05:29:58] <cmr> you deleted src/llvm !?
[05:30:05] <kvanb> yeah it was empty except for .git
[05:30:16] <cmr> might as well just blow everything away and do a fresh clone, then.
[05:30:23] <kvanb> oh dear.
[05:30:25] <kvanb> ok
[05:30:33] <ChrisMorgan> That shouldn't be necessary.
[05:30:42] <cmr> well the slow part is cloning llvm
[05:30:46] <ChrisMorgan> Just check out the entire repository again.
[05:30:48] <cmr> and if that's gone... no reason not to start over.
[05:31:07] <cmr> personally, I don't trust the build system
[05:31:29] <kvanb> cmake!
[05:31:38] <kvanb> I recently wrote a glorius cmake system for a thing 
[05:31:54] <ChrisMorgan> kvanb: before killing the whole thing, you might as well try a `git checkout master`
[05:32:04] <kvanb> well, Im using the git gui for osx
[05:32:10] <kvanb> so Im going to reclone
[05:32:13] <kvanb> I think it was my fault
[05:32:22] <kvanb> it got to 100% and became unresponsive so I killed it after about 5 mins
[05:32:25] <kvanb> thats probably what did it
[05:32:34] <ChrisMorgan> ... yes, that would do it.
[05:33:01] <ChrisMorgan> Pulling again would probably work.
[05:36:41] <kvanb> Oh does rust have built-in benchmarking?
[05:36:45] <kvanb> #[bench] ?
[05:36:52] <cmr> yes
[05:36:53] <cmr> and yes
[05:36:59] <cmr> https://github.com/mozilla/rust/wiki/Doc-unit-testing
[05:36:59] <kvanb> all of my yes.
[05:37:15] <kvanb> wow, and I spent
[05:37:22] <kvanb> 3 days setting up googletest + cmake
[05:37:26] <kvanb> for C++
[05:37:38] <cmr> heh
[05:37:43] <cmr> I've been through that too
[05:38:01] <cmr> My efforts hindered by the fact that I actually needed to support visual studio too
[05:40:59] <kvanb> I've had more luck with visual studio than xcode actually
[05:41:08] <kvanb> idk what it is with Xcode, but it wont run sh scripts properly from within the IDE
[05:41:14] <kvanb> that is, the ones generated by CMake
[05:41:27] <kvanb> Visual Studio wound run a target called RUN_TESTS though and actually give the output down the bottom
[05:42:15] <kvanb> lol, bottom
[05:43:08] <kvanb> ugh, that wasn't me.
[05:43:30] <kvanb> inhabitants of questionable intelligence like to take control of my IRC when I wander.
[05:57:57] <kvanb> the github app  is no good. It fails to clone it properly. Trying command line now.
