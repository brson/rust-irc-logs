[03:02:59] <Tobba> All DbgHelp functions, such as this one, are single threaded. Therefore, calls from more than one thread to this function will likely result in unexpected behavior or memory corruption. To avoid this, you must synchronize all concurrent calls from more than one thread to this function.

[03:04:20] <eddyb> WindowsBunny: no u
[03:04:35] <eddyb> it makes an rlib with only metadata but no machine code
[03:04:51] <eddyb> and it works even with -Z no-trans
[03:05:00] <Tobba> eddyb: hm, I wonder if using LZ4 to compress a kernel is a good idea
[03:05:06] <eddyb> (well, that's the point, with trans you don't need this extra type)
[03:05:10] <Tobba> the decompression is ridiculously fast, and it looks like the implementation is really small
[03:05:11] <WindowsBunny> Tobba: LZ4 is really fast at decompression
[03:05:19] <eddyb> Tobba: if you do only decompression, that's great
[03:05:21] <WindowsBunny> And the decompression impl is really small
[03:05:23] <Tobba> WindowsBunny: kernels are small though, not sure if it will matter
[03:05:25] <eddyb> it's pretty easy to do it safely
[03:05:29] <Tobba> I'm mostly worrying about impl size
[03:05:38] <eddyb> I use a tiny bit of unsafe code in my inflate impl but I know how to fix it
[03:05:52] <eddyb> it involves &mut T -> &Cell<T>
[03:05:54] <Tobba> oh, you have an LZ4 impl? /lazy
[03:05:59] <eddyb> Tobba: no
[03:06:15] <eddyb> and a new kind of sliding window iterator... or maybe an existing one :D
[03:06:17] <WindowsBunny> I rewrote LZ4 decompression one time
[03:06:26] <WindowsBunny> It's really simple
[03:06:27] <eddyb> but LZ4 should be similar
[03:06:49] <Tobba> yeah the decompression function is only like 100 lines (and then theres the helpers, but still)
[03:06:53] <eddyb> (could reuse some bits of the impl, too, if I really wanted, I bet. though I haven't ever seen LZ4 so I could be bullshit)
[03:07:31] <WindowsBunny> I use LZ4 in one of my file formats, so I can tell you from personal experience it is very light and fast
[03:07:43] <fkaa> only slept for 4 hours \o/
[03:07:45] <Tobba> it looks like it trades size for decompressor sanity, which is nice
[03:07:47] <WindowsBunny> Tobba: I could decompress bitmaps faster than I could upload them to the GPU :D
[03:07:56] <Tobba> deflate has really crazy bitstream stuff going
[03:07:57] <Tobba> :D
[03:08:15] <eddyb> https://cyan4973.github.io/lz4/lz4_Block_format.html
[03:08:29] <eddyb> Tobba: took me a while to understand how to do state saving properly
[03:08:36] <eddyb> and for dynamic huffman tables it's a complete hack
[03:08:50] <Tobba> yeeaah
[03:08:50] <eddyb> it relies on LLVM to partially unroll the first iteration of the loop
[03:08:54] <eddyb> otherwise it will be shit
[03:08:56] <Tobba> I did a thing where it handled the saved state separately
[03:09:06] <Tobba> and then did a separate thing for the "main body"
[03:09:11] <Tobba> but fuck that code in general, and fuck bitstreams
[03:09:15] <eddyb> heh
[03:09:30] <eddyb> "LZ4 is an LZ77-type compressor with a fixed, byte-oriented encoding." say woot
[03:09:50] <eddyb> is that acknowledging the reality of current CPUs?
[03:10:12] <eddyb> and how lots of bit fiddling can take lots of cycles?
[03:10:22] <Tobba> well no shit bit fiddling is a time sink
[03:10:36] <Tobba> you get lots of icky dependencies and out of order execution stops being able to save you pretty fast
[03:10:37] <eddyb> (I'd rather implement inflate in hardware)
[03:10:48] <Tobba> eddyb: you'd end up with...
[03:10:51] <Tobba> a shift register from hell, really
[03:10:54] <eddyb> lel
[03:11:05] <eddyb> Tobba: speculative shift register execution!
[03:11:09] <eddyb> pipeline it
[03:11:23] <Tobba> you'd want to do more than one byte per machine cycle
[03:11:24] <Tobba> so uh
[03:11:29] <Tobba> jesus christ that's gotta be a mess
[03:11:38] <eddyb> pretty much any arbitrary bitstream should be valid in inflate
[03:11:53] <eddyb> unless your huffman tables are suboptimal
[03:12:13] <Tobba> I'm not sure if it even lets you represents those "suboptimal" huffman tables
[03:12:18] <Tobba> it has a weird representation
[03:12:21] <eddyb> so you'd optimize for common bit sizes (the offset could be dynamic)

[03:14:22] <Tobba> interesting

[03:14:38] <Tobba> so LZ4 has no huffman tables, just copying
[03:14:50] <Tobba> I guess it works really well for binary data
[03:15:17] <eddyb> you could keep a register file for statistics and use it to pick the most common bit sizes and shift by those in your pipeline :D
[03:15:24] <eddyb> anyways
[03:15:37] <eddyb> Tobba: does that actually compress well?
[03:15:46] <Tobba> depending on the data, it should
[03:15:55] <Tobba> it can essentially perform RLE with 1:255 compression ratios
[03:16:12] <Tobba> I wish there were compression algos that could have multi-byte huffman codes though
[03:16:19] <Tobba> I'd imagine that could help a lot
[03:18:53] <eddyb> Tobba: whoa whoa whoa
[03:19:10] <eddyb> Tobba: LZ4 is... seekable
[03:19:16] <eddyb> kinda...
[03:19:18] <Tobba> wait what
[03:19:28] <eddyb> well, not really :P
[03:19:40] <Tobba> well, you don't have to decode the *whole* thing
[03:19:44] <eddyb> it's just that it's really easy to index seek positions in it
[03:19:44] <Tobba> unlike deflate
[03:19:51] <eddyb> and then use those
[03:20:41] <eddyb> Tobba: hmpf
[03:21:07] <eddyb> Tobba: could you insert offsets of the compressed file... after compression?
[03:21:16] <Tobba> sure?
[03:21:21] <eddyb> mark bytes as "undetermined" so they're literals in the output
[03:21:29] <eddyb> and then insert offsets in there
[03:22:04] <eddyb> could do some neat on-demand decompression with it

[05:07:27] <RC9> though it ends up being cruftyu
[05:08:19] <WindowsBunny> RC9: I think windows will refuse to upgrade further when they finally abandon 32-bit
[05:08:28] <WindowsBunny> but I don't see that happening in a long time
[05:08:33] <RC9> so... 2020?
[05:08:47] <WindowsBunny> pretty sure windows 10 will support 32-bit
[05:08:56] <RC9> its kinda painful because i have slight pains with 8gb though 
[05:08:56] <WindowsBunny> and windows 10 is apparently the last windows
[05:09:22] <RC9> i can see 32 bit being okay for embedded systems but for consumer use... *shudders*
[05:09:27] <RC9> on the other hand
[05:09:38] <RC9> i do multitask a lot so 4gb is still okay for facebook machines
[05:09:39] <RC9> for now
[05:10:30] <WindowsBunny> RC9: I wanna upgrade to 16 GB of RAM
[05:10:40] <WindowsBunny> I'm frequently using the majority of my 8 GB
[05:10:46] <FreeFull> 64-bit windows has no support for running DOS programs
[05:10:52] <FreeFull> Or Win16 ones
[05:11:05] <RC9> me too, though on a budget build its hard to fit in the price

[05:11:12] * RC9 goes back to pcpartpicker and contemplates options
[05:11:25] <WindowsBunny> RC9: I'm waiting for AMD Zen, then I'll get 16 GB of DDR4 >:D
[05:11:29] <RC9> haha
[05:11:38] <RC9> how close is ddr4 to being mainstream
[05:11:43] <RC9> and how much of a premium is it
[05:11:59] <WindowsBunny> Let's find out!
[05:12:07] <RC9> i approve, yo ucan be my guinea pig
[05:12:37] <WindowsBunny> suppose I get 2 sticks of 8 GB
[05:13:29] <WindowsBunny> hmmm
[05:13:36] <WindowsBunny> $120 for DDR4 2133
[05:13:45] <WindowsBunny> cheapest option that is
[05:14:00] <RC9> and then you need a mobo to support it, don't you?
[05:14:45] <WindowsBunny> DDR3 2133 is as cheap as $94
[05:14:59] <WindowsBunny> So the premium isn't entirely bad
[05:15:03] <RC9> yeah thats what i found
[05:15:24] <WindowsBunny> RC9: Hence why I'm waiting for AMD Zen, which will have DDR4 support
[05:15:33] <RC9> i c
[05:15:47] <RC9> yeah im sort of just noodling on the idea of building another desktop
[05:16:02] <WindowsBunny> RC9: Well, if you want Intel, just buy whenever
[05:16:05] <RC9> my day job makes me sit at a desk for 8-10 hours a day though so im not usually inclined to do it more
[05:16:08] <WindowsBunny> if you want AMD, I'd recommend waiting for Zen
[05:16:13] <RC9> thus the surface :P
[05:16:41] <RC9> probably stick with ddr3 unless it makes more sense when i get around to the build
[05:18:16] <WindowsBunny> Well with an AMD APU DDR4 makes sense because performance at the top end is directly proportional to RAM speed
[05:19:53] <RC9> yeah im aiming midrange
[05:20:14] <RC9> the kind of rig i really want would require a custom desk and 4 digit investment into multiple monitors
[05:20:32] <RC9> and thats an understandably superfluous purchase for most people :P
[05:22:18] <WindowsBunny> RC9: top end for an AMD APU is midrange :P
[05:22:26] <RC9> haha
[05:22:33] <RC9> yeah ive been kinda sticking with intel
[05:22:43] <WindowsBunny> your loss
[05:22:43] <RC9> what ive read kinda recommends it over amd
[05:22:45] <RC9> but then
[05:22:50] <RC9> i havent looked into it in a while
[05:22:51] <RC9> maybe i should
[05:23:01] <Quxxy> Go to search the NixOS package list.  Autocomplete pops up a drop-down list in the search box
[05:23:07] <Quxxy> First entry is "attack on titan"
[05:23:17] <RC9> naturally
[05:23:17] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: awful
[05:23:21] <Quxxy> I... don't think there's a package for that
[05:23:43] <cmr> huon: I don't *need* to upgrade it, but I might as well while it's out!
[05:23:48] <cmr> huon: I find it amusing.

[05:24:20] <RC9> WindowsBunny, have you any relevant literature on the intel vs amd or is it just preference :P
[05:24:25] <RC9> mostly asking out of curiosity
[05:24:30] <RC9> i like to read things and look at charts
[05:24:35] <WindowsBunny> RC9: Intel currently leads in CPU performance
[05:25:02] <WindowsBunny> RC9: AMD leads in GPU performance
[05:25:04] <cmr> RC9: Well there's lots of sites with charts, but you might be interested in reading their developer manuals.
[05:25:32] <WindowsBunny> If developer manuals is what you want
[05:25:36] <WindowsBunny> http://developer.amd.com/resources/documentation-articles/developer-guides-manuals/
[05:26:05] <RC9> i like a nice technical read
[05:27:28] <cmr> There's always anandtech too for the sort of architecture reviews that leave you feeling like you know something.
[05:28:00] <WindowsBunny> I prefer semiaccurate
[05:28:27] <XMPPwocky> intel also wipes the floor with AMD for power consumption (and performance-per-watt)
[05:28:42] <cmr> they're good too.
[05:28:43] <WindowsBunny> XMPPwocky: Well duh, Intel has the process advantage
[05:29:04] <XMPPwocky> right
[05:29:07] <WindowsBunny> semiaccurate gives some very solid technical explanations
[05:29:18] <WindowsBunny> XMPPwocky: Right now AMD is stuck in the same boat as everyone except Intel
[05:29:40] <WindowsBunny> Hence why AMD and Nvidia are able to duke it out so evenly
[05:31:24] <WindowsBunny> XMPPwocky: I also prefer semiaccurate due to their sense of humor

[10:29:17] <eddyb> Quxxy: you can check my branch
[10:29:19] <Quxxy> Which was to have an iterator thunk that owned all the state, then have both the main and sub-iterators borrow it
[10:29:57] <Quxxy> But I couldn't get it to accept re-borrowing from the outer iterator to the inner iterator
[10:31:58] <bluss> Quxxy: what happens if I start on the second subiterator before the first?
[10:32:27] <Quxxy> bluss: That *should* be impossible since that would imply two mutable borrows simultaneously :D
[10:32:39] <niconii> cmr: nope
[10:32:40] <bluss> then it's not an Iterator --
[10:32:56] <bluss> Quxxy: iterator protocol requires that all the iterator elements are available at the same time
[10:33:05] <cmr> niconii: yeah it seems to have righted itself now.
[10:33:17] <bluss> Quxxy: we always come back to this :)
[10:33:27] <bluss> Quxxy: well not you and I, but in rust
[10:34:10] <Quxxy> eddyb: Fn0 is sodding evil
[10:34:28] <eddyb> EMBRACE THE FUTURE
[10:34:43] <bluss> give me Clonable closures, whatever the costs
[10:34:52] <Quxxy> I don't want to; it's full of religious extremism and economic mismanagement
[10:34:56] <eddyb> bluss: CTFE
[10:35:00] <cmr> ohhh, fancy: http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/5174
[10:37:02] <Quxxy> eddyb: Oh good grief... you walk the sequence *twice*
[10:37:19] <eddyb> that's what bluss suggested
[10:37:21] <Quxxy> I was sitting here, utterly baffled as to what was going on
[10:37:22] <eddyb> and it works fine
[10:38:00] <Layl> does anyone happen to know who said in a defcon presentation "If I see a button by god I'll press it twice"
[10:38:18] <Quxxy> Ok, so we've got one GroupBy that allocates for each group, one that computes the sequence twice, and one that does one allocation
[10:38:24] <Layl> actually nevermind, that's probably every other defcon presentation
[10:38:32] <Quxxy> We need Iterator<'a> so bad :P
[10:39:28] <Quxxy> (I should add: *does one allocation but uses an Rc<RefCell<..>> and options and clones and shit)
[10:39:44] <bluss> Quxxy: I imagined a reasonable impl would simply wipe the first iterator if the second was started roughly
[10:40:14] <Quxxy> Well, my LazyGroupBy basically does that
[10:40:39] <Quxxy> I modified it so that group iterators can detect when the source iterator has advanced to a subsequent group and just fuse themselves
[10:40:43] <bluss> great then just put than in appropirate spooky action-at-a-distance wrappers and it should work
[10:41:01] <Quxxy> I decided that was slightly preferable to just exploding :P
[10:42:29] <Quxxy> eddyb: With impl Trait, we can finally start the age of Dynamic Rust: -> impl Any all the things! :D
[10:42:52] <eddyb> Quxxy: we can write tuple iterators
[10:43:00] <eddyb> and general object visitor things
[11:14:11] <Layl> I wonder what's today's substance that 100 years from now children can't believe people considered normal back then

[12:46:45] <cmr> spending a few evenings tinkering with it can be fruitful
[12:47:07] <cmr> some of its subtler aspects aren't obvious

[15:13:29] <eddyb> I may have just realized I have confused MS and schizophrenia in the past
[15:14:08] <eddyb> schizophrenia doesn't rhyme with "roza" in Romanian, sclerosis ("scleroza") does
[15:14:25] <eddyb> and I didn't realize MS stood for multiple sclerosis
[15:15:01] <bluss> see, MS is evil
[15:16:23] <eddyb> there's been, what, 3-4 cases in my family? maybe more undiagnosed ones

[16:02:47] <Astrum|Lap> oh steam, why must you tempt me with more games than I can realistically play
[16:07:51] <dfockler> at least with indie games they are quick to play
[16:08:48] <Astrum|Lap> I feel the market has gotten a bit too crowded with indie games tbh
[16:08:52] <Astrum|Lap> hard to tell the good from the bad
[16:10:21] <dfockler> that's fair, I think that's the nice thing that they are cheap so if you get a dud, it's only $5-10 lost
[16:11:12] <Astrum|Lap> I've gotten tons from the humble bundles

[16:11:19] <dfockler> Oh yeah me too
[16:11:36] <Astrum|Lap> although I will say I'm glad a lot of companies are updating old games
[16:11:41] <Astrum|Lap> I definitelyb ought homeworld remastered

[16:12:47] <dfockler> ^ yeah!
[16:12:58] <Astrum|Lap> heh, my dad was a clean room engineer for various companies who made hard drive heads
[16:13:04] <Astrum|Lap> so I had a computer from a pretty young age
[16:13:11] <Astrum|Lap> naturally got into gaming =)
[16:13:30] <dfockler> haha nice, I had a Mac Color, and played Joust on it

[16:14:54] <Astrum|Lap> I don't remember it too well, I was really young

[16:16:34] <dfockler> I played tetris on the gameboy, and pokemon, and Super Mario Bros 3
[16:17:17] <Astrum|Lap> I think I played super mario bros 3 in... day care? I dunno, wherever children go when their parents go to work
[16:19:45] <dfockler> Embedded was one of my favorites too, we made a tron light cycle game in verilog
[16:20:31] <Astrum|Lap> I made a bomberman clone in vhdl =)
[16:20:59] <Astrum|Lap> well... it was made in C, but we used VHDL to configure the FPGA
[16:21:24] <Astrum|Lap> what FPGA did you guys use, dfockler ?

[16:22:36] <Astrum|Lap> and theirs was WAY better
[16:22:38] <dfockler> haha
[16:22:43] <Astrum|Lap> they also dumped like 4x the amount of time into it
[16:22:50] <dfockler> the other group in our class made asteroids
[16:23:15] <Astrum|Lap> they used the 128Mb of memory on the back to add sound, higher resolution sprites, etc...

[16:23:54] <Astrum|Lap> my partner and I... were not
[16:23:55] <Astrum|Lap> lol
[16:23:58] <dfockler> we didn't realize you could access memory so we had to figure out how to fit all the dynamically drawn lines
[16:24:37] <Astrum|Lap> I recently bought a mojo v3
[16:24:40] <Astrum|Lap> based on the spartan 6
[16:24:44] <Astrum|Lap> toolchain is miserable =/
[16:26:23] <dfockler> can you use the arduino toolchain?
[16:26:41] <Astrum|Lap> no
[16:27:07] <Astrum|Lap> I mean the mojo v3 is arduino compatible (it has at atmega chip and a spartan 6)
[16:27:27] <Astrum|Lap> but to actually program the FPGA you need xilinx's ISE monstrosity
[16:27:46] <dfockler> ahh, I haven't used that
[16:27:46] <Astrum|Lap> which is 10GB, crashes all the time, and looks like something from the mid-90's UI wise
[16:28:10] <dfockler> we had to use the Quartus software for the DE0
[16:28:45] <Astrum|Lap> I don't have any experience with altera stuff tbh
[16:29:05] <Astrum|Lap> I know xilinx came out with a new toolchain, vivado
[16:29:16] <Astrum|Lap> but it doesn't support previous generation FPGAs like the spartan 6
[16:30:21] <dfockler> Bummer
[16:30:41] <Astrum|Lap> well I dunno if vivado is good or not, it might be just as bad as ISE, heh

[17:54:59] <fkaa> my attempts to convert people to rust have been unfruitful
[17:55:12] <fkaa> how do i make them see the light
[17:55:24] <Astrum|Lap> I love the word 'proselytize', I try to use it often =)
[17:55:42] <Astrum|Lap> that and roanoke, but I can never fit that into a conversation
[17:56:06] <Astrum|Lap> kind of like le singe est sur la branche
[17:56:36] <dfockler> rust is hard, and I don't have a project I want to build with it
[17:56:40] <Astrum|Lap> fkaa: well, you need to target the right people
[17:57:02] <Astrum|Lap> if you're trying to convert a javascript developer... probably won't work out
[17:57:15] <Astrum|Lap> if you're trying to convert someone who uses C/C++ a lot, it's much easier
[18:04:41] <mrmonday> fkaa: your first mistake is trying to convert people
[18:04:44] <mrmonday> people don't like being converted
[18:04:48] <Astrum|Lap> shhh
[18:04:49] <Astrum|Lap> yes they do

[18:05:10] <Astrum|Lap> I will proselytize you into proselytizing other people!
[18:05:13] * fkaa wolololo~
[18:05:22] <mrmonday> if you'd let me finish...
[18:05:38] <mrmonday> my trick is to just ask lots of questions
[18:05:55] <mrmonday> if you word them correctly you don't need to convert anyone
[18:05:55] <fkaa> (not actually trying to convert people, just show them how cool it is and try to get them interested)
[18:05:58] <mrmonday> they will convert themselves
[18:06:10] <Astrum|Lap> so what you're saying is... we should make an infomercial with over the top comical mistakes made in other programming languages
[18:06:37] <mrmonday> that would work wonders, but I suspect most devs don't watch infomercials
[18:06:45] <mrmonday> although, you could make one and post it to reddit
[18:06:51] <Astrum|Lap> I think that'd be a brilliant community project tbh
[18:06:58] <mrmonday> that could work out, if you mock absolutely everything
[18:07:00] <fkaa> could get it on tv shop or something
[18:07:14] <fkaa> chef tony is pretty convincing
[18:07:16] <Astrum|Lap> well... I'm not thinking about a serious infomercial here
[18:07:28] <Astrum|Lap> just something really silly
[18:07:35] <Astrum|Lap> that mocks informercials in general, but for programmers
[18:07:37] <mrmonday> my standard approach to every programming language is "everything is terrible"

[21:32:06] <XMPPwocky> oh boy 2.5USD
[21:32:23] <erickt> you're rich!
[21:33:06] <XMPPwocky> but they pay out 5000USD/day... is it just that they stop paying after 0.05% of the day?
[21:33:21] <erickt> speaking of billions from Africa, apparently the exchange rate for Zimbabwean dollars is 175,000,000,000,000,000 to US$5
[21:34:00] <fmtq> the currency no longer exists
[21:34:00] <fmtq> so 
[21:34:03] <fmtq> yeah
[21:34:07] <erickt> they're getting rid of their currency though, so I guess I can't be a quadrillionare
[21:34:15] <fmtq> they got rid of it ages ago, erickt
[21:34:42] <fmtq> it stopped being the official currency in 2009
[21:34:54] <fmtq> "The Zimbabwean dollar is due to be demonetised (no longer legal tender) by the end of 2015."
[21:35:04] <erickt> but I saw an article about it today!
[21:35:09] <erickt> http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-33105400
[21:36:13] <fmtq> The highest – and last – banknote to be printed by the bank in 2008 was 100tn Zimbabwean dollars. It was not enough to ride a public bus to work for a week.
[21:37:32] <erickt> that's pretty sad :( hyper inflation is terrifying
[21:38:13] <fmtq> meh
[21:38:19] <fmtq> I would just stop trying the second it appeared
[21:38:31] <erickt> I'm surprised they didn't stop it much earlier
[21:38:34] <fmtq> why
[21:38:41] <fmtq> deeply corrupt dictatorship kept printing money
[21:38:47] <fmtq> the hyperinflation was caused BY PRINTING MONEY
[21:38:53] <fmtq> they had to stop printing it because they ran out of ink to print it
[21:38:57] <fmtq> and couldn't afford to buy more
[21:39:01] <fmtq> because... they had to print more money to pay for it
[21:39:13] <erickt> hah
