[19:52:56] <Ilari> Tobba: What's wrong with it (apart from unusual domain names)?
[19:54:31] <Tobba> re-using certificates for multiple domains
[19:54:37] <Tobba> though I'm assuming it's a cloudflare thing
[19:54:53] <Tobba> also the fact that it's hilarious
[19:55:04] <Ilari> That could lead to all kinds of fun with tokbind/HTTP2.
[19:56:21] <mcpherrin> The free teir of cloudflare puts multiple names on a cert, yes
[20:01:18] <Ilari> Multiple unrelated domains even?
[20:02:05] <mcpherrin> Ilari: yeah, multiple unrelated domains.
[20:02:18] <mcpherrin> My site on cloudflare has a pile.
[20:02:52] <Tobba> I'm not sure if you can actually access your cert on there, I doubt you can
[20:02:57] <Tobba> but that seems like a really bad idea
[20:03:21] <mcpherrin> You definitely can't access your cert
[20:03:45] <mcpherrin> it's in some load balancer thing that you have zero access to
[20:13:37] <Ilari> Some blogpost about that it might be difficult to do constant-time even in x86 assembly. Mixes up code effects and data effects, so the conclusion does not follow.
[20:17:19] <Ilari> That XOR EAX, EAX takes different number of cycles (or causes subsequent instructions to take different number of cycles) from XOR EAX, EBX isn't relevant. What is relevant is does the execution time depend on contents of EAX or EBX?

[20:52:41] <bascule> lolwtf
[20:52:58] <bascule> haha yeah
[20:53:05] <bascule> Cloudflare has an "interesting" issuance model
[20:53:17] <bascule> it sort of makes sense because they control the whole infrastructure
[20:53:17] *** Joins: brson (brson@moz-cfhap5.mtv2.mozilla.com)
[20:53:32] <bascule> and require you point your domain at their DNS servers before issuing certs
[21:05:57] <Ilari> Which causes certain problems due to DNS limitations.
[21:08:35] <bascule> heh
[21:09:06] <bascule> then there's Let's Encrypt
[21:11:06] <Ilari> Specifically, there is no mechanism for splitting locator records (A, AAAA and such) from things like E-Mail.

[21:14:56] <bascule> I've never tried to use email with a cloudflare managed domain but they do support MX records and such
[21:18:09] <Ilari> bascule: To make domain unmailable, you need a MX record.
[21:18:30] <Ilari> bascule: And that was recently defined.
[21:20:04] <Ilari> bascule: Because of implicit MX record.
[21:26:41] <Ilari> bascule: At least for www.ietf.org (which uses cloudflare, even when the rest doesn't) does not have an MX record, which means implicit MX record applies (hit that and mails timeout, instead of immediately bounce).
[21:30:38] <bascule> I'd have to look at what they're doing
[21:30:53] <bascule> I only use CloudFlare for low-value sites where I want free hosting and SSL ;)

[23:25:32] <Ilari> ""QUIC’s anti-replay didn’t work and nobody noticed until a couple of weeks ago."
[23:26:51] <bascule> lolololol
[23:29:09] <Ilari> Basically, at the last TLS interrim, DKG destroyed just about all anti-replay schemes.
[23:30:02] <bascule> hahaha, what about Noise's? (rekeying)
[23:31:20] <Ilari> Well, at least just about everything that could fly for anti-replay mechanism for more general-purpose protocol like TLS.
[23:36:19] <bascule> hahahaha
[23:36:36] <Ilari> Sure, if you can keep per-client state, it should work, but that is of course infeasible in TLS.
[23:36:48] <bascule> do you know anything about the outcome of the CFRG meeting?
[23:38:09] <Ilari> I listened to it. Seemed to be presentation-heavy.
[23:38:46] <Ilari> Also, LOL at that Dan Harkins presentation. Dragonfly breaks at least two SHOULDs there.
[23:40:19] <Ilari> Well, also pretty sound rejection of NIST compliance (yay).
[23:40:41] <bascule> nice
[23:42:16] <Ilari> Basic argument being: ECDSA/P-256 (and a few other curves) is NIST compliant. Anything else is pure speculation.
[23:44:16] <Ilari> Also, altough this wasn't stated there, I'm concerned about capability of ECDSA code to handle anything more exotic. Especially as both curves cause pretty vile special cases in ECDSA.
[23:46:00] <Ilari> There are much simpler corner-cases in ECDSA that are complete crapshoot if the receiver gets it correct or not.
[23:47:10] <Ilari> https://twitter.com/MacLemon/status/580740353327796225 ... SSLv2, POODLE, FREAK, ...
[23:53:15] <Ilari> If you try to do ECDSA with Goldilocks and SHA-512, you need to truncate the last 66 bits... Except those two odd bits are not MSBs of their bytes, but LSBs. Yuck.
[23:54:47] <bascule> needs more EdDSA
[23:55:07] <Ilari> EdDSA does modular reduction from untruncated value.
[23:58:41] <Ilari> Oh, and as to how nasty scalar arithmetic is (ECDSA has plenty of it, EdDSA has minimal amount), the ECC lib has bugs in it (try to implement that 2^336-3 curve and one hits those).
[23:59:36] <Ilari> bascule: Also, notiece that rust-crypto ICEs rustc. \o/
