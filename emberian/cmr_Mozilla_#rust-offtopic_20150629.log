[03:13:36] <eddyb> Mutabah: I call this kind of system "deep cellifications"

[03:14:00] <eddyb> JS' mutability model (and maybe Python? though Python doesn't do thread safety) is technically sound in Rust
[03:14:10] <eddyb> it's just a PITA to guarantee

[03:15:40] <eddyb> that's probably close to Object.freeze in JS (though freeze is kinda dynamic and less typey)

[03:17:34] <Havvy> Granted, I could always use mori....
[03:17:34] <eddyb> problem is, the opinion essay might suck so I'm not guaranteed more than one, one and a half points out of 3 for it
[03:17:50] <eddyb> and there's some other stuff in there that could be nasty
[03:18:18] <eddyb> so I could end up under 4 if I don't touch the literature essay

[10:39:12] <eddyb> I laugh and ask "but what is?"
[10:39:24] <eddyb> I guess I'd take Haskell as an answer (but who'd do that?)
[10:39:39] <aatch> I just want to know how that person got it into their head that casting a single-precision float to a double-precision float is somehow a lossy conversion.

[10:40:34] <kimundi> aatch: You just need to not know that float parsing and printing are complicated subjects, and that there might be different defaults as to how something might get printed or rounded
[10:40:52] <eddyb> niconii: my large scale refactoring frenzy has something to do with PHP
[10:41:08] <eddyb> which was the first language I used for anything more than a few dozen lines of code
[10:41:18] <eddyb> the second one was C++, I believe
[10:41:26] <niconii> eddyb: even the most convoluted, messiest spaghetti code will look *BEAUTIFUL* to someone who only knew brainfuck
[10:41:31] <kimundi> aatch: With the result that what you get in the end of such a print/parse/print cycle might look more like what you want than the the result of a single print

[10:48:46] <eddyb> but Rust can express all of that and *better*

[10:52:36] <FreeFull> Well, I was thinking something more like Scheme
[10:53:35] <FreeFull> Ideally a typed variant with generics
[10:53:44] <aatch> FreeFull, same deal. I mean, I don't know how well my understanding translates to other people, but I find it so much easier to understand things when I have a clear picture of what's *really* going on.
[10:54:08] <FreeFull> aatch: Well, then you should write in assembly :)
[10:54:27] <FreeFull> C certainly hides a lot of what is going on too
[10:56:16] <aatch> FreeFull, not really. Probably just stack management and register allocation. But that's not really relevant to understanding datastructures. Anyway, I mean more understanding what's actually going on with the bytes in memory.
[10:56:50] <niconii> C is... it wants to be very lightweight and not obscure the hardware (hence so much stuff is implementation-defined)
[10:57:34] <niconii> but at the same time it wants to be portable and abstract stuff away... imo those two goals are rather at odds with each other
[10:58:41] <aatch> I'm not sure what major abstractions C has, some of the atomics stuff in C11 maybe?
[10:58:54] <eddyb> with unsafe Rust and transmute, you can tell what things really do
[10:59:12] <eddyb> each intrinsic has a well-defined function
[10:59:17] <niconii> well it got better with C99
[10:59:46] <niconii> but not being able to count on basic stuff like "what size even is this number" was kinda...
[11:00:28] <bluss> C supports buffered files and streams, that's far out abstract isn't it?
[11:00:50] <aatch> bluss, that's the library though, not the language.
[11:01:29] <bluss> well it's part of the C language, but ok, I understand what you're asking now
[11:02:58] <kimundi> A curriculum that starts with no_std and gradually introduces essential libraries like IO one at a time would be interesting
[11:03:55] <bluss> I don't know any language that doesn't obscure what the CPUs are doing, since their execution logic is so advanced now
[11:04:19] <aatch> I dunno, I'm not good with abstraction, I always want to know how something works, down to some reasonable level.
[11:05:05] <aatch> I wrote a simple program in Rust that did direct syscalls for stuff like io, learned a lot about user programs talk to the OS.
[11:06:35] <niconii> my knowledge of CPUs is still kinda rooted in the '80s... i could probably make a design for a cpu like that at the logic gate level, but i don't know enough about modern cpus to know what all goes into that
[11:06:52] <niconii> i'm aware of basic stuff like the cache though

[11:08:07] <niconii> anyway, i don't have much of a taste for abstraction layers either, i prefer being able to stay fairly close to the metal
[11:09:37] <niconii> haskell kinda intrigued me but it was just too abstract; aside from that, i was sick of C; so rust really ended up filling the sort of niche i was looking for
[11:11:26] <aatch> For me it was wanting to explore the close-to-the-metal stuff. C is just too finicky, and C++ is, well, C++. Rust is complex, but it's a flavor of complex to C++.
[11:12:30] <aatch> I guess my issue with C++ was actually that trying to read other people's C++ code was either unproductive because it was simple, or unproductive because I didn't have any idea what was going on.
[11:12:51] <benh> we should come up with a cool rust/haskell ffi layer that translates ADTs
[11:13:04] <bluss> sometimes C libraries could use a bit more abstraction. Say small wrapper structs to enable a tiny bit more type checking
[11:13:38] <benh> the pain of C is that it can't really abstract over error handling intertwined with resource management imo
[11:14:25] <aatch> I like Rust because I can treat it like C + some useful abstractions.

[15:08:02] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: neat

[15:08:13] <XMPPwocky> .... you know what I meant.
[15:08:26] <Quxxy> WindowsBunny: Unfortunately, I *may* have just hit a rather big snag
[15:08:34] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: neat
[15:08:40] <Quxxy> :D
[15:09:42] <XMPPwocky> the interesting thing about that revuln paper is how much they get on int overflows
[15:09:48] <XMPPwocky> that's what I've found in the Source engine, too
[15:10:26] <XMPPwocky> do game programmers just not know that ints wrap back around?
[15:12:01] <ytain> they don't know if they didn't learn before in assembler
[15:12:03] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: Does it sort the functions into separate files for each -sys crate?
[15:12:18] <Quxxy> WindowsBunny: Not yet, but I already have the tables for that
[15:12:24] <Quxxy> Oh dear
[15:12:34] <Quxxy> This... might be a problem
[15:12:49] <Quxxy> I need to find a way to *stop* clang from defining platform-specific identifiers
[15:12:53] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: Did you just use dumpbin?
[15:13:06] <WindowsBunny> platform specific identifiers? o_0
[15:13:17] <Quxxy> I have to run the process for each arch
[15:13:23] <Quxxy> I can't #define my way around that
[15:13:32] <Quxxy> So I do this by passing a bunch of -D switches to clang
[15:13:51] <Quxxy> But I didn't realise that, even when you're using the cindex api, it *already* defines all the usual symbols automatically
[15:14:16] <Quxxy> So I have a 32-bit build of clang; I can't get it to *not* #define __i386__, for example, when I'm doing the x86_64 pass
[15:14:31] <Quxxy> WindowsBunny: Uhh... I used... *something*, I forget what :P
[15:14:44] <ogham> is it possible to run out of inodes
[15:14:53] <XMPPwocky> ogham: yes
[15:15:20] <ogham> oh good
[15:16:22] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: lol clang
[15:18:43] <Quxxy> WindowsBunny: I've also discovered some other fun things
[15:18:51] <Quxxy> On some platforms, DWORD is a typedef
[15:18:54] <Quxxy> On others, it's a macro
[15:19:00] <Quxxy> Which means they expand to different things
[15:19:48] <Quxxy> WindowsBunny: Also, --target switch to the rescue! :D
[15:20:18] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: which headers are you using?
[15:20:24] <Quxxy> MinGW
[15:20:28] <WindowsBunny> fak u
[15:20:50] <WindowsBunny> I don't want code generated from mingw headers in my winapi :(
[15:20:50] <Quxxy> I figured clang would have an easier time with those
[15:21:21] <WindowsBunny> Windows 8.1 SDK is the one true source
[15:21:45] <Quxxy> WindowsBunny: The last time I tried installing the official MS SDK, it fucked something up and broke my environment
[15:22:08] <Quxxy> The *second* time, I *couldn't* install it because it insisted on installing to C: where I don't have enough space
[15:22:11] <Quxxy> So... yeah
[15:22:26] <Quxxy> If clang can parse the VC headers, then this should still work on those

[15:36:30] <zofrex> this is one of my favourite articles ever
[15:36:41] <Quxxy> WindowsBunny: Well, I *am* using the shitty MinGW headers :P
[15:36:41] <WindowsBunny> yet your output doesn't reflect that >:(
[15:36:59] <zofrex> Starcraft doesn't actually have isometric tiles, it's still using the square tile engine from Warcraft: "While rendering isn’t so bad, isometric path-finding on square tiles was very difficult"
[15:38:00] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: now get me some output using the correct headers :D
[15:39:40] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: also, some corrections to the output, since each -sys crate glob imports winapi to get all types, you can refer to all the types without any qualifiers
[15:40:26] <Quxxy> Is it faster without the globs, though?
[15:40:45] <Quxxy> Anyway, that can be changed pretty easily later on (just remove the module qualifier in the type translation)
[15:41:00] <WindowsBunny> the -sys crates already compile very fast, so compilation speed isn't an issue
[15:41:51] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: it would be _really_ cool if you grouped things into extern blocks that had the same set of cfg flags
[15:42:13] <Quxxy> WindowsBunny: Aye; for the moment, it's easier to just emit everything as single decls
[15:42:24] <Quxxy> But there's already a collation step at the end where the symbol list is sorted
[15:42:29] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: But for the future it would be nice
[15:43:08] <Quxxy> Given that, you should be able to sort by (cconv, feature_set, name), .group_by, and iterate over the result
[15:43:34] <Quxxy> The only problem is that I don't think you can do attributes on blocks for items
[15:43:51] <WindowsBunny> attributes?
[15:43:51] <Quxxy> So you'd have to shove each batch into its own module, then re-export
[15:43:58] <Quxxy> The #[cfg] stuff
[15:44:06] <WindowsBunny> I'm pretty sure you can cfg an extern block
[15:44:13] <WindowsBunny> Because I did it in my -sys crates
[15:44:17] <Quxxy> Ah, ok
[15:44:20] <WindowsBunny> unless they're compiling without actually working
[15:44:23] <WindowsBunny> in which case what the fuck rust

[17:16:19] * WindowsBunny nibbles on Quxxy
[17:16:29] <Quxxy> Are you sure RtlCompareMemory isn't defined on 32-bits?
[17:16:46] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: I mean, it isn't in kernel32.lib
[17:17:02] <WindowsBunny> It is defined as an inline function though :D
[17:17:18] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: You do check if a function is defined inline right?
[17:17:29] <Quxxy> Currently the check is a bit wonky; theoretically, yes
[17:17:37] <Quxxy> But I'm looking at winnt.h, and it's not defined inline
[17:17:47] <Quxxy> And as far as I can tell, it's defined for x86
[17:18:00] <WindowsBunny> oh I see
[17:18:03] <WindowsBunny> it is in ntdll
[17:18:15] <WindowsBunny> but not kernel32
[17:18:31] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: Want me to grab you all the exports?
[17:18:31] <Quxxy> So it *is* supposed to be there
[17:18:43] <Quxxy> I'm not worrying about which lib stuff is in just yet :P

[17:21:08] <WindowsBunny> Are you sure you have your calling conventions functioning correctly?
[17:21:25] <Quxxy> WindowsBunny: I've noticed the Rtl functions always seem to be C
[17:21:27] <Quxxy> Even on Win32
[17:21:51] <Quxxy> I believe I checked it a while back; it's because they're NTAPI and not WINAPI
[17:21:58] <WindowsBunny> one sec

[17:26:20] <WindowsBunny> VS 2013 is 1800
[17:26:30] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: Try setting it to 1800 and hoping for the best?
[17:29:50] <Quxxy> WindowsBunny: That did it

[21:01:51] <zofrex> Tobba: are you on windows?
[21:01:58] <Tobba> linux, okular seems to work
[21:02:03] <zofrex> ah, NFC then
[21:02:14] <zofrex> although for giggles you could open it in Firefox and see what it does to pdf.js
[21:02:29] <Tobba> okular has a memory leak, so uh
[21:02:56] <Tobba> it's currently using 3.5GB for this one 220 page PDF I've been browsing for a while
[21:04:48] <WindowsBunny> Tobba: can has link?
[21:05:14] <Tobba> WindowsBunny: it's a merged version of an intel spec, which normally comes as 20(!) volumes
[21:05:21] <WindowsBunny> Tobba: I find that sumatra pdf works pretty well
[21:05:40] <Tobba> while this thing is 5.2k pages, intel does not provide an index

[21:10:13] <Sho> BTW, KDE's Okular runs fine on Windows
[21:10:18] <c74d> Tobba: maybe PWMT's PDF viewer? they seem to like minimalness, at least.

[21:12:18] <Tobba> the CPU usage is not.

[22:54:05] <bstrie> I like how windows tells me "Your username or password is incorrect" upon typing an incorrect password, despite the fact that there exists exactly one plainly available and selectable user account to log in with
[22:54:27] <bstrie> it suggests that it's possible that windows could generate honeypot user accounts for attackers to select
[22:55:32] <bstrie> three identically-named "Ben" accounts on the login screen, but only one has the correct user icon. select the wrong one and your hard drives wipes itself
[22:55:54] <dfockler> much secure
[22:56:58] <Sho> we had a huge debate over whether it's ok for Plasma 5's sddm theme to leak the existence of user names or not
[22:57:20] <dfockler> Is it pretty easy to get them otherwise?

[23:02:53] <Tobba> Sho: any idea why the "optimized for systems with 256MB" on Okular actually keeps a 2.8GB cache?
[23:03:02] <Tobba> it doesn't seem to want to go above 2.8GB per document
[23:03:24] <Tobba> but uh, yeah
[23:03:26] <Sho> In any other channel I'd ask "how did you measure" now, but I assume you know what you're doing, so: Dunno
[23:03:32] <zofrex> leaking usernames on websites is a slightly bigger deal because it makes brute force attacks that much easier
[23:03:50] <zofrex> I'd be interested how much you agree with ^, bstrie 
[23:04:43] <Sho> c74d: It's configurable by changing the theme or fiddling with the "list users in uid range x-y" setting
[23:04:51] <bstrie> zofrex: practically speaking, so many websites already do leak your username. google via your gmail address. every forum ever. there are easy solutions for over-the-web bruteforcing
[23:05:12] <Havvy> It's practically impossible to secure your username.
[23:05:15] <zofrex> yeah forums are terrible for that
[23:05:20] <Elaine> nor should it matter, really.
[23:05:23] <Elaine> usernames are not secrets.
[23:05:28] <bstrie> now, these sites *could* decouple your login name from your public nick
[23:05:46] <zofrex> no, not secrets... but if you can tell apart valid usernames from invalid you have a much smaller space to search
[23:05:51] <Tobba> Sho: I'm looking at ksysguard, but statm seems to show the same thing
[23:06:03] <Elaine> that's true, but I don't see it as important or relevant.
[23:06:07] <zofrex> example attack: try to log in with the "top 10" passwords on every valid username
[23:06:10] <Havvy> zofrex:  Which seeing that you can attempt a registration attempt to check in 99% of websites....
[23:06:11] <Sho> That's fine, ksysguard is pretty decent at it (I like its big memory report feature, too)
[23:06:23] <zofrex> Havvy: yeah and that's where it gets impossible to stop the leak :D
[23:06:51] <Tobba> the cache probably works off the number of pages it keeps rendered and underestimates the page size
[23:06:55] <Sho> Tobba: My guess would be something like "we shouldn't have let a GSoC student implement the tiled renderer" or so
[23:06:56] <bstrie> zofrex: I've heard that websites these days just reject your password if you try to sign up with one of the top 10 passwords
[23:06:59] <Tobba> which probably comes down to a graphics driver bug
[23:07:08] <Tobba> or that

[23:07:32] <zofrex> even ones that really, really should... http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/24/irs-employees-password-no-wonder-we-get-hacked
[23:07:54] <bstrie> but I'm not here to defend passwords, passwords suck :P
[23:08:15] <bstrie> usernames aren't a security mechanism, and passwords are a shitty security mechanism
[23:08:30] <Tobba> people really need to come up with better security solutions than "use stronger passwords"
[23:09:01] <c74d> bstrie: passwords, or customizable passwords?
[23:09:06] <Tobba> users are never going to be good at remembering passwords, deal with it
[23:09:30] <Tobba> heck I'm not going to use anything not pathetically weak unless it's for something important
[23:09:35] <bstrie> c74d: describe "uncustomizable passwords" :P
[23:09:55] <niconii> "choose your password from this drop-down list!"
[23:10:02] <c74d> passwords set by the service, rather than by the user
[23:10:07] <bstrie> how does a user log in
[23:10:17] <c74d> with the password the service gave them
[23:10:20] <bstrie> oh I see
[23:10:25] <Sho> if we just didn't allow logging in at all it would dramatically reduce the bug surface
[23:10:35] <Sho> i've also suggested power management just keeping the screen off at all times
[23:10:37] <bstrie> Sho: enforced anonymity!
[23:10:40] <Tobba> also the more strict a password policy is, the less effective it is
[23:10:51] <zofrex> to a point
[23:10:59] <bstrie> c74d: it's probably possible to do it well, but I don't think it's an order of magnitude better
[23:11:00] <Tobba> if you mandated 2 special characters, uppercase and lowercase minimum 10 letters everyone would just have it on a post-it
[23:11:07] * Sho identifies as guestkin and is offended by having a username forced on him
[23:11:14] <zofrex> "minimum length 6, disallow top 10 passwords" is stricter than "no restrictions" but you'll get better passwords with the former
[23:11:38] <Tobba> well yeah
[23:11:43] <bstrie> if we just stop putting personal data online entirely then we don't need accounts
[23:11:49] <zofrex> also don't underestimate the security of post-it passwords
[23:11:52] <bstrie> The Uncustomized Internet Manifesto
[23:11:54] <Tobba> there's a fine middle ground where you can actually remember the password
[23:12:13] <bstrie> honestly, all my passwords are on a post-it. that post-it is in a safe, though
[23:12:14] <c74d> bstrie: people had accounts before there was the Internet to have them on :p
[23:12:35] <Tobba> there's a fine middle-ground where the user can actually remember the password
[23:12:37] <Sho> i have a function in my head for combining $name_of_the_thing_im_logging_into with a text only i know to generate a pw
[23:12:40] <bstrie> because all these damn websites with their arbitrarily different password policies mean that I have to have a million unmemorizable passwords
[23:12:41] <Sho> that way i don't need to remember any pws
[23:12:43] <Tobba> which I'm guessing is at around 10-16 bits of entropy to an educated attacker
[23:12:51] <Sho> i just regen them
[23:13:03] <bstrie> Sho: I do too, but it still doesn't help because different websites have different special character demands
[23:13:16] <Sho> bstrie: I've been lucky so far

[23:14:19] <zofrex> my favourite password thing ever is the London Oyster Card... you register it via a paper form and write your intended account password down ON PAPER
[23:14:20] <zofrex> it's wild
[23:14:34] <bstrie> write it in cursive
[23:14:48] <bstrie> they force you to type it in using the cursive unicode characters
[23:14:53] <zofrex> it's just hilarious, people get upset about storing passwords in plaintext, and then there's this thing
[23:14:55] <bstrie> perfect security
[23:15:09] <niconii> Tobba: depends on what the password looks like; a set of random words a la diceware provides a good amount of entropy yet is actually something you can remember because it's not just a bunch of random characters
[23:15:10] <Havvy> Include the zero-width space character in your passwords.
[23:15:16] <bstrie> honestly, it's still better than storing passwords in plaintext
[23:15:20] <Havvy> That way even if you write it down, they can't enter it in.
[23:15:23] <niconii> Tobba: ...it's just a lot of stuff won't accept passwords like that
[23:15:30] <brandonson> zofrex: can you change the password online after?
[23:15:30] <zofrex> brandonson: yes, you can and I did
[23:15:42] <Tobba> niconii: it does depend on how you count the entropy though

[23:18:19] <zofrex> "sleptfinedeadreturnfinishedpattern" that's... surprisingly memorable
[23:18:26] <niconii> Tobba: diceware in particular uses a list of 7776 words, and you choose a word from the list based on five dice rolls
[23:20:02] <zofrex> bstrie: arguably security answers can't be hashed, though... they often need to be checked over the phone
[23:20:04] <Elaine> I use a password manager... it's pretty useful, I don't need to remember even its password since it's on my yubikey.
[23:20:26] <Elaine> Having password generators built into browser password stores would be nice.
[23:20:36] <zofrex> when I signed up for a Telewest Broadband account the registration was done online so I generated the password with LastPass... turned out I had to give that password over the phone every time I rang up
[23:20:36] <Tobba> I wonder how many things normalize unicode before hashing it
[23:20:56] <zofrex> I could tell the member services agent could see the password because they'd ask for it and laugh when I sighed "oh boy, here we go"
[23:21:11] <niconii> Tobba: assuming the attacker actually knows you're using diceware, and you use six words, that's log2(7776^6) bits of entropy, so about 77 bits

[23:22:17] <Tobba> that's pretty reasonable
[23:23:04] <zofrex> I wonder if anyone's made rainbow tables specifically targeting diceware passwords

[23:33:45] <aatch> Too many different hashing strategies for rainbow table to be useful.
[23:34:47] <zofrex> plus anything that isn't salted is probably using a terrible hashing algorithm that can now be attacked billions of times per second on a single modest GPU
[23:35:16] <aatch> I think the reality is that most sites are either handling sensitive data properly, or are doing a terrible job and rainbow tables aren't necessary.
[23:35:27] <aatch> zofrex, yeah, that.
[23:35:27] <zofrex> yup
[23:35:44] <zofrex> one thing that gets overlooked loads:
[23:35:53] <zofrex> are you hashing your one-time login tokens for your password reset feature?
[23:36:15] <Elaine> Eh?
[23:36:25] <aatch> zofrex, anything that gets used for authentication is hashed in my app.
[23:36:30] <zofrex> \o/
[23:36:54] <Elaine> Why would you hash that?
[23:36:56] <aatch> zofrex, so passwords, one-time login tokens, even "remember me" cookies.
[23:36:59] <Elaine> aatch: use a kdf, not a hash!
[23:37:07] <zofrex> Elaine: assuming the point of hashing passwords is to mitigate damage from someone getting access to the database, if the one-time login tokens are stored in plaintext then at any given time there would be a bunch of valid ones at rest in the DB
[23:37:44] <Elaine> Fair enough, but I'm willing to bet you sent it in plaintext in email too.
[23:37:59] <zofrex> not really any choice there
[23:38:06] <aatch> Elaine, I might actaully be using a KDF, assuming a KDF is what I think it is.
[23:38:11] <zofrex> but it's the difference between getting into 1 account and getting into N accounts
[23:38:14] <brandonson> zofrex: if your expiry period is low enough, that's probably not a significant concern
[23:38:40] <zofrex> yeah that brings me to another thing that gets overlooked loads...
[23:38:42] <zofrex> :P
[23:38:45] <Elaine> bcrypt, scrypt, pbkdf2 etc
[23:38:48] <brandonson> zofrex: it's so simple you might as well do it, but on a 15 minute expiry there's not too many valid tokens at once
[23:39:23] <zofrex> indeed. Sadly on many sites one time tokens don't expire, or last a very long time. If they DO expire, they tend to not be "one time" tokens at all...
[23:39:30] <Elaine> yuck
[23:39:40] <Elaine> it's so hard to mess up password reset nonces :(
[23:39:50] <zofrex> but it's so easy to implement them lazily
[23:40:05] <Elaine> lazy developers shouldn't be allowed to touch user data :P

[23:40:45] <Elaine> See also, https://password-hashing.net/
[23:41:06] <zofrex> Elaine: this was on the front page of hacker news not too long ago https://neosmart.net/blog/2015/using-hmac-signatures-to-avoid-database-writes/
[23:42:24] <zofrex> I'm not sure what kind of developer it is that thinks "Gee, using cryptography primitives sure is easier than storing random numbers in a database" but apparently there are lots of 'em
[23:42:30] <bstrie> be aware that diceware itself tells you all the info about entropy that you need:
[23:42:33] <bstrie> "For the technically inclined, each word in your Diceware passphrase yields 12.9 bits of entropy, the way passphrase security is measured. A five word Diceware passphrase would have an entropy of at least 64.6 bits; six words would have 77.5 bits, seven words 90.4 bits, eight words 103.2 bits. Inserting a letter at random adds about 10 bits of entropy. All this assumes, of course, that you actually keep your passphrase a secret."
[23:43:04] <bstrie> they also recommend a way to insert special characters into your password for even more security
[23:43:12] <zofrex> how many bits of entropy does choosing to use diceware add? (only half joking)
[23:44:59] <bstrie> zofrex: http://xkcd.com/936/
[23:45:20] <zofrex> I hate this comic
[23:45:25] <bstrie> hahahaha
[23:45:32] <Elaine> If you know someone is using diceware, you have reduced your search space dramatically compared to what the password length would indicate.
[23:46:04] <Elaine> According to keepassx a 15 character password (admittedly using all printable ASCII characters) is 99 bits of entropy.
[23:46:05] <aatch> Elaine, looking at the implementation (it's been a while since I touched this code) it looks like we're using bcrypt
[23:46:10] <Elaine> And my standard 50 is 330...
[23:46:12] <zofrex> right. but if we know how many people use diceware versus how many people use other schemes, we could actually calculate the entropy of choosing to use diceware
[23:46:16] <Elaine> right, yes
[23:46:34] <zofrex> aatch: isn't using bcrypt prohibitively slow for validating session cookies?
