[04:46:57] <Gankro> quantheory: Whether cargo locks caching a "canonical Rust" version of the library where globs are expanded, types are all annotated, and everything is UFCS
[04:47:24] <Gankro> s/Whether/"the idea of"
[04:48:40] <Gankro> This was proposed in the new semver RFC as a possible way to minimize "minor" breaking changes like adding a public item to a module, but I was wondering if there's performance value in this
[04:50:18] <aatch> Gankro, well it'd actually be good to have a representation like that for most of the compiler internals.
[04:50:23] <quantheory> OK. I can see it buying performance as something intermediate between Rust and LLVM IR (IIR? IIIR?). I have my doubts about relationship to semver, but I'll have to read/think more to have any intelligent thoughts.
[04:50:43] <aatch> Gankro, it's pretty much the Typed AST I want.

[04:54:29] <Gankro> quantheory: The semver argument is basically that Idiomatic Rust is basically a massive back-compat hazard where almost any change but "make a new crate" is technically breaking in a corner case, but a lot of it is just ambiguities from shorthands. If you make everything longform/explicit a lot of the problems go away. We have to live with this property of
[04:54:29] <Gankro> idiomatic Rust, but at very least Cargo can snapshot the semantics the code had when it was last built by expanding stuff out to "explicit" form.
[04:57:18] <acrichto> eddyb: hm interesting, I'd have to investigate some more to see what's going on as well, although I woul ddefinitelyb elieve that plugins just work by the skin of our teeth
[04:57:28] <acrichto> seanmonstar: I'm hoping to drill more into tomaka's concerns
[04:57:32] <quantheory> Gankro: To be clear, my reaction was that the RFC was a very important thing, but a hard thing to take on. So "I have my doubts" is just a fuzzy feeling until I have a better opinion, not a criticism!
[04:58:07] <eddyb> so here's an idea... nmatsakis, aturon: what if enabling feature gates turns on certain conditional deprecations? if you have const_fn enabled, you shouldn't use ATOMIC_USIZE_INIT or static mut (because there are const_fn-based replacements). and when the feature gets accepted in stable, the deprecations are turned on by default
[05:00:37] *** Joins: dinfuehr (dinfuehr@moz-jqkce6.highway.telekom.at)
[05:00:39] <eddyb> acrichto: actually, before the rustc_driver function that doesn't load, I call a few libsyntax and librustc functions (to create the session) so that's a bit odd. I know it's lazy because it doesn't error until you open a file in the demo, and it wants to compile it
[05:01:46] <eddyb> acrichto: if it's a stage1 vs stage2 thing, it could be that *some* hashes are different, and maybe that specific nightly version was unlucky
[05:02:35] <eddyb> I could probably get my hands on the exact version if I see mindtree around again
[05:05:19] <WindowsBunnyIsSorry> Rust is full of back compat hazards
[05:05:32] <WindowsBunnyIsSorry> I don't know how Rust ever intends to follow semver strictly
[05:05:39] <eddyb> Rust is a health hazard :P
[05:05:53] <WindowsBunnyIsSorry> eddyb: Only if it gets in your lungs
[05:06:42] <eddyb> WindowsBunnyIsSorry: by having language versioning and persistence
[05:06:52] <quantheory> I think that the point of what aturon proposed is that semver will not be followed "strictly", but rather as well as is practical.
[05:07:01] <eddyb> i.e. if you ask for 1.0 you cannot see that anything has changed
[05:07:31] <eddyb> this is probably workable at the library level, using the stability attributes
[05:07:41] <quantheory> But yeah, the only languages that I've seen providing super-strict semver guarantees are the ones that do so by simply not changing more than 1-2 times per decade.
[05:08:06] <eddyb> stuff like method conflicts can be solved by giving lower priority to unstable things
[05:08:37] <eddyb> if you ask for 1.0 and something was introduced in 1.1, it's considered unstable
[05:08:51] <eddyb> but I am guessing there is a reason for not doing that
[05:09:30] <seanmonstar> acrichto: ok, just concerned its getting closer and closer to too late
[05:09:58] <acrichto> seanmonstar: there aren't any backcompat worries about a lint like this, lints are not part of our backcompat story
[05:10:04] <eddyb> I personally want to remove static mut at least by means of deprecation
[05:10:10] <seanmonstar>  And removing the lint can be free
[05:10:37] <acrichto> seanmonstar: well removing any code is free, that is not a reason to land something
[05:10:46] <seanmonstar> I haven't read the semver rfc yet, it handles lints like this?
[05:10:50] <eddyb> const fn was too late and had no chance of being stabilized
[05:11:41] <eddyb> acrichto: I guess seanmonstar is worried that 1.0 not including this lint could result in some UB in the crates developed with the 1.0 compiler
[05:12:18] <acrichto> right, but that's going to happen no matter what
[05:12:29] <eddyb> a nice way to tell is to merge it in nightly and build all crates with the lint set to deny

[05:28:15] <aatch> Yes, it is. But how do prevent it without using something like Agda?

[05:28:37] <huon> WindowsBunnyIsSorry: right, but we're not going to land ever useful UB lint in 1.0: there'll be lots of things that crates developed against 1.0 will do that are UB

[07:20:23] <bstrie> nmatsakis: an interesting thought experiment that I've seen come up in the past few days: is borrowing more fundamental to rust than moving? what if, instead of move-by-default or copy-by-default, rust was borrow-by-default?
[07:22:45] <seanmonstar> bstrie: foo(bar) passes &bar, and you need to foo(move bar) to get current semantics?
[07:23:54] *** WindowsBunnyIsSorry is now known as WindowsBunny
[07:30:02] <bstrie> seanmonstar: some variant of that idea, yes. the important point being that moves and borrows are now explicit and implicit, rather than vice versa
[07:30:38] <bstrie> seanmonstar: perhaps `foo(bar)` for borrows, `foo(mut bar)` for mutable borrows, `foo(move bar)` for movement
[07:30:55] <bstrie> I'm not actually proposing this, just thinking if there's anything obviously wrong with it :)
[07:31:22] <bstrie> let x = move 2;  would be required so as not to get a reference

[14:41:42] <Manishearth> thanks

[14:42:47] <bluss> rustc parses it as (&1)..2 too
[14:43:41] <bluss> which means that &3.. is legal but parsed as (&3)..
[14:45:39] <klutzy> parser-lalr results. `fn main() { &1..2; }`: http://ix.io/iip / `fn main() { &..; }`: http://ix.io/iiq

[18:13:43] <cmr> doener: (I'm going to need to do the same thing for some SIMD intrinsics, if you did)
[18:14:33] <acrichto> brson: yeah I'm.. not sure what's going on
[18:14:45] <acrichto> brson: the md5 of the two gcc/ld executables is the exact same, and the set of files we distribute is also the exact same
[18:14:48] <acrichto> between the two nightlies

[18:14:52] <acrichto> I'll keep poking at it later
[18:15:26] <klutzy> acrichto: hmm, what's the problem there?
[18:15:40] <brson> acrichto: LIBRARY_PATH is gcc specific http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4250624/ld-library-path-vs-library-path
[18:16:06] <acrichto> klutzy: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/25072
[18:16:19] <brson> i wonder why we used that instead of -L
[18:16:23] <acrichto> klutzy: the bundled gcc in 2015-04-29 worked
[18:16:23] <brson> seems to be the same as -L
[18:16:30] <brson> except precedence
[18:16:34] <acrichto> klutzy: the bundled gcc in 2015-05-01 does not
[18:16:42] <acrichto> brson: yeah...
[18:16:53] <acrichto> the 04-29 compiler passed full paths to crtN.o
[18:17:02] <acrichto> the 05-01 just passes raw "crtN.o" instead of a path to it

[18:17:36] <klutzy> acrichto: does replacing 05-01 gcc with 04-29 one fix it? (i.e. which one of gcc/rustc is responsible?)
[18:18:43] <acrichto> klutzy: the gcc/ld binaries have the same md5
[18:18:49] <acrichto> so I think it has to be rustc
[18:18:51] <klutzy> uh
[18:20:10] * kmc builds two gcc with the same md5sum just to confound acrichto 
[18:20:59] <benh> acrichto: is thread::catch_panic unproblematic to nest?
[18:21:41] <acrichto> benh: it should be unproblematic, yes
[18:22:07] <benh> it just seems to delegte to rt::unwind::try() which seems to say it's unsafe to nest it

[18:25:39] <benh> basically being unable to catch exceptions safely when being called by C code seemed like a big issue a while ago and catch_panic seems like a really simple function for having solved all that!
[18:26:49] <acrichto> benh: the 'static + Send bound is what helps that
[18:27:05] <acrichto> benh: and yeah that's precisely what catch_panic was added for :)

[18:53:52] <brson> rust-www has suggested the wrong beta for 4 days
[18:54:16] <brson> i guess that's a good sign that betas are nbd
[18:56:06] <bluss> it makes it harder for users. Some crates already depend on IntoIterator in the prelude
[18:56:33] <acrichto> klutzy: ping
[18:56:42] <brson> steveklabnik: how do you ideally want the doc urls to change? do we just need to make a stable location for the stable docs (assuming betas will be in a stable location)?
[18:57:21] <steveklabnik> brson: so, there's two questions
[18:57:29] <steveklabnik> one is, of course, the canonical URLs
[18:57:35] <steveklabnik> the second is, what do the shortcuts redirect to
[18:57:45] <steveklabnik> so, like doc.rust-lang.org/std redirects to nightly at the moment
[18:59:01] <steveklabnik> i think that the nightly/beta has been working well, so my gut is to say nightly/beta/stable, with shortcuts redirecting to stable. and of course, each release has its version specifically too, so we can look at 1.1 docs after 1.2 is released
[19:00:22] <brson> so ideally doc.rust-lang.org/ and doc.rust-lang.org/stable both redirect to doc.rust-lang.org/1.0.0
[19:00:51] <brson> would it be bad if /stable was not a redirect but duplication?
[19:00:56] <steveklabnik> yeah, i'd guess so. /stable is probably the least important, but might as well have one for each channel, for consistency
[19:01:09] <steveklabnik> generally yes. but we could fix that with rel=canonical
[19:01:28] <brson> so the stable docs should rel=canonical to /stable?
