[19:30:58] <Tiffany> china is a little bit insulated though
[19:31:13] <Tiffany> they have all their own social networks and such
[19:31:32] <Tiffany> so you don't see a lot of chinese people on the english-speaking parts of the internet
[19:31:51] <Tiffany> but hackers don't really care where their targets come from, so they start shining out
[19:32:18] <Tiffany> personally I think the only chinese IPs that have hit my website were bots trying to scan for vulnerabilities to exploit
[19:32:28] <Tiffany> or easy passwords to guess
[19:32:36] <Tiffany> like admin:admin or root:admin
[19:32:49] <kmc> there are a fair number of rust contributors in china
[19:33:00] <kmc> even though their govt keeps trying to take down github
[19:35:53] <Tobba> can't really expect anything less from the chinese gov
[19:40:04] <kmc> the NSA does more to compromise worldwide internet security, and ordinary citizens of the USA are more responsible for those actions than chinese citizens are for what their govt does 
[19:40:09] <kmc> because this country is still ostensibly a democracy
[19:40:40] <kmc> 'If this government ever became a tyrant, if a dictator ever took charge in this country, the technological capacity that the intelligence community has given the government could enable it to impose total tyranny, and there would be no way to fight back because the most careful effort to combine together in resistance to the government, no matter how privately it was done, is within the reach of the government to know. Such is the capabilit
[19:40:46] <kmc> I don't want to see this country ever go across the bridge. I know the capacity that is there to make tyranny total in America, and we must see to it that this agency and all agencies that possess this technology operate within the law and under proper supervision so that we never cross over that abyss. That is the abyss from which there is no return'
[19:41:14] <kmc> honestly if the USA doesn't fix this soon, there is no reason to consier the country democratic anymore
[19:41:45] <kmc> that and the fact that the basic apparatus of legislative government has completely ceased to function
[19:42:19] <kmc> the job of a congressman is solely to get elected congressman again
[19:42:26] <kmc> ugh
[19:42:37] <Tiffany> most of the people I've talked to don't care about privacy
[19:42:40] <Tiffany> it's rather horrifying
[19:42:42] <Tobba> it's been fucked for quite a while
[19:42:47] <Tobba> and what Tiffany said
[19:42:56] <Tiffany> at least
[19:42:56] <kmc> I don't care about my *personal* privacy, but I care a great deal that privacy continues to exist
[19:42:58] <Tiffany> that's what they say
[19:43:00] <kmc> it's a really important distinction
[19:43:04] <kmc> that people are usually fuzzy about
[19:43:05] <Tiffany> until someone hacks their phone or uploads revenge porn
[19:43:07] <Tobba> I need to come up with a better explanation for the implications of privacy other than worst-case tyranny scenarios
[19:43:17] <kmc> I have the privilege to live mostly without secrets, but not everyone does
[19:43:27] <kmc> especially political dissidents
[19:43:31] <Tobba> even though everyone sane would tell you that having a system where that is one of the final outcomes is absolutely insane
[19:43:50] <kmc> it's not even a "final outcome", it's today's reality
[19:44:08] <kmc> the govt can tap all of your communications without a warrant and then arrest you on drug charges w/ made up evidence
[19:44:12] <kmc> that's just a clearly documented fact
[19:44:54] <Tiffany> people don't really believe that's a thing that can happen to them
[19:44:56] <kmc> or render you to pakistan
[19:45:00] <Tiffany> it sounds too much like conspiracy theories
[19:45:02] <kmc> right
[19:45:04] <Tiffany> a rogue facebook app looks through your timeline and finds embarassing photos and puts them up for ransom
[19:45:12] <Tobba> blame conspiracy nuts
[19:45:20] <mcpherrin> if people don't want privacy ask 'em for dick pics
[19:45:27] <kmc> it also sounds like conspiracy theories that the CIA would kidnap random american citizens and dose them with LSD just to see what happens
[19:45:35] <Tiffany> an app on your phone with one extra permission that you really should have looked at but didn't, and now all of your private texts are up on the internet for everyone to see
[19:45:35] <kmc> but in fact they did that shit, there was a congressional investigation
[19:45:51] <kmc> and they probably did much worse things because most of the records were destroyed :/
[19:45:56] <mcpherrin> or the navy spray diseases over SF to see how they spread
[19:45:59] <kmc> yep
[19:46:03] <Tobba> mcpherrin: then people just say they would only trust the government with it
[19:46:05] <Tiffany> a proprietary chat platform like snapchat is compromised and leaks all user chat logs, despite their publicly stated security guarantees
[19:46:13] <Tobba> I don't know why people trust governments like that
[19:46:42] <kmc> the thing about "conspiracy theories" is that sometimes conspiracies happen! especially when you take a large number of ruthless ideological people and give them billions and billions of dollars with no public oversight
[19:46:46] <kmc> who could imagine that going wrong
[19:47:12] <Tiffany> it's the number of people involved and the incentive structure which makes or breaks a conspiracy (or a conspiracy theory)
[19:47:23] <kmc> the CIA is quite literally in the business of perpetrating criminal conspiracies, nominally only ouside the USA
[19:47:35] <Tobba> I wish people would stop shitting out so many dumb conspiracies so actual ones could be taken seriously
[19:47:52] <mcpherrin> CONTRAILS
[19:48:05] <Tiffany> covering up aliens would require basically every member of congress to know and understand that alien life exists and, for some reason, is pestering earth
[19:48:12] <kmc> I've honestly lost any sense of which theories are ridiculous
[19:48:25] <Tobba> I remember when it started snowing in the US and people genuinly believed the government was dropping plastic snow
[19:48:49] <Tobba> that one was pretty funny though
[19:49:01] <kmc> there's no reason to believe HAARP can control my mind, but plenty of reason to believe the US (or especially Soviet) government would try such a thing anyway
[19:49:14] <Tobba> aren't there records of the CIA trying that
[19:49:15] <mcpherrin> HAARP is shut down :(
[19:49:16] <Tobba> a whole lot of times
[19:49:18] <kmc> a lot of totally pointless things were done and built during the cold war just because the other side was doing it
[19:49:30] <kmc> or to trick the other side into doing something dangerous / stupid / expensive
[19:49:38] <kmc> http://www.tor.com/stories/2012/07/a-tall-tail
[19:58:27] <cmr> Reminds me of that one blogging chemist who writes articles about substances he refuses to handle.

[19:58:54] <Tiffany> cmr: this one? http://pipeline.corante.com/
[19:59:04] <kmc> I think the modern world is just incredibly hostile to representative democracy :/
[19:59:12] <kmc> because there are too many ways to accumulate power in one place
[19:59:20] <Tiffany> well, this category in particular: http://pipeline.corante.com/archives/things_i_wont_work_with/
[19:59:31] <kmc> money, atom bombs, hacking everything, being a televangelist, etc
[19:59:39] <kmc> advertising
[19:59:55] <cmr> Tiffany: that's the one, yeah.
[20:00:19] <kmc> not like people haven't always been coerced by violence or captivated by idiots
[20:00:22] <kmc> or swayed by money
[20:00:27] <kmc> but now you can wield these tools on a global scale
[20:03:23] <kmc> in america we stockpile guns against government tyranny but we're too lazy to use them when it actually happens
[20:03:24] <cmr> I'm not really sure what can be done to make the situation better.
[20:03:40] <cmr> yeah but they mostly only kill black people, so it's ok, right?
[20:03:41] <kmc> I'm actually afraid to say that here, because I know the NSA can see it and use it against me

[20:08:58] <kmc> it wouldn't actually be viable unless the political situation in the USA gets a lot worse
[20:10:26] <kmc> at which point Canada might be less willing to let the USA do whatever they want on the vermont/canada border
[20:10:38] <kmc> I don't know if NATO covers civil war / secession within a member state
[20:13:34] <kmc> i dunno
[20:13:37] <kmc> it's all pretty scary
[20:16:42] <Tobba> I think the scary part is that theres no easy way out of it
[20:16:52] <Tobba> also it depends on the US doing something right for once
[20:20:18] <kmc> yeah
[20:20:28] <kmc> also we've been through this before and people don't really care :(

[20:21:05] <cmr> yeah I don't really care either, as much as it kills a significant portion of the thinking half of my mind to say so.
[20:21:32] <kmc> i do care
[20:21:46] <kmc> but it's hard to rank all the various problems of the world in terms of severity
[20:22:03] <kmc> especially comparing ongoing acute problems to existential risks
[20:22:39] <kmc> anyway I think contributing to Rust and building the Rust ecosystem is one of the best things you can do to fight the NSA ;)
[20:22:51] <cmr> lol, how do you justify that?
[20:23:26] <kmc> well... ~50% of critical security holes are related to memory safety
[20:23:35] <kmc> the NSA is able to do what they do largely because they find bugs in everything
[20:23:43] <kmc> probably the massive datacenter in Utah is running massive fuzzing jobs, among other things
[20:23:50] <kmc> so fixing the security crisis in open source software
[20:23:57] <kmc> as well as improving open source tools like fuzzers
[20:24:05] <kmc> is very important
[20:24:23] <kmc> we've made it harder to exploit C/C++ bugs such that not every kiddiot can do it
[20:24:47] <kmc> I mean in C and C++
[20:24:50] <Tiffany> someone should build a rust equivalent of VCC
[20:24:51] <kmc> through ASLR, no-exec stacks, etc
[20:25:02] <kmc> but arguably it doesn't protect you much against adversaries like the NSA
[20:25:08] <kmc> who can find and exploit more subtle bugs
[20:25:33] <kmc> the NSA wants everything to be everyone-but-NSA proof and we are pretty much helping :(
[20:25:47] <kmc> by refusing to take a systematic approach to security on practically any level of the modern computing ecosystem
[20:26:03] <Tiffany> more funding for seL4 would be nice too
[20:26:22] <kmc> what's funny is that the US govt funds a lot of that research
[20:26:27] <kmc> thru DARPA and SBIR
[20:26:38] <kmc> Ksplice was at one point approached by the CIA's venture capital firm
[20:26:49] <Tiffany> can't have any bugs in avionics systems on military aircraft
[20:27:09] <kmc> yeah exactly
[20:29:39] <kmc> there's such a gap right now between that stuff and the absolute shit that "normal people" use
[20:29:52] <kmc> PHP web forums and libpurple with its segfault of the day
[20:30:12] <kmc> so it doesn't damage the NSA's mission
[20:30:58] <kmc> maybe I should sell a capabilities based secure microkernel to al qaeda (KIDDING, GUYS)
[20:31:18] <kmc> I read an article about jihadi crypto software and it sounded pretty bad
[20:31:38] <Tiffany> do they halfass their own stuff?
[20:31:42] <Tiffany> or just use whatever is popular
[20:31:46] <kmc> i think the former
[20:32:14] <kmc> for all I know, the NSA makes it and releases it thru a front
[20:32:17] <Tiffany> now I'm thinking of all of those awful, awful applications written in delphi
[20:32:20] <kmc> that i would have no problem with
[20:32:26] <Tiffany> like that mr-T endorsed voice chat
[20:32:30] <kmc> ...
[20:32:46] <Tiffany> delphi, for reference, does not have async IO, and does not have sane thread primitives
[20:32:55] <Tiffany> so what you end up with are applications full to the brim with deadlocks and race conditions
[20:33:02] <Tiffany> mutexes everywhere
[20:33:03] <kmc> yaaaaaaay

[22:45:41] <kmc> i don't actually pay attention to the news
[22:45:44] <kmc> because it's too depressing
[22:45:46] <kmc> I just rant on IRC
[22:45:57] <kmc> from time to time
[23:01:04] <Tiffany> I don't really have a good news source
[23:01:16] <Tiffany> the tv news networks are just absolutely unbelievable
[23:01:28] <Tiffany> and sites like the bbc are always posting irrelevant stuff
[23:01:38] <Tiffany> slow news day? better throw up a dead baby story
[23:02:36] <eternaleye> NPR's relatively worthwhile
[23:03:11] <eternaleye> I grew up with it always on though, so I may be biased
[23:04:20] <Tiffany> ugh
[23:04:34] <Tiffany> what the hell is with radio having shitty flash-based players
[23:04:43] <Tiffany> just give me the damn stream url to drop into mpv
[23:05:08] <Tiffany> at least this one somehow manages to not peg my CPU like all the others do
[23:06:51] <Tiffany> oh
[23:06:54] <Tiffany> they do have one available
[23:06:55] <Tiffany> that's nice
[23:09:05] <Tiffany> "NPR has been accused of displaying both liberal bias, as alleged in work such as a UCLA and University of Missouri study of Morning Edition, and conservative bias, including criticism of alleged reliance on conservative think-tanks.[54]"
[23:09:06] <Tiffany> hah
[23:21:26] <kmc> anyone with half a brain has been accused of both liberal and conservative bias
[23:21:41] <kmc> the best news channel in america right now might be al jazeera
[23:21:42] <kmc> lol
[23:21:54] <Tiffany> don't they focus on the middle east?
[23:22:04] <kmc> they have an american channel now
[23:22:12] <kmc> http://america.aljazeera.com/
[23:22:21] <kmc> i don't pay much attention to them tho
[23:22:56] <Tiffany> I found out that I can just dump pls files into my music dir and start them up whenever I want with mpv
[23:23:05] <kmc> cool
[23:23:31] <Tiffany> of course I don't really have any idea what they're talking about on npr
[23:23:35] <Tiffany> I'm guessing it always sounds like this
[23:30:00] <taryn> aljazeera is great
