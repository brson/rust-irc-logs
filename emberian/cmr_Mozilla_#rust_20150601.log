[00:16:53] <bbloom> then i have Object(T: Block)
[00:17:06] <WindowsBunny> So Object is a DST
[00:17:19] <bbloom> DST = dynamically sized type?
[00:17:22] <WindowsBunny> yes

[00:17:46] <WindowsBunny> Object<T: Block>(T)
[00:17:55] <bbloom> yeah, sorry, still learning the sytnax
[00:18:11] <bbloom> anyway, want to transmute a [u16;8] (which implements block) to an Object
[00:18:21] <bbloom> and i want to do this generically for any Block implementation
[00:18:32] <bbloom> and since Block is private, i know that the only implementations are properly sized
[00:18:45] <bbloom> (because i made them that way)
[00:18:55] <bluss> you can also mark a trait unsafe if you want to rely on such things
[00:19:09] <bbloom> what does it mean for a trait to be unsafe?
[00:19:24] <bluss> bbloom: only that you have to say `unsafe` when implementing it
[00:20:09] <bbloom> bluss: ok, well Block isn't part of my public API, so i don't really care if other people know it's safe or not
[00:20:15] <bbloom> but sure, i can do that
[00:20:17] <thelink2012> the correct way to convert a & ref into a * pointer is by transmuting?

[00:26:29] <bbloom> WindowsBunny: ah, ok - that makes some sense, but in this case the sizes can be known statically - is there a way to hint it? like the Sized trait or something else i don't quite understand yet?
[00:26:30] <Layl> basically: [5, 2].select(|num| num + 1) would result in [6, 3]

[00:27:09] <bbloom> seems really weird to me that the Sized trait represents "size is known" but not "the size is X"
[00:27:24] <WindowsBunny> bbloom: There is an implicit Sized bound on all type parameters anyway, I think
[00:27:24] <bbloom> i would expect a `fn size() -> usize`

[00:33:03] <_habnabit> ng "hey, i'm making sure a /real/ failure would be caught" would be. having a public API-level "set_panic_mode" method that makes the next method call panic seems like a bad idea too

[03:27:21] <Quxxy> I've used inference where possible

[03:31:37] <Quxxy> Do you have an example of it working?
[03:32:38] <doomrobo> Quxxy, in the code sample I gave you, the compiler didn't throw an error on .borrow().map(), but if you change the code to (&lines).map() it'll error
[03:33:22] <Quxxy> But it *is* throwing errors, because it doesn't know what type is involved
[03:33:38] <Quxxy> I meant an example of borrow().map(...) that *compiles* :P
[03:33:56] <doomrobo> oh, then you're probably right
[03:34:17] <Quxxy> I think when the error is on an entire method invocation, it means it's complaining about the subject
[03:35:10] <doomrobo> I'm just bothered that Vec::as_slice() is unstable. Using &v[..] is outright disgusting
[03:35:22] <Quxxy> &*v
[03:35:27] <Quxxy> Or &**v if you have a &Vec
[03:35:46] <doomrobo> less disgusting but I want my damn method
[03:35:54] <Quxxy> I tend to use that because it reads left-to-right; &v[..], on the other hand, cuts through *all* intermediate indirections
[03:36:07] <Quxxy> Rust is not a fan of duplicating functionality
[03:36:18] <Quxxy> &v[..] exists, and is more general, so .as_slice is unlikely to come back

[03:46:21] <p1start> My version is probably a terrible way of doing it
[03:46:24] <niconii> starless: to explain, it's not really a matter of "promoting the lifetime", the string needs to be stored somewhere
[03:46:38] <p1start> Given that it overwrites the input string
[03:47:00] <niconii> starless: right now it's being stored as a local variable inside the function, which dies when the function ends
[03:47:19] <doomrobo> I think p1start's does something closer to what you originally intended, starless. Mine just got rid of &mut and made a copy
[03:47:21] <niconii> starless: since you want to make it live longer, the solution is to store it inside Trivial itself, as a String
[03:48:41] <niconii> though p1start takes another approach by mutating the String living in main()
[03:49:05] <niconii> so that the &str will live as long as main() (i.e. the whole program)

[03:50:52] <niconii> scp: that's more than just breaking the rules, that's undefined behavior

[03:51:52] <niconii> scp: yeah, you can use UnsafeCell to accomplish what you want
[03:52:23] <Quxxy> doomrobo: Which is because s is a &Vec<u8>, so *s is Vec<u8>
[03:52:38] <doomrobo> ohh
[03:52:40] <Quxxy> Which is why I pointed out that &s[..] *cuts through intermediate layers* but &*s doesn't
[03:52:49] <Quxxy> You need an extra *, &**s
[03:53:04] <Quxxy> *That* triggers Deref on the Vec, turning it into a [String], which you then re-borrow
[03:53:06] <doomrobo> gotcha
[03:53:18] <Quxxy> So it goes &Vec<String> -> Vec<String> -> [String] -> &[String]
[03:53:33] <Quxxy> But [..] is really .index(..)
[03:53:51] <Quxxy> And because method calls auto-deref, it cuts all the way down to [String] in one go
[03:53:54] <Quxxy> Which you can then re-borrow
[03:54:10] <Quxxy> *thinks* Wait, that's not quite right
[03:54:20] <Quxxy> It's because Vec::index results in a [String], but anyway

[03:54:54] <Quxxy> Point is: &*s / &**s requires you to more or less know what the deref chain is from memory; &s[..] doesn't

[03:56:01] <starless> niconii, doomrobo, p1start: so, I went ahead and studied your snippets and chose something along the lines of p1start's solution, since I /could/ have just moved line rather than borrowing it, and I've read that &str is stored more efficiently than String.

[07:33:57] <Jonas> I am a little confused about the docs. Sometimes in "derived implementations" you see trait bounds like Clone + Clone + Clone specified on a single type parameter. What's up with this?
[07:34:51] <Mutabah> Jonas: I think it's a combination of how Derived adds bounds (which I think sometimes duplicates), and rustdoc not removing thos duplicates

[11:28:56] <Leo`> http://is.gd/7iJ0Vk this used to work before :(
[11:30:17] <Quxxy> Leo`: True, but this is nicer to the optimiser
[11:30:20] <kimundi> Leo`: functions now have individual types. You need to cast each of those constructors to a function pointer to restore the old behavior
[11:30:43] <Leo`> u_u
[11:30:45] <kimundi> Leo`: http://is.gd/iSWFjM
[11:30:56] <Quxxy> It would be nice if function items had a "drop_name" method or something
[11:30:58] <kimundi> (This uses a type hint to make it coerce correctly)
[11:31:01] <Leo`> allright...
[11:31:21] <Quxxy> Or some other shortcut other than re-typing the whole thing and coercing
[11:31:46] <faern> This might be general parallelization question rather than very Rust specific. But I have a parallel mergesort implementation implemented on a fork-join specific thread pool. The strange thing is that sorting slows down when adding more than 20 worker threads (I have 36 physical cores). It's one thing that it does not scale up much further than 20 threads, but what can make it actually slow down?
[11:32:11] *** Quits: nodweber (nodweber@moz-nimkla.bali.ge) (Quit: Leaving...)
[11:32:25] <kimundi> faern: Maybe OS scheduling overhead? lock contention?
[11:32:27] <Quxxy> Synchronisation overhead?
[11:32:51] <kimundi> maybe at 20, the sync ovhead starts to get bigger than the time a thread needs to complete :P
[11:33:23] *** Joins: areski (areski@moz-qrjahi.user.ono.com)

[11:34:09] <faern> So it drops quite fast after 20.

[13:09:09] <anty> Hi everyone! I imagine this is a quite common question but is it currently advisable to write a rust library to be called from ObjectiveC/Swift on iOS and Java on Android? I ask, because there seems to be a problem with unwinding when calling into rust code, which is not trivially solved, and documentation I found on the matter is not really clear on whether "this is how you can still do it"-sort of advice is
[13:09:09] <anty>  actually a good solution or just an unsafe hack...

[13:45:08] <RalfJ> Which are the rules for overwriting values that have been used to construct other values? When I have a pointer to a struct, I may need it once to obtain the address of some field, but then I could - in principle - overwrite it. I played around with that in <http://is.gd/SdXdam>: why is bar allowed, but foo is not? (IMHO they should both be legal. and this is currently blocking me from writing a nice "append" function for a singly-linked list.)

[13:53:44] <kimundi> RalfJ: SO, this is a bit abstract. The basic semantic of borrowing is, in general, if you have a chain of references like &'a mut &'b mut &'c mut D, then, taking a reference through that restricts you to the smallest lifetime. So you could create a &'a D by doing &mut***r, but not a &'c mut D

[13:56:16] <kimundi> However, shared references have an additional freedom beyond that: Because they are copyable, you can take a &'a &'b C and just copy out the inner reference with *r to get a new &'b C

[23:57:48] <aatch> ToxicFrog, so if you, say, take a `&T` and return a reference to a field in the type, that reference is valid for the same amount of time the passed `&T` is valid for.
[23:57:51] <jethrogb> why doesn't this work? http://is.gd/AFp0VF
[23:57:58] <jethrogb> or: why doesn't the borrow end at line 24?
[23:58:20] <cmr> jethrogb: because `b` is still alive and non-lexical borrows have not been implemented.

[23:59:10] <aatch> cmr, actually SEME wouldn't do anything here.
[23:59:24] <cmr> aatch: you're right
[23:59:30] <cmr> aatch: I just noticed the later usages.
