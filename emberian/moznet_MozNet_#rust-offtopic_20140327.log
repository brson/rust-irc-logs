[11:01:07] <huon> eddyb: doesn't that make you feel at least a bit naked?
[11:01:22] <eddyb> why do I even have 3?
[11:01:33] <eddyb> one of them must be my "travel key"
[11:01:38] <eddyb> which I could very well have lost
[11:01:53] <cmr> I have one for every computer I've used
[11:02:13] <eddyb> huon: I'm not a real privacy nut because then I would be even less efficient if I cared about all the holes I have :(
[11:07:13] <cmr> eddyb: kdiff3 really hates X forwarding
[11:09:43] <eddyb> ouch
[11:10:09] <eddyb> if you find an inline diff just as good that isn't, uhm, some vim plugin, please let me know
[11:10:17] <cmr> vimdiff is great :p
[11:10:20] <cmr> (and built-in)
[11:10:33] <cmr> emacs has really nice diff tools too.
[11:10:52] <eddyb> *sigh*
[11:11:36] <huon> eddyb: we'll eventually corrupt you to a proper editor
[11:11:41] <huon> s/a/the/
[11:11:43] <cmr> hahah
[11:11:45] <huon> (emacs)
[11:12:12] <eddyb> I'd rather die trying to build an IDE
[11:12:16] <cmr> I used emacs for almost two years and it just never felt natural to me.
[11:12:21] <cmr> so, I use vim
[11:12:34] <huon> cmr: you're not natural
[11:12:41] <cmr> which, for all its suck, *feels* right
[11:12:52] <eddyb> huon: I have to agree with you there
[11:12:55] * huon is desperately hoping for a flamewar
[11:13:47] <eddyb> picking one of {vim,emacs} over the other for "natural" is just silly
[11:14:02] <cmr> why?
[11:14:08] <cmr> they're both adept editors.
[11:14:25] <cmr> why wouldn't I pick the tool that feels right?
[11:14:54] <eddyb> because they're both wrong :P
[11:14:58] <eddyb> huon: good enough?
[11:15:01] <cmr> hah
[11:15:36] <huon> eddyb: no you're wrong
[11:15:37] <cmr> if an editor doesn't have marks or a navigation dsl, I don't care about it.
[11:15:50] <huon> cmr: noone cares about you
[11:15:55] <cmr> good!
[11:15:59] <bvssvni> fine
[11:16:01] <eddyb> marks?
[11:16:02] * huon adopts the ad-hominem role
[11:16:15] <huon> eddyb: you get no marks, 0/10
[11:16:27] <eddyb> huon: pls no nightmares
[11:16:33] <cmr> eddyb: let you save the cursor position for later use in expressions, essentially.
[11:16:42] <huon> eddyb: ur a nightmare
[11:16:46] <eddyb> cmr: interesting, I've never heard of that before
[11:17:01] <cmr> there's one of the features every vim emulation lacks, and is thus useless to me
[11:17:18] <eddyb> wait, hang on, there's a kate feature
[11:18:08] <cmr> additionally gui tools are generally out of the picture because they use lots of screen space and I can't nicely use them over ssh, though I'd reevaluate that position.
[11:18:17] <cmr> I played with textadept for a month or so
[11:18:19] <eddyb> "animate bracket matching" wtf?
[11:18:31] <huon> Greenspun's eleventh rule: every sufficiently complicated editor contains an ad hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow implementation of half of Emacs/Vim
[11:18:41] <eddyb> "show scrollbar marks" that's new
[11:19:08] <eddyb> hah, line bookmarks show up in the scrollbar
[11:19:25] <eddyb> not that I ever use bookmarks
[11:20:29] <eddyb> cmr: mkay, I've enabled persistent selection, but it probably doesn't do as much as marks do
[11:20:31] <cmr> honestly I'm just going to end up writing my own text editor before I give up vim or vi clones.
[11:21:06] <cmr> though qtcreator is quite nice I've found
[11:21:14] <cmr> visual studio's text editor is also adequate once learned.
[11:21:40] <bvssvni> SharpDevelop is nice, but for C# mostly
[11:22:27] <huon> visual studio is best-in-class as an IDE, right?
[11:22:35] <cmr> I think so, yes.
[11:22:46] <cmr> others seem to disagree but I can't fathom why.
[11:23:08] <bvssvni> huon: John Carmack thinks it is the best
[11:23:09] <cmr> the jetbeans IDEs are also fantastic, especially their plugin architecture
[11:23:09] * huon has never used it... or even ever done any significant development on windows
[11:23:24] <huon> bvssvni: that's a recommendation-and-a-half
[11:23:27] <cmr> which is an area visual studio sorely lacks, from my experience.
[11:23:42] * cmr almost worships carmack as an idol
[11:23:51] <bvssvni> visual studio is expensive though
[11:24:04] <cmr> it is. I've been able to have it through my uni's dreamspark
[11:24:12] <cmr> but it's like... a few grand
[11:25:34] <bvssvni> SharpDevelop and MonoDevelop is free and does almost everything Visual Studio does
[11:25:37] <eddyb> it could be worse
[11:25:40] <eddyb> cmr: it could be IDA
[11:25:59] <cmr> my experiences with monodevelop have been very positive, though limited
[11:26:51] <cmr> but really I'm perfectly happy with a shell and my linux tools :)
[11:27:03] <bvssvni> yeah vim rocks!
[11:27:25] * eddyb takes paper
[11:27:31] <bvssvni> haha
[11:27:37] <huon> cmr is a turtle
[11:28:01] <cmr> GO 15
[11:28:05] <eddyb> I would've said "penguin with a shell" but that's not quite... natural
[11:29:00] * huon imagines an attack on antartica
[11:29:13] <huon> and the penguin artillery squadrons
[11:29:29] <huon> preferably with more than a single shell, though
[11:30:14] <eddyb> I am not going to open World of Tanks
[11:30:46] <huon> and instead open emacs and let yourself into a world of wonder
[11:30:46] <cmr> keep telling yourself that.
[11:32:09] <eddyb> haha I see what that animation thing does
[11:32:33] <eddyb> it's actually quite useful, when you can't tell exactly what's going on
[11:33:32] <eddyb> when you switch to one end of a bracket range (e.g. {......}x<caret> and press left), the other end becomes ~1.5 bigger for a second (can't remember what this transition is called)
[11:34:06] <cmr> "temporary embiggen"
[11:34:32] <eddyb> I knew it was a weird word :P
[11:34:41] <cmr> not actually what it's called
[11:34:46] <cmr> but it's certainly descriptive of it

[13:18:29] <eddyb> cmr: different channel :P. I doubt duktape has any JIT, so that has to be true
[13:18:39] <cmr> yeah, a more appropriate channel :p
[13:18:58] <eddyb> cmr: that API is kinda tiny compared to v8
[13:19:02] <cmr> I believe luajit is still the highest performing dynamic scripting lang impl
[13:19:16] <eddyb> or v8.h just has all the C++ bloat that makes it huge
[13:19:20] <eddyb> *makes it look huge
[13:19:37] <cmr> it doesn't even have proxies or fun stuff :(
[13:19:58] <eddyb> are proxies ES6?
