[00:21:39] <deokjinkim> About "line-height", it doesn't work now because of disabling of inheritance. It's easy work.

[02:03:01] <aydinkim> jack: Last time I discussed with pcwalton about methodology. List is similar to block as you know, we just added some additional processing routine to block and flow.
[02:04:12] <aydinkim> jack: And we want to know that we need to guarantee the last version of html.(backward compatiobility)
[02:06:08] <aydinkim> jack: if the type attr in list tag and "list-style-type" css property is overlapped, how we can handle it?
[02:07:18] <aydinkim> jack: It is regulated to use only CSS property in document of html spec actually, but often usual web pages are violated.
[02:09:01] <aydinkim> For implementing overapped value processing, we need to fix css cacading routine or need to know whether the values are set from UA rule or not.

[03:58:30] <june0cho> Hello, you are our mentor! 
[03:58:40] <sonwow> :-)
[03:58:58] <june0cho> okay! we are now considering the fixed layout first in table.
[03:59:24] <june0cho> first, we defined new flows for table, table row, table cell 
[04:00:12] *** Joins: Jesse (jruderman@moz-9754CB0.hsd1.ca.comcast.net)
[04:00:13] <june0cho> and we are modifying bubble width and assign width for each flow, then calculating the widths
[04:01:38] <jack> Are the table flows and table cell flows much differnet from block flows internally?
[04:01:52] <june0cho> hmm the current situation is that we can print out simple table now without considering borders/padding/margin, but it has some error yet. 
[04:02:29] <sonwow> Currently we are implemented table-related flows based on the block flow.
[04:02:41] <june0cho> almost similar, but table flow need column- related calculation
[04:03:04] <jack> it looks like <table><tr><td><img></td></tr></table> is the complexity of the acid2 test case.
[04:03:26] <jack> what kind of test cases are you using currently?
[04:04:09] <jack> ah, there is also display: table in acid2 for the <ul>
[04:04:14] <june0cho> and acid2 test case has list element with display:table as well :(
[04:04:16] <jdm> jack: did bidi make it into your planning chart?
[04:04:17] <june0cho> yesyes
[04:04:28] <jack> jdm: it is in Q2 i think.

[04:06:16] <jack> june0cho, sonwow: Have any problems so far?
[04:06:31] <june0cho> yes, i think so. strange. but until now we didn't consider about it yet.
[04:07:23] <june0cho> until now,we are testing only with the basic table example which has only <table> <col> <tr> <td> 
[04:07:31] <sonwow> Currently we are focusing on the basic implementation for fixed layout. 
[04:07:34] <sonwow> yep
[04:08:40] <jack> Did you need to change the traversals at all yet?
[04:10:12] <june0cho> hmm not yet, but I'm not sure about the auto layout calculation.
[04:10:34] <sonwow> Not now, but I heard that ryan want to change, and he will try that.
[04:12:18] <jack> If you look at modifying traversals, but sure to look at pcwalton's parallel layout PR and make sure it will still work.
[04:12:41] <jack> it sounds like what you are doing right now is fine.
[04:12:56] <jack> When do you think we will see the first PR for tables?
[04:13:07] <sonwow> maybe next week?
[04:14:25] <jack> Awesome
[04:15:05] <aydinkim> june0cho: Traversal sequence would be changed? It means current postorder flow generation can be changed??
[04:15:13] <jack> You should post a screen shot of a table once you have it showing up :)
[04:15:34] <sonwow> jack: Sure, we will let you know our status on next week.
[04:15:50] <sonwow> andinkim: No, not now.
[04:17:18] <jack> aydinkim: reading your questions from earlier.
[04:17:24] <jack> what did you mean by "last version of HTML"?
[04:17:56] <sonwow> andinkim: ryan said that he want to change the traversal. But I'm not sure.
[04:18:04] <jack> deokjinkim: Did you see my comments on white-space PR?
[04:18:34] <aydinkim> jack: It means older version of HTML like <ul type="disc">. 
[04:19:01] <jack> seems like the HTML5 spec would have a note about that. /me checks
[04:19:02] <aydinkim> It is deprecated for now. 
[04:19:37] <aydinkim> jack: because CSS property & html attribute is duplicated.
[04:20:30] <aydinkim> jack: Standard spec. of HTML4 recommand to do not use list type attribute.
[04:20:53] <jack> the HTML5 spec says type=disc is a presentational hint
[04:21:03] <jack> that implies list-style-type: disc
[04:21:37] <jack> so i assume you do that if no list-style-type is given. if one is given, you ignore type attribute.
[04:21:54] <jack> it should be easy to check what webkit and firefox do in those two cases.
[04:22:31] <aydinkim> jack: yes. but we cannot make sure that list-stype-type is given or not yet.
[04:22:45] <jack> aydinkim: is this needed for acid2? i don't see anything but list-style: none
[04:23:48] <jack> aydinkim: i assume there will be some function .list_style(). That function can check style attribute if list-style is inherited.
[04:24:04] <aydinkim> jack: We have default value of ul as 'disc' on basic UA style sheet.
[04:24:14] <jack> Ah
[04:24:20] <jack> so we have to draw the bullets
[04:25:07] <jack> but the only <ul> in acid2 is display: table
[04:25:33] <jack> ah, second rule    ul li { padding: 0; margin: 0; }
[04:25:42] <jack> so that will have list style :)
[04:26:07] <jack> These tests are funny. All this work to draw one small circle :)
[04:26:20] <aydinkim> jack: yes. style::display has no problem for now.

[17:46:53] <jgraham> abinader: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/history.html#read-html defines where contentType is set for navigation. Note that it doesn't actually specify what happens for XML documents because XML in general is underdefined
[17:49:09] <abinader> jgraham: ic, here says "unless stated otherwise", it would be "application/xml" http://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-document-content-type

[17:52:12] <jgraham> abinader: Not quite :)
[17:52:57] <jgraham> I just pointed out to Hixie that the fact that this is all underdefined might lead you to believe exactly that
[17:53:04] <jgraham> s/you/one/
[17:53:18] <abinader> hmm... yeah, this might sound confusing indeed
[17:53:43] <jgraham> But actually the intent is that "other relevant specifications" will create the Document object and set the right contentType
[17:54:22] <jgraham> The problem is that the "other relevant specifications" have never been written due to the low overlap of people that care about XML and people who care about DOM
[17:55:14] <jgraham> So basically for something we treat (in some future time) as XMLish contentType should be set to the contentType coming off the wire
