[01:35:03] <tikue> what is supposed to happen when window.close() is called?
[01:35:26] <tikue> that's the js line not being executed properly. compositor is not receiving an exit message even though window.close() is called
[01:39:14] <jack> i suppose if it's the only window left, the compositor should shut down.
[01:39:29] <jack> since we only have one window ever, seems like it would also shut own the compositor.

[01:41:17] <tikue> the problem is that the script is treating the window's message like any other exit message

[02:20:14] <jack> you mean in response to window.close?
[02:20:24] <tikue> jack: no in response to evicted frames
[02:20:36] <jack> frames are evicted by navigating right?
[02:20:43] <tikue> if you're on page B and your history looks like A -> B -> C and then you load a new page, C is evicted
[02:20:57] <tikue> and so the constellation iterates over the frames in C and exits any pipelines that don't exist elsewhere in the navigation context
[02:21:03] <jack> Yes. So why does script close the frames?
[02:21:04] <tikue> but that process of exiting is very redundant
[02:21:13] <jack> why not let the constellation do it?
[02:21:21] <jack> Or only the constellation i mean
[02:21:27] <tikue> jack: the script task doesn't exit necessarily
[02:21:33] <tikue> jack: it only exits when its root frame exits
[02:22:10] <tikue> since pipelines : scripts is many : one
[02:22:13] <tikue> potentially
[02:22:13] <jack> But what I'm saying is why have hte script be involved in the exiting? Let it delegate to its constellation
[02:22:41] <jack> If the issue is that owrk happens in two places, get rid of one of the places :)
[02:22:43] <tikue> jack: because if the script removes a frame, it has no reference to subframes of that frame anymore
[02:23:14] <tikue> and it would receive an exit message for a pipeline it has no association with and it'd fail!() presumably
[02:23:28] <jack> Why does script get the exit message?
[02:23:42] <tikue> jack: because it needs to exit if the exit message is from its root frame's pipeline
[02:24:13] <jack> It seems like this is two different exits. Ther eis ScriptExit and some PipelineExit
[02:24:29] <jack> why is script getting hte latter?
[02:24:43] <tikue> i can think of two reasons --
[02:24:54] <tikue> one is that script handles shutting down the layout right now -- which it doesn't necessarily need to do
[02:25:21] <tikue> the other is that the constellation doesn't have any intrinsic knowledge of the script's root frame.
[02:26:31] <tikue> actually that might not be true.
[02:26:54] <tikue> the frame trees have parent: Option<@mut Pipeline>, and if the option is None that means it's the root frame, and it could exit the script task
[02:27:22] <jack> Doesn't help for hte layout stuff though.
[02:27:26] <tikue> jack: but if the script isn't told about individual pipelines exiting, it'll be holding handles to invalid pipelines

[02:42:57] <jack> Sure.
[02:43:05] <jack> Won't that get an exit message from a higher level script?
[02:43:07] <tikue> (internet talk is hard, i think we're talking past each other)
[02:43:19] <tikue> jack: no, because scripts don't store all subframes
[02:43:36] <tikue> only those associated with a pipeline for which they are the script task
[02:43:46] <jack> ok. So scripts can't see past scripts?
[02:43:58] <jack> or can't see other scripts
[02:44:05] <tikue> yeah they don't see anything other than their own stuff
[02:44:36] <jack> So maybe the constellation just needs an iterator that hits only the unique scripts?
[02:44:45] <tikue> ooo
[02:44:46] <jack> or juts filter out for unique scripts on the iterator?
[02:44:47] <tikue> filter!
[02:44:50] <tikue> great idea
[02:44:53] <tikue> wait..
[02:45:06] <tikue> but what if a subframe of a script task needs to be exited but not the root frame?
[02:45:22] <tikue> you'd need to go deeper
[02:45:56] <jack> How do you know that?
[02:46:06] <jack> when would you evict a non-root frame?
[02:46:32] <jack> oh, if it's a iframe navigation?
[02:46:39] <tikue> yeah
[02:46:55] * tikue is thinking...
[02:47:06] <jack> So always send to the top one, and then iterator over unique scripts below.
[02:47:10] <tikue> when you navigate you always get a new script
[02:47:23] <tikue> so maybe it's a safe assumption that you can always filter out deeper scripts
[02:48:01] <tikue> i can't think it through right now. i'm not sure it's generally true but i can't think of a pathological case in which it wouldn't be
[02:48:20] <jack> so A -> B where B is same-origin and you navigate to C which is also SO. so you evict B and anything below
[02:48:29] <tikue> jack: you can't do that
[02:48:32] <tikue> C won't be SO
[02:48:33] <jack> so exit B no matter what, then filter over B's sub-scripts
[02:48:38] <tikue> navigation is always XO i think
[02:48:49] <tikue> and you wouldn't evict B because it'd still be in the navigation context
[02:48:51] <jack> i can move from foo.html to bar.html on example.com
[02:49:03] <jack> and back to foo and then to baz.html
[02:49:07] <jack> so bar will get evicted.
[02:49:15] <jack> and this is all SO
[02:50:03] <jack> so you'd exit pipeline B even though it's script task is for A
[02:50:10] <tikue> jack: that's not how SO is handled right now
[02:50:12] <jack> and then iterate over any script task that is under B
[02:50:37] <tikue> are you sure that's correct? i was under the impression that if you perform any kind of manual navigation you get a new pipeline with a new script 
[02:51:00] <tikue> so if your page is A -> B and you navigate B ==> C, C can't touch A
[02:51:13] <jack> A can touch C thought right?
[02:51:37] <tikue> as things are now, A will not know about C, only B
[02:51:48] <tikue> in fact
[02:52:01] <tikue> if A is doing something with B and you navigate B ==> C there's nothing stopping A from continuing to do stuff with B
[02:52:06] <tikue> there should be an issue about that
[02:52:08] <jack> that's bad :)
[02:52:24] <jack> well, i don't think it's fatal to duplicate the exits assuming you can make them idempotent.
[02:53:10] <tikue> i guess when navigation is performed, scripts should be prevented from running on the frames that are no longer active

[20:40:22] <bjz> oh
[20:40:23] <jack> bjz: for AU to US that was a great ping time.
[20:40:39] <bjz> wait, I thought you were jeaye
[20:40:44] <jack> is glfw-rs already updated to &mut self to Drop?
[20:40:49] <bjz> yarp
[20:40:56] <bjz> :)
[20:41:42] <bjz> I think pcwalton still had to add some conditionally compiled stuff
[20:42:10] <jack> did consts.rs go away?
[20:42:30] <bjz> yep, now using c-style enums
[20:42:41] <bjz> is that ok?
[20:43:05] <jack> it's fine. just forward porting servo
[20:43:14] <bjz> cool

[20:47:12] * jack bangs head on table
[20:47:20] <jack> i compiled hte wrong version of rust. forgot tjc's stuff is on a branch.
[20:47:39] <tjc> jack: :-( fortunately you'll only have to recompile rustpkg
[20:48:29] <kmc> should I attend "Unprefixing frenzy", "CSS Regions", or "2D canvas"
[20:49:29] <jack> between the latter two for me.
[20:49:37] <jack> probably would head to 2d canvas because i have no idea hwat css regions are.
[20:49:43] <jack> but maybe that's an argument for css regions ;)
[20:49:50] <jack> kmc: how is the conf so far?
[20:49:59] <jdm> https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=919609
[20:50:00] <jack> tjc: is there a make target for that?
[20:50:02] <jdm> this is so encouraging
[20:50:16] <jack> jdm: i've been following it. and yes, i am similiarly sad.
[20:50:24] <tjc> jack: I usually do make check-stage1-rustpkg, and that won't rebuild the libs or rustc
[20:50:30] <jack> my first thought after the last comment was "So we're writing a VM in Rust then?"
[20:50:35] <tjc> I think make rustpkg-stage1 or stage1-rustpkg also works (without running the tests)
[20:50:38] <kmc> jack: *shrug* nothing particularly revelatory so far
[20:51:01] <jack> kmc: make sure you meet some of those guys, and say hi to eric seidel for me.
[20:51:07] <kmc> ok
[20:52:57] <jack> jdm: we should set up a meeting with him or something. this conversation is beyond a bug report.
[20:55:02] <jdm> agreed
[20:55:11] <jack> is he the right person?

[22:19:30] <pcwalton> ok, making RenderBox an @Trait (with no base optimization) makes reflow about 15% faster
[22:19:34] <pcwalton> virtual methods ftw
[22:19:39] <pcwalton> 63% slower than Gecko now
[22:20:42] <jack> wow
[22:20:45] <lbergstrom> nice work!
[22:20:48] <jack> so it was _really_ slow then :)
[22:21:00] <pcwalton> OO is sometimes nice!
[22:21:08] <pcwalton> I need to optimize base access now with unsafe code
[22:21:11] <pcwalton> just a little bit
[22:21:12] <jack> i just epxected the stuff we did was done to be faster than @Trait
[22:21:17] <pcwalton> we'll add the Rust stuff later
[22:21:21] <pcwalton> to make it safe
