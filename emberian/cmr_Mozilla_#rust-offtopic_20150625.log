[02:32:36] <ChrisMorgan> Function and variable hoisting is certainly one of the many things that can lead to confusion in JavaScript.
[02:34:56] <ChrisMorgan> One of my favourites is how String.prototype has both .substr(start, len) and .substring(start, end), and Array.prototype has both .split(start, len) and .slice(start, end).

[02:35:57] <ChrisMorgan> (OK, splice removes that chunk and puts something else in its place, but it’s the len/end inconsistency that I’m complaining about.)
[02:35:58] <whipsch> wow, i'm going to grep for substr tomorrow in the code at work and see if there are any erroneous usages now
[02:36:09] <whipsch> i knew they both existed, but didnt think to check the difference

[05:01:02] <eddyb> DOS is actually kinda interesting (and supporting x86_16 is a challenge, even if it's a nasty one)
[05:01:45] <Mutabah> eddyb: YEah... wonder if we could get at least the compiler outputting 16-bit code
[05:01:55] <eddyb> I think LLVM has some support for it
[05:02:07] <eddyb> I don't even know the triple for it :P
[05:02:15] <eddyb> or anything of the sort
[05:02:23] <Mutabah> Might require telling LLVM to go for -Os, and dunno if it could support segmented addresses
[05:02:33] <eddyb> does LLVM even have a concept of -Os?
[05:02:35] <Mutabah> (that's the largest problem with 16-bit code)
[05:02:39] <Mutabah> I don't know
[05:02:40] <eddyb> because we're not exposing one
[05:03:08] <eddyb> Mutabah: it supports *something* related to segments
[05:03:18] <Mutabah> Address spaces, right?
[05:03:24] <c74d> hm, “relevant” how? I think it's plenty relevant in that many people use it and will continue using it, though I'm in favor of the sentiment that supporting it is irresponsible.
[05:03:25] <eddyb> maybe addrspace can be used to select the segment, but I don't know more
[05:03:43] <eddyb> c74d: and win98 was in use when XP was released
[05:04:39] <eddyb> and almost everything new that was released stopped working on win98
[05:05:15] <zwarich> eddyb: LLVM's -Os is more like a -O2 w/ "please don't use too much space"
[05:05:23] <zwarich> -Oz is actually "make this small"
[05:05:28] <eddyb> maintenance until some large sluggish corp or govt switches over?
[05:05:34] <eddyb> suuure
[05:05:41] <eddyb> new code? hell no
[05:06:06] <Mutabah> eddyb: Problem with real mode is far pointers
[05:06:07] <eddyb> non-personal use of XP almost certainly depends on old apps
[05:06:20] <eddyb> Mutabah: I *think* that works in clang
[05:06:22] <eddyb> not sure though
[05:06:32] <eddyb> personal use? just upgrade, win10 is free or something
[05:07:42] <zwarich> in theory LLVM supports segmented memory, via distinct address spaces
[05:07:55] <Mutabah> Maybe put XP support in, but have it as a separate build? And then later down the line, see how many people end up using it
[05:10:40] <eddyb> zwarich: where the heck did I see all the details about x86_16 on llvm.org?
[05:10:44] <eddyb> that site is a maze
[05:12:17] <zwarich> eddyb: http://llvm.org/docs/CodeGenerator.html#the-x86-backend ?
[05:12:56] <WindowsBunny> Mutabah: I feel like writing a macro that will conditionally replace a function with a stub that attempts to dynamically load the function, otherwise it falls back to a fallback method, but only if a certain cfg is set, otherwise it just links directly
[05:13:02] <eddyb> zwarich: it was talking about in-development targets
[05:13:20] <WindowsBunny> Mutabah: Can I use #[cfg]'s inside a macro?
[05:13:27] <eddyb> WindowsBunny: yupp
[05:13:30] <WindowsBunny> sweet
[05:13:31] <eddyb> WindowsBunny: though be careful
[05:13:34] <Mutabah> WindowsBunny: Yes, but only on items
[05:13:42] <Mutabah> WindowsBunny: Where item = fn/type/static/...
[05:13:52] <eddyb> WindowsBunny: if you #[cfg] the macro definition, the switch happens when you compile the library
[05:13:53] <WindowsBunny> sure, that's reasonable
[05:14:07] <eddyb> WindowsBunny: if you have it inside the macro, it's checked at every expansion site
[05:14:21] <WindowsBunny> eddyb: I'm okay with it being checked at expansion site
[05:15:24] <WindowsBunny> eddyb: How can I pass arbitrary cfg's through rust's make system?

[05:16:26] <c74d> “<eddyb> personal use? just upgrade, win10 is free or something” — what are the hardware requirements of Microsoft Windows 10 vs. XP, though?
[05:16:45] <eddyb> I'd be impressed if something that old is still running
[05:16:46] <WindowsBunny> eddyb: sweet
[05:17:02] <eddyb> (old enough to support XP but not win10)

[05:20:06] <c74d> huh. I'm… impressed, really, that Windows 10 is okay with 1 GB RAM.
[05:20:19] <eddyb> zwarich: I mean the part where they remove pointer types and keep only an opaque one
[05:20:29] <zwarich> c74d: 2 GB for 64-bit :P
[05:20:41] <eddyb> you ain't gonna use 64-bit on an XP box
[05:20:59] <eddyb> anyways
[05:21:34] <eddyb> > To access the Windows Store and to download and run apps, you need an Internet connection, a screen resolution of at least 1024 x 768, and a Microsoft account.

[05:26:46] <niconii> c74d: far less, even, if you know where to look; you can get lots of old computer hardware if you go to auctions and things, because as places upgrade all their old hardware they tend to sell the old stuff off

[06:49:27] <WindowsBunny> and casting between types just isn't the same
[06:49:38] <bstrie> WindowsBunny: ok, ok. idea. we'll just reserve the entire address space as storage for this type, so that we don't have to worry about the length
[06:49:47] <bstrie> the length will be implicit

[06:51:15] <bstrie> WindowsBunny: I don't see what the problem with casting is, make the struct repr(C) and rust won't move the unsized bit relative to the pointer
[06:51:19] <WindowsBunny> I have a dislike for Rust's inability for me to effectively express some C idioms in an FFI-safe yet rusty manner

[07:31:35] <WindowsBunny> c74d: I intend to work on Rust for XP soon

[07:40:22] * WindowsBunny nibbles on c74d's pinky toe
[07:42:55] <c74d> WindowsBunny: I hereby formally take issue with (per the CoC), and request that you cease, your practice of sending CTCP ACTIONs that would, were they instead actions performed in the offline world, be considered (1) attacks upon me, (2) actions causing me injury or distress, (3) invasions of my personal space (under typical US standards of personal space), or (4) attempts at performing
[07:42:56] <c74d> any action such as those described in (1) through (3) above. Such actions include, but are not limited to, the following: biting me, nibbling on me, flatulating on or at me, and eating me.
[07:43:26] <eddyb> c74d: about that paste
[07:44:01] <eddyb> c74d: I think the libs can get away with not using concurrency primitives
[07:44:11] <eddyb> unless the "runtime" does

[07:45:28] <eddyb> if those features are not used... shouldn't cause issues, no?
[07:45:32] <eddyb> WindowsBunny: what do you know about this?
[07:46:14] <WindowsBunny> eddyb: I'll work on building up a list of all the functions std links and which OS they need
[07:46:40] <eddyb> but even before workarounds are in place, it could still work on windows via... LTO maybe?
[07:47:05] <eddyb> all you need is for the imports to be missing AFAIK
[07:47:34] <WindowsBunny> eddyb: working on list while I eat an eddyb sandwich

[08:36:56] <bluss> Quxxy: are you DK. on SO?
[08:37:05] <Quxxy> Noooo!
[08:37:47] <bluss> ok, some insane person is promoting .collect::<Vec<()>> and I have a feud now
[08:37:58] <bluss> ;-)
[08:38:19] <Mutabah> bluss: wait, what?
[08:38:35] <Quxxy> Sounds like the sort of person who wanted a .consume or something, but there isn't one, so he just gave up and started using .collect<Vec<()>> when needed
[08:38:59] <bluss> I've chosen .count() as my consumer. You should too
[08:39:06] <Quxxy> Also sounds like the sort of... shit, dinner; gotta go
[08:39:21] <bluss> hehe
[08:39:27] <Quxxy> But anyway; sort of person who *loathes* writing a nice, linear left-to-right chain, then having to go back to the start because "syntax"
[08:40:05] <Mutabah> wait... how would collecting into Vec<()> work for most things?
[08:40:12] <Mutabah> or is it a () iterator
[08:40:46] <bluss> Mutabah: yeah it's an iterator chain ran for its “side effects“ and the closure produces ()
[08:40:54] <eddyb> lol
[08:41:06] <eddyb> the funny thing is that there's no big difference between that and .count()
[08:41:16] <eddyb> should be roughly the same codegen
[08:41:48] <bluss> hm do you think the Vec<()> optimizes out just as well?
[08:41:54] <eddyb> it doesn't allocate
[08:41:59] <bluss> The actual counting in count should disappea
[08:42:01] <eddyb> all it does is increment the length
[08:42:05] <bluss> yeah
[08:42:17] <eddyb> bluss: my suggestion: use a fucking for loop
[08:42:36] <bluss> .count() is the chosen iterator consumer
[08:42:38] <eddyb> you have side-effects, don't run away from imperative
[08:43:16] <eddyb> you have less side-effects than value flow, feel free to use functional (but it doesn't always fit nicely)
[08:43:54] <Mutabah> I remember someone complaining about the lack of .each()
[08:44:09] <bluss> yeah there has been multiple issues reported for foreach
[08:44:13] <Mutabah> Might have been on an RFC for it actually, a largish dicussion that boiled down to "We have it, it's a for loop"
[08:44:15] <bluss> and a rejected RFC or two
[08:44:25] <eddyb> good >:(
[08:44:39] <bluss> it's apparently very popular
[08:44:47] <eddyb> I recently removed a walk_ty function somewhere in the compiler
[08:44:49] <Mutabah> I remember a comment "We do know it's important, it's so important we made it a language feature"
[08:44:58] <eddyb> which called a closure for each element in an iterator
[08:45:07] <eddyb> I just used the iterator directly at each call site
[08:45:07] <Mutabah> eddyb: Oof
[08:45:13] <eddyb> guess what? it was simpler
[08:45:25] <eddyb> Mutabah: the closure-taking function predates the iterator it is using
[08:45:36] <Mutabah> eddyb: Acceptable then
[08:46:13] <bluss> Mutabah: there are good arguments. Like having to needlessly stick the iterator in a variable binding
[08:46:32] <Mutabah> bluss: needless?
[08:46:41] <Mutabah> (over using a for loop)
[08:47:11] <bluss> where .foreach() could avoid the temporary variable
[08:47:49] <eddyb> what?
[08:47:57] <eddyb> why would you need a variable?
[08:47:59] <eddyb> for what?
[08:48:31] <eddyb> if it's about line length, you already have a problem .foreach won't solve :P
[08:48:41] <benh> xs.foreach(f) <-> for x in xs { f(x); }
[08:49:05] <Mutabah> bluss: That's just if you're calling a function, as opposed to doing a closure

[18:03:19] <Astrum|Lap> future generations are going to hate us so much =/
[18:03:46] <dfockler> haha
[18:04:12] <dfockler> every generation comes up with the same shit over and over, just a little bit better
[18:04:33] <Astrum|Lap> well I only exist in this generation, so I can't speak for the others
[18:05:14] <Sho> dfockler: I'm feeling that right now porting things to Wayland
[18:05:19] <Astrum|Lap> but even I can see that atom is a pretty silly idea
[18:05:40] <Sho> I know why we do it and I want the end result too, but damn if it doesn't feel sickening sometimes to reimplement the same things over and over and over again
[18:06:24] <Astrum|Lap> Sho: I can totally reinvent the wheel
[18:06:32] <Astrum|Lap> give me $50m and 2 years
[18:06:38] <dfockler> it's because genuine innovation only comes along once in a while, everything else is incremental
[18:06:45] <Astrum|Lap> it'll be the best wheel ever!
[18:06:48] <Sho> As for Atom it's a little annoying to see their blog posts lately, like that doped up post on implementing smart rangers

[18:06:51] <Tobba> Sho: X11 is pretty godawful though
[18:06:52] <Astrum|Lap> just spitballing here, I'm thinking lasers!
[18:06:59] <Tobba> so in that case it's more "same thing without the junk"

[18:07:49] <Astrum|Lap> now on your desktop
[18:07:58] <Astrum|Lap> and your servers
[18:08:10] <Sho> Tobba: Except we can't stop supporting X11 anytime soon, so we're in many cases reimplementing/rearchitecturing things to be able to support both simultaneously
[18:08:18] <Sho> Tobba: Which then hilariously means reimplementing the X11 bits as well
[18:08:28] <Tobba> fun!
[18:09:17] <dfockler> I understand why backwards compatibility exists
[18:09:51] <dfockler> but at some point you gotta say, we're moving on
[18:09:59] <Astrum|Lap> I suppose if I want my editor to succeed it's gotta depend on no less than 5GB of code from google
[18:10:02] <Sho> Tobba: e.g. the entire windowing system + rendering stack abstraction got rewritten inside Qt, with mostly plain-better results, but in the course of that the X backend was basically written from scratch against xcb with many exciting regressions and edge case bugs
[18:10:11] <Astrum|Lap> also.... gotta sell it
[18:10:27] <Tobba> Sho: <Tobba> fun!
[18:10:28] <Astrum|Lap> being technically competent is overrated
[18:10:31] <Astrum|Lap> just has to look cool
[18:11:09] <Tobba> Sho: this is funnier in the context that I'm working on reinventing the entire OS
[18:11:14] <Tobba> but it's not like that'll get any adoption anyways
[18:11:24] <Astrum|Lap> Tobba: not with that attitude

[18:12:38] <Sho> And currently I'm rewriting the stuff that powers KDE Plasma's "task bar" (and other window-switching and dock-like UI elements) - it's a terrible old creaky lib called libtaskmanager, which in turn is mostly tied to a library called KWindowSystem that was designed to be winsys-agnostic but in reality needs reworking because Wayland threw out a lot of stuff no one anticipated when designing KWS
[18:13:17] <Tobba> Astrum|Lap: github.com/charliesome/jsos
[18:13:58] <Sho> The end result will be much more cleanly layered and eliminate a bunch of UI latencies as well, but it's still a lot of work to basically just get back the same functionality that already exists
[18:14:10] <Sho> That endless porting churn
[18:14:13] <Astrum|Lap> Tobba: heh, I assumed someone had already done it =P
[18:14:29] <Tobba> Astrum|Lap: interestingly, that guy works for github now
[18:14:46] <Astrum|Lap> Sho: at least you get paid for it I suppose
[18:14:51] <Astrum|Lap> I get paid to make silly thing
[18:15:02] <Astrum|Lap> Tobba: he probably works on atom =P

[18:16:02] <fkaa> js too slow? more js!
[18:16:38] <Astrum|Lap> no, no
[18:16:44] <Astrum|Lap> you move it into kernel space if it's too slow
[18:16:53] <Astrum|Lap> bah, I'm going to have to look up that talk again
[18:17:35] <Sho> Astrum|Lap: Yeah I get paid for it currently
[18:17:41] <Sho> Astrum|Lap: I did it for like seven-eight years for free tho
[18:17:57] <Astrum|Lap> more than I'm willing to put into something =/
[18:18:00] <Tobba> heh, today I found a reliable way to break radeon
[18:18:17] <Tobba> for some reason, a very specific dropdown box in inscape will instantly crash the graphics driver
[18:18:20] <Sho> Astrum|Lap: I think I got my first KDE patch in like in May '05
[18:18:39] <Astrum|Lap> Sho: I never really got into contributing to large projects like that
[18:18:48] <Tobba> (I'm actually not sure if it's the graphics driver, but everything goes black, goes back to normal and then you can't interact with anything)
[18:18:54] <Astrum|Lap> the code bases were massive and takes a fair amount of time to get up to speed with

[19:57:11] <GBGamer117> it's just weird
[19:57:25] <Astrum|Lap> "... did you mean to use 'as!' to force downcast?"
[19:57:31] <Astrum|Lap> as opposed to 'as' which just asks politely?
[19:57:58] <GBGamer117> Astrum|Lap: I assume that makes sense, but I don't understand it
[19:58:21] <WindowsBunny> Astrum|Lap: So is it like dynamic_cast vs static_cast in C++?
[19:58:36] <WindowsBunny> where dynamic_cast might fail but static_cast will go ahead and downcast anyway, even if the result is invalid?
[19:58:46] <Astrum|Lap> WindowsBunny: I assume
[19:58:53] <WindowsBunny> yay!
[19:58:55] <Astrum|Lap> I was mostly just poking fun at the way they phrased it
[19:59:04] <GBGamer117> WindowsBunny: that seems a bit dangerous...
[19:59:07] * WindowsBunny downcasts Astrum|Lap
[19:59:09] <GBGamer117> So how does it work?
[19:59:24] <WindowsBunny> GBGamer117: presumably undefined behavior if the downcast is invalid :D
[19:59:42] <Astrum|Lap> UB, the best behavior you didn't ask for

[20:00:10] <GBGamer117> bless you!
[20:00:34] *** Joins: pcwalton (pcwalton@moz-ilu.bfn.243.173.IP)
[20:00:43] <GBGamer117> so a downcast is like, going from a class * -> implementing class * right?
[20:01:44] <GBGamer117> or in Rust, an &Trait -> &Type?
[20:01:50] <WindowsBunny> where Foo: Bar, a downcast is Bar -> Foo while upcast is Foo -> Bar
[20:02:06] <WindowsBunny> Trait -> Type is downcast, Type -> Trait is upcast
[20:02:58] <GBGamer117> so a static_cast would be something like a (Type *)(t) where t is a Trait *
[20:03:16] <GBGamer117> or a cast of the data pointer?
[20:03:48] <GBGamer117> while a dynamic_cast checks the type of the pointer, and then only works if t is actually a Type *
[20:04:33] <WindowsBunny> GBGamer117: static_cast does not just cast the pointer
[20:05:01] <WindowsBunny> remember that in a derived class, the base class might not be at position 0
[20:05:11] <WindowsBunny> so static_cast will also offset the pointer as needed
[20:05:16] <GBGamer117> ah, okay
[20:05:22] <WindowsBunny> reinterpret_cast will not do that
[20:05:28] <WindowsBunny> and I don't know what C style casts do
[20:05:33] <WindowsBunny> so I just avoid them at all costs
[20:05:41] <GBGamer117> well, C style casts do what you expect
[20:05:50] <WindowsBunny> they break everything?
[20:05:53] <GBGamer117> they turn a pointer of one kind into another kind
[20:06:07] <GBGamer117> so yes, if you're doing OOP, they could probably break everything
[20:06:08] <WindowsBunny> But do they offset the pointer properly or not?
[20:06:11] <GBGamer117> nope
[20:06:16] <WindowsBunny> yay C style casts
[20:06:21] <GBGamer117> they don't do any offsetting at all

[20:08:11] <GBGamer117> I remember doing some game programming, and all of it could be written in C
[20:08:13] <WindowsBunny> GBGamer117: well things like untagged unions and bitfields and multiple inheritance
[20:08:51] <GBGamer117> how does one do an untagged union?
[20:08:57] <GBGamer117> like, how does one work with it?
[20:09:12] <WindowsBunny> GBGamer117: Well, structs in winapi have their own field that is the tag
[20:09:23] <WindowsBunny> Or you just have to keep track of it yourself based on how you use it
[20:09:25] <GBGamer117> so it's a struct { tag; union; }
[20:09:35] <WindowsBunny> plus a bunch of other members
[20:09:44] <WindowsBunny> and the tag might not be right before the union

[22:10:28] <GBGamer117> ?
[22:12:05] <Astrum|Lap> levarging a large chunk of chromium to create a cross-platform editor was a mistake
[22:12:20] <Astrum|Lap> basing it off of web technologies in general wasn't a great idea
[22:12:20] <ogham> "Everything that can get written in JavaScript will eventually get written in JavaScript"
[22:12:36] <Astrum|Lap> building web pages in general isn't easy
[22:13:16] <GBGamer117> interesting point
[22:13:25] <GBGamer117> what do you use then?
[22:13:25] <Astrum|Lap> so... atom may be easy to hack on, but it comes at a steep cost

[22:14:43] <Astrum|Lap> bstrie: there are ain't? 
[22:15:19] <ogham> people used to think that web technologies were lacking (slow, no drag and drop, etc) and then they improved
[22:15:30] <Astrum|Lap> then again my person views on most editors isn't too good, but that's because I think I can do better (naturally)
[22:15:33] <bstrie> Astrum|Lap: *there are two ain't easy problems in computer science: building web pages, pimpin', and automatic grammar detection
[22:15:35] <ogham> eventually they'll improve some more to deal with things like the alt gr problem

[22:16:42] <ogham> Astrum|Lap: I agree
[22:16:59] <Astrum|Lap> css in general is just bad (though I do like the idea of gss which implements the cassowary constraint solver, same as is used with apple's autolayout)
[22:17:06] <ogham> too many problems, but they're not unfixable as the platform improves
[22:17:16] <Astrum|Lap> html is approaching a decent area, but it's quite verbose
[22:17:42] <Astrum|Lap> (which is why we have things like jade, haml, etc...)
[22:18:05] <Astrum|Lap> GBGamer117: that's a rather in-depth question tbh
[22:18:19] <Astrum|Lap> short of it is, I think textual languages are far too limiting
[22:19:07] <Astrum|Lap> I also think the drag'n'drop bezier soup dataflow languages are both unusable and poorly suited to most language semantics
[22:20:26] <GBGamer117> Astrum|Lap: so how would you design a language to be neither textual nor "drag'n'drop bezier soup"

[22:24:35] <ogham> WindowsBunny: yeah, me neither. but maybe one day...
[22:25:09] <WindowsBunny> ogham: When that day comes, then I shall embrace the web a bit more
[22:25:15] <eddyb> one thing I did that I don't expect simplex algorithms to handle is take "chaining" inequalities, e.g.
[22:25:21] <eddyb> a < b < c < d
[22:25:28] <eddyb> and distribute the space between them equally
[22:25:31] <Sho> Astrum|Lap: It's a superset-of-ECMAScript declarative language with built-in primitives for things like state machines and property change tweens + a standard lib providing e.g. an anchor-based layout model + a runtime with a multi-threaded GLES scenegraph renderer (along with draw call batching, texture atlasing, etc.)
[22:25:58] <Astrum|Lap> eddyb: I've been thinking about implementing that in rust actually

[22:31:24] <eddyb> which was... 6 years ago or more
[22:31:45] <Sho> we also have a test instance of gerrit that's pretty cool because we integrated it with our CI and have it run builds and tests on precombined stuff before pull requests even go in
[22:31:49] <eddyb> it's slow as shit and very annoying to use
[22:31:56] <Sho> but gerrit is just too unfriendly for our non-coders

[22:35:13] <eddyb> that... looks a lot like the thing I wanted to build in a vacuum
[22:36:21] <eddyb> it's confusing though
[22:36:30] <eddyb> events are expressions
[22:36:37] <Sho> eddyb: Basically what you can do is Object { someProp: <expression> } to instanciate Object and bind <expression> to someProp, and if <expression> references a property on another object and that property changes in value, the expression is re-run and someProp updated
[22:36:57] <Sho> eddyb: Object can be written in QML itself, or anything implemented in C++ that inherits QObject
[22:37:26] <eddyb> Sho: so out of that file, is there anything that's a default value for a property, or is everything constants or views?

[22:38:37] <eddyb> clearer here
[22:38:38] <Sho> Along with Qt-style signals-and-slots
[22:38:52] <Sho> And you can embed procedural JS code (well, that's what the expressions are after all)
[22:39:17] <Sho> The runtime used to use a fork of v8, but eventually switched to a homegrown engine (still w/ a JIT) called "v4"
[22:39:21] <eddyb> so components are just specified inside a container
[22:39:40] <eddyb> that's... again, very much like what I wanted to make
[22:39:52] <eddyb> Sho: can QML express the entire UI out of primitives?
[22:40:00] <Sho> eddyb: ... and I just linked you old outdated Qt 4 stuff btw, QML 2 in Qt 5 is a bunch cooler
[22:40:52] <eddyb> hmm, QML looks more verbose than I'd hoped
[22:40:59] <eddyb> (and that could also be a problem with my own design)
[22:41:16] *** Quits: ogham (rally@moz-91e3hp.cable.virginm.net) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[22:41:44] <Sho> eddyb: Define 'out of primitives'
[22:41:57] <Sho> Sorry, was monologizing a bit because I was distracted by someone else
[22:41:58] <eddyb> let's say triangles and shaders
[22:42:11] <eddyb> but that may be lower than what I would realistically use
[22:42:47] <eddyb> Sho: i.e. don't write the style code in C++ but do it declaratively, in QML
[22:42:54] <Sho> eddyb: Sort of kinda yeah-no, ... let me go into detail :-)
[22:43:47] <eddyb> (what I had in mind was something that would compile down to the most efficient representation possible: constants would not exist at runtime and many of the containers with fixed children would be linear in memory, no DOM-like pointer madness)
[22:44:09] <Sho> eddyb: The smallest primitive in the standard lib that targets the scenegraph UI layer (QML isn't necessarily implicitly visual) is "Item", which doesn't necessarily render anything, and on the C++ side is an instance of a class called QQuickItem
[22:44:40] <eddyb> does that interact with layout?
[22:44:55] <Sho> eddyb: So if you want to write a more complex visual item, you subclass QQuickItem and implement a bunch of methods to e.g. use the c++ scene graph API to spawn an arbitrarily-sized subtree of nodes in the scenegraph
[22:45:17] <Sho> eddyb: The standard lib also provides some visual primitives like Rectangle which work that way
[22:45:47] <Sho> eddyb: And you can also, inside QML, apply shaders to any Item, with the fragment shader source embedded into QML
[22:46:40] <Sho> eddyb: There's also some standard lib items to e.g. render an item into a texture and then use it as a source for a shader effect item, and a lib full of standard effect items (like masking or blurring or what not)
[22:47:09] <Sho> Animations run off the main thread, btw
[22:48:43] <eddyb> so you could theoretically implement the entire Qt UI with, e.g. the Breeze style, in QML
[22:48:53] <Sho> eddyb: and yeah, items interact with layout
[22:49:40] <Sho> eddyb: Items can have x/y and width/height (along with implicitWidth/implicitHeight), as well as anchors for relative positioning (e.g. SomeItem { anchor.left: otherItem.right; }) and anchor margins
[22:50:02] <Sho> eddyb: However there's also items that will position their children, e.g. Column and Row
[22:51:37] <Sho> eddyb: what you do is have a data model (which can just be a JS array, but in a more real app will be a Qt item model implemented in C++) and hand it to a Repeater item which takes care of instanciating a delegate component for every item in the model, and then e.g. nest that inside a Row to layout those spawned delegate items automatically
[22:52:04] <Sho> But you could also have the model serve up coordinates and bind those to the x/y props of the delegate items
[22:52:58] <Sho> And there's things like ListView that instead of binding delegate lifetime to the the lifetime of something on the model, use delegate pooling instead to scale to large models
[22:53:20] <Sho> i.e. create/destroy/reuse delegate instances as you scroll a viewport for example
[22:53:39] <eddyb> (the cool thing about controlling codegen is that you can have a dynamic scenegraph and convert between the efficient and the dynamic one at will. imagine entering "debug mode", moving some compoenents around and then pressing a button to recompile and reload the UI as a plugin into the app, and then have the dynamic scengraph decomposed into the new optimized version)
[22:54:15] <eddyb> (but that's a pipe dream, given my track record)
[22:54:29] <Sho> heh
[22:57:59] <Sho> eddyb: In terms of pratical stuff, in the QML scenegraph-based text rendering thing I'm hacking on for the IRC client in my spare time, what it does is use a delegate-pooling ListView to manage line delegates, but the line delegate item is a C++ subclass of QQuickItem that creates scene graph nodes per line segment (columns). and the data source for the ListView is a proxy model that filters out e.g. a channel's lines from a global model. 
[22:58:01] <Sho> so e.g. every identical nickname in the scene is satisfied from the same texture atlas, switching tabs just moves identical lines ("xyz joined this channel") in the scene, readjusting the nick column width just moves line segment nodes in the scene unless there's a need to actually recalculate wrapping, etc.

[22:58:53] <Sho> and there's only as many line delegate instances as needed by the viewport + some pool management for scrolling (that's mostly done by ListView)
[22:59:07] <Sho> most of the complexity is actually in eviction logic for the various texture caches
[22:59:14] <Sho> and text layout caches
[22:59:40] <Sho> since text rast still has to be done CPU-side with FreeType
[23:00:15] <Sho> QML actually ships a GL-based distance field font rasterizer, but aside from the desktop rendering compat problem, it's just not very good since it just uses a single 64x64 texture as the distance field for each glyph
[23:00:41] <Sho> i keep meaning to play around with using glyphy in a QML app
[23:01:01] <eddyb> that sounds complicated
[23:01:10] <eddyb> and my stuff is worse. utopias gaah
[23:01:45] <eddyb> Sho: I need a team of Qt/KDE devs who are sick of C++
[23:02:58] <Sho> heh
[23:03:06] <Sho> eddyb: We almost got sick of C++ I think
[23:03:18] <Sho> but 11 and 14 did fix a lot of pain points and introduce enough toys to make it a little bit fun again
[23:03:35] <eddyb> what I have in mind could very well be QML3

[23:04:54] <eddyb> Sho: being more efficient than almost everything out there is a goal. like beating Java on mobile
[23:05:22] <eddyb> and I'm a bit skeptic about doing that with an ES VM
[23:05:32] <Sho> well, there are many kinds of efficiency
[23:05:53] <Sho> for a mobile user UI latency and throughput probably matter the most
[23:06:00] <Sho> developer efficiency ain't a small thing either
[23:06:22] <eddyb> we already have micro-optimizations
[23:06:38] <eddyb> and convenient to develop frameworks with shitty perf
[23:06:50] <eddyb> Sho: so it would have to be both :P
[23:07:20] <Sho> BB10 and Ubuntu Phone and Sailfish are all QML btw
[23:07:38] <Sho> BB10 is a fork off the old pre-GL one though with a lot of homegrown gunk
