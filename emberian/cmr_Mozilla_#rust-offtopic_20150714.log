[03:13:20] <Peach> In the future, do you think programming languages will converge into something simpler and cleanly designed that replaces compiled languages and scripting language with one neat concept?
[03:13:29] <WindowsBunny> Astraea: I am based towards the superior OS
[03:13:33] <WindowsBunny> *biased
[03:13:54] <XMPPwocky> Peach: a sufficiently clever JIT, like the JVMs, is a pretty good solution for a lot of use-cases
[03:14:00] <XMPPwocky> but you still need to decide whether you want GC or not
[03:14:26] <Astraea> Peach: I have an idea to my that way
[03:14:41] <Astraea> *move that way
[03:14:43] *** Joins: eddyb (eddyb@moz-pic.82i.25.188.IP)
[03:16:13] <aatch> Peach, honestly? No. There's too much variation in use cases and what people want out of a language. There's a fundamental tradeoff between compile-time and runtime, and I don't think more power is enough.
[03:16:33] <aatch> More power will ultimately just mean more static analysis.
[03:16:50] <aatch> Or better JITs
[03:16:58] <XMPPwocky> if you look at something like java or C#, you have GCed pointers to things on the heap (often called "objects"), and you have things on the stack with copy semantics (value types). but you can't have pointers to anything on the stack
[03:17:29] <XMPPwocky> one of the neat things about Rust is that it lets you have pointers to things on the stack, with safety
[03:18:10] <XMPPwocky> by checking their lifetimes
[03:18:27] <Astraea> WindowsBunny: so what laptop would you suggest?
[03:19:13] <Peach> Astraea: you have an idea to move that way?
[03:19:48] <XMPPwocky> So I could imagine that, say, Java gets Rust-style references and region types, but only allowed to refer to value types (or maybe allowed to refer to GC roots elsewhere, not sure)
[03:19:58] <aatch> I think that we'll see more divergence, with languages that are designed for high-performance and robustness on one side, and languages that are designed for flexibility.
[03:20:01] <WindowsBunny> Astraea: I don't suggest laptops :P
[03:20:16] <XMPPwocky> which gives that much more control over memory layout, reducing allocation, etc; with no compromise on safety
[03:21:02] <aatch> With the high-performance/robust side having large amounts of static analysis and annotation.
[03:21:10] <Astraea> Peach: more of a meta language I suppose
[03:21:30] <Astraea> WindowsBunny: desktops are so 80s tho! Heh
[03:21:37] <XMPPwocky> the nice thing about "Just", as i'd call it, is that if you want to just be "traditional Java" you can
[03:21:45] <scott> Rust seems like a fairly unique step in the direction of high level that maintains control+safety. But you can definitely make a much simpler language by reducing the level of control.
[03:21:46] <aatch> Think, Rust + http://www.brics.dk/pale/ + a theorem prover.
[03:21:47] <XMPPwocky> references would just be another tool
[03:22:02] <XMPPwocky> aatch: can theorem provers make half-decent error messages yet?
[03:22:19] <aatch> XMPPwocky, probably not. But if we're talking hypothetical languages...
[03:22:22] <Peach> aatch: what flexible features could a statically compiled language not have? What about a scripting language that instead of JIT, is "compiled on demand" so it runs even faster than JIT(native speed)
[03:22:33] <XMPPwocky> Peach: ... that's literally what JIT means? :P
[03:22:55] <XMPPwocky> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation
[03:23:01] <Peach> No no, I mean 0 performance penalty
[03:23:08] <Peach> as in on program startup
[03:23:18] <Peach> the entire code is compiled in advance
[03:23:36] <XMPPwocky> you can tell a JIT to do that, but a lot of the perf of JITs comes from the fact that they actually dynamically instrument code, and optimize based on that
[03:23:42] <aatch> Peach, kinda defeats the point, ahead-of-time is ahead-of-time, might as well get it out of the way as early as possible.
[03:23:58] <XMPPwocky> in theory, they could beat AoT compiliation for runtime performance, after the instrumentation finishes
[03:25:15] <Peach> Ok, so my real question is
[03:25:38] <Peach> What part of "flexible " programming language doesn't allow for performance
[03:25:45] <Peach> as in what specific features
[03:26:14] <aatch> Peach, I'm talking more about flexibility in terms of writing the code. On one side you have a focus on statically proving correctness, and on the other side you have a focus on making it easy to write the code.
[03:26:54] * Peach doesn't see why it's difficult to make those 2 go hand in hand
[03:27:13] <Peach> easy to write code and statically proving correctness
[03:27:14] <aatch> Peach, it's like legalese vs. informal prose.
[03:27:48] <Peach> I think different, I totally see it as possible to be simple and formally correct
[03:28:04] <XMPPwocky> sure, it totally is
[03:28:29] <aatch> I don't think you can do that *and* have performance all at the same time though.
[03:28:29] <XMPPwocky> for example, a virtual machine with the only instruction being NOP; all programs written for it are safe
[03:28:53] <Peach> You SURE aatch ? Can you give more specific examples, because that's actually what I'm working on right now
[03:28:53] <XMPPwocky> but it's when you want to expose certain underlying details,  for performance reasons
[03:29:06] <Peach> a programming language that is simple, correct, and performant
[03:29:31] <Astraea> Like most things in engineering, pick two of the three
[03:29:44] <aatch> Peach, "simple" isn't necessarily good. It's easy to prove that a simple program is correct.
[03:30:04] <Peach> No I'm a rebel I'm a rebel that picks all 3
[03:30:22] <Peach> aatch: by simple, I mean like C with struct functions simple
[03:30:34] <XMPPwocky> what the heck's a struct function
[03:30:44] <Mutabah> XMPPwocky: A function scoped to a struct? Simple method I assume
[03:30:55] <XMPPwocky> ah
[03:30:57] <aatch> Peach, there's more to correctness than that though.
[03:31:07] <aatch> Peach, simple is fine, but do you have pointers?
[03:31:18] <Peach> Yup, and language purity too
[03:31:29] <Mutabah> Pointer arithmatic, the bane of correctness checks
[03:31:33] <Peach> so you can guarentee code has no side effects
[03:32:01] <Peach> and I have fat pointers (pointers with length stored before the actual data)
[03:32:25] <Astraea> Bleh, I want 16GB of ram and more than a pittance of storage space apple, please stop charging me an arm and a leg for such basics! :(
[03:32:49] <aatch> Peach, ok, and what mechanisms are you using to prove correctness?
[03:34:28] <aatch> Peach, eventually you run into the halting problem and either have to sacrifice performance (check stuff at runtime) or "simplicity" (annotate the program).
[03:34:53] <Peach> The major aspect is the compiler that does static analysis on the code aatch, I should probably ask what you mean by proving correctness,
[03:35:11] <XMPPwocky> what sort of static analysis
[03:35:25] <aatch> Peach, that the code has no bugs.
[03:35:57] <aatch> Peach, *at all*. Including logic ones.
[03:36:07] <Peach> Assuming you mean no null deference or garbage data access, 
[03:36:11] <Peach> and then for logic,
[03:36:44] <aatch> I don't think any language will ever get there, but I think there will be a trend towards more and more annotation to help drive analysis.
[03:36:56] <Mutabah> *nod*
[03:37:10] <Peach> It's centered around library integration - for example functions have input range checking so you can't do sqrt(-1), or make an OpenGL call with an invalid parameter
[03:37:25] <aatch> Peach, can you check that at compile time?
[03:37:27] <Mutabah> It's possible you could design a language and compiler to check for logical fallicies in the code... but even then bugs can creep in
[03:37:41] <Mutabah> aatch: Poke bcos on freenode for fun about that :)
[03:37:45] <Peach> Yes aatch , the goal is to have as much compile time error checking as possible
[03:37:49] <aatch> Peach, because if not, that's a performance hit.
[03:37:52] <Peach> Eliminate runtime errors
[03:38:28] <Peach> Yeah, totally do not want any performance hit, the compiler analysis checks most errors at compile time
[03:39:06] <aatch> Peach, and that's fine, but eventually you have to have either runtime checks or increased annotation.
[03:39:25] <Peach> Is that a challenge? :P
[03:40:04] <aatch> Peach, no, it's fact. This isn't something that's just "really hard", it's literally impossible to get away with having neither.
[03:40:29] <Peach> "Make a simple intuitive language that requires minimal annotation and almost no runtime checks and prevents crashing and most logic errors"?
[03:40:33] <niconii> a program that prints sqrt(n), where n is one of the arguments to the program
[03:40:43] <niconii> you can't check that at compile-time, period
[03:41:13] <Peach> niconii: true, but you can make a manual branch or clamp be required though
[03:41:21] <Peach> the compiler can check external input
[03:41:25] <aatch> Peach, at any rate, your pointers are already runtime checks.
[03:41:43] <aatch> Peach, the "fat" ones, anyway.
[03:44:05] <Peach> I know, anything that's a branch or extra instruction from a direct asm ADD, MOV etc. instruction is a runtime check aatch 
[03:44:38] <Peach> The idea is - compile time checks, and enforce that the user's code handles cases where things MUST be checked at runtime

[03:47:43] <Peach> aatch: So, can you call Python/Javascript with static type checking "flexible"   (that isn't the prospect of the language I'm making, but I want to know what you'd think a flexible language that surprisingly has zero performance overhead would be)
[03:55:44] <aatch> Peach, static type checking reduces a fair amount of overhead from having to deal with unknown data types, but by "flexible" I just mean that it's easy to do stuff with.
[03:55:58] <Peach> OH
[03:56:18] <Peach> Then I think I may have actually made something that does that aatch 
[03:56:41] <aatch> So you can spend more time figuring out logic than convincing the compiler that your code won't crash.
[03:58:23] <aatch> Also, "<Peach> The idea is - compile time checks, and enforce that the user's code handles cases where things MUST be checked at runtime" - So ATS?
[03:59:10] <Peach> ATS the programming language aatch ?
[03:59:21] <aatch> Peach, yes
[04:00:05] <Peach> No ATS is WAAAAAY too math and theory oriented, the language I'm making is intended to be expert AND beginner friendly
[04:00:34] <Peach> The language tries to do all the fancy proofs and inference behind the scenes
[04:01:03] <Peach> It really only will say anything if you're doing something that would have failed at runtime in Python/similar languages anyway
[04:02:01] <Peach> It's a language catered toward high level application development - fun stuff, tries to remove as much low level details as possible (unless you specifically ask for them)
[04:02:30] <Peach> all while having no performance penalty - it's no slower than C
[04:02:56] <Peach> yet has a bunch of fancy pretty features for human programmer productivity

[04:07:25] <Peach> I'd say a lot of languages DON'T have nicely written compiler code, which makes it difficult for them to resolve fancy features

[04:10:06] <scott> What could I name a Rust shell? I think all the good puns are taken.
[04:10:23] <Peach> The compiler scans the code and makes a data tree of variables and sorts them by purity and scope; if a variable is marked as being externally changeable or going outside of local scope, it gets tracked and the compiler gives a warning in cases where reading or writing to data is unsafe, but do you mean something more specific aatch ?

[04:14:23] *** Quits: Kingsquee (kingsley@moz-k72lip.bchsia.telus.net) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[04:14:46] <aatch> Peach, if you have statically-checked range limits on function arguments, how is that encoded? Into the type, a separate annotation?
[04:19:18] <Peach> aatch: type system is nominal typing/duck typing, it has generics, the language uses a unified syntax for most cases - so generics are written the same way regular functions are, homoiconic reflection,
[04:19:25] <Peach>  range limit on functions is defined in the code:   function sqrt(double x : x >= 0)
[04:19:37] <Peach> the : can also be a pure function that resolves at compile time
[04:20:04] <Peach> So you can even do crazy things like make a function that only accepts primes as input :P
[04:21:40] <Peach> It's pretty simple - no inheritance, instead there's protocols with optional implementations

[04:24:22] <Peach> if x is a compile time resolveable value - like  int x = 4; in the same scope, then the compiler allows that. If x gets a value stored into it from a non pure function then the compiler gives an error that you need to branch or clamp the value of x
[04:25:08] <aatch> Peach, ok, so how do you know if the value has been clamped?
[04:26:47] <Peach> only when there's a call to a compile time resolvable clamp() function in the same scope before x gets read
[04:27:03] <Peach> so if you do:  int x = 4; sqrt(x);  - that's fine
[04:27:22] <Peach> and if you do:  int x = 4; x = random(); x = 4; sqrt(x);   that's fine

[04:34:49] <aatch> Peach, yes.
[04:36:28] <Peach> Yes this case is easy, the path is marked as being safe because every conditional gets marked aatch , upon entering the if branch the compiler knows that x has a valid range for sqrt and it's being assigned to y

[04:46:45] <aatch> Peach, that's the result of years of work by a university professor.

[04:50:50] <aatch> Peach, anyway, you should take a look at the publications. It's important to have *some* solid theoretical basis.
[04:51:26] <Peach> Oh thanks aatch you're really helpful!
[04:53:00] <Peach> Java is the polar opposite of the language I'm making - Java is pure verbosity and has too much distance from the raw machine
[04:53:58] <aatch> Peach, well, to be fair to whiley, Dave seems interested in compiling it to native code. One of the computer science honours projects was writing a compiler-to-C for Whiley.
[04:54:39] <Peach> "One of"? Where at your university or?
[04:54:54] <aatch> He teaches at the university I went to.
[04:55:09] <Peach> Plus MAN I could so make a compiler to C for that language
[04:55:26] <aatch> The person that got assigned the project dropped out though.

[05:13:39] <Quxxy> (You may need to download it from the link at the bottom)
[05:13:57] <scott> ES6 introduces new keywords in part to correct the scoping disaster.
[05:14:14] <Havvy> scott:  I don't think `let` is a huge improvement over `var`.
[05:14:20] <Peach> Javascript is awful
[05:14:25] <scott> And ES6 closures treat `this` differently than old-style functions do.
[05:14:30] <Havvy> The truly awful part of JS there is what happens when you don't declare.
[05:14:36] <scott> Havvy: I'm not too familiar with the details.
[05:14:56] <Peach> I'm taking the good parts, removing type coersion, and adding static typing and genrics and removing all the awful
[05:15:05] <Peach> then I add C and a sprinkle of Python
[05:15:52] <Havvy> Technically the single threadedness model could be considered a bad part.
[05:16:03] <Peach> and then remove the undefined behavior and voila! 
[05:16:17] <WindowsBunny> WebAssembly is a great thing
[05:16:34] <WindowsBunny> hopefully it takes over so the web can be scripted in saner languages than shitscript

[09:51:51] <bluss> eddyb: intrinsics::drop_in_place(&mut self[..]) 
[09:51:57] <bluss> this is crazy
[09:51:59] <bluss> and it works
[09:55:28] <bluss> what happens on panic in drop though
[09:55:51] <WindowsBunny> bluss: not good
[09:59:06] <bluss> it's tricky. Just looking at Vec::truncate that drops elements one by one from the back, so if there is a panic in an element's drop, every remaining elem will still drop due to Vec::drop
[09:59:38] <bluss> so it's probably not a good idea to just replace the drop loop in truncate with  drop_in_place(&mut self[len..])  
[10:11:10] <WindowsBunny> bluss: if you set the length after you drop_in_place, then everything that was already dropped before the panic set in, will be dropped again
[10:11:11] <WindowsBunny> which is bad
[10:11:39] <WindowsBunny> bluss: But if you set the Vec len before you drop_in_place then worst case you end up basically leaking anything that wasn't dropped yet
[10:12:40] <bluss> ye
[10:13:01] <bluss> I wonder how drop_in_place handles panic w.r.t the rest of the elements being dropped at the same time

[11:20:35] <kimundi> Is it correct in C++ that if I have implemented a pubic virtual member function in a class, I still need to redeclare it in any subclass to make it callable for the subclass?
[11:21:02] <kimundi> THat is, is it correct that public member functions can get lost that way down the inheritance chain?
[11:21:36] <Quxxy> kimundi: I'd have only thought so if you do a non-public inherit from the base class
[11:21:40] <Quxxy> (But I'm not an expert)
[11:22:26] <kimundi> I'd have thought so too the last ten times I stumbled over something like that, but each time the compiler is of a different opinion :P
[11:22:38] <kimundi> inheritance is public all the way up
[11:24:07] <WindowsBunny> kimundi: if inheritable is public all the way up, then you should be able to call base class functions from a subclass

[12:15:21] <Quxxy> Previously, I just ignored all but the first

[12:15:41] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: lol
[12:15:42] <Quxxy> So you go from referring to minwindef::INT to winnt::INT
[12:15:57] <Quxxy> So I added a whole new chunk of code to detect this and create module-local aliases
[12:16:03] <Quxxy> So winnt::INT is just an alias for minwindef::INT
[12:16:14] <Quxxy> Except I *just* realised that's going to completely break when you do your bloody glob import

[13:15:13] <eddyb> or not... idk

[13:16:46] <eddyb> I think it's fine, but YMMV

[13:21:09] <eddyb> great, everything's in order :D

[16:12:26] <zofrex> I've done a lot of Java development so that's what I'm used to
[16:12:59] <Peach> I wish Java was a cleaner language
[16:13:04] <dfockler> eclipse is great but awful
[16:13:23] <Peach> I suppose the DOZENS of languages that compile to JVM make up for default Java
[16:13:37] <zofrex> I converted to IntelliJ a while back (when Android Studio first came out), haven't looked back
[16:14:04] <dfockler> When I was a young pup in college I used jGrasp for a while
[16:14:12] <zofrex> Java is verbose but I like that I can easily answer questions like "who else calls this function" and do safe refactors... these days I do a lot of Ruby and Tcl and those questions are much harder to answer
[16:14:13] <dfockler> then eclipse and then Ruby
[16:14:27] <zofrex> I'll take answering those questions easily over brevity any day, in a large codebase at least
[16:15:36] <dfockler> with well done Ruby, it's fairly easy to tell
[16:15:50] <dfockler> but it can get gross if you aren't careful

[16:50:41] <Quxxy> One for ANSI, one for Unicode
[16:50:56] <Quxxy> Then, there's a #define that picks one of those for Foo based on the definition of UNICODE
[16:51:05] <Quxxy> *Except* for GetEnvironmentStrings
[16:51:15] <Quxxy> It is, so far, the *only* function I've *ever seen* that doesn't do this

[16:51:33] <Astraea> it's windows, don't expect good things from it
[16:51:36] <Quxxy> *Instead*, it defines GetEnvironmentStrings and GetEnvironmentStringsW... and then if UNICODE is defined, does #define GetEnvironmentStrings GetEnvironmentStringsW
[16:51:40] * Astraea runs from WindowsBunny
[16:51:41] <Quxxy> So it *redefines a function*
[16:51:46] <Quxxy> As a macro
[16:51:57] <Quxxy> The very next function in the file does it the normal way
[16:51:59] <Quxxy> Why this one?
[16:51:59] <zofrex> see I sympathise with Peach being annoyed that Atom requires the very latest version of OS X, which is quite common for OS X software, backwards compatibility is not the norm on that platform
[16:52:01] <Quxxy> Why?!
[16:52:04] <zofrex> but the other option is shit like this.
[16:52:17] <Quxxy> This just breaks the binding generator
[16:52:35] <Astraea> zofrex: osx software is pretty decent with backwards compatibility

[17:04:04] <eddyb> kimundi: two (relevant) unis in Bucharest: the politechnic university and the university of Bucharest
[17:04:33] <eddyb> the former is more hardcore, and the top faculty there I knew I couldn't get into (physics admission exam)
[17:05:28] <eddyb> however, there's a "faculty of engineering in foreign languages" which has less competition and I can take two math exams instead of math + physics
[17:05:56] <eddyb> that is 1 = algebra and analysis and 2 = geometry and trigonometry
[17:06:47] <eddyb> so I went today to apply to both. poli: 5 minutes. unibuc: 3 hours
[17:07:22] <eddyb> the magic? I had already had all my data on their site (built with bootstrap, too, it's pretty nice)
[17:07:45] <eddyb> the same thing they use to input the data on-site, they let you register on, several days earlier
[17:07:50] <eddyb> they used *technology*
[17:08:03] <kimundi> woooh~~ ;)
[17:08:06] <eddyb> now I want there badly. at least it would suck less
[17:09:29] <eddyb> fuck the old guard. if I don't get to go there, I don't think I'll enlist in the other one
[17:11:48] <zofrex> Astraea: I've found quite a lot of dev tools only work on recent versions
[17:12:57] <Astraea> zofrex: I might have to look into it honestly
[17:13:06] <Astraea> for the most part I just upgrade to the latest version of OS X anyway

[17:13:21] <zofrex> maybe this time it will fix the wifi issues
[17:13:23] <Astraea> it's free and generally doesn't hurt to do it

[17:13:36] <Astraea> yeah, except wifi issues...
[17:13:52] <zofrex> maybe this time, things will be different... no no no no please, maybe THIS TIME...

[18:04:19] <eddyb> (hint: one is usually enough)
[18:04:33] <Astraea> speaking of, I get really strange looks now that my hair is purple
[18:04:59] <Astraea> I catch people looking at me strangely and can't imagine why for a few moments before realizing I dyed my hair, heh
[18:05:42] <eddyb> Astraea: don't make me feel like a jerk, but TBQH, for me, that would be end up in being treated like "just another of them rebel kids"
[18:06:03] <Astraea> well I'm not a rebel kid (too old for that)
[18:06:17] <Astraea> I kind of suspect it's people thinking I'm gay...
[18:06:20] <eddyb> which is why it might work for you better than me
[18:06:23] <eddyb> Astraea: oh
[18:06:31] <eddyb> I don't see the connection though
[18:06:36] <Astraea> even though I dyed my hair with my 6 year old niece for 4th of July (it was supposed to be red... it's more purple tho)
[18:07:09] <eddyb> just the fact that some people are more used to seeing women dying their hair, or what?
[18:07:24] <Peach> Hey, I have an important question!   Does anyone know how GUI text editors handle collision when you click a character/select a line?
[18:07:42] <eddyb> Peach: yes and no
[18:07:46] <Peach> I can't find info about make a GUI text editor ANYWHERE
[18:07:48] <eddyb> Peach: I'd start with binary search
[18:08:07] <Astraea> eddyb: I assume so. I mean punks dye their hair but they usually have mohawks. I have neatly parted hair
[18:08:09] <eddyb> actually, no
[18:08:12] <Peach> By collision eddyb I mean for each character when you use your mouse to select something
[18:08:23] <eddyb> yeah, I know what you mean
[18:08:34] <Astraea> with the recent supreme court decision I'm kind of assuming people are thinking that, I haven't stopped and asked anyone
[18:08:38] <eddyb> Peach: if you don't store layout information, you'll need to do a linear scan every time
[18:09:37] <Astraea> maybe I'll start dying my hair more often tho, it was kind of fun, heh
[18:09:44] <eddyb> start from the start of the line (left or right, depending on what the direction of the text is)
[18:10:09] <eddyb> keep adding characters until you're overlapping with the cursor
[18:11:14] <Astraea> bleh, I really need to buy a new laptop so I can start working on my modal code editor
[18:11:56] <eddyb> with just, e.g. 8 cached positions per line, you can limit that linear search to a maximum of an 8th of the line's length, which could be really small
[18:12:11] <eddyb> for 80 columns, that's 10 characters. okay, maybe still a lot :P
[18:12:23] <Peach> I was thinking of doing it like graphically,
[18:12:32] <Peach> each character gets a rectangle
[18:12:38] <Peach> and then collision check
[18:12:50] <Peach> on mouse click
[18:14:06] <eddyb> Peach: oh that's so pointless
[18:14:21] <Peach> really?
[18:14:24] <eddyb> Peach: it's like what I just described but with extra unnecessary expensiveness
[18:14:33] <eddyb> you can find the line first and then find the character in the line
[18:14:50] *** Joins: ogham (rally@moz-91e3hp.cable.virginm.net)
[18:15:15] <eddyb> and if you have overlapping characters, one of them has to win *anyways*
[18:15:47] <eddyb> Peach: imagine you merged the min/max y coordinates of all those bounding boxes
[18:15:56] <eddyb> (which the font library gives you)
[18:16:12] <eddyb> Peach: for each line, that's the y range of that line
[18:16:27] <eddyb> (assuming horizontal writing mode or w/e it's called)
[18:16:57] <eddyb> Peach: individual bounding-boxes are still useful for UI elements, but text can be in massive quantities
[18:17:27] <Astraea> so... like a simplified BVH
[18:18:18] <eddyb> Astraea: I opened that up on wikipedia and I don't get the image
[18:18:50] <Astraea> let me look at the image
[18:19:34] <eddyb> Peach: there's another optimization you can do for monospaced text, btw: store contiguous connected ranges of either "regular width" or "not-so-regular"
[18:20:18] <Astraea> makes sense to me
[18:20:28] <Astraea> except some inner nodes are unlabeled
[18:20:37] <Quxxy> BAM!

[18:32:29] <zofrex> Quxxy: NICE!
[18:32:32] <eddyb> Peach: binary search
[18:32:35] <Peach> i.e. if I have the line  "abc"   and my cursor clicks on the line range
[18:32:50] <eddyb> (well, it depends)
[18:32:55] <Peach> 0 to 5 would be 'a',  6 to 10 would be 'b' etc.
[18:33:14] <eddyb> Peach: you can do linear scan on that and it would be pretty fast
[18:33:31] <eddyb> if it's monospace, you can divide the cursor x position by the character width
[18:33:41] <eddyb> (if it's monospace and you're in an uniform range)
[18:36:05] <Peach> Nope, I do things the hard way, no monospace font
[18:36:18] <FreeFull> You can do better than binary search if you can reliably estimate where the desired element will be
[18:36:29] <eddyb> FreeFull: ehm
[18:36:55] <eddyb> FreeFull: like using the average char width per line?
[18:37:07] <eddyb> FreeFull: but even if you guess the right character 95% of the time
[18:37:13] <eddyb> how are you going to validate your guess?
[18:37:17] <FreeFull> eddyb: It really depends on what you're searching through
[18:37:19] <eddyb> without doing linear layout?
[18:37:57] <FreeFull> What you end up doing is a biased search
[18:38:03] <FreeFull> With a O(1) best case
[18:38:48] <Quxxy> Argh; who defined wchar_t as unsigned long long?!

[21:16:53] <Astraea> on what? heh
[21:17:10] <npm> abstract algebra!
[21:17:14] <npm> it sounds cool
[21:17:19] <npm> just from the name
[21:17:24] <Astraea> groups, rings, fields
[21:17:31] <Astraea> isomorphisms, automorphisms
[21:17:37] <Astraea> homomorphisms
[21:17:46] <npm> I don't know what any of that means

[21:18:45] <npm> (I wanna be the very best that no one ever was)
[21:18:47] <Astraea> eh, just look up a mathematical group on wiki
[21:18:55] <Astraea> it'll explain it pretty well
[21:19:01] <Astraea> though the notation might be a bit weird at first

[21:21:34] <GBGamer> yikes
[21:21:44] <GBGamer> that definitely looks interesting
[21:21:51] <GBGamer> but... wow
[21:22:24] <scott> I love abstract algebra. I'm taking a course in it starting January.
[21:22:48] <GBGamer> I doubt my community college has any courses
[21:23:02] <GBGamer> but hopefully I'll be able to take it in University
[21:23:28] <GBGamer> (plus I'm taking Calc II-IV these next quarters)
[21:23:38] <Astraea> calc 2 was miserable
[21:23:55] <GBGamer> what was miserable about it?
[21:24:05] <Astraea> basically a grab bag of techniques for solving integrals
[21:24:10] <huon> is there some US-wide definition of what's in each Calc X class?
[21:24:17] <Astraea> not... really, huon 
[21:24:30] <GBGamer> probably integrals, usually
[21:24:37] *** Joins: jxcl (jxcl@moz-o4k.t5t.173.207.IP)
[21:24:39] * huon has no idea what is in any of them
[21:24:55] <Astraea> calc 1 was basically limits, derivatives, integrals, FTC
[21:24:56] <GBGamer> also sometimes basic diff eqs?
[21:25:13] <Astraea> calc 2 was, as I said, grab bag of solving integrals, and a bunch of other random weirdness
[21:25:18] <huon> my calculus classes at university were "differential calc", "integral calc", "vector calc", basically
[21:25:23] <Astraea> calc 3 was multivariate calculus and vector valculus
[21:25:45] <GBGamer> for us, Calc I was limits and differentials
[21:25:45] <huon> (i.e. that was their names)
[21:25:52] <Astraea> diff eqs and pdiff eqs are almost always separated from what I've seen, GBGamer 
[21:25:59] <GBGamer> multivariate Calc?
[21:26:14] <GBGamer> pdiff eqs?
[21:26:21] <huon> partial differential equations
[21:26:38] <Astraea> multivariate/multivariable calculus is calculus of more than one variable
[21:26:59] <GBGamer> oh, we did mv differentials in CI as well
[21:27:20] <Astraea> eh, we covered the very basics of it in my calc 1
[21:27:55] <GBGamer> yeah
[21:28:21] <GBGamer> anyways, the point is, there's kind of a general progression but its definitely not set in stone
[21:29:01] <GBGamer> and also, I need to do more calculus

[21:45:51] <GBGamer> what do people usually write ides in?
[21:46:50] <mbrubeck> emacs lisp :P
[21:47:14] <GBGamer> I have to admit emacs lisp is pretty great
[21:47:35] <GBGamer> really any lisp lets be honest
[21:47:41] <GBGamer> especially RPL

[21:54:20] <fkaa> all jetbrains products are java
[21:55:30] <Peach> I can't stand that IDEs are dominated by vim style or eclipse style
[21:55:41] <Astraea> vim style?
[21:55:45] <Astraea> there's more than one?
[21:55:45] <Peach> I bet vim has the ugliest code library ever
[21:55:59] <Peach> cause it's ancient
[21:56:09] <Astraea> yes, pretty ugly
[21:57:20] <Astraea> also, IDE in OpenGL sounds... kind of painful
[21:59:43] <Peach> Why Astraea ? In what way?
[22:00:28] <Astraea> you have to reinvent a bunch of stuff
[22:00:50] <Astraea> (I meant painful for the programmer, not the user btw)
[22:01:20] <Astraea> alright, is 256GB enough storage for a laptop... ugh, I'm going to end up building a NAS

[22:02:15] <XMPPwocky> Astraea: it's enough for me, generally
[22:02:33] <XMPPwocky> my entire windows partition is just 100gb which was a bad decision in retrospect
[22:02:46] <Astraea> well I know 128GB is way too little
[22:03:15] <Astraea> my dead MBP has a 500GB drive, which is... almost full, but I have quite a few movies/tv shows on there
[22:03:20] <Astraea> which probably takes up a ton of space
[22:03:31] <XMPPwocky> oh if you have movies/shows...
[22:03:37] <XMPPwocky> my issue is just games
[22:03:48] <XMPPwocky> i guess with media, you can always build a NAS for it and run plex 
[22:04:00] <Astraea> yeah, I've been looking into that
[22:04:27] <Astraea> I've always wanted a NAS
[22:05:47] <Astraea> kind of expensive to make one though

[22:18:26] <zofrex> unless you're doing like.. all of those things, even 256 is quite roomy
