[12:44:34] <gleb> does rustdoc ignore transitive and most of blanket trait implementations currently?

[20:03:57] <gleb> Gankro: regarding gh25892 (rustdoc of type aliases), could you elaborate on your request? do you wan to look at the libstd docs with the change?
[20:04:57] <Gankro> gleb: Yeah
[20:05:06] <Gankro> Sometimes a change to something breaks something else
[20:05:16] <Gankro> Good to have a live instance to poke all the widgets with
[20:15:21] <Gankro> gleb: thanks!
[20:16:21] <gleb> Gankro: now that I think of the libstd impact the change might be too hacky... but there aren't many typedefs there
[20:17:25] <Gankro> At very least I can confirm the right thing seems to have happened on io::Result
[20:18:21] <Gankro> gleb: Interestingly the variants don't show up
[20:18:33] <Gankro> Not sure if that's out of scope, though
[20:19:30] <Gankro> Hmm... although it's showing the unconstrained type
[20:19:37] <Gankro> Interesting
[20:19:47] <Gankro> Doing otherwise would presumably involve some complex work
[20:21:06] <gleb> yeah I'm not opposed to that but it's not clear where to begin =)
[20:22:23] <Gankro> It's not super clear to me what the value of this is over just clicking on Result and going there. Slightly more eagerly helpful, I suppose.
[20:23:50] <gleb> imagine you have `type Bar = Foo<Baz>` and it has its own set of methods and traits you can't see on the `Foo` page
[20:26:14] <bluss> that shouldn't happen, it's just an alias
[20:26:52] <gleb> Foo<Baz> and Foo<Qux> can be very different
[20:27:18] <bluss> hm ok, is this in a situation with multiple crates?
[20:27:30] <bluss> Otherwise all impls on Foo should show up on Foo's page
[20:27:44] <bluss> including impls on Bar, because it's just an alias for Foo<Baz>.
[20:28:33] <gleb> let me check... I didn't plan to publish the `Foo` type at all BTW =)
[20:33:10] <gleb> bluss: no, I don't see any of the `Foo<Baz>` specific items on the `Foo` page
[20:33:42] <bluss> is it all in one crate?
[20:33:49] <gleb> yes
[20:33:53] <bluss> that sounds buggy
[20:34:42] <bluss> I'd expect to see it, just like for example Box<Any> methods show up here http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/boxed/struct.Box.html
[20:36:22] <gleb> same crate but different modules though
[20:38:41] <gleb> I may be somewhat abusing type aliases in my case. this generic type I have is a wrapper type so instead of having 30 similar wrapper types I decided to use typedefs
[20:38:47] <gleb> this might not be idiomatic
[20:39:22] <bluss> if they are different types it's not weird
[20:39:30] <bluss> just `type` is just an alias though
[20:43:18] <gleb> aliases are just sugar so I can say `Bar` instead of `Foo<Baz>` and maybe also have separate doc pages instead of everything piled up on the `Foo` page
[20:43:54] <gleb> the Foo<T> type takes care of things that are common to those types and it would be a shame to have to duplicate that or use macros
[20:48:43] <gleb> real code here: https://github.com/gkoz/rust-gnome-gtk/blob/object_reform/src/window/mod.rs https://github.com/gkoz/rust-gnome-gtk/blob/object_reform/src/object.rs
[20:52:22] <gleb> I'd also like rustdoc to render transitive and blanket impls (gh25608) and that would likely mean diving deep...
[20:53:42] <bluss> yes
