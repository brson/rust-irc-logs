[00:15:50] <dbaupp> cmr: okay
[00:16:20] <cmr> I might write a dbus client and rewrite the profiler.
[00:16:32] <cmr> Considering how hacky it is it's been standing up pretty well.
[00:16:44] <cmr> It's not bad, just super memory efficient because that's what python makes easy
[00:17:07] <cmr> strcat: ping
[00:17:08] <strcat> cmr: just keep in mind that dbus is likely about to go through massive changes...
[00:17:25] <cmr> strcat: that'd make me happy, it's a steaming pile right now :D
[00:17:37] <strcat> systemd has a dbus client library now and the server is moving into the kernel as https://github.com/gregkh/kdbus

[00:17:56] <cmr> oh do they? that's nice.
[00:18:00] <cmr> I should probably watch systemd closer.
[00:18:09] <strcat> arch doesn't ship the header yet but you can still use it
[00:18:13] <cmr> Anyway, I pinged you to ask how to setup rust-playpen
[00:19:02] <strcat> cmr: http://cgit.freedesktop.org/systemd/systemd/tree/src/systemd/sd-bus.h
[00:19:09] <strcat> cmr: playpen is in the official arch repos
[00:19:12] <strcat> cmr: install that
[00:19:26] <cmr> I cloned the repo and ran init.sh but rustc won't run when I chroot, complains "task 'rustc' failed at 'can't determine value for sysroot', /build/rust-git/src/rust/src/librustc/metadata/filesearch.rs:171"
[00:19:50] <strcat> ummm
[00:20:04] <strcat> that sounds like /proc isn't being mounted by playpen... which should be happening
[00:20:16] <cmr> oh hm
[00:20:22] <cmr> yeah I was doing it wrong :p
[00:21:18] <strcat> alright
[00:21:21] <cmr> `sudo playpen root-master /irc.sh --syscalls-file=whitelist` does that look right?
[00:21:34] <strcat> cmr: look at what web.py does
[00:21:39] <cmr> ok
[00:21:42] <strcat> need to allow urandom 
[00:21:50] <strcat> it has a device whitelist based on mknod ids
[00:21:58] <cmr> ah ok

[00:22:30] <strcat> cmr: when arch finally ships a kernel with CLONE_NEWUSER it won't need sudo ;p
[00:22:58] <strcat> I need to switch it to using the systemd cgroup API too
[00:23:02] <strcat> the old way is deprecated
[00:23:17] <strcat> not just on systemd systems - /sys/fs/cgroup/ is deprecated in the kernel
[00:23:26] <strcat> at least as it is atm
[00:28:08] <jack> cmr: are you going to update that rustdoc pkgid PR? acrichto said he was blocked on that.
[00:28:23] <cmr> oh, I didn't realize it rotted
[00:31:36] <cmr> jack: updated, r?
[00:39:42] <strcat> so I finally figured out the answer to 'unlock and signal, or signal and unlock?' ;p
[00:39:45] <strcat> on linux at least
[00:40:17] <strcat> unlocking after is never less efficient *on linux* because signalling just moves the woken thread to the mutex wait queue
[00:41:01] <strcat> and unlocking first can cause priority inversion which will piss off people using it for real-time stuff ;p
[00:41:20] *** Joins: jensnockert (jensnocker@moz-7DC16A5F.afb.bredband2.com)
[00:41:20] <strcat> + can be less efficient... with some 3 thread race situation that's probably never going to happen much
[00:45:53] <cmr> so... it seems rustc gets hung in a pthread_join, but there are no other threads according to gdb.
[00:46:39] <strcat> undefined behaviour
[00:46:42] <strcat> \o/
[00:46:56] <strcat> cmr: it probably did something bad leading up to that
[00:47:08] <strcat> libuv doesn't check error codes *all over the place* and rust is the same way...
[00:47:16] <cmr> sigh
[00:47:17] <strcat> although rust isn't as bad now as it was
[00:47:31] <strcat> I find lots of bugs that way with seccomp
[00:47:37] <strcat> can make syscalls return error codes arbitrarily
[00:47:47] <strcat> if they aren't whitelisted
[00:47:55] <strcat> and no one ever checks ;\
[00:47:59] <strcat> it's not really specific to rust...
[00:49:39] <dbaupp> cmr: put #[no_uv] on driver/driver.rs
[00:51:52] <cmr> dbaupp: trying, but I'm not sure that's entirely it..
[00:52:01] <cmr> even with every syscall whitelisted it hangs.

[02:16:11] <Eridius> cmr: I got a tip the other day. The amount seemed to be worth something like 1 cent
[02:19:52] <strcat> someone gave me 5 dollars worth of bitcoins for doing the iterator stuff ;p
[02:20:11] * strcat is far too lazy to use them ;\
[02:20:27] <Eridius> bitcoin is interesting, but I personally think it's plagued with far too many problems to be truly practical
[02:20:34] <Eridius> and it's vastly overvalued right now
[02:20:50] <Eridius> That's why I use Dogecoin! http://dogecoin.org
[02:21:00] <strcat> it's not really overvalued. it has to have deflation over time
[02:21:13] <strcat> if it actually starts being used more, it will rise in value
[02:21:32] <strcat> Eridius: the total # of bitcoins is capped
[02:21:40] <strcat> and over time the amount mined drops
[02:21:56] <strcat> it's basically a pyramid scheme
[02:21:56] <Eridius> if anything that will encourage inflation, not deflation
[02:22:05] <strcat> how will that encourage inflation?
[02:22:09] <Eridius> especially as bitcoins slowly disappear into forgotten wallets and therefore are removed from the system
[02:22:13] <strcat> that's deflation
[02:22:30] <Eridius> it's only deflation if the demand for bitcoin stays at a static level
[02:22:44] <Eridius> anyway, this is wildly off-topic

[03:06:48] <Eridius> heck, maybe just remove #[link] from the set of known crate attributes

[03:08:50] <Eridius> although I guess it allows #[link] right now because it allows item attrs on crates. So I guess you can't just remoev it from there

[06:55:53] <dbaupp> brson: is there an issue for enabling gating on android bots? (currently IRFY has custom logic to ignore android failures when it handles the info from buildbot)
[06:56:49] <dbaupp> (and it would be good to get an automatic notification if/when this logic should be removed.)
[06:57:28] <brson> dbaupp: there isn't an issue yet, but i intend to turn on gating as soon as that builder is working correctly

[14:19:58] <ChrisMorgan> dbaupp: aw :-(
[14:20:05] <cmr> dbaupp: aren't you going to sleep? :P
[14:20:55] <ChrisMorgan> I wonder whether a member of the Rust team should email people like Gaetan, Liigo Zhuang and spir (just the three that spring most immediately to mind) and ask them to post a little less—that they're chiming in too quickly and accidentally causing trouble on the mailing list where they simply don't understand what they're saying fully. Of course, that's an *extremely* tricky thing to get right, especially if English is not the f
[14:21:12] <dbaupp> ChrisMorgan: (more seriously, unless `do` is outlawed in that PR, people will continue to land changes with `do` in them.)
[14:21:20] <mark_edward> hey with all the turmoil and problems with rustpkg  why not look at cabal for inspiration on functionality

[14:21:31] <dbaupp> cmr: glacially
[14:21:44] <ChrisMorgan> irst language of the recipient
[14:22:07] <cmr> ChrisMorgan: I think the better course of action is for someone to write a clear, concise, and correct explanation of why things are the way they are and why change is not very desirable
[14:22:44] <ChrisMorgan> dbaupp: I was surprised looking at it seeing where `do` was being used: invocations of things inside std::task (mostly spawn) and extra::future, and that's about it.
[14:22:45] <cmr> I don't think we should discourage honest discourse.
[14:23:02] <cmr> ChrisMorgan: well pcwalton removed a lot of it with closure reform too.
[14:23:15] <ChrisMorgan> Yes, now that it's proc() only it doesn't get used so much.
[14:24:46] <ChrisMorgan> Of that significant backlog of PRs of a couple of days, not one introduced new `do` or caused merge failure.
[14:25:04] <dbaupp> oh, I guess so
[14:25:26] <ChrisMorgan> dbaupp: yes, people may land new things using `do`, but I figured I might as well send that on its way to get confirmation that yes, this really is the direction we're wanting to head, while I do the rest.
[14:36:14] <jack> did anyone else get spammed in rust with threats that +R and +M wouldn't stop the bots?
[14:36:24] <ChrisMorgan> Not I.
[14:36:37] <ChrisMorgan> Delightful.
[14:37:33] <cmr> +s is probably a good idea.
[14:37:36] <jack> The IRC netops did tell me #rust is now the biggest channel on the network
[14:37:49] <jack> does that make it hidden from /list?
[14:37:52] <cmr> yes
[14:38:18] <cmr> it also doesn't show up when you /whois people iirc, but that might have just been a different ircd
[14:38:36] <cmr> (unless you are also in that channel with them)
[14:39:53] <jack> for example: [b]ebek17> Needless to me + R + M will not work, do not open your jaw
[14:40:17] <cmr> Oh I also have queries off for non-registered
[14:40:20] <cmr> /umode +R
[14:41:11] <ChrisMorgan> cmr: do unregistered people get a warning that they couldn't send to you?
[14:41:16] <cmr> ChrisMorgan: I do not know.
[14:41:32] <cmr> nor do I particularly care, tbh! uninvited queries are rude ;p
[14:42:09] <cmr> jack: looks like +j will do join limiting, so the join/part floods will be stopped.
[14:42:21] <cmr> Maybe +f[1j]:1 ?
[14:42:28] <cmr> 1 join per second per user...
[14:42:39] <cmr> or actually
[14:42:45] <cmr> that seems to not be per user
[14:42:57] <cmr> maybe 10 per second is more reasonable.
[14:43:14] <cmr> (it makes the channel invite-only for a period of time)
[14:47:54] <jack> the bad part of using irc cloud is that hte client is usuable after an attack and there seems to be no way to mass delete the spammer windows :(
[14:48:15] <jack> it basically destroys firefox too, so i have to attempt recovery in chrome :(
[14:48:50] <ChrisMorgan> What, it can't cope with a few hundred extra tabs? (My Pidgin didn't either yesterday.)
[14:50:32] <jack> there not even tabs. just the list of query windows seems to be enough. loading each one takes 2 seconds with this many and so deleeting them is really painful.
[14:50:42] <jack> i spent at least 30 minutes recovering yesterday
[14:50:52] <jack> *sigh*
[14:51:31] <ChrisMorgan> Sounds like they probably have bad algorithms, maybe O(N²) or some such thing.
[14:51:47] <ChrisMorgan> Report it as a bug and see what they say!
[14:55:52] <ChrisMorgan> There, I've been distracted from going to bed for long enough. Far too long, actually. Goodnight, all.

[22:45:21] <strcat> [pid 23517] splice(8, NULL, 2, NULL, 8192, SPLICE_F_MOVE|SPLICE_F_NONBLOCK) = -1 EINVAL (Invalid argument)
[22:45:24] <strcat> that's still libuv afaict.
[22:45:32] <strcat> cmr: well libuv does plenty of invalid stuff
[22:45:38] <cmr> no, that's from playpen
[22:45:42] <cmr> it's playpen's splice
[22:45:44] * strcat shrugs
[22:46:12] <strcat> is it mad about the fd?
[22:46:17] <cmr> I think so yeah
[22:46:24] <strcat> but why
[22:46:41] <strcat> cmr: do you get that with other processes?
[22:46:42] <cmr> I wish I knew!
[22:46:45] <strcat> I mean... it works for other stuff
[22:46:50] <strcat> just not rust since a specific revision
[22:46:52] <cmr> no
[22:46:59] <cmr> well it didn't do that before for me either
[22:47:22] <strcat> well all I can say is that rust is doing something weird to stdin/stdout
[22:47:25] <cmr> anyway it's because the rustc libs are wrong anyway.
[22:47:32] <cmr> well it never go to that point, the linker was dying
[22:47:57] <cmr> does playpen pass through env vars?
[22:48:13] <strcat> no
[22:48:34] <strcat>         char *env[] = {path, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL};
[22:48:36] <strcat>         if ((asprintf(env + 1, "HOME=%s", pw.pw_dir) < 0 ||
[22:48:37] <strcat>              asprintf(env + 2, "USER=%s", username) < 0 ||
[22:48:39] <strcat>              asprintf(env + 3, "LOGNAME=%s", username) < 0)) {
[22:48:42] <strcat>             errx(1, "asprintf");
[22:48:43] <strcat>         }

[23:47:43] <ktt3ja> is encoding method attributes done in metadata::encoder or middle::astencode? https://github.com/mozilla/rust/blob/master/src/test/compile-fail/lint-stability.rs#L25
[23:48:05] <dbaupp> ktt3ja: probably the former
[23:48:36] <dbaupp> in theory it likely just needs an encode_attr(m.attrs) line somewhere
