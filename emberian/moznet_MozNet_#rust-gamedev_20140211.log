[01:18:37] <h3r3tic> 39-41 are slight bullshots, though, as they use time-averaged jittering for anti-aliasing. only works with a static camer. but hopefully it's going to look this anti-aliased when I implement SMAA :)

[01:20:35] <h3r3tic> well it would be called just precomputation or baking. or lightmaps, or light probes, or IBLs :)
[01:20:38] <h3r3tic> but all the lighting is dynamic
[01:21:05] <photex> even awesomer
[01:21:15] <h3r3tic> the reflections are done via SSR and a single cube map
[01:21:29] <photex> that was my next question
[01:21:35] <photex> HDRs?
[01:21:38] <h3r3tic> for the cube-map I pre-render its G-Buffer, and then light it at runtime
[01:22:17] <h3r3tic> HDR, yeah. with exponentia/photographic tone mapping and some subtle-ish glare
[01:22:21] <h3r3tic> exponential*
[01:22:34] <photex> awesome. 
[01:22:44] <h3r3tic> here's a (slightly dated now) video: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1267818/rust/008.mkv
[01:23:23] <h3r3tic> this one doesn't have FXAA though, so it's a bit aliasy. I've also improved the reflections a bit since
[01:24:19] <cmr> h3r3tic: how long does it take you to pound out this stuff?
[01:24:39] <h3r3tic> difficult to masure, as I'm doing it after hours, very much on a whim
[01:25:07] <h3r3tic> but let's see, the first screenshot: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1267818/rust/001.png is dated for the 22nd of september 2013.
[01:25:22] <cmr> well I mean in general
[01:25:32] <h3r3tic> um? xD
[01:25:40] <cmr> like, I've just watched someone spend two hours in the CS labs trying to make diffuse shading work.
[01:25:50] <h3r3tic> oh
[01:25:52] <cmr> s/shading/lighting/
[01:26:09] <h3r3tic> well, once you get yourself some sort of a framework ( the proverbial "black traingle" ), it's much easier
[01:26:26] <h3r3tic> e.g. I made myself a data-driven post-processing pipeline, and a high-ish level wrapper over the API
[01:26:52] <h3r3tic> so I can add stuff like SSAO or chromatic aberration without touching a single line of Rust code, just in the JSON config and GLSL shaders
[01:27:00] <h3r3tic> and with live shader reload, iteration is really quick
[01:27:23] <photex> h3r3tic: help me out with some terminology if you would: g-buffer is what we call an AOV in vfx/animation right?
[01:27:30] <h3r3tic> yup
[01:27:30] <photex> AOV == Alternate Output Value
[01:27:35] <photex> ok cool
[01:27:43] <h3r3tic> in my case, normals, albedo, glossiness, depth
[01:27:46] <photex> so it's just another render target?
[01:27:52] <h3r3tic> a few targets, yeah
[01:28:02] <photex> do those get written in one draw call?
[01:28:05] <h3r3tic> so having these pre-rendered for the cube-map, at runtime I can just do the lighting without re-rendering the scene
[01:28:09] <h3r3tic> yeah
[01:28:56] <photex> are they high resolution?
[01:28:56] <h3r3tic> something like https://gist.github.com/h3r2tic/0458c6ca660e3341fd07 :)
[01:29:09] <h3r3tic> the cube map is 256x256x6
[01:29:15] <h3r3tic> the screen 1280x800
[01:30:12] <h3r3tic> I'm planning to have lots of these cube-maps, with dynamically decided resolutions based on the distance to the camera
[01:30:21] <photex> that's really cool
[01:30:32] <h3r3tic> thanks ;D
[01:31:16] <photex> I was thinking about baking things to vertex attributes... but this just seems so much better
[01:31:20] <h3r3tic> thanks to the wonders of modern GPUs I can create an array of some 1000 cube maps, but only commit memory to a fraction :D
[01:31:50] <h3r3tic> oh, baking certainly does have its uses. it's typically much cheaper for runtime use :)
[01:32:15] <h3r3tic> at work we bake some crazy data which allows us to do radiosity in real-time on the 360 and PS3 :D
[01:32:24] <photex> neeeeeeeeeeto
[01:32:33] <h3r3tic> but of course that impacts your iteration speed
[01:33:11] * photex wishes some of these techniques would make their way into vfx and animation
[01:33:44] <h3r3tic> hah, yeah the render times in offline stuff can be crazy
[01:33:46] <photex> offline renderers are expensive and the feedback loop is atrocious
[01:33:59] <photex> the memory usage is astronomical too
[01:34:00] <h3r3tic> but they are slowly making their way, e.g. CryEngine has this whole CinemaBox going
[01:34:05] <h3r3tic> yeah :S
[01:34:39] <photex> back in the day people used to do all manner of hack to get shots going and looking good
[01:35:09] <photex> these days studios see it as a liability to do anything other than glue maya to X
[01:35:17] <h3r3tic> lol
[01:35:22] <photex> where X is Arnold or Renderman
[01:35:25] <h3r3tic> please don't let X be Mental Ray
[01:35:28] <h3r3tic> oof ;D
[01:35:30] <photex> lol used to be
[01:35:40] <photex> we're a Renderman shop
[01:35:47] <photex> but we use some Mantra for fx work
[01:35:49] <h3r3tic> Arnold is quite neat, but I thought it was faster than it is :S
[01:35:53] <photex> omg o
[01:35:55] <photex> no*
[01:36:02] <photex> it's incredibly slow
[01:36:05] <h3r3tic> it doesn't even bidirectional :<
[01:36:13] <photex> you have to tune the living hell out of it for every shot
[01:36:16] <h3r3tic> haha
[01:36:19] <h3r3tic> sounds like Mental Ray
[01:36:24] <photex> it's amazing anybody gets work done
[01:36:34] <photex> Sony really dialed it in
[01:36:41] <photex> so much R&D time
[01:36:50] <photex> which leads to the "make it awesome" button
[01:36:54] <h3r3tic> they're making job positions for people who just tune it all day xD
[01:37:00] <photex> most places don't have that kind of time or money
[01:37:06] <h3r3tic> hah
[01:37:30] <h3r3tic> do other places even use OSL with it?
[01:37:30] <photex> bah, anyway, hooray for your work here!
[01:37:40] <h3r3tic> tnx \o/
[01:37:45] <photex> no show I've worked on that used Arnold used OSL
[01:37:50] <h3r3tic> D:
[01:37:52] <h3r3tic> THE HORROR
[01:37:54] <photex> which was only one
[01:37:56] <photex> heh
[01:37:58] <h3r3tic> haha
[01:38:02] <photex> so hardly an appropriate sample size
[01:38:05] <h3r3tic> mm
[01:38:12] <h3r3tic> but I thought the two were made for each other D:
[01:38:18] <photex> kinda?
[01:38:34] <photex> I mean, for the most part Arnold is ready to go
[01:38:34] <h3r3tic> OSL seems so awesome
[01:38:41] <photex> you need to build so much around it though
[01:38:42] <h3r3tic> mm
[01:39:02] <h3r3tic> so that's how Sony have their edge :P
[01:39:07] <photex> I think so
[01:39:26] <photex> it seems more common to treat it similar to Vray which was used a lot at the last place I worked
[01:39:50] <photex> you're mostly just relying on material definitions
[01:40:01] <h3r3tic> heh, sounds like the game industry tbh :
[01:40:02] <h3r3tic> :P
[01:40:21] <photex> hhe
[01:40:45] <h3r3tic> how do you make crazy stuff like the skin of Croc from Spiderman without crazy amounts of OSL?
[01:40:55] <photex> procedurals
[01:41:13] <h3r3tic> and just bake it down into simple material descriptions?

[01:44:19] <photex> alembic is based on hdf5
[01:44:24] <photex> which is a great project
[01:44:40] <h3r3tic> hm, haven't heard of HDF5
[01:45:10] <photex> I'm going to make a rust binding
[01:45:35] <photex> not for alembic, just hdf5
[01:45:44] <photex> alembic is a wash of boost and templates
[01:46:35] <h3r3tic> "HDF5 is a data model, library, and file format for storing and managing data. It supports an unlimited variety of datatypes, and is designed for flexible and efficient I/O and for high volume and complex data. "  :o
[01:46:39] <h3r3tic> so not just voxels
[01:46:41] <h3r3tic> curious
[01:46:57] <photex> OpenVDB isn't hdf5 based actually
[01:47:03] <h3r3tic> mm
[01:47:11] <h3r3tic> so what kind of data do you store in HDF5?
[01:47:39] <photex> whatever you want
[01:47:49] <h3r3tic> MUDKIPZ!
[01:47:52] <h3r3tic> O___O
[01:47:57] <photex> alembic defines a protocol over hdf5
[01:48:15] <h3r3tic> yeah, but what kind of data do you store in it, e.g. at your studio? :D
[01:48:20] <photex> so you can use it to store specific data like OpenVDB or OpenEXR content
[01:48:34] <photex> alembic is typically just geometry
[01:48:37] <photex> polygonal geometry
[01:48:51] <h3r3tic> millions and millions?
[01:48:53] <photex> with point deltas for deforming shapes
[01:48:58] <h3r3tic> nice :D
[01:48:58] <photex> and xforms
[01:49:19] <photex> a single file can represent an entire shot heirarchy
[01:49:28] <photex> or just a single character
[01:49:49] <h3r3tic> that's pretty neat. wish I had access to such crazy data :D
[01:50:25] <h3r3tic> so very often rendering is all about proper acquired data :S
[01:50:29] <h3r3tic> e.g. this stuff: http://gl.ict.usc.edu/Research/Microgeometry/
[01:50:45] <h3r3tic> 16k x 16k displacement maps for bloody pores   @__@
[01:52:02] <photex> yeah, but then it has to be art directed so artists still have to take it and do all manner of work to it
[01:52:12] <h3r3tic> sure :)
[01:52:19] <photex> Benjamin Button and Tron did something similar to this
[01:52:34] <photex> not nearly as detailed
[01:52:56] <photex> but the scans get used for target shapes and textures
