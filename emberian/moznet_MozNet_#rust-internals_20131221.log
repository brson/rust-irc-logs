[00:01:32] <acrichto> they're still in std::rt::util
[00:01:39] <brson> good
[00:01:50] <brson> that's my legacy
[00:01:51] <acrichto> oh I would never remove them

[00:02:12] <acrichto> I meant to remove that :\
[00:10:41] <brson> acrichto: what does the % in https://github.com/mozilla/rust/blob/master/mk/tests.mk#L918 mean?
[00:13:37] <ChrisMorgan> brson: wildcard
[00:13:57] <ChrisMorgan> And after the colon, % means the value which was matched.
[00:14:22] <ChrisMorgan> So you can have basic dependency rules like ``build/%: src/%.c src/%.h``
[00:14:46] <acrichto> brson: yeah it takes the value of the stuff that the rest of the pattern doesn't match
[00:14:57] <acrichto> which in this case is hopefully the name of the rmake test
