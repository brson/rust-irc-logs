[01:42:56] <Ilari> Apparently FrankenECDSA is totally incompatible, yet does not solve all the problems that can be easily solved.
[01:51:58] <Ilari> There are parts in cryptography that are extremely resource-intensive, like designing useful symmetric ciphers. And then there are relatively easy parts, like ECC curve selection and signature primitives.

[03:02:32] <||> Why not just standardize on y²=x³+486662x²+x
[03:06:59] <adu> ||: is that a name?
[03:07:22] <||> adu: curve25519
[03:07:48] <adu> I would never have known
[03:08:00] <adu> where is there an introduction to ECC?
[03:08:38] <adu> I think I've sufficiently understood AES and Whirlpool now
[03:12:57] <||> adu: I've just barely began to understand RSA as anything other than magic
[03:13:11] <adu> I still think RSA is magic
[03:13:53] <adu> also, I'm convinced that all hash algorithms are invertible
[03:13:55] <Tobba> adu: I think you might want to understand that first
[03:14:09] <Tobba> symmetric crypto has *very* little to do with asymmetric crypto
[03:14:25] <adu> I also understand that
[03:15:03] <adu> so RSA is asymetric
[03:15:12] <adu> and AES and RC4 are symmetric
[03:15:28] <adu> right?
[03:15:51] <||> I don't think hashes are really invertable 
[03:16:13] <||> you can find input that results in that output, but you cannot say it was the same input
[03:18:28] <eternaleye> adu: You can prove hash functions aren't invertible via the pigeonhole theorem
[03:18:29] <adu> ||: sure they are, take SHA-256 for example, fundamentally and mathematically, it's block function is a function from (H_0, W_0) -> (H_64, W_64), but it's the truncation and ommission of data to a function from (W_0) -> (H_64) that's non-invertible
[03:18:55] <eternaleye> adu: And it's neither truncation nor omission.
[03:19:18] <eternaleye> adu: Every bit of the input affects the output, which means it's not omission.
[03:19:44] <eternaleye> adu: And a number of hashes generate output by "folding" the state in on itself via xor or otherwise, not truncating it
[03:20:25] <adu> I agree that the complete SHA-256 is non-invertible
[03:21:45] <adu> but, for example, given a list of all intermediate hash values, the message can be trivally recomputed
[03:22:23] <eternaleye> adu: That's kind of how attacks on hashes work, yes.
[03:22:58] <eternaleye> adu: Symmetric crypto is based on *infeasible*, not *impossible*
[03:23:47] <eternaleye> adu: If the effort needed to recover those intermediate states (or trace differentials through, or whatever technique is used) is greater than the effort to brute-force, the hash is very secure indeed.
[03:23:58] <adu> and isn't giving H_64 instead of all intermediate hash values a form of "omission"?
[03:24:15] <eternaleye> adu: No, because the output still depends on all bits of the message
[03:24:34] <||> eternaleye: what about collisions?
[03:25:04] <eternaleye> ||: If they can be efficiently computed then it's a problem, but collision/preimage/second preimage are hard for the same reasons
[03:25:50] <eternaleye> ||: For a good hash function, finding collisions by brute-force is faster than the state-of-the-art "clever" methods
[03:26:04] <eternaleye> ||: As state of the art advances, that ceases to be true
[03:26:19] <eternaleye> ||: And then you switch to new hash functions, designed to avoid _those_ attacks too
[03:28:34] <eternaleye> ||: Of course, if true one-way functions exist, one could use those and be _sure_ it's not invertible - but that requires (and would prove) that P != NP
[03:29:10] <Ilari> ||: The problem with y²=x³+486662x²+x (mod 2^255-19) for signatures is that calculating the double scalar multiplication for signature verification is somewhat nasty.
[03:29:15] <eternaleye> ||: And such a thing would likely be pretty darn slow anyway, as crypto based on hard math tends to be (compare RSA or even ECC against AES or Chacha or SHA-256)
[03:31:09] <Tobba> is it actually possible to prove a hash function doesn't leak any information about its input (assuming no inputs and their outputs are known)?
[03:31:39] <lahwran> I think if that had ever been proven, we wouldn't be wondering about sha-256 still
[03:32:28] <lahwran> I mean, it's trivially possible to throw away enough data that you don't leak any information about the input, but also doing that while being completely unpredictable statistically?
[03:32:30] <||> what are your opinions on NTRU?
[03:32:49] <adu> Tobba: I think it's easier to disprove than to prove
[03:32:56] <Tobba> lahwran: I think there are some theorems within mathematical logic that help with this
[03:32:59] <Tobba> adu: well no shit
[03:33:28] <lahwran> Tobba: I don't think there has been any meta-proof that it's provable, either
[03:34:13] <Tobba> if the provability of hash functions is unprovable then well

[03:34:57] <lahwran> wait, if aes isn't based on hard math, what is it based on, eternaleye?
[03:35:47] <Tobba> I'm not sure if I would classify "shuffle shit around so hard noone has ever figured out a way to unfuck" it goes under hard math
[03:35:59] <Tobba> under hard math*
[03:36:25] <Tobba> I think I'm a bit tired
[03:36:49] <lahwran> I'm a bit of a noob here
[03:36:54] <lahwran> I don't actually know how aes works
[03:37:37] <Tobba> I think symmetrical crypto would be way harder to prove than asymmetrical crypto
[03:38:14] <Tobba> symmetrical crypto usually depends on a whole lot of operations that come together to be really tough to do backwards
[03:38:22] <adu> Tobba: I wouldn't classify AES as hard, except perhaps the S-box
[03:38:29] <Tobba> asymmetrical is usually based around a single problem
[03:38:37] <eternaleye> lahwran: AES is based on avoiding the known attacks.
[03:38:43] <eternaleye> lahwran: As is most symmetric crypto.
[03:39:19] <Tobba> (i.e discrete logarithm problem, diffie-hellman problem, elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem, etc)
[03:39:32] <eternaleye> Tobba: proving a hash function is truly one-way would net you a million dollars, and probably a professorship or two.
[03:39:41] <eternaleye> Tobba: Because you'd have proved P != NP
[03:39:56] <Tobba> oh yeah
[03:40:02] <Tobba> I forgot about that one
[03:41:04] <eternaleye> Tobba: And yeah, I classify symmetric crypto design under "hard engineering", not "hard math"
[03:41:21] <eternaleye> Tobba: The former means it's built to withstand the shit we know might happen
[03:41:24] <Tobba> I guess you could write a proof under the assumption that P != NP
[03:41:41] <eternaleye> Tobba: The latter means it's built on a problem we know isn't getting solved soon
[03:41:56] <Tobba> true
[03:42:03] <Tobba> but so is most symmetrical crypto anyways
[03:42:04] <lahwran> that sounds like it has implications about the long-term security of symmetric vs assymetric
[03:42:07] <Tobba> proof is better than no proof
[03:42:28] <eternaleye> lahwran: Sort of? The same is true of asymmetric, in reality.
[03:42:35] <||> https://tbuktu.github.io/ntru/
[03:42:39] <Tobba> plus P = NP would have such fucked up implications crypto would be irrelevant
[03:42:40] <eternaleye> lahwran: We don't know there's no efficient factoring algorithm
[03:42:51] <eternaleye> lahwran: We just know we haven't found it yet.
[03:43:11] <lahwran> Tobba: stranger discoveries have been made before
[03:43:31] <Tobba> lahwran: it has *really* fucked up implications
[03:43:34] <eternaleye> Tobba: Like automated theorem discovereres?
[03:43:36] <Tobba> especially in conjunction with physics
[03:43:47] <Tobba> eternaleye: and especially that
[03:43:55] <lahwran> Tobba: um, in conjunction with physics?
[03:44:02] <eternaleye> Tobba: Yeah, that one's a bit scary.
[03:44:02] <Tobba> lahwran: QM goes haywire if P = NP iirc
[03:44:12] <adu> ||: that's cool
[03:44:19] <lahwran> "haywire"?
[03:44:41] <lahwran> Tobba: I mean, it's possible that if P = NP, then that means QM is wrong
[03:44:53] <lahwran> and I mean
[03:44:56] <lahwran> QM is wrong, we already know that
[03:45:21] <eternaleye> lahwran: QM is _incomplete_
[03:45:29] <eternaleye> lahwran: That doesn't make it _wrong_
[03:45:29] <Tobba> IIRC there was some problem with information, since thats what it's all really about
[03:45:36] <lahwran> eternaleye: I suppose that depends on what you mean by "wrong"
[03:45:37] <eternaleye> lahwran: Subtle but important distinction.
[03:45:57] <eternaleye> Tobba: That reminds me, did you see the news about the no-hair theorem?
[03:46:09] <Tobba> I think so?
[03:46:11] <lahwran> that sounds interesting
[03:46:21] <Tobba> I remember someone proving it
[03:46:33] <Tobba> actually wait, that was another theorem
[03:46:35] <eternaleye> http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/04/150402132708.htm
[03:46:37] <Tobba> so I guess I didn't
[03:46:47] <Ilari> lahwran: What's incompatible in QM with P=NP?
[03:46:59] <lahwran> I don't know
[03:47:05] <lahwran> Tobba is the one who made that claim
[03:47:14] <Tobba> yeah I'm trying to find something on that
[03:47:37] <lahwran> I was just commenting that a possible consequence is that QM is more incorrect than we thought - rather than it having weird implications about the universe
[03:48:00] <lahwran> in a fitness sense of "incorrect", because apparently physics science doesn't like to call it "incorrect"
[03:48:31] <lahwran> which seems odd to me, because of course no model of the universe is correct until we have a perfect one, but w/e
[03:48:51] <eternaleye> lahwran: Incomplete means that there are cases it doesn't cover; incorrect means it gives wrong results for cases it does
[03:49:23] <eternaleye> lahwran: it's _known_ to be incomplete, due to a lack of a theorem of quantum gravity
[03:49:23] <lahwran> a "correct" theory would mean science is done finding out the rules, we can go home and see what we can build with the rules now
[03:49:35] <eternaleye> lahwran: No, that's a _complete_ one.
[03:49:43] <eternaleye> lahwran: Moreover, a complete correct one.
[03:49:55] <Tobba> it seems that if P =/= NP a bunch of stuff makes more sense, but it doesn't have any serious implications if N = NP
[03:49:57] <Tobba> I think
[03:50:09] <Tobba> I can't remember my quantum mechanics too well
[03:50:22] <Tobba> but the theorem proving is really the scary the part of P = NP
[03:50:24] <eternaleye> lahwran: You know the difference between accuracy and precision?
[03:50:28] <eternaleye> lahwran: This is like that.
[03:50:30] <Tobba> P = NP*
[03:50:42] <eternaleye> Tobba: Theorem _discovery_
[03:50:44] <lahwran> certainly, and I'm still unconvinced
[03:50:49] <Tobba> eternaleye: right
[03:51:12] <eternaleye> lahwran: Just because a tarp only covers a 10' by 10' square, doesn't mean it has holes in it.
[03:51:22] <lahwran> but QM *does* cover all of physics
[03:51:28] <eternaleye> lahwran: It does, however, mean you need a bigger tarp to cover your whole house.
[03:51:37] <lahwran> or well
[03:51:41] <lahwran> no, that's not quite right
[03:51:59] <lahwran> but it overlaps with another tarp, and that part is all crumpled up
[03:52:09] <adu> wait, QM proves P = NP? what?
[03:52:17] <lahwran> adu: what no
[03:52:26] <lahwran> P = NP was commented to have implications for QM
[03:52:28] <lahwran> not the other way around
[03:52:40] <adu> oh

[04:33:53] <bascule> lol
[04:34:58] <adu> I had a chat with someone about adding Klingon to Unicode
[04:35:40] *** Quits: erickt (erickt@moz-njt.vqi.14.76.IP) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[04:36:27] <adu> and it didn't go well, because the official writing system is Latin, not what you see on ST
[04:37:54] <DarkFox> Would it be worth adding a #[no_copy] attribute for things like keys and plaintexts that should not be copied - while they should be sodium_mlock'd?
[04:40:01] <||> DarkFox: a #[mlock] would be a nice attribute
[04:40:02] <eternaleye> adu: Personally, I want the Tengwar in unicode - I mean, the shape of the letters (stem alignment, bow structure, etc) is directly correlated to how the sound is formed (palatal, aspirated, etc)
[04:40:06] <eternaleye> adu: Perfect for conlangs.
[04:40:13] <eternaleye> adu: No phonetic drift!
[04:40:46] <adu> eternaleye: that might actually happen, since that is the official writing system of something
[04:40:58] <eternaleye> adu: Already rejected, IIRC.
[04:41:35] <adu> eternaleye: although, I think Tengwar was the writing system of "Common", and Runes were the writing system of Elvish, iirc
[04:41:58] <adu> or was it the other way around?
[04:42:23] <eternaleye> adu: Well, it depends on what you mean by "elvish"
[04:42:34] <eternaleye> adu: Do you mean Sindarin, or Quenya, or the Black Speech, or..
[04:42:54] <adu> *mind blown*
[04:42:54] <eternaleye> adu: Tolkien didn't just make languages; he made language _families_
[04:43:16] <eternaleye> adu: Like how French is one of the Romance languages, and so is Italian
[04:43:39] <eternaleye> adu: (Note: I speak _none_ of the variants of Elvish)
[04:44:02] <eternaleye> adu: (I only know this because the Tengwar caught my interest when I saw an orthography for Lojban using them)
[04:44:10] <eternaleye> adu: (Note: I also do not speak Lojban)
[04:44:10] <adu> you just wanted to blow my mind, what do you take me for? a conjueror of cheap tricks?
[04:44:46] <eternaleye> adu: As any fan will tell you, fiction is srs bsns :P
[04:45:13] <adu> my cousin speaks it
[04:45:24] <eternaleye> adu: Oh, hey: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tengwar#Unicode
[04:45:30] <eternaleye> adu: Looks like it moved forward!
[04:45:38] <eternaleye> >> The codepoints are subject to change; the range U+016080 to U+0160FF in the SMP is tentatively allocated for tengwar according to the current Unicode roadmap.
[04:45:48] <adu> he tried to tell me that "no", "off", "wrong", and "false" were all the same word
[04:49:43] <adu> eternaleye: yo, that proposal was made in 1997
[04:50:23] <adu> it still says "Status: Proposal" in 2015, wtf unicode consortium
[04:50:36] <eternaleye> adu: Key word. 'consortium'
[04:50:41] <eternaleye> adu: Committee-time.

[04:54:19] <adu> I can see how a business man levitating and a pile of poo is more important than the greatest high fantasy every written
[04:54:57] <adu> but it just feels wrong
[04:55:29] <DarkFox> ||: My point for disallowing copying is as the copy would need to either inherit the mlock or be illegal.
[04:59:21] <eternaleye> ||: Why on earth would you need an #[mlock] attribute? Just define an Mlocked<T>() with a destructor that un-mlocks, Deref/DerefMut Target=T, and a constructor mlock<T>( T ) -> Mlocked<T> that uses a little unsafe { } bit to mlock the thing.
[05:00:08] <DarkFox> ...
[05:00:15] <DarkFox> eternaleye: Damn rust is amazing :P
[05:00:33] <adu> eternaleye: by destructor, do you mean a Drop impl?
[05:00:41] <eternaleye> adu: Ah, yes
[05:00:43] <DarkFox> adu: Yes
[05:00:51] <eternaleye> adu: Was doing C++ at work today, so the language is in my head
[05:01:54] <eternaleye> ||, DarkFox: However, for key storage, there's a lot more than just mlocking
[05:02:01] <DarkFox> Anyone here have thoughts for sodiumoxide? Appears to provide a _different_ interface to nacl/libsodium, and lacks things like sodium_mlock/munlock and sodium_malloc.
[05:02:03] <eternaleye> ||, DarkFox: I'd suggest looking up TARS

[05:05:25] <DarkFox> (No disks; just 8G ram)
[05:06:12] <||> DarkFox: host node has no disks either, or only guest is diskless?

[05:07:11] <eternaleye> DarkFox: if you have x11 forwarding
[05:07:29] <DarkFox> Fair point

[05:08:52] <eternaleye> DarkFox: Incidentally, why the VM?
[05:09:03] <eternaleye> DarkFox: Why not just a chroot?
[05:09:05] <DarkFox> I might need to do a reboot; and then I'd have to set my environment back up (no disks; and only cached packages and encrypted archive of base configs)
[05:09:30] <eternaleye> DarkFox: mkdir /mnt/foo; mount -o bind / /mnt/foo
[05:09:36] <DarkFox> eternaleye: Alpine uses pax; the pax is old; rust depends on the newer pax - and glibc - so ... arch chroot was nice but pax killed rust :P
[05:09:54] <eternaleye> DarkFox: Tar up /mnt/foo to server, curl | tar on boot
[05:10:24] <DarkFox> Couldn't use paxctl against it due to rust having something that depends on the same bits that pax replaces.

[05:10:54] <DarkFox> eternaleye: Did it use pax? :P
[05:11:00] <eternaleye> DarkFox: Nope. It was a plain gentoo installcd
[05:11:04] <DarkFox> Nice
[05:11:06] <eternaleye> DarkFox: But no pax, admittedly
[05:11:13] <DarkFox> ^ That helps for rust :D
[05:11:19] <DarkFox> Actually; gentoo's pax should be fine
[05:11:27] <DarkFox> That is up to date
[05:11:28] <eternaleye> DarkFox: And I had disks, but couldn't use them,  since I was trying to fix them (fried btrfs)
[05:11:40] <DarkFox> ...

[05:12:16] <eternaleye> DarkFox: Huh, if you want to /query me I can try and help
[05:12:40] <eternaleye> DarkFox: I've got at least five btrfs recoveries under my belt :P
[05:12:56] <DarkFox> I'm really just testing my dependancies; I've backed up lots of things from that btrfs system for in-case-i-need. While running ramdisk to see what I do really need.
[05:13:02] <eternaleye> Mm
[05:13:13] <eternaleye> DarkFox: have a go at Exherbo, maybe :P
[05:13:21] <DarkFox> When I'm happy with my dependancies - then I'll purge that corrupted btfs installation.
[05:13:25] <eternaleye> DarkFox: ...though maybe wait a week, we just did a huge change

[05:13:59] <DarkFox> Good luck with that.. :D
[05:14:08] <eternaleye> DarkFox: Er, we _did_ it
[05:14:23] <eternaleye> DarkFox: It's been in dev for 3 years, and we did the final tuning over March
[05:14:40] <DarkFox> Speaking of linux systems; I might have to end up switching to gentoo (alpine is great, but not _quite_ ready for me).

[05:15:15] <eternaleye> DarkFox: I haven't used Gentoo in yeaaaars.
[05:15:16] <DarkFox> What is your Exherbo based from?
[05:15:26] * DarkFox yet to use gentoo _ever_.
[05:15:26] <eternaleye> DarkFox: Exherbo is based on Exherbo
[05:15:45] <DarkFox> Sounds like an -ng ?
[05:15:51] <eternaleye> DarkFox: Though it has some rough similarities to Gentoo, it's package format is different, it has different features, it uses Paludis and not Portage...
[05:16:01] <eternaleye> *its
[05:16:37] <eternaleye> DarkFox: Funtoo is more of an -ng on Gentoo
[05:16:54] <eternaleye> DarkFox: Exherbo takes a different approach, and has a different underlying philosophy
[05:16:56] <DarkFox> I forgot my fbsd was tor - hello capcha hell :P
[05:18:07] <DarkFox> eternaleye: Do you use pax with exherbo?

[05:23:18] <||> eternaleye: I thought pauldis implemented a different EAPI which was like an evolution of the ones in portage (also, doesn't pauldis support some gentoo eapis?)
[05:25:31] <eternaleye> ||: Paludis supports multiple EAPIs (and is in-progress on some entirely different package formats, like rubygems and cabal)
[05:25:59] <eternaleye> ||: but Exheres is pretty divergent from Ebuild, and Ebuild is... not going to work on Exherbo.

[05:30:32] <eternaleye> ||: In-progress.
[05:30:58] <eternaleye> ||: Currently, the gems support requires manually fetching the json data, and is metadata-showing only - not installing

[21:16:33] <eternaleye> One thing I think might be really nice is using Stellar on the "backhaul" so to speak, and an E-cash system (in the line of Chaum) for user-level spending.
[21:17:01] <eternaleye> There's a new E-cash paper on iacr, in fact
[21:17:14] <eternaleye> https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/300
[21:17:37] <eternaleye> Efficient, unlinkable, and in the standard model :D
[21:29:44] <eternaleye> ...huh, I think Stellar's SCP protocol is turing-complete.
[21:31:25] <eternaleye> Since the "quorum slices" thing is analogous to disjunctive normal form, and the network as a whole is recursively structured.
[21:32:47] <eternaleye> With the result that so far as I can tell, one could express arbitrary boolean statements with it.
[21:42:46] <bascule> hahaha
[21:43:05] <bascule> eternaleye: I did read that, and quoted him earlier!

[22:20:00] <eternaleye> bascule: Ooooh, the note about certificate transparency in §6.3 of the Stellar paper caught my attention
[22:20:23] <bascule> orly
[22:20:25] <bascule> I didn't see that
[22:20:34] <bascule> I kinda want to build a CT log server
[22:20:37] <bascule> for internal use here
[22:20:46] <bascule> like any time our internal CAs mint certs, report them to the log server
[22:20:59] <bascule> and then our internal tools can audit certs in production and spot ones that aren't in the audit log
[22:21:14] <eternaleye> For example, in a payment network, slots might be ⟨ account , serial number ⟩ pairs, where serial numbers are consecutive integers and ballots must be signed by the account holder. Such a scheme totally orders all payments from a particular account, but not across accounts. As long as each account holder signs only one ballot per serial number, there is no possibility of preemption by conflicting values. Should an account holder lose 
[22:21:15] <eternaleye> state and accidentally duplicate a serial number, the person can easily recover by signing a higher ballot number that subsumes one of the existing ballots. Such an approach also works for some certificate transparency applications, when each namespace authority has an independent history.
[22:21:22] <eternaleye> p. 30
[22:21:44] <bascule> o_O
[22:21:51] <bascule> I don't know how CT handles reused serial numbers offhand
[22:22:12] <eternaleye> bascule: >> Should an account holder lose state and accidentally duplicate a serial number, the person can easily recover by signing a higher ballot number that subsumes one of the existing ballots. 
[22:22:14] <Ilari> Reused certificate sequence numbers? Or some other sequence number?
[22:22:28] <eternaleye> bascule: :D
[22:22:50] <eternaleye> bascule: It's an _efficiency_ win (guaranteeing timely forward progress)
[22:22:55] <eternaleye> bascule: It's correct regardless
[22:25:35] <bascule> Ilari: reused certificate sequence numbers in the context of a CT log
[22:25:59] <Ilari> bascule: AFAIK, X.509 just says that can't happen, so...
[22:26:12] <eternaleye> bascule: and honestly, the main point is that with SCP, one can do tuple tricks like (issuer, hash-of-cert) or whatever.
[22:26:14] <bascule> yeaaaaah
[22:26:34] <eternaleye> bascule: So serial repeating doesn't have to be a part of it because the serial doesn't have to be the key
[22:26:48] <eternaleye> (key in the sense of 'lookup key' or 'primary key')
[22:27:18] <eternaleye> bascule: What on earth is the serial actually good for?
[22:28:25] <Ilari> Apparently CT has its own serial number in log too... Those are assigned in append order.
[22:28:27] <bascule> they seem good for bookkeeping. I don't know beyond that, perhaps Ilari has an opinion
[22:28:30] <bascule> aah
[22:29:18] <eternaleye> Ilari: bascule: That'd be analogous to the "slot" in SCP
[22:30:01] <eternaleye> bascule: Generally speaking, distributed consensus is _all about_ bookkeeping :P
[22:30:23] <bascule> heh
[22:30:48] <eternaleye> bascule: I mean, one can trivially model CT as basically keeping books on outstanding loans.
[22:31:28] <Ilari> Reminds me of certain IETF WG that works mostly on protocol that does distributed consensus among routers about network (without much configuration and has to deal with loops and such).
[22:31:52] <eternaleye> Ilari: OSPF, or RIP, or the mesh folks, or...?
[22:32:55] <eternaleye> Ilari: (Because we all know: the IETF will never make one WG when three can be justified)
[22:33:10] <eternaleye> Ilari: See also: HIP vs LISP vs SHIM6 vs...
[22:33:33] <eternaleye> Oh, and Mobile IPv6! Can't forget that!
[22:33:58] <Ilari> Actually, there are now 2 WGs on that. :-)
[22:34:16] <Tobba> is a working group on mobile IPv6 even necessary?
[22:34:29] <Tobba> isn't it just "beat someone with a stick until they add support"
[22:35:40] <Ilari> eternaleye: Actually, it is good bit more than routing (in a pinch, one could even build not optimal but working route tables out of exchanged config data).
[22:36:48] <eternaleye> Tobba: Mobile IPv6 != IPv6 on mobile devices
[22:37:20] <eternaleye> Tobba: Mobile IPv6 is about keeping your IP address as you change (physical and topological) network location, with stuff still being routed to you.
[22:37:31] <Tobba> oh, fun
[22:37:53] <eternaleye> Tobba: IMO, it's a horrendous layering violation and HIP is a vastly better approach
[22:39:50] <Ilari> Then there's the fun of IPv6 routing. It just does not scale.
[22:40:55] <eternaleye> Ilari: Which part of IPv6 routing?
[22:41:05] <Ilari> The routing decisions.
[22:41:09] <eternaleye> Ilari: There are subsets that do scale, and features that don't.
[22:41:51] <Ilari> (Received a packet destined to X, to which port it is to be forwarded?)
[22:43:09] <Tobba> does IPv6 suffer from horrible amounts of second system syndrome?
[22:44:24] <Ilari> On wire level, the extension model is pretty horrible.
[22:45:21] <Ilari> It is not designed with ASICs in mind, and as consequence, doesn't perform that well.
[22:45:26] <Tobba> and/or horrible feature creep
[22:46:02] <Ilari> The other problem is that really important features are missing...
[22:46:06] <bascule> Tobba: it seems like had they just settled for a 64-bit address space, things could've been a lot less confusing and more backwards compatible
[22:46:17] <bascule> and faster and fit within the word size of CPUs!
[22:46:25] <bascule> like here's a crazy idea
[22:46:29] <Tobba> bascule: 48-bit would have been fine until we colonize other planets
[22:46:32] <bascule> IP addresses that go up to 512.512.512.512
[22:46:35] <Tobba> or everyone starts owning 100 toasters
[22:46:43] <bascule> CSI:Cyber style
[22:47:02] <Tobba> do the prop guys for those shows realize theres a chunk of address space dedicated to that stuff?
[22:47:04] <Tobba> it never gets used
[22:47:54] <eternaleye> bascule: Except that ipv6 addresses are not purely topological.
[22:48:12] <eternaleye> bascule: If that was true, then 64 bits would have worked just fine.
[22:48:38] <Ilari> Well, IPv6 intends to have 64-bit network addresses. :->
[22:48:42] <eternaleye> bascule: But ipv6 addresses are also used to encode other things (ORCHID comes to mind, but there's plenty of other stuff)
[22:49:48] <Ilari> The problem with overlay networks: Finding the underlying physical address and fast.
[22:50:10] <eternaleye> Ilari: Kademlia's not half bad at that.
[22:51:00] <eternaleye> Ilari: I'm pretty sure there's a reason that research on DHT architectures is kind of anemic ever since Kademlia, and S/Kademlia kind of put a fork in the issue.
[22:51:37] <Ilari> Like at LISP, problems seem to be one of two kinds: 1) Logical-to-Physical lookup. 2) Some misc nice-to-have thingy.
[22:51:59] <eternaleye> Ilari: Yeah.
[22:52:49] <eternaleye> Ilari: One of the things I like about HIP is how pragmatic it is about logical to physical: They defined an RR, a rendezvous system, a DHT-based approach, _and_ an opportunistic mode.
[22:53:03] <eternaleye> Ilari: And all of them can interoperate.
[22:53:24] <Ilari> I mean, how many different LtP lookup systems does LISP have?
[22:53:33] <tiffany> tobba: at least now with ipv6 we don't have to worry about running out until we start colonizing other galaxies and everyone has 10000 e-toasters
[22:54:01] <tiffany> or start giving nanobots individual addresses, I guess
[22:54:03] <eternaleye> tiffany: Except that it doesn't quite work that way
[22:54:07] <Tobba> tiffany: except we wasted a shitload of those bits
[22:54:12] <tiffany> yeah, lots of wasted space
[22:54:18] <tiffany> however
[22:54:19] <Ilari> Well, the nearer the edge you can push the tunnel entrypoint, the better the thing scales (since you get smaller active tables).

[22:54:24] <bascule> eternaleye: DHTs in and of themselves are kind of useless for anything except BitTorrent, lol
[22:54:25] <eternaleye> Not necessarily wasted
[22:54:25] <Tobba> it's effectively like 48 bits due to how much space was wasted
[22:54:30] <tiffany> isn't 6/8 of the address space still completely unallocated?
[22:54:32] <eternaleye> bascule: Not really
[22:54:33] <bascule> eternaleye: like, in any sort of security-critical scenario
[22:54:39] <bascule> they're easy to game
[22:54:41] *** Joins: erickt (erickt@moz-4hh.6p3.217.74.IP)
[22:54:41] <tiffany> the next /3 could be allocated more efficiently
[22:54:43] <bascule> needs a trust model
[22:54:51] <tiffany> give end users /96s instead of /64s
[22:55:03] <tiffany> am I getting masks backwards again
[22:55:10] <eternaleye> bascule: See also: The bit about conciliators in the SCP paper.
[22:55:16] <eternaleye> tiffany: Yes.
[22:55:19] <bascule> eternaleye: there's that annoying Sybil attack
[22:55:27] <eternaleye> bascule: Read S/Kademlia.
[22:55:37] <bascule> needs a DHT where you don't talk to the sybils
[22:55:39] <bascule> lol
[22:55:49] <bascule> I think I have like 5 papers on DHT security on the Cryptosphere reading list ;)
[22:55:56] <Ilari> tiffany: Well, the standing RIR policies are that you can hand /48s to individual sites... without justification.
[22:56:27] <bascule> eternaleye: I'm not saying it's an unsolvable problem. I'm saying it's a hard problem
[22:56:33] <eternaleye> bascule: Anyway, a DHT can be very useful as an optimization layer over something safer.
[22:56:35] <bascule> and a lot easier if you can just avoid it by design
[22:56:55] <eternaleye> bascule: For instance, using a DHT for speedy mapping, where membership is gated by something like SCP
[22:57:31] <Ilari> tiffany: And actually, just colonizing stars would be enough to put serious pressure on IPv6 address space. Milky Way isn't exactly a small galaxy.
[22:57:47] <eternaleye> bascule: Or heck, serializing updates through SCP while reads take the DHT path.
[22:58:02] <tiffany> I was under the assumption that the other stars would not be as well populated as earth is
[22:58:18] <bascule> eternaleye: how do you determine the address of a peer in the DHT?
[22:58:37] <bascule> and what are the qualifications for participating in the DHT?
[22:58:45] <tiffany> and many stars would probably be ignored for not having habitable zone planets suitable for terraforming
[22:58:47] <bascule> if the answer is "by the public key" and "anyone can provide service" you've already lost

[22:58:53] <eternaleye> bascule: >> where membership is gated by something like SCP
[22:58:58] <bascule> heh, ok, sure
[22:59:32] <eternaleye> bascule: DHTs are good at gottagofast; the way to make them safe is to make them use something more secure as the trust model.
[22:59:43] <eternaleye> bascule: There are ways to interleave them cleanly.
[22:59:49] <bascule> there's still the DoS problem
[22:59:59] <eternaleye> bascule: >> Or heck, serializing updates through SCP while reads take the DHT path.
[22:59:59] <bascule> although that's more easily addressed if you're decently Sybilproof in some form
[23:01:13] <Ilari> tiffany: There are lots of stars in the galaxy. Including probably many with roughly Earth-sized or a bit larger planets in the hz.
[23:02:08] <tiffany> but yeah, ipv6 is quite a lot of space
[23:02:19] <tiffany> it's being allocated quite wastefully, but so was IPv4 when it first started
[23:02:27] <tiffany> IPv4 is a bit silly though
[23:02:36] <tiffany> I mean sure, when it came into existence, there were less than 4 billion people on earth
[23:02:47] <tiffany> but it should have been easy to predict that it would run out eventually
[23:02:57] <eternaleye> tiffany: It's not just allocated "wastefully"
[23:03:09] <eternaleye> tiffany: It's allocated to a variety of suballocation _strategies_
[23:03:16] <eternaleye> tiffany: Which is a _useful thing_
[23:03:45] <eternaleye> tiffany: For instance, ORCHIDs assign addresses within a namespace based on hashes of unique identifiers.
[23:05:11] <tiffany> I'm not really familiar with ORCHID but sure
[23:09:34] <Ilari> Isn't it ORCHIDv2 now?
[23:10:16] <eternaleye> It is
[23:10:27] <eternaleye> the original block has been released back to the IANA
[23:10:39] <eternaleye> because v1 didn't have any crypto agility
[23:11:23] <eternaleye> tiffany: Anyway, seeing IPv6's 128 bits and thinking "we'll never have that many devices" is missing the point.
[23:11:44] <eternaleye> tiffany: It's supposed to have room not just for future devices, but for future ways of allocating addresses _to_ devices.
[23:12:19] <eternaleye> tiffany: Note that in ipv6, having multiple addresses on an interface is the norm (link-local + global unicast)
[23:13:06] <tiffany> yeah I heard about link-local addresses while reading about the autoconfig thing that can replace DHCP for simple setups
[23:13:18] <tiffany> or maybe more setups? I'm not really sure
