[01:40:50] <huon> well, it is the token for an owner of the organisation
[01:40:57] <huon> not the token of the organisation itself
[01:41:09] <huon> (do organisations even have tokens?)
[01:41:24] <barosl> I'm not sure
[01:41:33] <barosl> Maybe we should do some print() debugging... :/
[01:41:45] <huon> unfortunately, i gtg, and its running on my server
[01:41:50] <huon> so we'll have to do it later :(
[01:42:06] <Gankro> barosl: So you haven't seen anything like this before, then?
[01:42:24] <barosl> No
[01:42:29] <barosl> Or yes? I don't remember, haha
[01:43:08] <Gankro> heh, fair enough
[01:43:12] <barosl> huon, You can look at the `travis()` function in `server.py` to track what has gone wrong
[01:43:24] <huon> barosl: btw, one problem with the current file format is the secrets are mixed in with the rest of the config
[01:43:35] <barosl> Aaaand... more logging! I definitely need to work on this
[01:43:40] <huon> meaning one has to be careful about what ones checks into a repo
[01:44:10] <barosl> huon, You mean, checking the configuration file into a repo?
[01:44:19] <huon> e.g. I've written a script that will merge two files into a cfg.toml, so that the per-repo configuration can be collaborated on https://github.com/contain-rs/admin
[01:44:21] <huon> yeah
[01:44:33] <barosl> Hmm
[01:44:40] <huon> anyway, gtg
[01:45:21] <Gankro> conventional wisdom is that secrets should be like env variables, right?
[01:45:34] <barosl> Would that be sufficient to just load the two files (general.toml, secrets.toml) when Homu is starting?
[01:45:54] <huon> barosl: maybe
[01:46:08] <huon> (that script also has the advantage of dramatically reducing how much repetition is required)
[01:46:18] <barosl> Gankro, Technically secrets can vary from repo to repo, so there needs to be many env variables if we choose that approach
[01:46:39] <barosl> But in reality, that may not happen, cause most of the repos would be owned by one
[01:47:06] <barosl> So I call it a reasonable idea, hmm
[01:47:08] <huon> 45 lines of commented/whitespaced TOML becomes 120 lines of compact TOML
[01:47:20] <barosl> 120?!
[01:47:26] <barosl> Why did it grow?
[01:48:21] <huon> https://github.com/contain-rs/admin/blob/master/homu/configs.toml is merged with a filled out version of https://github.com/contain-rs/admin/blob/master/homu/secrets.example.toml
[01:48:37] <huon> filling in owner and name and reviewers for each repo, along with .github and .travis info
[01:49:03] <barosl> Aha
[01:49:12] <barosl> So it's working as a template
[01:49:16] <huon> basically the only thing that differs between repos is the reviewer list and the name, and those can be inferred/defaulted sensibly
[01:49:18] <huon> yeah, exactly
[01:49:39] * huon leaves
[01:50:22] <barosl> Actually, weeks ago, all the secrets were placed in the common section ([main])
[01:50:44] <barosl> And I changed it to a per-repo setting to allow each repo to have its own secret
[01:51:02] <barosl> But maybe *both* should be supported
[01:56:24] <Gankro> barosl: I feel like super-instances should be encouraged over many instances for keeping track of all your PRs in one UI. That implies to me a fair amount of secret sharing (as e.g. rust-lang and contain-rs would have)
[01:58:51] <barosl> That's true
[01:59:29] <Gankro> reem: may be interested in above conversation for iron/hyper stuff
[02:00:06] <barosl> One concern is, wouldn't that increase the complexity of the configuration file if we support two different places to set up a secret?
[02:00:10] <reem> Ah yes, thanks.
[02:00:23] <reem> I would probably set up one bot and use it to manage everything in reem/ hyperium/ and iron/
[02:01:05] <reem> and other projects if people want - if you can handle all of rust-lang, you can handle like 100 normal-sized projects :P
[02:01:55] <barosl> MSBuild (Microsoft's "make") is open sourced today, and its license is MIT!
[02:02:12] <barosl> So MIT is even endorsed by Microsoft
[02:03:04] <Gankro> barosl: Definitely more complicated in general, but making either optional should make it simple in simple cases and complicated in complicated cases
[02:03:13] <barosl> They're using tw=80 :P
[02:03:39] <barosl> Gankro, Yeah, regardless of the complexity, I think that's the way we should go
[02:05:23] <Gankro> Might want to tap acrichto or brson for their take on rust-lang's usage
[02:05:39] <Gankro> Or maybe file an issue on homu I can CC a million people on

[05:52:39] <theme> If I initiated a program that registers an account, does that count as "not a human"?
[05:52:44] <eddyb> theme: yes
[05:53:02] <eddyb> theme: you probably have to break captcha :P
[05:53:27] * theme hates ambiguous legalese
[05:54:18] <Murarth> <theme> 'You must be a human. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted.'
[05:54:18] <Murarth> What about accounts registered by a human and thenceforth used by a bot? :P
[05:54:35] <theme> Murarth, that's what I'm talking about
[05:54:38] <theme> too
[05:54:49] <theme> then why does reem got flagged?
[05:55:05] <reem> theme: It's not final, it's just a bot that flagged me
[05:55:10] <theme> -_-
[05:55:13] <reem> theme: They say to contact them if you are human
[05:55:18] <reem> so I contacted them
[05:55:18] <theme> or does it violate rule A.7?
[05:55:21] <reem> and waiting for a response
[05:55:26] <theme> *_*
[05:55:55] <theme> "One person or legal entity may not maintain more than one free account."
[05:56:16] <theme> and account called reem-bot is definitely going to be suspicious for violating that
[05:56:27] <reem> ugh
[05:56:52] <reem> I'll pay a few dollars a month if they want me to, I guess.
[05:56:54] <eddyb> wait, what?
[05:57:04] <eddyb> what about organizations?
[05:57:05] <reem> but that sucks if they point it out to me
[05:57:12] <theme> eddyb, a result of interpreting the TOS literally?
[05:57:17] <theme> eddyb, erm... what?
[05:57:23] <reem> eddyb: Use an organization for an organization :P
[05:57:50] <eddyb> I have never created one, I guess they can just be different
[05:58:08] <theme> I guess an organization in github is more like a "group"?
[05:58:13] <theme> group of accounts
[05:58:26] <eddyb> theme: it gives you an user-like "namespace"
[05:58:26] <reem> You create an organization and add people to it and they can contribute to it
[05:58:33] <theme> "You may create separate logins for as many people as your plan allows."
[06:00:49] <reem> theme huon Gankro: They cleared my account.
[06:00:55] <theme> great! ^_^

[16:47:10] <brson> to get rid of the fortran dep
[16:47:23] <cmr> the implementation I use (OpenBLAS) is mostly hand-written assembly doing SIMD stuff
[16:47:41] <cmr> that'd be interesting though, I didn't think of it
[16:48:28] <cmr> there's f2c, should write a c2rs
[16:48:58] <lahwran> that doesn't seem like it'd be too horribly difficult
[16:49:06] <lahwran> it'd produce like 100% unsafe code though
[16:49:11] <cmr> yes it would.
[16:49:22] <lahwran> it would be difficult, or it'd produce unsafe code?
[16:49:27] <cmr> produce unsafe code
[16:49:32] <lahwran> ah
[16:49:34] <cmr> probably be somewhat difficult as well
[16:49:45] <cmr> though bindgen has done a lot of the tricky layout work already
[16:49:49] <lahwran> not impossible though, C is designed to be translated to lots of things
[16:49:58] <cmr> getting the preprocessor stuff right would be the hardest part
[16:50:08] <lahwran> ooh yeah
