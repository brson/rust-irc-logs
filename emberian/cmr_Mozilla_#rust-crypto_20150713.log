[01:34:36] <eternaleye> LISP is entirely redundant with HIP in my opinion, and HIP does it better.
[01:34:50] <eternaleye> Especially because the crypto is built-in, not bolt-on
[01:36:18] <Ilari> What would be good introductionary HIP document? draft-ietf-hip-arch?
[01:36:40] <eternaleye> Ilari: RFC 7401
[01:37:05] <eternaleye> Ilari: Or possibly some of the papers on the InfraHIP site
[01:37:37] <eternaleye> Ilari: Depends on whether you want an introduction to the basic idea (7401), the protocol (7401), or some of the more advanced possibilities (papers)
[01:38:14] <eternaleye> Ilari: Note that the papers are somewhat dated; 7401 is recent and contains HIPv2 while they were written against 5201 which contained HIPv1
[01:39:19] <eternaleye> Ilari: The other RFCs and drafts listed on the hipwg datatracker are also illuminating
[01:39:45] <eternaleye> Ilari: Actually, lemme check when the hip-arch draft was updated...
[01:40:15] *** Joins: dpc (dpc@moz-t6gr4b.ca.comcast.net)
[01:41:17] <Ilari> Apparently HIP acts at host level, whereas LISP acts on network level (altough LISP can do host routes too).
[01:41:51] <eternaleye> Ilari: Yup
[01:42:21] <eternaleye> Ilari: Ah, draft-ietf-hip-rfc4423-bis-12 is probably the best starting point
[01:42:54] <eternaleye> Ilari: http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-hip-rfc4423-bis-12
[01:43:35] <Ilari> I actually have set up browser so I can do: "id: draft-ietf-hip-rfc4423-bis".
[01:43:55] <Elaine> neat
[01:43:58] <eternaleye> Ilari: Yeah, I have rfc and rfcd (rfc draft) for the same
[01:44:05] <eternaleye> Ilari: Firefox keywords are great
[01:44:18] *** Quits: brson (brson@moz-cfhap5.mtv2.mozilla.com) (Quit: leaving)
[01:55:37] <Ilari> I think LISP was designed for a bit different problem than HIP.
[01:57:50] <Ilari> I think LISP is meant for connecting N+1 multihomed networks into the Internet (for large values of N).
[02:00:06] <Ilari> ... Without overloading the core routers in the process (which would happen if one tried to multihome the sites in the traditional way).
[02:00:24] <mcpherrin> And without worrying about IPv4 / AS number exhaustion ;)
[02:00:37] <mcpherrin> And with roaming (which is a special case of multihoming)
[02:01:14] *** Joins: dcb (textual@moz-v6l3du.ca.comcast.net)
[02:01:26] <mcpherrin> LISP looks like it actually might happen; vendors talking about and doing work with it
[02:02:04] <Ilari> Well, looks like ASN4 has mostly solved the ASN exhaustion.
[02:03:17] <mcpherrin> yeah :)
[02:03:26] <mcpherrin> And v6 has solved v4 depletion!
[02:03:33] <Ilari> Well, not quite. :-/
[02:03:51] <mcpherrin> ;)
[02:05:03] <Ilari> ASN2->ASN4 shift looks a lot easier than IPv4->IPv6 shift.
[02:05:14] <eternaleye> Ilari: LISP and HIP are fundamentally very similar - s/EID/HIT/; s/RLOC/IP address/; s/encapsulation/end-to-end IPsec/
[02:05:50] <eternaleye> Ilari: And while strictly speaking it's not compliant, one could pretty easily set up a box to create an HI for each LAN machine, and do 1-to-1 NAT
[02:07:25] <eternaleye> Ilari: And re: vendors talking about it, the entire point of HIP is to avoid any need to change the routing infrastructure _at all_
[02:07:54] <eternaleye> Ilari: If the routing equipment vendors were talking about it, that'd be a sign of something wrong :P
[02:08:17] <eternaleye> Ilari: IMO, LISP violates the smart-edge, dumb-core principle that is so crucial to the success of the internet
[02:08:27] <Ilari> Also, another goal of LISP is to improve traffic engineering (which is apparently source of major headaches for core router operators).
[02:08:33] <eternaleye> Ilari: Because upgrading the core is _fucking hard_
[02:09:48] <Ilari> LISP, HIP and there was at least one other highly experimential IRTF thingy all try to sove the the same fundamential problem, what I call "logical-physical problem".
[02:10:27] <eternaleye> Yup
[02:10:56] <mcpherrin> LISP leaves a "dumb core"
[02:11:03] <mcpherrin> it happens at edge routers
[02:11:07] <Ilari> Given logical identity of system image, where it is physically (in network topology).
[02:11:39] <mcpherrin> Doing HIP+NAT at the same scale as LISP is pretty infeasible -- that's a lot of state to keep
[02:11:53] <mcpherrin> And a lot more per-packet
[02:11:57] <mcpherrin> And a lot more per-packet work
[02:12:16] <eternaleye> mcpherrin: Only if you don't do LISP dataplane security (that RFC up there)
[02:12:28] <eternaleye> mcpherrin: And that opens up some fascinating impersonation issues IIUC...
[02:12:37] <Ilari> And there can be multiple physical locations at once, even if anycast is not involved.
[02:13:06] <mcpherrin> I don't think most lisp deployments will have dataplane security
[02:13:09] <eternaleye> I think part of the problem is the different IETF areas not paying attention to each other
[02:13:15] <eternaleye> mcpherrin: And That's Terrible
[02:13:29] <eternaleye> LISP is rtg, HIP is int, etc.
[02:13:56] <Ilari> Actually, the multi-location shows up in LISP design (the mapping is done network as a whole).
[02:14:04] <mcpherrin> fwiw, I have only ever heard of HIP in this channel which doesn't bode well for it's acceptance in vendor equipment ;p
[02:14:13] <eternaleye> Ilari: And there were four total, IIRC - Mobile IP, which is terrible; ILNP, LISP, and HIP
[02:14:16] <Ilari> IIRC, LISP was recently moved from one area to another.
[02:14:26] <eternaleye> mcpherrin: It's designed to run on the host
[02:14:29] <eternaleye> mcpherrin: HIP is e2e
[02:14:50] <eternaleye> mcpherrin: "acceptance in vendor equipment" is something HIP was designed _not to need_
[02:14:52] <mcpherrin> eternaleye: yeah, I mean w.r.t making LISP redundant
[02:14:57] <eternaleye> Mm
[02:15:04] <mcpherrin> LISP is designed to not need end-hosts to upgrade ;)
[02:15:37] <eternaleye> mcpherrin: How often do people apply software updates vs. replacing their gateway router?
[02:15:46] <Ilari> Also, if we had solution for "logical-physical problem", IPv4 to IPv6 migration would have been fricking non-issue.
[02:16:01] <eternaleye> Ilari: Yup; that gets brought up by the HIP docs
[02:16:20] <mcpherrin> eternaleye: 5-10 year amoritization time on most network hardware ;p
[02:16:24] <eternaleye> Ilari: It can actually allow programs written for IPv4 or IPv6 to use HIP over either
[02:16:35] <eternaleye> mcpherrin: Precisely :P
[02:16:40] <mcpherrin> But LISP is fairly compatible with existing hardware
[02:16:46] <mcpherrin> could happen as a software upgrade
[02:17:12] <eternaleye> Ilari: Via either LSI's (which are inet4addr-like host-local identifiers) or HITs (which are IPv6 ORCHIDs)
[02:18:24] <Ilari> Then there are some new schemes to do efficient IPv4 address usage on provoder end by having IPv6-only provoder network core. Wonder how well those actually work.
[02:19:27] <eternaleye> Oh, wait, there's a fifth separation method, SHIM6
[02:19:52] <eternaleye> SHIM6, HIP, and ILNP are all host-based it seems
[02:20:50] <eternaleye> Mobile IP, LISP, and something called GSE/8+8 are all network-based
[02:21:00] <eternaleye> Good lord, what a clusterfuck
[02:23:25] <eternaleye> Another nice thing re: HIP - it doesn't necessarily have to use ESP
[02:23:35] <eternaleye> That's the only transport that's gone to RFC yet
[02:23:44] <eternaleye> But there's an expired draft that did SRTP
[02:23:56] <eternaleye> For zero-overhead SRTP, keyed by HIP
[02:24:02] <Ilari> Also, with encryption, there is tradeoff between how much is protected and reach one has. E.g. HTTP payload encryption can't protect a lot of info, but has reach across multiple intermediates and storage. Vs. Lambda encryption, which can protect everything except existence of the link, but reaches only the link.
[02:24:56] <eternaleye> Ilari: Yeah, HIP's designed to protoect everything except that locator A contacted HIP ID B at locator C
[02:25:15] <eternaleye> Ilari: And the target HIP ID can be protected using an extension
[02:26:43] <eternaleye> Ilari: Individual transports keyed by it might leak more, but the ESP transport is pretty maximal in its protection
[02:31:43] <Ilari> Also, one could compress the IP forwarding table quite a bit (coalesce adjacent routes with the same NH), but for some reason routers don't seem to support that...
[02:33:08] <eternaleye> I wonder how hard it is to implement crit-bit trees in hardware, actually
[02:33:20] <eternaleye> They seem like they might be near-optimal for routing tables
[02:33:45] <Ilari> Well, it would be software, since software loads the forwarding tables into hardware linecards.
[02:34:49] <Ilari> Routers use special kind of memory (which isn't even SRAM, but something much costlier and power-hungry) for speed reasons
[02:36:57] <Ilari> Okay, I don't quite understand this report about routing table, but it would seem based on it that one could cut routing table size in about half by merging routes.
[02:37:33] <Ilari> One can't in general compress RIB, but one doesn't need to, since RIB is in RAM, which is pretty plentiful in routers.
[02:37:47] <eternaleye> Ilari: Yes, TCAM
[02:38:05] <eternaleye> Ilari: But TCAM is basically a hardware impl of a hashtable IIRC
[02:38:18] <eternaleye> Ilari: I'm asking about swapping TCAM for a different paradigm
[02:38:54] <Ilari> I think there was some hybrid scheme that used RAM + TCAM to save TCAM space. Or something like that.
[02:41:31] <Ilari> Crit-bit trees... Are those the ones that skip all levels that are forced by previous looked bit? I think there would be quite many lookups on average.
[02:47:15] <Ilari> Even SRAM, which is quite expensive compared to DRAM is heckuva cheap when compared to TCAM.
[02:54:36] <Ilari> eternaleye: And the most difficult problem with scheme to solve LPP: Deployment.
[02:57:30] <eternaleye> Ilari: Agreed, though OpenHIP's statement of intent to support HIPv2 this summer helps a lot there
[02:57:41] <eternaleye> Ilari: Since it supports Linux, Windows, OS X, etc.
[02:58:16] <eternaleye> Ilari: And it's one daemon, one keygen tool, one diagnostic tool, and three config files
[02:58:32] <eternaleye> Ilari: And really trivial to install/set up
[02:59:04] * eternaleye set it up on my laptop and a server on Thursday evening, and did HTTP over HIP inside half an hour from scratch
[03:02:13] <Ilari> Or I actually meant wide-scale deployment, not deployment on few hosts or even few networks.
[03:11:02] <eternaleye> Sure
[03:11:13] <eternaleye> But it being easy to do is a definite point in favor :P

[17:20:27] <eternaleye> Tiffany: The idea being that in order for an ACL system to confine something dynamically, the agent building the cage needs the ability to create ACL principals (~identities), a superuser operation
[17:20:29] <eternaleye> Tiffany: Whereas for a capability system, all the confining agent needs to do is... not provide caps, and when providing caps interpose them with a membrane (recursive filter)

[17:35:34] <Tiffany> hm
[17:35:37] <Tiffany> I guess
[17:35:40] <eternaleye> Tiffany: In a system with select!(), it's literally one additional branch+syscall pair
[17:36:20] <Tiffany> I get the impression that there are often optimisations for revokable capabilities?
[17:37:53] <eternaleye> Tiffany: In a system with lightweight share-everything threads (no stack, run from registers only), it's equal to the size of the register file
[17:37:54] <eternaleye> Tiffany: There's the double copy, but that's... tiny
[17:37:57] <eternaleye> Tiffany: Since most cap systems (like seL4) have a pretty small max message size
[17:38:11] <eternaleye> Tiffany: And yes, sometimes there are optimizations, but they're more tradeoffs
[17:40:38] <eternaleye> Tiffany: You could have the kernel provide a cap that "cuts" another cap, but then you can't interpose on it to manipulate or filter messages
[17:40:39] <eternaleye> Tiffany: It's a very narrow primitive
[17:40:41] <eternaleye> Tiffany: It's much more useful to just optimize message sending overhead itself
[17:40:42] <eternaleye> Tiffany: seL4 got that _low_

[22:32:31] <Ilari> Haha about that DJB comment about SHA-3.
[22:33:12] <Ilari> And there are faster variable-length hashes with serious qualifications.
[22:34:59] <Ilari> bascule: Lol, is that code DJB posted memory-safe? :->
[22:39:49] <eternaleye> I think DJB considers memory safety something that happens to other people.
[22:40:32] <bascule> hahaha
[22:40:51] <Ilari> And OpenSSL? Aren't there lots of other good SHA-512 implementations as well?
[22:41:09] <eternaleye> Nettle.
[22:41:23] <eternaleye> (Personally, I trust Nettle a LOT more than OpenSSL...)
[22:42:19] <Ilari> IIRC, some prototype code I wrote recently used nettle. I don't remember what it was for (maybe ECC sigs).
[22:44:28] <eternaleye> I wonder if there are Rust Nettle bindings
[22:45:20] <Ilari> Well, at least not on crates.io. Dunno about github.
[22:47:33] <Ilari> Haha on that nettle soup recipe (unfortuanately contains flour and meat/vegetable stock)...
[22:49:08] <eternaleye> My mom actually made nettle soup just recently
[22:49:40] <eternaleye> And back when I was the outdoor living skills counselor at a summer camp, I used to teach the kids how to make nettle tea
[22:49:50] <eternaleye> (Which is quite tasty, actually)
[22:54:08] <Ilari> The two ingridients I listed are because most of the ones sold in markets are just plain nasty.
[22:54:16] <eternaleye> Mm
[22:54:48] <eternaleye> Well, on the stock side, my mom typically buys a chicken every couple of weeks, roasts it, and once it's eaten makes stock from the carcass
[22:55:39] <Ilari> Yeah, that sure works.

[22:59:57] <eternaleye> And as far as flour goes, Bob's Red Mill is amazing (but likely not available unless you live on the US west coast; they're Portland-based)
[23:00:35] <eternaleye> (You learn all sorts of things when your mom creates a startup that sells frozen challah dough)
[23:01:55] <Ilari> (Well, I happen to have some potato flour in cupboard, haven't used it through. At least the nasty effects are mostly limited to destablizing blood sugar).

[23:11:26] <Ilari> Also, occurs to me that if DH2k is used in TLS 1.3, configurations are not used (or the config key is DH2k too) and connection lasts some time, attacker with DH2k logarithm tables can start MITMing the connection after pretty fast logarithm calculation completes (as all keys are computable).
[23:11:47] <Ilari> Works with DH1k in TLS 1.2 with some standard group too...

[23:13:53] <eternaleye> Oooh, this is neat: https://github.com/pcwalton/ipc-channel
[23:14:10] <bascule> eternaleye: yeah I saw that, seems awesome
[23:14:15] <bascule> also lol soghoian quoted my tweet: https://twitter.com/csoghoian/status/620703098042867712
[23:14:54] <eternaleye> bascule: ipc-channel + gaol = awesome
[23:19:30] <Ilari> Also, DJB seems quite above average on excitement about SHA-3. :-)
[23:21:14] *** Joins: dcb (dcb@moz-4hh.6p3.217.74.IP)
[23:23:40] <eternaleye> I think it's more that he wants stuff to get deployed, and has fought many battles on that front before and is hoping he need not do so again.
[23:26:37] <bascule> hahaha
[23:26:56] <bascule> I don't have anything against SHA-3 for hashing tiny amounts of data, except for ^^^ tweet
[23:27:04] <bascule> scumbag NIST, publish the standard already
[23:27:16] <Ilari> I would think that working with baseline 512-bit hashes like SHA-512 would be better strategy for getting stuff deployed (and then one could replace SHA-512 with something better).
[23:27:25] <bascule> sure
[23:32:21] <Ilari> Also, yeah quite obvious that one could use raw SHA-512 as H in computation of s. Since with E-521, on average ~0.2% of H values are <2^512.
[23:33:49] <Ilari> And factor of 512 isn't much in crypto.
