[04:46:43] <nrc> edunham: the highfive bug was pretty minor: https://github.com/nrc/highfive/commit/ce206f9ca9edee5f251915c6a9f7aa79aec9e053
[04:47:03] <nrc> Looks like it works now: https://github.com/nrc/highfive/pull/52
[04:58:50] <edunham> ah. yep, tests with a toy config and api response would have totally caught that :)
[04:59:12] <edunham> thanks for fixing it!
[05:05:48] <nrc> np, thanks for the patch!
[05:06:05] <nrc> Looking forward to those the toy config stuff... :-)
[05:28:19] <edunham> hmm, there
[05:28:22] <edunham> err. 
[05:28:40] <edunham> there's CGI wizardry afoot, and I don't have the perms to see how hooks are configured on any of the repos that this highfive is configured for.
[05:29:38] <edunham> nrc: would you mind updating the highfive README with how to configure the bot for a new repo?
[05:54:27] <nrc> sure
[05:56:34] <nrc> edunham: probably won't get to it until next week though, sorry - its 6pm Friday here

[06:44:29] <huon> edunham: http://huonw.github.io/blog/2015/03/rust-infrastructure-can-be-your-infrastructure has some info

[06:52:45] <nrc> I don't think that's out of date from highfive's perspective

[16:00:57] <edunham> nrc: oh yeah, timezones! have a great weekend!
[16:03:07] <edunham> huon: thanks! That's so recent it'd even be feasible to skim the changelogs of the tools since then if I was worried about it getting obsolete :)
[16:04:07] <edunham> heh, good writeup... both of them fulfill "automatically maintain a repository of code that always passes all the tests" partially by not having enough tests...

[19:44:27] <aturon> question for brson and edunham: we were just talking over lunch about the version of mac os the bots are running on,
[19:44:38] <aturon> and it reminded me that at some point we talked about testing on multiple versions --
[19:44:47] <aturon> that's definitely not needed for normal "keep the tree green testing",
[19:45:05] <aturon> but i wonder if it would make sense to set something like that up for periodic testing e.g. prior to putting the beta out
[19:45:21] <aturon> and also whether the configuration work edunham is doing might ease setting that up
[19:46:16] <edunham> aturon: yeah, that's being tracked in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/17269
[19:47:37] <aturon> amusingly, an issue i opened... i thought it seemed familiar ;-)
[19:50:45] <brson> it would be amazing to have an exhaustive set of test configurations just for special occasions
[19:51:01] <brson> burn thousands of cpu hours right before release
[19:51:26] <edunham> I haven't dug into our utilization of the current mac minis to estimate how many we'd need on macstadium -- they start at $60/month each, and they have some "private cloud" solutions that look way overpowered for our needs (and priced accordingly, ~$800/mo and up)
[19:52:42] <edunham> there are alternatives to macstadium with an hourly type model that'd probably be a much better fit for exhaustive special occasion testing
[19:53:38] <acrichto> edunham: whoa 60/mo sounds pretty cheap
[19:53:40] <acrichto> I think...
[19:54:32] <edunham> 60/mo per server; we currently have 4 but might want more depending on the importance of speeding up the tests
[19:55:04] <acrichto> hm true, that does add up...
[19:55:33] <edunham> also to my current knowledge, 1 OSX version per server, though there might be vmware workarounds to allow more
[19:55:55] <acrichto> yeah I don't think we'd want to do much vms-on-vms business
[19:55:57] <edunham> though any virtualization to allow other OS versions will slow down the tests, which is bad
[19:56:07] <acrichto> not testing all versions isn't the end of the world though
[19:56:10] <edunham> no, macstadium is a rent-a-physical-mini model
[19:56:27] * edunham currently looking at cloud providers
[19:57:12] <edunham> yeah, testing on only one version wouldn't be a step backward, but i'm reluctant to commit a bunch of work to a platform that'll make it unduly difficult to move forward when we're ready to
[20:01:01] <acrichto> true
