[00:00:42] <bjz> brson: do you understand the use case? I understand the concern about overloading methods though
[00:01:23] <bjz> brson: it would be good to have an official stance on this issue though
[00:03:41] <bjz> brson: I would prefer not to spread mis-information (I've been telling folks it's on the way)
[00:05:03] <brson> bjz: yes, I do. is there an issue open?
[00:06:14] * bjz chacks
[00:06:16] <bjz> checks
[00:06:18] <bjz> :P
[00:06:32] <brson> i guess it might work even without general overloading since you could conceivably have multiple impls as long as they don't overlap. I don't know enough about how traits work to know though
[00:07:17] <bjz> mm
[00:07:33] <bjz> heh, my first issue on rust: https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/2961
[00:08:32] <bjz> the solution proposed by pcwalton isn't practical unfortunately
[00:09:03] *** Quits: maik (maik@moz-C09804C4.dip0.t-ipconnect.de) (Ping timeout)
[00:10:35] <bjz> you have to do separate impls for all the concrete types, but then that constrains client code. Also, if you or the client wants to use those overloads, they must add each of those bounds to their generic functions
[00:11:38] <jeaye> Definitely one thing I miss about C++
[00:12:07] <cmr> I would also like method overloads.
[00:12:18] <cmr> I understand the problems they bring about with in terms of error checking
[00:12:23] <cmr> They're just so damn convenient :\
[00:12:32] <jeaye> yup
[00:12:37] <cmr> Although it'd probably make type inference less useful or more difficult.
[00:12:46] <cmr> Since now you don't have a single constraint when you call a function/method.
[00:13:10] <bjz> cmr: I think C++ handles that by lazily evaluating templates at compile time, but that would make lots of other things difficult for us
[00:13:16] <jeaye> Like C++, an overload would not be able to vary only on the return type.
[00:15:12] <bjz> brson: granted, I guess if you wanted you could make a meta-trait that bags all those RHS traits together, but then that would force clients to use that bound for their generic functions
[00:15:48] <bjz> brson: it would be hard to make separate libraries composable
[00:16:51] <bjz> jeaye: that makes sense
[00:16:59] * bjz doesn't know enough type theory
[00:17:53] <cmr> Wait, why does it make sense?
[00:38:04] <h3r3tic> bjz: looks like I was lying about glsl. does allow vec + scalar, vec * scalar, etc. strange, I remember getting compiler errors about that at one point
[00:38:23] <bjz> h3r3tic: yeah I thought they allowed multiple overloads
[00:38:23] <h3r3tic> s/does/it does/

[01:18:58] <jeaye> Because the C++ standard says so (and it makes sense);
[01:19:34] <jeaye> float foo::get_bar(float);
[01:19:35] <jeaye> std::string foo::get_bar(float);
[01:19:51] <jeaye> auto ret = foo::get_bar(0.0f);
[01:19:56] <jeaye> What do I get?
[01:20:05] <cmr> A compile-time error
[01:20:08] <cmr> Unconstrainted type
[01:20:25] <cmr> (at least if that were translated into equivalent rust and rust had overloading)
[01:21:02] <jeaye> I think, if Rust did support overloading, following this rule (as per C++) would be entirely reasonable.
[01:21:02] <bjz> h3r3tic: yay
[01:21:24] <bjz> h3r3tic: did you use your own maths lib for that, or cgmath, or none?
[01:21:48] <cmr> I don't see how it's any different from fn get_bar<T: FromFloat>(x: float) -> T
[01:21:55] <cmr> (for example)
[01:22:29] <jeaye> Traits are different.
[01:23:14] <jeaye> std::shared_ptr<base_object> get_foo(bar const &);
[01:23:23] <jeaye> Polymorphism doesn't count.
[01:24:58] <jeaye> (get_foo could return `new foo;` where foo derives from base_object)
[01:25:12] <cmr> I really don't see why it'd be unreasonable for Rust method overloads to vary only on return type.
[01:25:33] <h3r3tic> bjz: just simple stubs for now. going to plug in cgmath in a sec, but was getting some compiler errors, as I'm not up to date with rustc
[01:25:43] <jeaye> I've yet to see a good example as to where it'd be useful/applicable, cmr.
[01:25:44] <cmr> Maybe there's something I'm missing.
[01:25:57] <bjz> h3r3tic: ah sorry
[01:25:58] <h3r3tic> bjz: the lack of cgmath is the reason there's no perspective projection there yet xD
[01:26:12] <cmr>  let x: int = get_url_param("foo")
[01:26:18] <cmr> get_url_param can return lots of different things
[01:26:19] <bjz> h3r3tic: fingers crossed I got that projection stuff right :P
[01:26:24] <h3r3tic> ... and me just adding another uniform buffer for viewport constants :)
[01:26:26] <h3r3tic> ha
[01:26:27] <cmr> fails if the string faisl to parse
[01:26:33] <h3r3tic> I tried it before. I think you did :)
[01:27:22] <jeaye> vs: let x = get_url_param::<int>("foo")
[01:28:14] <cmr> Well, for that, get_url_param would have to handle everything in one body, rather than having specialized overloads for specific types.
[01:28:49] <jeaye> Not as unreasonable in Rust as in C++, admittedly (due to Rust already having far superior type-deduction). Still pretty unneeded, it seems.
[01:29:00] <cmr> I agree it doesn't really seem necessary.
[01:29:21] <cmr> But if you're going to add overloading, it doesn't seem like return type overloads should be disallowed.
[01:30:05] <jeaye> Sounds good to me.
[01:30:42] * bjz hates the word 'disallowed'
[01:30:44] <bjz> :P
[01:30:47] <cmr> why?
[01:31:05] <bjz> forbidden?
[01:31:24] <bjz> shouldn't be supported?
[01:31:39] <cmr> all of the above are equivalent?

[03:54:02] <jeaye> Yes. Voxels provide a very succinct way of performing volumetric manipulations, compared to triangles. q3 will not necessarily be rendered in terms of voxels as a final product, but the underlying engine will still be using voxels.

[03:57:34] <cmr> h3r3tic: the first paragraph of the description tells all I think :p
[03:57:43] <jeaye> I plan to develop gameplay around this.

[03:59:10] <Kelet> jeaye, You ever hear of anyone building q^3  for a windows systems?

[04:00:13] <h3r3tic> tiffany: CSG is cool, especially when done with the linear programming method for merging sub-trees, but it still tends to have unpredictable memory and performance requirements
[04:00:52] <jeaye> Also, Quake has never required much for graphics. :P I'll be following its lead in focusing more on fun gameplay than stellar visuals.
[04:00:55] <tiffany> hm, never thought about that
[04:01:12] <cmr> jeaye: \o/ fun games ftw
[04:01:41] <cmr> Being able to gather exploded voxels and rebuild barriers or ramps etc could be fun
[04:01:50] <Kelet> jeaye, I wasn't aware that QL had significant differences in its BSP format as compared with Q3.
[04:01:56] * jeaye plays Quake at the absolute lowest settings, so it's weird to even see people play Quake with even textures enabled.
[04:02:02] <Kelet> I thought I recalled loading QL custom maps in Q3 but I may be mistaken

[04:02:12] <Kelet> picmip 9!
[04:02:15] <cmr> especially for CTF, could create some interesting gameplay.
[04:02:24] <h3r3tic> jeaye: srsly, you don't even use lightmaps?
[04:02:58] <jeaye> Kelet: It's really lame. QL maps are encrypted, for one thing.
[04:03:08] <Kelet> ah
[04:03:13] <Kelet> That sucks
[04:03:15] <jeaye> Beyond that, they're definitely not stored the same. I can load 'em up... but things do not look proper.
[04:03:26] <jeaye> So some layout must be a bit different.
[04:03:34] <jeaye> Maybe a new field added to one of the lumps.
[04:04:40] <jeaye> h3r3tic: This basically is what it looks like for me (when I play) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1nSz3yKSMw
[04:04:50] <Kelet> I made some maps in GTKRadiant some time ago, but my latest foray into Quake was messing with a game called quake2world (and playing it). I believe it had a custom BSP format that was pretty good: http://quake2world.net/books/documentation/creating-levels/bsp-compiler
[04:05:02] <Kelet> but I'm sure you're mainly doing it so you have a wide array of maps available to you from q3/ql
[04:05:16] <Kelet> jeaye, For gameplay are you going to try and mirror q3 physics (strafejumping, circle strafe jumps, etc)?
[04:05:18] <h3r3tic> jeaye: O_O that's a new level of extreme :P
[04:05:40] <jeaye> Yeah, I want people to be able to blow up the maps they love, Kelet.

[04:05:55] <cmr> What is CPMA?

[04:06:20] <cmr> Ah, thought it was some graphics thing
[04:06:26] <h3r3tic> you then get flight control and can dostuff like circle-strafes :3
[04:06:27] <Kelet> the biggest change was probably much more air control

[04:10:31] <jeaye> Namely portals (that anyone can use). Imagine CTF where, if you place a portal, someone else may jump right through is and rail you (or whoever was behind you).
[04:11:20] <Kelet> Definitely lots of possibility, when I saw q^3 I was interested, growing up playing all the quakes, and I've played and contributed to many Q2 mods
[04:11:22] <h3r3tic> // huh, glfw3's SetSwapInterval doesn't work on my windows box, while manually using the wgl extension does
[04:11:32] <jeaye> Also, this is probably a must-have, since the maps will be 100% destructible, there will need to be some way to regenerate maps (otherwise they could be render unplayable very quickly). I plan to have a gun that does this.
[04:11:49] <Kelet> That's really interesting
[04:12:02] <Kelet> jeaye, You don't think that some non-destructable property is a worthful investment for mapmakers?
[04:12:38] <Kelet> I guess it just depends on several factors, like how much of a map is destroyed with one shot of a rocket launcher or something - I haven't been able to test it so I don't quite know.
[04:12:41] <jeaye> Not yet. I still feel everything should be destructible right now.
[04:12:45] <Kelet> (If weapons are in-game yet)
[04:13:08] <h3r3tic> Kelet: I have Rust running on windows, complete with gl-rs, glfw3, assimp, freeimage and cgmath
[04:13:12] <jeaye> No weapons in-game yet. Or even players running around. I did just finish skeletal animation (CPU skinning) though.
[04:13:27] <jeaye> h3r3tic: Ah, you're using assimp. Did you bind it yourself?
[04:13:28] <Kelet> h3r3tic, Interesting, I can't even get Rust to build, but the fact that you've got that much motivates me to try again
[04:13:40] <h3r3tic> jeaye: yeah, I made a bare-bones binding manually
[04:13:59] <h3r3tic> Kelet: I basically followed the instructions from wiki, and had zero issues :P
[04:14:01] <Kelet> I need a simple 2d-oriented framework that handles windowing/input so I've been hoping that rust-sdl2 or rust-sfml mature up and I get this build going.
[04:14:04] <jeaye> h3r3tic: I'm certain the rust community would geatly benefit from such bindings.
[04:14:14] *** Quits: samx (sami@moz-D9DA5773.dyn.optonline.net) (Quit: This computer has gone to sleep)
[04:14:50] <h3r3tic> jeaye: yeah, I could certainly share it up. the trouble is that I have very limited spare time these days, so couldn't actively maintain it
[04:15:19] <h3r3tic> and the bindings are very limited right now
[04:15:22] <Kelet> jeaye, What version of OpenGL does q^3 require?
[04:15:59] <jeaye> Kelet: 3.2
[04:16:25] <Kelet> Damn, I'm being more and more motivated to dual boot Linux on my main computer, haha
[04:16:26] <jeaye> h3r3tic: I understand. I'm the same way with my bindings. >.<
[04:16:32] <h3r3tic> hah
[04:16:33] <jeaye> Kelet: Do it!
[04:16:37] <jeaye> <3 Linux
[04:16:41] <Kelet> q^3's codebase looks really approachable compared with other similar projects
[04:16:53] <jeaye> I'm fucking shocked to hear that.
[04:16:56] <cmr> blame rust for that, or jeaye's skill?
[04:17:01] <h3r3tic> lol
[04:17:17] <Kelet> jeaye, I've spend many years of my life navigating the old Q2 codebase. I was a developer for a Q2 total conversion mod for a while.
[04:17:21] <Kelet> that was a long time ago though.
[04:17:39] <Kelet> The codebase was very 'clever', which is a good and bad thing..
[04:17:53] <jeaye> I'm trying _very_ hard not to be clever at all in q3.
[04:17:54] <Kelet> Had to be clever back then
[04:17:55] <h3r3tic> Carmack and his "the fewer lines the better"
[04:18:00] <Kelet> With limited hardware and such
[04:18:02] <h3r3tic> now he's all "LINT ALL THE THINGS"
[04:18:21] <Kelet> Yeah, I've been following his twitter since his latest branch out into Haskell and Scheme
[04:18:22] <jeaye> cmr: I've always felt my Rust code is often the "Don't do this" example. :P
[04:18:27] <Kelet> Just to see what he has to say about them
[04:18:40] <h3r3tic> Sweeney might be a better guy for that
[04:19:10] <jeaye> Kelet: That's awesome to hear, dude (working on a Q2 mod).
[04:19:21] <jeaye> I think Q2 was before my time. :P
[04:19:24] <Kelet> Yeah, the primary developer is still working on it actually
[04:19:35] <Kelet> he has the engine up to about a UT2k4 level these days, I think
[04:19:49] <jeaye> Another great game.
[04:19:52] <Kelet> I just kind of got burnt out working with that old engine in 2010+
[04:19:57] <jeaye> aye
[04:19:59] <Kelet> Yeah I was kind of disapointed with UT3
[04:20:05] <jeaye> Agreed.
[04:20:11] <Kelet> good graphics, mediocre gameplay compared with UT99 or UT2k4
[04:20:25] <jeaye> UT3 sacrificed gameplay for graphics
[04:20:32] <jeaye> I couldn't stand the hoverboards
[04:20:42] <jeaye> Not nearly as good as a translocater
[04:20:48] <h3r3tic> +1
[04:21:03] <Kelet> And IIRC, they removed jump into dash or some of those movement things
[04:21:06] <jeaye> I never liked "Dodging" in UT04 though. Doesn't come close to Q3A's strafing.
[04:21:11] <h3r3tic> translocating into people == best thing in UT evar.
[04:21:22] <cmr> jeaye: Well, having read a fair bit of q3, it's not that bad.
[04:21:39] <jeaye> cheers
[04:21:44] <Kelet> the spacing in matrix.rs is a bit weird
[04:21:55] <Kelet> looks like the intention was to align
[04:22:17] <jeaye> Ah, yes. Some of the first Rust I wrote.
[04:22:54] <jeaye> Yeah, it's tough to visually represent a 2D matrix in code.
[04:22:58] <Kelet> jeaye, I haven't wrote much at all, because I've only used it on my crappy laptop. Just wrote the generic factorial and such. I'm actually kind of intimidated by the language because it doesn't have too many 'for learning' examples and it's constantly changing. But I don't mind breakages here and there.
[04:23:13] <Kelet> I was writing my game (a 2d worldbuilding/roguelike type game, think dwarf fortress meets nethack or something) in Ocaml
[04:23:16] <Kelet> but was considering Rust
[04:23:31] <Kelet> I like the memory management model
[04:23:44] <jeaye> "dwarf fortess meets nethack" "worked on Q2" -- dude, we need to chat more often
[04:23:48] <Kelet> hahah
[04:24:39] <cmr> jeaye: How much Rust-induced pain have you gone through with q3, compared to what you'd estimate if it were C++?
[04:24:49] <jeaye> Rust is still at a point where a lot of bits are not fully documented, or that documentation is not adequately accessible. For those bits, I have spent a fair amount of time in #rust begging for help.
[04:25:45] <Kelet> Anyways, I'm going to head out for now, but I'd like to say the existance of a #rust-gamedev really motivates me to work with it more. Props to all the people in here and even more props to those making games in it with the language in this early state and examples/documentation missing
[04:26:04] <jeaye> cmr: I think, if I'd written q3 in C++, I would have networking functional, animated meshes running around, and some destruction of the maps by now.
[04:26:13] <jeaye> Cheers, Kelet 
[04:27:36] <jeaye> cmr: I think that, if I were to take every hour I've spent on q3 and categorize it, at least half would be under 'Figuring out how to do this in Rust'
[04:28:52] <cmr> jeaye: Is it more fun/do you enjoy it?
[04:30:32] <jeaye> When I started, I had a blast. Once I got into q3 and decided it'd be something I was serious about, I was very frustrated with Rust for some time (at least a month). I think I'm at a point with it now where I can express my ideas in terms of Rust without much extra effort, so I'm back to enjoying it. 
[04:30:34] <h3r3tic> jeaye: https://github.com/h3r2tic/assimp-rs/tree/master, https://github.com/h3r2tic/freeimage-rs/tree/master  but yeah, these are extremely barebones.
[04:30:59] <jeaye> If I were to start a new project today... I think I'd do it in C++ (if only for a break from Rust).
[04:31:09] <jeaye> h3r3tic: cheers
[04:31:31] <cmr> jeaye: Sans maturity issues, do you think Rust is suitable for game development, from your experience?
[04:31:43] <cmr> (this impromptu interview is probably going to be in twir!)
[04:32:47] <h3r3tic> cmr: hobby game development? if it's self-hosting and can bind to GL and stuff, it's suitable :)
[04:34:02] <jeaye> Rust solves a lot of problems that exist in the game dev market (specifically the C++ game dev market). I think it's treading a thin line though. In some cases, Rust can feel a bit too restrictive (borrowing, borrowing, borrowing), and that can really put the breaks on development.
[04:35:01] <h3r3tic> can't you side-step it all and use raw pointers if cornered? :P
[04:35:21] <jeaye> If it's going to woo more game developers (especially higher-end game developers), there will need to be idioms developed for mitigating such problems, or such problems would need to be resolved in the language.
[04:35:41] <cmr> Yeah, I think that's a problem throughout Rust at the moment.
[04:35:47] <cmr> "How do I solve this problem in a way that doesn't suck?"
[04:35:58] <cmr> I do think the language needs some expansion.
[04:36:11] <jeaye> h3r3tic: Dropping to `unsafe` can lead to some really unexpected segmenation faults. Even a simple transmute_mut can fuck you over.
[04:36:20] <h3r3tic> ouch
[04:38:49] <h3r3tic> I'm kinda expecting the main devs to encounter just about the same issues with Servo
[04:39:04] <tiffany> I just spent multiple hours trying to figure out how to implement frp using generics without resorting to enums or unsafe
[04:39:15] <tiffany> the only way I could find was to use channels and tons of tasks
[04:39:17] <cmr> h3r3tic: servo has its own set of problems
[04:39:21] <tiffany> so yeah,  there are some things rust is bad at expressing
[04:39:50] <cmr> tiffany: Given that Rust is aimed more at the C++ niche, do you think it's a significant flaw in the language?
[04:40:33] <zeuxcg> my experience is roughly the same, I happily write code until I hit a speed bump and spend several hours trying to figure out how to write something in a way that's not completely horrible
[04:41:00] <tiffany> for people writing C++ in rust, no
[04:41:04] <h3r3tic> cmr: what I mean is that the design patterns used in gamedev aren't all that unique, and if they find some stuff annoying, hopefully they'll improve the language / libs to support more patterns without pain. that's why I have more faith in Rust than say, D. the devs eating their own dog food is of major significance.
[04:41:11] <tiffany> but for people who are more interested in writing FP it's a major hurdle
[04:41:52] <jeaye> cmr: In a production setting, game developers are force-pushed by product managers into implementing adhoc features in tight deadlines, or completely changing the way something (often visually simple) works. C++ will let the developer do what he/she wants, but maybe bite back later. I've hit some cases where idiomatic C++ was not going to work at all, and I had to take a step back and
[04:41:53] <jeaye> completely rethink my design. If Rust isn't going to support common C++ design patterns well (singleton, for example), it'll likely have to make their alternatives very clear.
[04:42:42] <tiffany> hm
[04:42:44] <tiffany> you know
[04:42:56] <zeuxcg> h3r3tic: my feeling is that overall the language won't change much, but maybe people who write in the language will discover how to write code better
[04:43:06] <h3r3tic> quite often the ad-hoc hacking-up of code in gamedev just puts you into massive technical debt, so I'm not so sure if making it more difficult is such a bad thing :)
[04:43:08] <zeuxcg> i.e. maybe it's unreasonable to expect to write code comfortably in Rust after a few weeks
[04:43:15] <zeuxcg> compared to, um, years in C++ :-D
[04:43:18] <cmr> zeuxcg: The language still has some significant semantic changes on the way.
[04:43:26] <h3r3tic> zeuxcg: hehe, gotcha
[04:43:28] <zeuxcg> cmr: hmm, such as?
[04:43:41] <cmr> zeuxcg: nmatsakis has a lot of work he wants to do in the borrow checker still
[04:43:45] <tiffany> rust has that difficulty to write that functional languages tend to have, in that it's harder to hack around problems
[04:44:00] <tiffany> but it doesn't have the high level abstractions to help you on your way
[04:44:27] <jeaye> " ad-hoc hacking-up of code in gamedev just puts you into massive technical debt" My job, actually, is making sure that doesn't happen. :P
[04:44:47] <jeaye> Because it happens so easily.
[04:44:51] <h3r3tic> "let's just make everything mutable!"
[04:45:00] <jeaye> s/mutable/public/
[04:45:14] <h3r3tic> as in the C++ "mutable" :P
[04:45:20] <h3r3tic> it's const, but it's not!
[04:45:21] <jeaye> Oh, even worse
[04:45:23] <jeaye> haha
[04:45:50] <cmr> zeuxcg: especially around rvalues and expressing some safe patterns.
[04:45:53] <h3r3tic> and since we're having fun, let's "#define volatile"
[04:46:28] <cmr> I have mostly been using Rust to replace what I'd be doing in Python or plain C, and I very much enjoy it.
[04:46:37] <jeaye> zeuxcg: You do bring up a fair point though.
[04:46:47] <cmr> It's interesting what other peoples' experiences are, from different backgrounds.
[04:47:05] <jeaye> I'm comparing nearly a decade of C++ work with 6 months of Rust work.
[04:47:24] <cmr> jeaye: surely it's been more than 6 months?
[04:47:35] <jeaye> I don't think so.
[04:47:41] <cmr> We can't have started at the same time, I'm pretty sure q3 existed when I popped into the Rust universe
[04:48:10] <cmr> Yeah, 6 months
[04:48:13] <cmr> Huh!
[04:48:33] <jeaye> https://github.com/jeaye/q3/commit/9a020b66417a1839798a969538908c552aa64f71

[19:55:14] <cmr> jeaye: I saw your message in #q3, I'll be sure to include it
[19:55:17] <cmr> ...when I get around to twir
[19:55:38] <jeaye> Kickass. Thanks very much.
[19:55:53] <jeaye> q3 reached the 0.2 milestone last night. :D
[19:55:58] <cmr> Awesome!

[20:03:15] <maik> typedef struct _ENetCallbacks {    void * (ENET_CALLBACK * malloc) (size_t size);
[20:03:26] <maik> is this an anonymous function?
[20:03:30] <maik> in c
[20:05:21] <cmr> It's a function pointer
[20:05:45] <maik> but it has no name?
[20:05:48] <jeaye> That's a function pointer called malloc to a function of type: void* (size_t)
[20:06:07] <jeaye> return_type (*var_name)(params...)
[20:06:18] <jeaye> ^ formula for C function pointer declarations
[20:06:30] <maik> ah okay thanks
[20:06:34] <jeaye> sure
[20:07:04] <jeaye> (C doesn't really have anonymous functions)
[20:08:22] <cmr> The equivalent rust would be `extern "C" fn malloc(libc::size_t) -> *libc::c_void`
[20:13:22] <maik> so I would write it like this? `struct ENetCallbacks { malloc: extern "C" fn malloc(libc::size_t) -> *libc::c_void} `
[20:13:42] <cmr> no, you wouldn't duplicate the name.
[20:13:51] <maik> ups
[20:13:53] <cmr> struct ENetCallbacks { malloc: extern "C" fn (libc::size_t) -> *libc::c_void}
[20:13:59] <maik> yeah was a typo
[20:14:04] <maik> okay thank you very much <3
[20:15:00] <maik> btw the ¸"ENET_CALLBACK" is just #define ENET_CALLBACK. is this unimportant?
[20:33:03] <jeaye> Yes.
[20:33:21] <jeaye> It could be just for searchability.
[20:33:42] <Amaranth> Is that the place you'd put the calling convention?
[20:34:37] <jeaye> Amaranth: Yes.
[20:34:48] <jeaye> But it's not defined for him anyway.

[22:21:54] <jeaye> Kelet: Good luck!
[22:35:51] <Kelet> I've got a good feeling about this build
[22:36:20] <Kelet> I'm actually compiling files, never got quite this far. I believe there where some fixes in git recently for Windows regarding some broken headers in mingw
[22:36:33] <Kelet> (Peculiar that I got them when many others didn't, but I'm past the point it usually fails at)
[22:49:51] <Luqman> Kelet: i've recently setup a windows build and it went well so it should work

[23:19:49] <Kelet> got it to build with 4.8.1, woohoo
[23:21:47] <cmr> Nice!
[23:22:05] <cmr> I tried to build yesterday with whatever mingw I had lying around from when I built shortly after 0.7 and it didn't work
[23:22:05] <jeaye> huzzah
[23:22:36] <jeaye> I'm pulling out and old laptop this week or next to put Windows on it and see if I can't get Rust going.
[23:22:37] <Kelet> Now later to try building a few rust packages
[23:23:03] <cmr> Kelet: build q3!
[23:23:15] <jeaye> hah
[23:23:48] <Kelet> I will try that probably later this week actually
[23:24:02] <Kelet> I'm rust-retarded right now though, I read the docs/tutorial but not much actual experience
