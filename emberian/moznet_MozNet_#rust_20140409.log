[00:18:24] <meyer> It might be nice if the docs for an item listed if it is included in prelude. Or maybe, more generally, the places where it is re-exported.
[00:18:57] <huon> meyer: file a bug :)
[00:19:07] <meyer> Alright.
[00:19:20] <huon> (for the prelude specifically, http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/master/std/prelude/index.html lists everything)
[00:19:26] <ktt3ja> what does the return type `!` mean?
[00:19:43] <mcpherrin> ktt3ja: it means it doesn't return
[00:19:45] <huon> doesn't return

[00:20:19] <mcpherrin> It's basically the "bottom" type if that means anything to you.
[00:20:23] <meyer> huon: I know. But I've found myself accidentally re-importing things already in Prelude, or using a deeper path for something that was re-exported in, say, std:io

[00:57:00] <tyoverby> What does it mean that I can't call a generic method through an object?
[00:57:04] <tyoverby> Isn't that the point?
[00:57:25] <strcat> tyoverby: no, traits are usually used for static dispatch via type bounds on generics
[00:57:27] <strcat> not as trait objects
[00:57:32] <sfackler> tyoverby: not a method that itself is generic
[00:57:35] <strcat> as a trait object, you can't call any method using generics or Self
[00:57:54] <huon> generic methods need to be monomorphised for each instantiation of the bounds, and if the type is erased (i.e. a trait object) the exact method that needs monomorphisation is not known.
[00:59:02] <tyoverby> I thought the point of Objects was that it starts using dynamic dispatch and anything returned from that keeps the specification dictated by the trait?

[01:01:05] <strcat> or just give in and use an enum, dynamic dispatch is silly! ;p

[02:29:46] <swgillespie> hi all, I'm poking around rust's LLVM layer and I'm wondering where the LLVM function "_ZN10lang_start20hc31dc88349ce747dOqd5v0.10E" comes from? is this from the rust runtime?

[03:06:03] <burntsushi> brson: pfft. nope. pure rust.

[03:06:17] <brson> ah
[03:06:39] <burntsushi> perf diff is likely due to the fact that my implementation (which is about a week old) has almost no optimizations. so most of the big differences (i think) are a result of optimizations kicking in.

[03:07:01] <burntsushi> e.g., look at the medium/hard benchmarks. rust is actually a bit faster in some of them. (likely because neither are using optimizations)

[08:08:39] <Yurume> C/C++ is notorious for being hard to parse (the correct parser has to rely on the semantic analysis)
[08:09:24] <jroweboy> Yurume: but when I think about it, no other thing in the grammar allows an identifier as the first thing right? a function could just be identifier<lifetime>(Params) -> retval in the grammar and still be just as easy to parse (I think)
[08:10:12] <jroweboy> I'm just going out on a limb when I make that assumption since I'm not too overly familiar with the grammar :)
[08:11:31] <Yurume> jroweboy: then `identifier(exprs...)` would be a function invocation while `identifier(params...) -> retval { ... }` would be a function declaration. :S
[08:11:55] <Yurume> technically, yes. practically, this requires an arbitrary amount of lookaheads (and lots of backtrackings).
[08:12:23] <Yurume> I also like the possibility to grep `fn foo` to search for the declaration of the function foo ;)

[08:13:22] <flaper87> Also, that small amount of explictness is great
[08:13:45] <jroweboy> Because otherwise starting a line with identifier would just indicate that it is the start of a function.

[08:32:16] <jroweboy> Okay, just finished writing up an email explaining that one, now the other question I struggled to answer was how exactly does rust prevent data races? I know there is no shared mutable global state in rust for starters, but where is somewhere that I can find out about exactly how the concurrency primitives work together to prevent data races and other threading issues?

[11:53:58] <cmr> farcaller: macros can only be in expression, statement, or item position.
[11:54:00] <kimundi> farcaller: Rusts macros are not dumb text macros, they work on the AST and the language grammar directly. However, that also means that you can't invoke them in any position
[11:54:06] <cmr> methods in an impl are none of those.
[11:54:14] <farcaller> ah
[11:54:19] *** Quits: celm (celm@moz-1CF4AE70.hsd1.ca.comcast.net) (Ping timeout)
[11:54:21] <cmr> it's honestly just a limitation of macros.
[11:54:32] <cmr> it's possible to have a macro be expanded anywhere
[11:54:35] <farcaller> rust macro system sounds more clever than I am :(
[11:54:36] <cmr> the complexity just skyrockets.
[11:54:45] <huon> methods should be ok, though
[11:54:51] <huon> especially with associated items
[11:54:59] <huon> when it'd just be expanding to an item
[11:55:54] <farcaller> also no ident concatenation, that's a feature I'd really like to see
[11:56:56] <huon> ident catting kills grep :(
[11:57:24] <farcaller> no ident catting requires explicit naming for getter/setter/reg
[11:57:44] <farcaller> I might need to dedicate some time figuring how to write programmatic macros though
[11:58:15] <huon> yeah, that's true, but... on the other hand, getters and setters kill me :P
[11:58:43] <cmr> you should be able to say get_$name iirc

[17:27:54] <eddyb> if you do .as_slice(), you can fiddle with that, can't you?
[17:27:59] <Tari> I expect this code to be pretty hot; basically part of a pipeline that takes [A] and turns it into [B]
[17:28:08] <eddyb> Tari: sounds like you want iterators

[17:28:50] <Eridius> eddyb: Tari was asking for uninitialized memory
[17:28:54] <Tari> I suppose I might be able to do an iterator over [T]s
[17:29:09] <eddyb> you can extend a slice if you know it was initialized

[17:30:19] <SiegeLord> I have a struct A{ a: Option<~int>, b: Option<~int> }, is it possible to get a &mut int simultaneously from those two fields?
[17:30:46] <Tari> I think iterators yielding slices might involve a lot of copies though
[17:30:46] <Eridius> eddyb: "almost always" maybe stretching it. If you're mapping an iterator on a vector/slice, then sure, but there's lots of iterator operations that reduce the accuracy of the size hint
[17:30:47] <Ms2ger> Maybe with destructuring?
[17:30:48] <Veld> did you try pattern matching?
[17:31:01] <Ms2ger> { ref mut x: a, ...
[17:31:06] <Ms2ger> Or something
[17:31:14] <Ms2ger> I don't remember the exact syntax
[17:31:22] <Eridius> SiegeLord: you can destructure with `let A{ ref mut a, ref mut b } = mystruct;` and then transform a/b
[17:31:30] <SiegeLord> Hmm
[17:31:30] <Eridius> or you can use a `match` statement to reach into the Options directly

[17:33:11] <Eridius> Tari: do they have to be ~[T]? They can't be &[T]?
[17:33:40] <Eridius> Tari: I'm guessing at this point that you should just go ahead with the straightforward impl using ~[T] and then figure out later if you can remove allocations

[18:12:11] <Tari> is there a way to specify to Zero::zero() that I want a T?
[18:12:14] <Leo`> I should read some docs about those "allocations APIs"
[18:12:15] <eddyb> (that way, shrink_to_fit doesn't cost anything under the threshold. and it's not like a mremap is going to be felt if you're working with that large of vectors)
[18:12:21] <eddyb> Tari: let x: T = Zero::zero();
[18:12:26] <Tari> without a let :)
[18:12:30] <Tobba> with ~[T] the size would be the capacity though
[18:12:32] <Ms2ger> No
[18:12:33] <eddyb> Leo`: strcat has an RFC, I think
[18:12:34] <Ms2ger> Well
[18:12:40] <Tari> I guess I can explicitly include the types in my map()
[18:12:41] <Tobba> so I dont see the problem with allocator that need the size upon freeing
[18:12:42] <Ms2ger> If you have something that takes a T
[18:13:08] <Tari> I want Zero::zero() of T in a map::<A, T>
[18:13:09] <Overv> What could be causing "fn main() { let a = 3.14; println!("{:?}", a as f32); }" to print "126443840048f32" instead of "3.14f32" in the nightly binary on Windows? Bug in Rust or perhaps bad gcc version?
[18:13:16] <Tari> so type inference is falling down a little
[18:13:23] <Leo`> Tobba: yep, but converting a Vec<T> to a ~[T] would thus require dropping the extra capacity

[18:41:05] <Eridius> you can't take a mutable reference on the receiver while that borrow exists

[22:33:54] <kimundi> You can have many & to the same data, and a &T is copyable. But you can have only one &mut to a T, and the &mut moves. And because of the way borrowing works that bubbles up the type: with foo.iter(), foo gets frozen but you can still pass &foo around while the borrows caused by .iter() last. With .mut_iter(), foo become inaccessible for anything else as long as the borrow by the mut_iter lasts.
[22:33:59] <kimundi> dpc: ^
[22:34:38] <dpc> That does not prevent iter_mut() having the same name as iter() really.
[22:35:18] <kimundi> Even if you could find a sane way to make something generic over that difference, not every collection allows you to mutate its content, so it would need to be seperate anyway
[22:35:21] <dpc> It's just current limitation / design choice of the language.
