[16:19:45] <huon> nmatsakis: ping
[16:45:36] <nmatsakis> huon: pong
[16:47:10] <huon> nmatsakis: so, my current baseline SIMD proposal is quite... weakly typed. Things are only defined to be checked in trans when full type info is known, of course, simd libs will generally impose more type safety with traits etc, but this isn't required.
[16:47:45] <nmatsakis> yes, I saw that
[16:47:58] <huon> nmatsakis: however, since these will be stable, "anyone" can use them, and can use them without adding bounds. I'm a little nervous about this, because it seems like something that could be abused for crazy non-SIMD related type tricks
[16:48:12] <huon> do you have any thoughts?
[16:48:33] <nmatsakis> huon: I filed it away as something to think about, but I didn't have thoughts yet =)
[16:48:52] <nmatsakis> huon: I guess I have to print out your document and try to review in more detail
[16:49:06] <nmatsakis> huon: my thought though is starting this way makes some sense, and we can try to layer traits on
[16:49:08] <huon> I've made non-trivial revisions to the pre-RFC
[16:49:16] <huon> (so don't print that)
[16:49:24] <nmatsakis> well, print the next revision then I guess
[16:49:46] <huon> heh
[16:50:07] <huon> anyway, since you don't have anything specific right now, I'll post it as a proper RFC; the internals discussion has died down a little
