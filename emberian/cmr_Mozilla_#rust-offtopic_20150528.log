[00:00:02] <leftylink> man, I kind of want to be able to wavedash in real life

[00:02:09] <leftylink> TAS runs can be pretty funny to watch though
[00:02:21] <eddyb> aturon: do you happen to remember who we met during the first night in Portland?
[00:02:28] <niconii> okay, so the next issue with this build is
[00:02:46] <niconii> it's looking for a file freebasic owns called fbrt0.o
[00:03:00] <aturon> eddyb: Morgan, https://twitter.com/mrrrgn
[00:03:05] <niconii> and it's doing that by looking in directories relative to the fbc binary
[00:04:04] <niconii> that's at /usr/bin/fbc, so it looks in /usr/bin/lib/, /usr/lib/, /usr/lib/freebasic/
[00:04:24] <niconii> and then the absolute paths /usr/share/freebasic/lib and /usr/local/lib/freebasic
[00:04:43] <niconii> ...unfortunately, it's at /usr/lib/freebasic/linux-x86_64/fbrt0.o
[00:05:00] <eddyb> aturon: thanks! I remmebered her when I saw the announcement about Emily and DevOps
[00:05:46] <eddyb> but the latter is a new hire, not just "borrowing" from other parts of Mozilla, it seems
[00:06:18] <aturon> indeed :)
[00:06:24] <niconii> ah, no, i see, it's appending target to all of those
[00:06:49] <niconii> but i set target to "linux", not "linux-x86_64"... i guess i'll try that
[00:07:54] <niconii> ...well
[00:08:01] <eddyb> edunham: oh, you're here. hi!
[00:08:05] <niconii> it... sorta started building

[00:09:22] <WindowsBunny> eddyb: Not yet
[00:09:38] <WindowsBunny> eddyb: And I'm pretty sure mozilla IRC has a limit on how many IRC channels I can be in
[00:10:00] <eddyb> file as a bug
[00:10:04] <Sho> I had to have freenode raise my limit at some point
[00:10:04] <WindowsBunny> I know other IRC servers have a limit of 50
[00:10:15] <niconii> MAXCHANNELS=100 on mozilla
[00:10:28] <niconii> i'm a little concerned if you've actually hit that limit
[00:10:29] <edunham> eddyb: i've been registered on this network for like... 3 months longer than you? ed<tab> battle!
[00:10:30] <WindowsBunny> niconii: Not enough
[00:10:49] <WindowsBunny> niconii: I have 420 -sys crates and eddyb wants me to have a channel for each :P

[00:16:09] <niconii> so, ohrrpgce uses the c preprocessor... on its freebasic files
[00:17:12] <niconii> oh, no, freebasic just has a preprocessor that looks exactly the *same* as the C preprocessor, my mistake

[06:52:30] <niconii> anyway i found a partial solution
[06:52:47] <niconii> using -B2,8 makes the latency on timidity a lot better
[06:53:05] <niconii> but now i have another problem: occasionally it just craps out entirely
[06:53:38] <niconii> and actually, that happens even without that option

[09:52:56] <WindowsBunny> (2:27:13 AM) niconii: wish i had a windows computer to run this on
[09:53:01] <WindowsBunny> yay windows
[09:54:52] <Quxxy> Windows-using master race represent *fistbump*
[09:55:12] *** Quits: Rym (y@moz-c2u.sd4.38.217.IP) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[09:55:30] <WindowsBunny> I like Windows because its a much more standard place to develop in
[09:56:11] <Quxxy> I like Windows because I've never once be able to render the system unbootable because I *dared* to enable multiple monitor support
[09:56:24] <Quxxy> And I've never had an issue with sound after ~1997
[09:56:38] <WindowsBunny> yeah, Windows is typically better about video and audio
[09:56:42] <Quxxy> And I've never had intractible network issues
[09:56:47] <Quxxy> Or intractible dialup issues
[09:56:52] <Quxxy> And I can play games
[09:56:56] <WindowsBunny> One thing I never got working on linux is getting it to switch to my headphones when I plugged them in
[09:57:05] <WindowsBunny> in fact, I have a hard time even manually switching to my headphones
[09:57:08] <Quxxy> And I can run 85% of the software that runs on linux *anyway*
[09:57:18] <eddyb> WindowsBunny: lol
[09:57:19] <niconii> there's things i don't like about windows, but at least it acknowledges the need for built-in sound rather than having like, four competing audio plugins
[09:57:26] <WindowsBunny> and I'll be fucked if I'm going to spend an hour googling shit to write some obscure script in some obscure location to do it
[09:57:26] <eddyb> PulseAudio circa 2010?
[09:57:31] <Quxxy> And the UI doesn't radically alter in asinine, counter-productive ways at random, throwing years of muscle memory out the... oh... wait...
[09:57:44] <Mutabah> niconii: Fun fact - There's HEAPS of windows sound APIs
[09:57:45] <Quxxy> Sorry, were you saying something?  I was kinda in the zone there for a bit
[09:57:46] <eddyb> WindowsBunny: oh, wait, ubuntu is debian-ish so it's bound to be behind
[09:57:53] <Mutabah> niconii: Just the old ones are kept around
[09:58:09] <eddyb> niconii: "plugins"?
[09:58:14] <WindowsBunny> The old ones are kept around for backwards compat
[09:58:17] <WindowsBunny> but they work just fine
[09:58:32] <eddyb> niconii: guess what ALSA stands for
[09:58:44] <niconii> eddyb: i was struggling to come up with a term for 'em
[09:59:06] <Quxxy> A Lurid Salsa Application?
[09:59:21] <eddyb> L and S come from Linux and Sound :P
[09:59:23] <WindowsBunny> The fact that Windows can give me easy control over my audio devices, and even let me adjust the relative volume of different applications
[09:59:34] <Mutabah> WindowsBunny: Pulse gives you that
[09:59:36] <eddyb> WindowsBunny: so can PulseAudio
[09:59:42] <eddyb> it has been able to do that for ages
[09:59:49] <Mutabah> Actually - Modern pulseaudio is better than win7's sound control
[09:59:56] <eddyb> I can quickly switch my laptop from 2.0 to 4.0
[10:00:03] <Mutabah> (More centralise,d less things working around it)
[10:00:06] <Quxxy> ... until you try running a program that doesn't use it and then all hell breaks loose*
[10:00:07] <WindowsBunny> The only problem is that most linux distros don't really expose it in a nice gui
[10:00:13] <niconii> really the main thing i like about windows is that, y'know
[10:00:21] <eddyb> WindowsBunny: that's not a distro issue
[10:00:22] <niconii> i *don't* need to know about this shit
[10:00:23] <Quxxy> * based on this, like, one time I tried to run a DOOM port and OH GOD everything was on fire
[10:00:26] <eddyb> WindowsBunny: there's pavucontrol and kmix
[10:00:28] <eddyb> they're both fine
[10:00:45] <eddyb> Quxxy: how?!
[10:01:06] <eddyb> Quxxy: actually, nothing needs to use pulseaudio
[10:01:11] <eddyb> AFAIK
[10:01:18] <Quxxy> eddyb: I don't bloody well know... I think it used some old API that conflicted with the *new* API, and I had to give it root and... I think I got sound back *eventually*
[10:01:30] <eddyb> yeah, I don't think chrome knows about pulseaudio at all
[10:01:47] <eddyb> Quxxy: wat
[10:01:50] <Quxxy> I find that things tend to Just Work on Windows *way* more reliably than on Linux.  That said, *IF* they work on Linux, they tend to work better, and if you don't like how things work on Windows *cough*Metro*cough*, you're kinda screwed
[10:01:55] <eddyb> there's ALSA and there's pulseaudio
[10:02:20] <eddyb> if software is using anything else, it's old enough that it shouldn't compile anymore
[10:02:28] <eddyb> so what are you doing running old binaries :P?
[10:02:40] <eddyb> (I know, I'm not exactly technically correct. but come on. what *other* API?)
[10:02:42] <Quxxy> eddyb: It said 'configure; make install', I dids that
[10:02:49] <Quxxy> I keep being told "lol compiling from source is easy"
[10:02:54] <Quxxy> Then everything explodes
[10:03:05] <benh> Wish there was a way to control volume per-application *without* using pulseaudio :(
[10:03:34] <Quxxy> eddyb: Also, Windows still runs stuff from bloody DOS
[10:03:57] <eddyb> I haven't compiled from source for ages now
[10:04:01] <eddyb> benh: wat
[10:04:05] <Quxxy> Hell, I could probably run my old VB5 programs... if I could find any of them
[10:04:09] <eddyb> benh: how does that make sense?
[10:04:18] <eddyb> it's like wanting to have sound without a sound layer
[10:04:37] <Quxxy> *Hell*, I could take my VB5 libraries and use them from a brand new C# program
[10:04:42] <Quxxy> That's a scary thought
[10:04:46] <eddyb> or access files without a VFS
[10:05:06] <eddyb> Quxxy: I thought DOS compatibility was nuked
[10:05:15] <Quxxy> Oh hey, cargo actually compiled this time
[10:05:25] <eddyb> what are you doing compiling cargo from source?
[10:05:28] <Quxxy> eddyb: Thinking about it, you're probably more right than not
[10:05:44] <Quxxy> eddyb: Because I need to make a cargo-rustig command to keep from going completely insane
[10:05:57] <Quxxy> and I need to ask Cargo where the source file is, the crate name, the rustc flags, etc.
[10:06:09] <eddyb> cargo read-manifest :P
[10:06:19] <eddyb> actually
[10:06:20] <Quxxy> I tried that and it didn't seem to do anything
[10:06:26] <eddyb> can't you just use cargo rustc?
[10:06:27] <Quxxy> and there's no documentation for it
[10:06:38] <Quxxy> ... how do I use cargo rustc to run something that isn't rustc?
[10:07:03] <benh> eddyb: it doesn't seem terribly farfetched that something got intercept the audio before it reaches the kernel and tone it down a bit based on process name if nothing else
[10:07:14] <benh> s/got/could
[10:07:37] <eddyb> benh: that's what pulseaudio does...
[10:07:39] <eddyb> Quxxy: cargo rustc -v -- -V
[10:07:41] <eddyb> :P
[10:08:19] <benh> in my experience what pulseaudio does it mostly make things not work until i jiggle individual programs' settings, and then eventually go into a mode where it just sends static at my speakers until i kill and restart it
[10:08:32] <Quxxy> eddyb: ... I'm *almost* tempted to try that... but then I'd have to parse the whole thing
[10:08:44] <eddyb> benh: have you also been using versions from 2010 recently?
[10:08:48] <eddyb> Quxxy: "parse"?
[10:08:51] <benh> and behave badly as i plug in/unplug headsets
[10:08:54] <Quxxy> I'm hoping that mutilating cargo rustdoc is easier
[10:09:00] <benh> eddyb: well no, i stopped around back then :P
[10:09:13] <benh> pulseaudio seems a lot more involved than just that one feature tho :(
[10:09:20] <Quxxy> I only want the ... oh damnit, it doesn't have the rustlib folder
[10:09:28] <Quxxy> Damnit, now I have to figure out how to get *that*
[10:09:45] <Quxxy> Anyway, I need that, and the --externs... --cfgs and --triple
[10:09:52] <eddyb> Quxxy: cargo rustc -v -- -V 2>/dev/null | grep Running | sed 's/^ *Running `//;s/`$//'
[10:10:09] <Quxxy> eddyb: depending on sh is an auto-fail :P
[10:10:16] <eddyb> Quxxy: ...
[10:10:21] <eddyb> that's showing you it's trivial to "parse"
[10:10:34] <eddyb> you can do the string manipulation in your Rust program
[10:10:37] <Quxxy> No, I meant the actual argument invocation
[10:11:06] <eddyb> huh?
[10:11:44] <eddyb> what it gives me is
[10:11:45] <Quxxy> I have to strip out the arguments I want from a raw string, which potentially means also implementing whatever shell quoting rules are in use
[10:11:46] <eddyb> rustc src/main.rs --crate-name inflate_test --crate-type bin -g -V --out-dir /home/eddy/Projects/super-image/inflate-test/target/debug --emit=dep-info,link -L dependency=/home/eddy/Projects/super-image/inflate-test/target/debug -L dependency=/home/eddy/Projects/super-image/inflate-test/target/debug/deps --extern flate2=/home/eddy/Projects/super-image/inflate-test/target/debug/deps/libflate2-4d1fbb00be4a22dd.rlib -L native=/home/eddy/Projects/
[10:11:48] <eddyb> super-image/inflate-test/target/debug/build/miniz-sys-d7e62e66665f9648/out
[10:12:04] <eddyb> Quxxy: oh, you mean *that*
[10:12:13] <Quxxy> That's also assuming rustc doesn't have any abberant switches
[10:12:26] <eddyb> why don't you strip the arguments you don't need?
[10:12:31] <eddyb> none of them use quoting AFAIK
[10:12:40] <Quxxy> Unless there's a space in a path
[10:12:56] <eddyb> oh, I see what you mean
[10:13:08] <Quxxy> And then you start playing "well, is \ an escape sequence or not, oh it depends on the shell, kill me now"
[10:13:23] <Quxxy> I'd *really* like to avoid that shit
[10:13:31] <eddyb> ha
[10:13:33] <eddyb> hahahaha
[10:13:36] <Quxxy> *Hence* cargo from source
[10:13:44] <eddyb> rustc src/main.rs --crate-name inflate_test --crate-type bin -g -V --out-dir /home/eddy/Projects/super-image/inflate test/target/debug --emit=dep-info,link -L dependency=/home/eddy/Projects/super-image/inflate test/target/debug -L dependency=/home/eddy/Projects/super-image/inflate test/target/debug/deps --extern flate2=/home/eddy/Projects/super-image/inflate test/target/debug/deps/libflate2-4d1fbb00be4a22dd.rlib -L native=/home/eddy/Projects/

[10:13:56] <benh> i love the different regex flavors between vim, sed, perl etc
[10:13:58] <Quxxy> See
[10:14:01] <Quxxy> See?
[10:14:02] <benh> keeps you from becoming complacent
[10:14:05] <Quxxy> This is the shit I'm talking about
[10:14:10] <eddyb> so, uhm, renaming the folder doesn't update -L native
[10:14:15] <eddyb> which is interesting
[10:14:21] <eddyb> and all the paths are fucked
[10:14:25] <eddyb> of course they are
[10:14:36] <Quxxy> Damn cowboys and their laisse faire attitude to quoting
[10:14:54] <eddyb> grr
[10:15:07] <eddyb> I just need a goddamn JSON output of the default arguments or something
[10:15:12] <eddyb> is it really that hard?
[10:16:24] <Quxxy> eddyb: *Yes*

[10:41:34] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: The problem is that in order to determine whether it can use color it checks whether stdout isatty, but that's only true for a proper windows console
[10:41:41] <Quxxy> Yeah
[10:41:52] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: Yet, if it actually attempts to do terminal coloring it _first_ checks TERM
[10:41:53] <Quxxy> The Windows console subsystem is just massively stupid
[10:42:18] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: Which means that if you open a cmd.exe from msys, and then run rustc, it'll realize its a tty, but then see TERM and output ansi codes to cmd.exe
[10:42:22] <Quxxy> I'm still annoyed that Win9x had better support for ANSI escapes
[10:43:06] <Quxxy> WindowsBunny: Hahaha, oh, that's beautiful :D
[10:43:24] <Quxxy> I'm semi tempted to revive my old Ansi decoder filter I wrote for D ages ago
[10:43:54] <Quxxy> Wrap it around an output stream, and it interprets the ANSI escapes *if* it's attached to a console, then either strips or passes them through unmodified otherwise

[10:54:18] <Quxxy> I haven't seriously tried debugging Rust on Windows in a while; is it tolerable yet?

[11:05:34] <Quxxy> Do you do the Windows builds?
[11:05:40] <Quxxy> Do you do the Windows builds?
[11:05:41] <Quxxy> Oops
[11:05:44] <Quxxy> As in, the official ones?
[11:05:54] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: Every call to make on the windows buildbots goes through a program I wrote
[11:05:58] <Quxxy> (Typing on shitty media PC keyboard; / is right next to up)
[11:06:10] * Quxxy *fistbump* WindowsBunny
[11:06:26] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: You can see it at the beginning of each build log
[11:06:30] <WindowsBunny> 'c:/dojob.exe' 'make'
[11:06:48] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: And this is the code for it https://github.com/retep998/dojob-rs/blob/master/src/main.rs
[11:07:00] <WindowsBunny> pure unadulterated winapi :D
[11:07:30] <Quxxy>  // If there's more than 0x100 zombies you have problems
[11:07:35] <Quxxy> No, then you have an award-winning TV series
[11:08:04] <Quxxy> It *looks* like Win32 code: lots and lots of really long function names and hideously unsafe code :D
[11:08:59] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: This code is needed because tests sometimes deadlock, leaving zombie processes that buildbot never cleans up
[11:09:07] <WindowsBunny> which then ruin future builds
[11:09:26] <Quxxy> How do you deal with the tests that spit out crash dialogs?
[11:09:33] <WindowsBunny> buildbot runs as a service
[11:09:37] <Quxxy> Ah, ok
[11:09:46] <Quxxy> Makes sense :P
[11:09:58] <WindowsBunny> so dojob just wraps make in a job object
[11:10:34] <WindowsBunny> and triple checks to make sure the job object is properly terminated no matter what
[11:11:18] <WindowsBunny> job objects are very useful, you can use them to impose ram/cpu limits and stuff

[11:15:40] <Quxxy> I need a Config
[11:15:57] <WindowsBunny> >Live samples of the anthrax virus were inadvertently sent from a Defense  Department research facility to labs in nine states as well as a  military base in South Korea

[11:16:24] <Quxxy> WindowsBunny: https://gist.github.com/DanielKeep/695d5baf3a3276840f61
[11:16:45] <Quxxy> (The wonky Python output has since been fixed)
[11:17:20] <WindowsBunny> so what exactly is rustig
[11:17:47] <Quxxy> It takes a Rust crate and spits out an interface for another language; currently C and Python
[11:18:03] <WindowsBunny> neat
[11:18:10] <Quxxy> At least, for things that are compatible with C ffi
[11:18:42] <Quxxy> I figure it would be neat for those "Use Rust from X!" articles if they could literally just /rustig/ to get the interface
[11:19:31] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: Now if only you could get it going the other way from official winapi headers _with_ macro constants
[11:20:11] <Quxxy> I have a partial prototype that does that
[11:20:43] <Quxxy> Uses clang's cindex and some truly *horrific* code to try and reconstruct the conditional compilation flags from the parsed headers
[11:21:05] <Quxxy> Does some really dodgy pattern matching to try and extract different kinds of macros
[11:22:09] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: I'd actually be interested if you could make something that can just take a COM definition and spit out a RIDL! rust interface
[11:22:14] <Quxxy> I started it because no one seems to be paying any attention to that whole "WinRT" thing, which I think is going to be a long-term mistake
[11:22:30] <Quxxy> Yeah, funny you should say that
[11:23:01] <Quxxy> I actually *started* on my hideous win32-bindgen because I was trying to write a com-bindgen that worked from the compiled TLB binaries using the system loader
[11:23:08] <Quxxy> Which, of course, you access via COM
[11:23:20] <Quxxy> So I was trying to bootstrap the whole thing
[11:23:39] <Quxxy> It doesn't help that the documentation for all of this is... *somewhat lacking*
[11:24:16] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: It's probably easier to bind IDL than C headers
[11:24:22] <Quxxy> Part of the reason I gave up was because I couldn't work out a sane way of even generating the COM interfaces on the Rust side
[11:24:32] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: I already have the Rust side covered
[11:24:43] <Quxxy> No, I mean, I was binding the TLBs; binary databases of type information

[14:46:57] <Sho> Quxxy, rewind is the central gameplay mechanic in the game the video was of :)

[15:13:50] <WindowsBunny> Because you'd have to parse the SAL annotations as well
[15:14:19] <WindowsBunny> Personally I prefer to convert to/from UTF-16 only when needed

[15:16:02] <eddyb> microsoft brought this upon themselves

[15:16:48] <WindowsBunny> They switched to Unicode in a time when people thought UCS-2 was enough

[15:17:18] <eddyb> no, they switched to a half-assed double-wide subset of Unicode
[15:17:27] <eddyb> Unicode + indexing is absurd
[15:17:35] <WindowsBunny> That's because people thought UCS-2 was enough back then

[15:17:40] <WindowsBunny> but then it turned out they were wrong
[15:17:42] <eddyb> for what?
[15:17:50] <eddyb> again, indexing is useless
[15:17:51] <WindowsBunny> for all of unicode!
[15:18:01] <eddyb> the only reason they wanted a fixed encoding is O(1) indexing
[15:18:02] <WindowsBunny> People though fitting everything in 65536 codepoints was possible
[15:18:11] <eddyb> even if they fit, it's still wrong
[15:20:33] <WindowsBunny> eddyb: Plus by using UTF-16, you make it abundantly clear that non-unicode isn't allowed
[15:20:44] <eddyb> ha ha ha
[15:20:54] <WindowsBunny> Because if you just take char *, people might not realize what encoding you take
[15:20:57] <eddyb> that is so "worse is better"

[15:25:15] <WindowsBunny> >HTTP is technically latin1
[15:25:31] <eddyb> all roads lead to Rome

[15:26:28] <eddyb> that's pretty interesting
[15:26:32] <Sho> japanese is the big loser in the han unification
[15:26:37] <Sho> so they just stick to shift-jis
[15:26:37] <eddyb> first 5 or so render horizontally, one after another
[15:26:46] <eddyb> and then the rest are clumped into the space of one character
[15:26:48] <fkaa> ouch
[15:26:55] <fkaa> that messed me up WindowsBunny 
[15:27:16] <eddyb> I wonder if I can use harfbuzz to deal with this
[15:27:16] <WindowsBunny> fkaa: I blame eddyb's link
[15:27:48] <Quxxy> Sho: I wonder if there's any chance the UC will just give up and compromise for the sake of actually getting Unicode used
[15:28:16] <Sho> Quxxy: technically variation selectors are that compromise
[15:28:28] <Sho> Quxxy: but the set is still incomplete, and support is bad, etc.
[15:28:37] <Quxxy> Sho: And has it led to wide adoption of... yeah, I didn't think so :P
[15:29:38] <Sho> yeah :)
[15:30:11] <Sho> the Korean HanIRC network is also sticking to CP949, but that's mostly just stupid
[15:30:24] <Sho> newer networks like Ozinger partly exist to move to Utf-8
[15:30:27] <Sho> #rust is on the latter :-)
[15:30:55] <Quxxy> Sho: Tell you what, han unification was a real bitch when I was using a kanji flashcard thing on Android
[15:31:13] <Quxxy> *Especially* when I didn't know it was showing the Chinese variants on my phone/tablet and the Japanese variants on my desktop
[15:31:18] <Quxxy> Was *real* confused for a while there
[15:31:46] <Quxxy> I also loved the solution: root my devices and clobber the system fonts
[15:32:04] <eddyb> https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2128410/Screenshot-Untitled%20Window.png
[15:32:28] <eddyb> so Servo is similar to Chrome
[15:32:29] <Sho> Korean's (diminishing) use of Han characters follows the Chinese renditions so the default is usually OK for me - that (and because simplified chinese has its own codepoints) is why China and Korea don't care much about the problem
[15:32:32] <Sho> Leaving mostly Japan
[15:33:43] <Quxxy> And I'll bet they're *ecstatic* that the UC's solution makes Japanese text *even larger* in memory and on disk :P

[15:35:40] <WindowsBunny> meanwhile in firefox

[17:24:17] <dfockler> what happens in unsafe code when you do bad stuff, and how do you handle it using rust?
[17:24:30] <XMPPwocky> dfockler: i recommend a good book on C for that :P
[17:24:36] <XMPPwocky> very similar issues
[17:26:02] <zofrex> what happens? anything. how do you handle it? don't do it. :P
[17:26:29] <bluss> dfockler: unsafe is a keyword you need to use to go the places where rustc can't check your assumptions and needs to trust you
[17:26:45] <dfockler> jesus take the wheel
[17:26:51] <dfockler> - rustc
[17:28:21] <XMPPwocky> Gankro: i'd like to see some mention of Things Wot You Can't Do Even Though It Seems Reasonable
[17:28:42] <XMPPwocky> i.e. transmuting & to &mut (iirc this warns now), aliasing &mut...
[17:28:49] <Gankro> XMPPwocky: definitely
[17:29:03] <Gankro> Gonna be a lot on "so you though RAII was safe..."
[17:29:21] <XMPPwocky> is mutating something while an &-ptr to it exists safe?
[17:29:26] <XMPPwocky> assuming UnsafeCell isn't involved
[17:29:47] <zofrex> "Rust actually tracks whether a type should be dropped or not at runtime" what :|
[17:30:14] <eddyb> nonono
[17:30:17] <eddyb> who said that
[17:30:26] <XMPPwocky> zofrex: yes, drop flag is required when control flow is nonlinear
[17:30:27] <eddyb> there's flags to prevent double drop
[17:30:39] <eddyb> and they will go away
[17:30:44] <XMPPwocky> zofrex: the issue is, rustc won't drop something earlier than it goes out of scoe
[17:30:47] <XMPPwocky> scope*
[17:30:59] <zofrex> eddyb: Gankro said it
[17:31:16] <XMPPwocky> so if you have let foo = String::new(); if meow { do_a_thing_consuming_foo(foo); }
[17:31:33] <Gankro> eddyb: in general it is tracked at runtime
[17:31:33] <XMPPwocky> if meow *isn't* true, then foo's destructor needs to run as foo goes out of scope
[17:31:39] <Gankro> we have dynamic drop semantics
[17:31:43] <XMPPwocky> if it *is* true, foo's destructor shouldn't run there
[17:31:44] <bluss> zofrex: not *a type* but a value
[17:31:52] <XMPPwocky> because the value has been moved into the function
[17:32:27] <eddyb> zofrex: the quoted statement is confusing
[17:32:43] <Quxxy> zofrex: "We're calling it... 'Now on Tap'!" *silence*  "I'm not saying anything until you bastards *clap*."  *hesitant clapping* "Yeah!"
[17:32:54] <zofrex> lol
[17:33:01] <Gankro> eddyb: The statement is incredibly qualified in context
[17:33:01] <zofrex> the contextual NLP voice search was impressive!
[17:33:39] <Gankro> eddyb: This raises an interesting question with respect to Drop: where does Rust try to call the destructor of a variable that is conditionally initialized? It turns out that Rust actually tracks whether a type should be dropped or not at runtime. As a variable becomes initialized and uninitialized, a drop flag for that variable is set and unset. When a
[17:33:39] <Gankro> variable goes out of scope or is assigned it evaluates whether the current value of the variable should be dropped. Of course, static analysis can remove these checks. If the compiler can prove that a value is guaranteed to be either initialized or not, then it can theoretically generate more efficient code! As such it may be desirable to structure code to
[17:33:39] <Gankro> have static drop semantics when possible.
[17:33:39] <Gankro> As of Rust 1.0, the drop flags are actually not-so-secretly stashed in a secret field of any type that implements Drop. The language sets the drop flag by overwriting the entire struct with a particular value. This is pretty obviously Not The Fastest and causes a bunch of trouble with optimizing code. As such work is currently under way to move the flags out
[17:33:39] <Gankro> onto the stack frame where they more reasonably belong. Unfortunately this work will take some time as it requires fairly substantial changes to the compiler.
[17:33:43] <dfockler> ahhh
[17:33:45] <eddyb> zofrex: it's only dynamic when the drop point of a local variable varies depending on control flow. basically... each possible drop point is checked, in case a previous one was reached
[17:33:48] <Quxxy> zofrex: Yeah, it's also kinda creepy as hell
[17:33:49] <eddyb> Gankro: DO NOT DO THAT
[17:33:55] <eddyb> you scared the shit out of me

[17:35:44] <Gankro> zeroing and all that jazz
[17:36:02] <eddyb> it's checked in more places than it should be
[17:36:08] <Gankro> yep
[17:37:16] <eddyb> but the dynamic aspect is still limited to function scopes
[17:37:28] <Gankro> eddyb: the drop flag is stored in structs
[17:37:43] <Gankro> code that exists today has to work around that, and leverages it
[17:37:47] <eddyb> yes, but moving it to the stack will only affect unsafe code

[20:38:24] <XMPPwocky> yeah
[20:38:40] <Tiffany> the config values you get from compiling vim without any global configs in /usr/share or whatever
[20:38:44] <Tiffany> are utterly awful

[20:39:33] <XMPPwocky> the built-in data types are either "cell" or "string"
[20:39:45] <XMPPwocky> the former is a 32-bit value of .. something, the latter is a string
[20:39:46] <Sho> XMPPwocky: The name reminds me of SourceMage Linux, a distro that wrote its package manager in 40k sloc of bash and advertised it as evidence for bash's suitability for "programming in the large" on its website
[20:39:51] <XMPPwocky> i have no idea how unicode works
[20:40:11] <XMPPwocky> they have optional typing (via tags) now, which seems to be an obnoxious hack too
[20:40:16] <Tiffany> good god
[20:40:22] <Tiffany> burn it
[20:40:37] <XMPPwocky> but because sourcemod uses it, and it's so deeply integrated (all the code's written in it), it probably can't die
[20:40:42] <Tiffany> xmppwocky: it looks like.. they don't?
[20:40:49] <Tiffany> "char - an 8-bit ASCII character"
[20:40:59] <XMPPwocky> yep
[20:41:02] <XMPPwocky> i gues
[20:41:12] <XMPPwocky> Strings, currently, are 0-terminated arrays of chars. They're described a little further ahead.
[20:41:18] <Tiffany> I suspect they halfass unicode
[20:41:25] <XMPPwocky> also note they don't have structs
[20:41:26] <Tiffany> like, their font renderer will do utf-8
[20:41:27] <Sho> always a safe assumption
[20:41:29] <XMPPwocky> so you usually see
[20:41:37] <Tiffany> but it only works if you don't modify strings in any way
[20:41:41] <XMPPwocky> every plugin has a bunch of global arrays
[20:41:44] <Tiffany> like, looking them up in a text file and displaying them
[20:41:49] <XMPPwocky> sort of struct-of-arrays from hell
[20:42:03] <Tiffany> utf-8 has a nice property
[20:42:09] <Tiffany> it never reuses lower-half characters in multibyte chars
[20:42:16] <XMPPwocky> "All strings are UTF-8 in SourcePawn.
[20:42:19] <Tiffany> multibyte character sequences only use high values
[20:42:27] <Tiffany> so like
[20:42:32] <Tiffany> if you strcmp for ":"
[20:42:39] <Tiffany> you won't accidentally smash the middle of a multibyte sequence
[20:42:43] <XMPPwocky> "There are six types of functions:"
[20:42:45] <XMPPwocky> oh god why
[20:42:53] <Tiffany> this is what lua did up until lua 5.3
[20:43:01] <Tiffany> and it basically worked
[20:43:12] <XMPPwocky> arrays and strings are passed by reference, everything else is by-value
[20:43:13] <Tiffany> as long as you don't do any string processing, only display it on the screen, it works
[20:43:22] <Tiffany> ooh fun
[20:43:31] <Tiffany> got to love languages which try to pretend references don't exist
[20:44:34] <XMPPwocky> "Even though the string is only one character, the new operator guarantees the rest of the array will be zeroed as well."
[20:44:48] <XMPPwocky> initializing a string apparently requires zeroing
[20:45:43] <XMPPwocky> also, note that you can crash (because manual memory management), and it's a JIT, which means debugging is fun and exciting
[20:46:17] <XMPPwocky> luckily, you can sometimes get a backtrace
[20:46:41] <XMPPwocky> but not if you segfault
[20:46:54] <XMPPwocky> only if you throw an exception
[20:47:49] <XMPPwocky> also notice that throwing exceptions, though they cannot be caught, only cause the current callback to fail
[20:48:11] <XMPPwocky> unless you're in debug mode, exceptions are otherwise ignerod
[20:48:24] <Tiffany> is there anything in source that isn't a pile of shit?

[20:50:22] <XMPPwocky> i'm not sure what i was expecting
[20:51:29] <XMPPwocky> they do get some impressive things done with it, all things considered
[20:51:37] <Tiffany> oh, sourcemod is a mod for source engine that implements this horrible, horrible language?

[20:52:17] <XMPPwocky> https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Server_plugins
[20:52:23] <Tiffany> I remember that portal 1 has at least 1 script written in squirrel
[20:52:29] <XMPPwocky> you get some callbacks, and that's basically it

[20:55:20] <Tiffany> oh, so I was right
[20:55:23] <Tiffany> squirrel is used
[20:55:40] <XMPPwocky> > Valve implemented ICE as a simple, and effective way of tamper-proofing a script file (using a 64-bit (8 bytes) key). 
[20:55:47] <XMPPwocky> that's accurate
[20:55:51] <XMPPwocky> that's what they were trying to do
[20:56:05] <XMPPwocky> because as everybody knows, confidentiality == authentication
[20:56:09] <XMPPwocky> especially in ECB
[20:56:18] <XMPPwocky> especially when you ship the key with the client files, too
[20:56:25] <Tiffany> it's a really shitty form of DRM
[20:56:31] <Tiffany> I wonder why they bothered
[20:56:43] <XMPPwocky> Tiffany: in the sense duck-taping your door shut is a shitty door lock

[20:57:27] <Tiffany> oh
[20:57:28] <Tiffany> I misread
[20:57:44] <Tiffany> wait, no I didn't
[20:57:48] <XMPPwocky> You can find and set the encryption key for your mod in your GameRules' GetEncryptionKey() function. All keys must be eight characters long!
[20:57:51] <XMPPwocky> so it's not just 8 bytes
[20:57:57] <XMPPwocky> it's 8 *alphanumeric* bytes
[20:58:18] <XMPPwocky> congrats, that's a 40-bit key
[20:58:23] <Gankro> XMPPwocky: That's like, basically good enough for an ok password

[20:59:02] <XMPPwocky> i almost want to say this is export-grade crypto
[20:59:16] <Tiffany> eh
[20:59:23] <Tiffany> hold on
[21:00:03] <XMPPwocky> also, you can change the item details all you want, it doesn't actually do anything in multiplayer *anyways*
[21:00:16] <Tiffany> you only need 584 billion tests per second in order to test the entire key space of 64 bits in one year
[21:00:23] <Tiffany> which is like
[21:00:29] <Tiffany> a moderate compute cluster?
[21:00:44] <Tiffany> and that's raw exhaustive key search
[21:00:47] <XMPPwocky> 40 bits
[21:00:51] <XMPPwocky> 41, i guess
[21:00:55] <Tiffany> no, I mean the block cipher itself xmppwocky
[21:01:02] <XMPPwocky> yeah
[21:01:05] <Tiffany> 64-bit block ciphers are pretty much export-grade crypto
[21:01:09] <Tiffany> especially used in ECB mode
[21:01:16] <XMPPwocky> this is also used as an anti-cheat measure
[21:01:26] <XMPPwocky> but for that you'd have to break it in minutes, which isn't so easy
[21:02:07] <XMPPwocky> although, iirc, the shared secret used for that ICE key is derived by DH between client and server
[21:02:15] <XMPPwocky> and there's an option in the client to use a fixed RNG seed for everything, so...
[21:03:25] <Tiffany> any kind of cryptanalysis at all would wreck a 64bit cipher
[21:03:29] <Tiffany> like, they're completely worthless
[21:03:39] <XMPPwocky> especially since you can known-plaintext all day
[21:04:10] <XMPPwocky> it's used for encrypting network traffic so you can't read out player positions or whatever
[21:04:11] <Tiffany> at least with 256-bit keys you can get a cryptanalysis which eliminates half your key bits and you'd still need to convert the sun into a computer to crack it
[21:04:19] <fkaa> 5k displays? https://www.apple.com/imac-with-retina/
[21:04:29] <Tiffany> and in fact, that's how you mitigate grover's algorithm once we have quantum computers
[21:04:34] <Tiffany> you use keys twice as large as the WF you want
[21:04:52] <Tiffany> 256-bit keys can be discovered in 2^128 ops using grover's algorithm
[21:04:59] <Tiffany> not nearly as devastating as shor's algorithm, but still pretty nasty
[21:05:07] <XMPPwocky> Tiffany: https://github.com/ValveSoftware/source-sdk-2013/blob/master/sp/src/mathlib/IceKey.cpp here
[21:05:10] <Tiffany> grover's algorithm on a 64bit cipher would be able to crack it in an hour
[21:05:25] <XMPPwocky> also note the excellent indentation on line 113
[21:05:46] <Tiffany> hahahah
[21:05:47] <Tiffany> "Differential cryptanalysis can break 15 out of 16 rounds of ICE with complexity 256. Thin-ICE can be broken using 227 chosen plaintexts with a success probability of 95%."
[21:05:57] <c74d> For months, I'd been carrying around a printed spreadsheet; for weeks, I'd thought it had somehow become moldy. Only yesterday did I realize that the “mold” was from it having been drawn on with a highlighter.
[21:06:00] <Tiffany> 2^56 and 2^27, since the exponents got mangled
[21:06:05] <XMPPwocky> Tiffany: where's that fro
[21:06:15] <Tiffany> wikipedia
[21:06:40] <dfockler> c74d: you're losing your mind grapes
[21:07:14] <XMPPwocky> Tiffany: oh, and that's from 1998
[21:07:46] <c74d> dfockler: … what? ó_o
[21:07:54] <dfockler> haha nothing
[21:07:58] <Tiffany> using this cryptanalysis, you could break a key in a month using a 27 billion keys/sec rate
[21:08:05] <Tiffany> well, 27 billion operations/sec
[21:08:07] * aji squeezes the idea juice out of dfockler's mind grapes
[21:08:13] <c74d> I don't know if that's a reference to some work of fiction or something, but… I once lost some grapes in a house and found them days (weeks?) later, very moldy.
[21:08:33] <dfockler> you sure they weren't written on with highlighter?
[21:08:41] <c74d> …so it was a surprising response for me.
[21:09:09] <c74d> It was black/gray fuzz…
[21:09:20] <Tiffany> if I somehow got it into my mind to create a shitty DRM scheme like this I'd probably use a cipher that's actually any good
[21:09:36] <aji> i went to make a cobb salad, but i couldn't use the blue cheese because it was all moldy
[21:09:38] <Tiffany> like AES in counter mode, or salsa20
[21:09:59] <Tiffany> salsa20 is definitely my preference, but it didn't exist in 2004
[21:11:07] <XMPPwocky> Tiffany: another fun one is that in older games, core files are protected by a cryptographic checksum for anti-cheat reasons
[21:11:14] <XMPPwocky> by cryptographic checksum, i mean crc32
[21:12:30] <Tiffany> in reality, I trust the client to do nothing
[21:12:50] <Tiffany> the only kind of hack this leaves to be performed is stuff like aimbotting and walls hacks
[21:12:55] <Tiffany> which are, honestly, kind of tame
[21:13:06] <Tiffany> there is nothing quite like someone flying or running extremely fast
[21:13:10] <XMPPwocky> yeah, except for exploits in other code
[21:13:11] <Tiffany> or just causing everyone on the server to instantly die
[21:13:15] <fmtq> Still requires being able to press buttons
[21:13:29] <XMPPwocky> like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuzSyNeBRNo
[21:13:32] <Tiffany> exploits are a given
[21:13:35] <Tiffany> but they're fixable
[21:13:46] <Tiffany> memory corruption is not a fundamental design flaw
[21:14:07] * c74d ought to stop procrastinating and start on my custom Linux-based OS for my replacement laptop. <_<
[21:14:17] <XMPPwocky> tbh, an aimbotter can ruin a game just as thorougly as somebody flying/speedhacking
[21:14:37] <XMPPwocky> i almost feel like i want to do client-side hit detection with some minimal validation
[21:15:05] <XMPPwocky> because better experience for players, without that huge an impact if there *is* a rage cheater
[21:15:06] <c74d> Now where did I put that live-SD-card…
[21:15:38] <Tiffany> it depends on the game, xmppwocky
[21:15:43] <Tiffany> for a twitch based shooter, absolutely
[21:15:47] <Tiffany> but for minecraft minigames? no
[21:16:01] <Tiffany> minecraft minigames are hit with all kinds of hacked clients
[21:16:18] <Tiffany> flyhacks, jump hacks, walk-through-tiny-spaces hacks, speed hacks, super fast mining hacks
[21:16:24] <Tiffany> minecraft checks almost nothing correctly
[21:16:33] <Tiffany> the client literally sends position updates
[21:16:43] <Tiffany> not thrusts or even velocity changes
[21:16:45] <Tiffany> position updates
[21:16:53] <XMPPwocky> mm
[21:17:06] <Tiffany> the server does a raycast to make sure the player isn't going through solid walls (which is why tiny spaces work, if it's 1 block high it won't get rejected)
[21:17:15] <XMPPwocky> loll
[21:17:19] <Tiffany> and only a certain distance (so you can only move so fast)
[21:17:27] <XMPPwocky> Tiffany: can you send NaN/
[21:17:30] <Tiffany> I'm not sure
[21:17:35] <Tiffany> however
[21:17:45] <XMPPwocky> lots of fun exploits with that
[21:17:47] <Tiffany> there used to be this exploit where if you send a large number (2^30 or so) to the server as your rotation value
[21:17:49] <Tiffany> well..
[21:17:55] <Tiffany> notch implemented modulus using a while loop
[21:17:58] <Tiffany> so you could DoS the server
[21:17:58] <XMPPwocky> also inf/-inf, and the maximum and minimum values
[21:18:02] <XMPPwocky> Tiffany: ...
[21:18:26] <Tiffany> fascinatingly, minecraft actually does encrypt communication with the server
[21:18:29] <Tiffany> but it fucks up at it
[21:18:32] <niconii> modulus... via a while loop......
[21:18:38] <Tiffany> it uses a zeroed out IV and doesn't use a proper block chaining mode
[21:18:44] <Tiffany> but it does use AES
[21:18:58] <XMPPwocky> doesn't java have a modulus operator
[21:19:03] <Tiffany> it does
[21:19:18] <Tiffany> people have actually tried to excuse this blatant error
[21:19:22] <Tiffany> saying something or other about performance
[21:19:59] <niconii> ...no matter how you slice it... a while loop is worse performance
[21:20:34] <XMPPwocky> niconii: possibly a branch and add/sub is faster than a modulo in the case where its' just one out of rong
[21:20:41] <XMPPwocky> i guess that's the logic
[21:20:42] <Tiffany> technically, if you didn't need to do anything, a while loop could only be a 1 cycle predicted branch
[21:20:47] *** Quits: UberLambda (uber@moz-24qg64.clienti.tiscali.it) (Quit: Leaving)
[21:20:49] <Tiffany> well, 2, one for the cmp
[21:20:58] <Tiffany> supposedly, modulus is more than one cycle in java
[21:21:03] <Tiffany> I doubt this greatly
[21:21:08] <XMPPwocky> Tiffany: of course, you could also use an if
[21:21:29] <Tiffany> the argument goes that java uses more accurate math ops for precision
[21:21:39] <Tiffany> like it implements sine more accurately than x86
[21:21:43] <Tiffany> which I think is a thing?
[21:21:46] <Tiffany> so sine is super slow
[21:21:53] <Tiffany> you can opt in to a faster but less accurate version of sine
[21:21:57] <niconii> XMPPwocky: it could possibly be a bit faster, but
[21:22:05] <Tiffany> but modulus... there's no precision problems
[21:22:12] <XMPPwocky> Tiffany: even with flots?
[21:22:14] <Tiffany> iirc it was integer modulo too
[21:22:15] <Tiffany> not floats
[21:22:18] <niconii> i think if you're trying to squeeze more performance out of %
[21:22:38] <niconii> there's probably better things you could be trying to optimize
[21:24:02] <XMPPwocky> now back to sourcepawn
[21:24:03] <XMPPwocky> Unlike other languages, this means you must know how much space a string will use in advance. That is, strings are not dynamic. They can only grow to the space you allocate for them.
[21:24:30] <Tiffany> do they have buffer overruns?
[21:25:11] <XMPPwocky> "Using an incorrect index will cause an error. For example:"
[21:25:12] <XMPPwocky> not sure
[21:25:25] <XMPPwocky> maybe that's a segfault, maybe something allegedly clean

[21:52:03] <Tiffany> I just use zathura
[21:52:31] <c74d> <https://www.google.com/search?tbs=vw:l,cat:267,pdtr0:732866%7C732867&tbm=shop&q=smartphone>
[21:52:43] <eddyb> Tobba: what about Adobe Reader :P?
[21:52:58] *** Quits: larhat (Adium@moz-vlo5br.cable.virginm.net) (Quit: Leaving.)
[21:53:00] <eddyb> c74d: how did you break google?
[21:53:05] <eddyb> it doesn't fully load
[21:53:19] <c74d> $25 for an OLED smartphone, really? Is it stolen?
[21:53:32] <eddyb> uhm, is it chinese?
[21:53:32] <c74d> eddyb: doesn't fully load?
[21:53:41] <Tobba> Tiffany: zathura doesn't support the contents listing
[21:53:44] <Tobba> (i.e it's unusable)
[21:53:53] <Tiffany> oh
[21:54:00] <eddyb> c74d: nothing below the bar with "Web ... More"
[21:54:01] <Tiffany> I noticed that but I was sure there was some way to get it to work
[21:54:05] <c74d> eddyb: it (the page) works for me; do you have JavaScript disabled or something?
[21:54:10] <Tiffany> since the contents have that "this is clickable" icon when you hover them
[21:54:11] <eddyb> lol no
[21:54:17] <Tiffany> but clicking just starts a selection region...
[21:54:21] <eddyb> c74d: I don't have "shop" in google
[21:54:33] <Tobba> Tiffany: I mean, good PDF readers will serve up a listing in a separate pane
[21:54:43] <Tiffany> oh
[21:54:49] <Tiffany> that would also be nice
[21:54:55] <Tobba> okular does this, but it's using 2.8GB for a 400 page PDF right now
[21:55:00] <Tobba> so fuuuuuuck that
[21:55:21] <eddyb> I could've sworn Adobe Reader
[21:55:23] <eddyb> Tobba: WAT
[21:55:32] <eddyb> Sho: ^^ are you seeing this?
[21:55:44] <Tobba> it seems it allocates memory for each page it renders that's never freed
[21:56:00] <eddyb> that doesn't sound right
[21:56:01] <Tobba> so if you scroll through the PDF too quickly WHOOPSIE DROPPED THE RAM
[21:56:06] <c74d> eddyb: does this work: <https://www.google.com/search?tbm=shop&q=smartphone#safe=active&tbs=vw:l,cat:267,pdtr0:732866%7C732867&tbm=shop&q=smartphone>?
[21:56:16] <eddyb> c74d: nope
[21:56:27] <eddyb> I have read very large PDFs in okular without issues before
[21:56:29] *** Joins: niconii_ (nicole@moz-qipo4g.frgo.qwest.net)

[21:56:41] <eddyb> (I could've sworn there used to be)
[21:56:46] <Tobba> (it was using 1.8GB from normal usage, went up to 2.8GB when I scrolled through all of it intentionally)
[21:56:47] <Sho> Tobba, eddyb: Okular has a "memory usage" knob in the settings that controls how aggressively it will prefetch and cache pages
[21:57:03] <eddyb> I've never had to touch it at all

[21:57:08] <eddyb> Tobba: can we see the PDF?
[21:57:09] <Tobba> Sho: I see you went for the vim school of configuration
[21:57:12] <Sho> Tobba, eddyb: it also uses tiled rendering these days, though, so it doesn't usually keep that much heavy data around ..
[21:57:12] <c74d> “<eddyb> uhm, is it chinese?” — it's a BlackBerry, so, yes and no.
[21:57:16] <Tobba> (insane defaults)

[21:57:31] <eddyb> link?
[21:57:46] <eddyb> if you have it handy
[21:57:51] <Tobba> one sec
[21:58:01] <Sho> Tobba: well the default is optimized for 256 MB RAM systems, says the config dialog ;)

[21:58:09] <Tobba> yep
[21:58:20] <Tobba> Sho: I don't think it's working right
[21:58:30] <eddyb> loads nicely in chrome, actually
[21:58:35] <Tobba> I don't want to know if I set this to "greedy"
[21:58:35] <eddyb> Tobba: what features did you want?
[21:58:38] <dfockler> who is responsible for writing that...
[21:58:43] <Tobba> eddyb: contents listing
[21:58:46] <c74d> > Amazon Fire Phone: $0.99 — what
[21:58:56] <eddyb> Tobba: chrome's PDF reader has that
[21:59:01] <Tobba> it does?
[21:59:11] <eddyb> unless you mean something else than what I'm looking at
[21:59:18] <eddyb> there's a bookmark icon
[21:59:18] <Tobba> not the in-document one
[21:59:25] <eddyb> which opens a side pane
[21:59:30] <Tobba> huh
[21:59:32] <Tobba> I don't get that
[21:59:42] <eddyb> I am using the material design UI for it
[21:59:44] <niconii> c74d: if they mean an actual phone that was set on fire, then lost in the amazon before it was discovered six months later, i would understand
[21:59:49] <eddyb> (enabled in about:flags)
[22:00:06] <Tobba> I don't even have that, I might have an older version
[22:00:15] <Tobba> in firefox you do get the listing if you hit an icon, but you can't collapse anything
[22:00:23] <Tobba> this gets really fun in multi-thousand page documents
[22:00:27] <eddyb> neither can you here
[22:00:28] <c74d> oh, that's from AT&T, “with contract”.
[22:00:36] <eddyb> Tobba: so not good for you
[22:00:58] <Tobba> Sho: if this was a 256MB system it would have crashed already, I really don't want to know what happens if I set this to greedy
[22:01:00] <Tobba> actually, I do.
[22:01:14] <eddyb> well, it's so nice that I can just pass the https link to okular :P
[22:01:28] <eddyb> wtf Tobba
[22:01:33] <eddyb> it uses 69MB at startup
[22:01:42] <Tobba> scroll through it
[22:02:01] <eddyb> it went down, to 54MB
[22:02:02] <Sho> Tobba: heh
[22:02:07] <eddyb> and then up to 84MB
[22:02:11] <Sho> Tobba: the tiled renderer was done by a gsoc student
[22:02:14] <Sho> all bets are off now
[22:02:18] <Sho> :-)
[22:02:22] <eddyb> down to 74MB
[22:02:59] <eddyb> it fluctuates a lot but I can't get it above 84MB
[22:03:11] <Tobba> interesting, it stopped at 2.7GB again
[22:03:16] <eddyb> oh, there, 103MB
[22:03:29] <eddyb> but I scroll down a bit and it's at 74MB again
[22:03:38] <Tobba> eddyb: scroll through the whole document somewhat slowly, so you get to see all the pages
[22:03:46] <Tobba> that's how I ended up at 2.8GB, it was at 1.8GB through normal usage
[22:03:49] <c74d> eddyb: oh, I guess Google Shopping is US-only.
[22:04:00] <eddyb> I just went through the entire document
[22:04:04] <eddyb> holding PageDown
[22:04:05] <Tobba> it's also at 1.2GB even if I clear the cache by changing rendering settings
[22:04:35] <Tobba> eddyb: grab the scroll bar and go through slowly, holding pagedown doesn't seem to cut it
[22:04:35] <eddyb> you must be hitting some leak or GPU driver weirdness
[22:04:43] <Tobba> the 1.2GB seems to be leaked
[22:04:49] <Tobba> not sure what the rest is
[22:04:55] <eddyb> same thing
[22:05:11] <eddyb> I also tried pressing pagedown/up and waiting for each page to load
[22:05:42] <eddyb> okay, it leaks, a few MBs at a time
[22:05:56] <Tobba> I've had this okular instance open for multiple hours
[22:06:08] <eddyb> now the baseline moved from 74MB to 107MB
[22:06:15] <eddyb> Tobba: oh, that does sound like a nice bug
[22:06:34] <Tobba> oh and I've been doing heavy searching
[22:06:50] <eddyb> hehehe
[22:06:51] <Tobba> which randomly glitches and starts a 1-2 minute long scrolling animation
[22:06:52] <eddyb> now that allocates
[22:07:05] <Tobba> which goes through the entire document several times over, not sure whats with that
[22:07:11] <eddyb> and you can't stop it
[22:07:20] <Tobba> but that would explain how I got to 1.8GB on normal usage
[22:07:57] <eddyb> if only it was a less complicated piece of software, I'd suggest digging into it or at least opening a bug report :P
[22:08:13] <eddyb> I don't even want to know how to open a bug report for a KDE thing
[22:08:24] <Tobba> I got it to 1.3GB on a fresh instance by just scrolling
[22:08:26] <eddyb> I am so spoiled by github
[22:08:31] <eddyb> Tobba: I can't get that
[22:08:36] <eddyb> that's odd
[22:09:04] <eddyb> Tobba: if you want to have some fun, run it through massif
[22:09:36] <eddyb> Tobba: I'm almost betting on libOpenGL.so owning most of those allocations
[22:10:26] <Tobba> yeah it might be a driver bug in the page caching
[22:11:30] <Tobba> hm, valgrind package doesn't have massif
[22:11:40] <Tobba> oh wait, it's valgrind --tool=massif

[22:14:10] <eddyb> like the BlackBerry we all know?
[22:14:27] <eddyb> Tobba: and massif-visualizer for a nice GUI. it can at least give you a breakdown by allocator
[22:14:28] <c74d> What is it that makes software keyboards a problem, though?
[22:14:33] <c74d> eddyb: vertical?

[22:16:30] <eddyb> then why don't I get it?
[22:16:49] <c74d> wait what, this is an Arch Linux live-medium :|
[22:16:58] <c74d> I thought it was NixOS <_<
[22:17:07] <Tobba> eddyb: might still be a driver thing, hold on
[22:17:22] <Tobba> massif-visualizer is a bit broken, need to figure out the normal output
[22:17:37] <eddyb> ms_print is the vanilla printer
[22:17:50] <Tobba> and massif-visualizer doesn't have a horizontal scrollbar
[22:18:02] <c74d> eddyb: is it a lack of sensory feedback
[22:18:05] <c74d> ?
[22:18:19] <eddyb> c74d: you could say that
[22:18:25] <c74d> (Enter pressed accidentally)
[22:18:31] <eddyb> oh, not only that
[22:18:40] <eddyb> c74d: have you ever touched glass or metal and felt really weird?
[22:18:40] <Tobba> eddyb: oh wait, I *can* make this thing bigger, and it's in reverse order
[22:18:55] <eddyb> c74d: like you're aware you have bones in your palm and fingers
[22:19:01] <Tobba> interestingly enough, valgrind tells me it used 350MB of memory
[22:19:05] <c74d> eddyb: I am, yes?
[22:19:10] <Tobba> but kesysguard was reporting up to 700MB
[22:19:14] <Tobba> ksysguard*
[22:19:18] <Tobba> it's possible it was spent on valgrind tracking
[22:19:20] <eddyb> Tobba: that's fragmentation for you
[22:19:22] <eddyb> oh
[22:19:27] <Tobba> was hard to render enough pages with how slow it was
[22:19:38] <eddyb> you can't trust the RSS when running under valgrind
[22:19:46] <eddyb> there's a lot of extra stuff going on
[22:20:02] <eddyb> c74d: you are what?
[22:20:11] <eddyb> c74d: no, I mean you can "feel" your bones
[22:20:14] <c74d> aware that I have bones… oh
[22:20:22] <eddyb> it's a very uncanny sensation
[22:20:40] <eddyb> and now I am feeling weird typing on my laptop keyboard
[22:20:40] <c74d> No, I'm afraid I don't recall this sensation.
[22:21:08] <eddyb> flat surfaces just suck for long-term usage

[22:23:14] <c74d> I don't recall ever having sensory issues with using a smartphone's software keyboard… maybe I might if my phone didn't provide feedback in the form of vibration on key-press and making an enlarged image of each pressed key briefly pop up as I press it.
[22:23:30] <eddyb> smartphones are powerful but dumb
[22:23:45] <eddyb> makes me think of bullies
[22:24:07] <c74d> Is that hardware keyboard built into the phone? It looks rather like it's not.
[22:24:14] <eddyb> which one?
[22:24:34] <eddyb> the presumably leaked photos of "Lauta"?

[22:32:07] <eddyb> they happen to work for a restricted set of usecases

[22:33:17] <c74d> how are software keyboards less versatile than hardware keyboards?
[22:33:39] <eddyb> good job Google, for creating this ecosystem infested with anti-performance crap
[22:34:09] <eddyb> I bet kde5 would work better on this old phone than the android apps...
[22:34:13] <c74d> two Android SSH apps I once used added arrow keys and modifier keys, where they could be used.
[22:34:16] <eddyb> and that's saying something
[22:34:47] <eddyb> c74d: there's little screen space for the actual terminal, as it is

[22:41:21] <eddyb> In April 2013, Munk announced that Hybris has been extended to allow Wayland compositors to utilize graphic device drivers written for Android.[5][9][10] Weston supports libhybris since version 1.3, which was released on 11 October 2013.[11]
[22:41:24] <Sho> eddyb: depends. kde 5 apps are really qt 5 apps made by kde.org, that usually use a bunch of the kde frameworks libs. qt 5 apps run on android. frameworks is heavily modularized and tiered now - a lot of the most used libs have no other dependencies than qt itself. the problem starts when you get into some of the libs on the higher tiers that start having certain runtime dependencies (e.g. d-bus, or kded5 for that matter) that are 
[22:41:25] <Sho> difficult to deploy on android due to process lifecycle and sandboxing handicaps

[22:41:42] <eddyb> whoa whoa
[22:41:47] <eddyb> qt5 apps on android?
[22:42:05] <eddyb> http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/androidgs.html
[22:42:08] <eddyb> sweeeeet
[22:42:08] <Sho> eddyb: some parts of the community have put significant effort behind making their very complex apps run without requiring complex runtime deps though (e.g. krita/calligra, for their windows and sailfish os ports)
[22:42:20] <c74d> eddyb: if I'm no body, am I an AI?
[22:42:22] <eddyb> O_O
[22:42:26] <c74d> Or a ghost?
[22:42:39] <Sho> eddyb: and i would be surprised if krita doesn't end up putting their tablet version on the play market sometime soon
[22:42:51] <eddyb> I WANT
[22:43:07] <eddyb> and then we can make qt7 in Rust
[22:43:16] <Sho> :)
[22:43:25] <eddyb> but for now I would be glad to run less shitty code on my device

[22:44:15] <Sho> eddyb: let me show you something else: http://wstaw.org/m/2015/05/13/img_0003.jpg (and no, that's not my ugly tiled floor)
[22:44:26] <eddyb> no
[22:44:29] <eddyb> that is not
[22:44:33] <eddyb> Sho: that's not plasma
[22:44:52] <eddyb> that's not plasma on a phone
[22:45:05] <Sho> eddyb: that's a nexus 5 running kubuntu, the android gfx driver stack, wayland on it via libhybris, and plasma 5 (and in fact kwin as a wayland compositor)
[22:45:18] <eddyb> :|
[22:45:27] <eddyb> Sho: no fucking way
[22:45:40] <c74d> …Is the camera focusing on the floor rather than the phone?
[22:45:41] <eddyb> I have to try that
[22:45:52] <Sho> eddyb: wait for akademy :-)
[22:46:03] <eddyb> Sho: I need to get into uni anyways :P
[22:46:09] <eddyb> oh dear it's almost 2am
[22:46:17] <eddyb> I have the graduation march tomorrow q_q
[22:46:41] <eddyb> ARTs will have to wait
[22:47:14] <Sho> eddyb: the joke we made is that if you add some duct tape we have an apple watch competitor
[22:47:28] * c74d wonders whether NixOS would work in Kubuntu's stead.
[22:47:48] <Sho> eddyb: oh and it runs android apps via sailfish os' compat layer
[22:47:55] <Sho> c74d: assuming nixos can package all the bits, sure
[22:47:56] <eddyb> hah
[22:48:00] <c74d> Sho: a watch with a five-inch-wide face?
[22:48:07] * ChrisMorgan has finally pinpointed why % is so badly broken in CSS/JS inside HTML in Vim after he has edited Rust code: $VIMRUNTIME/macros/matchit.vim being loaded (rust.vim does so to fix % on <:> with <F: Fn() -> T>) totally breaks it.
[22:48:39] <Sho> c74d: it's an old running gag
[22:49:10] <Sho> c74d: when we designed plasma's plugin component model back then (data engine plugins to provide data, widget plugins to visualize them, concepts like that) the first test case was a time data engine + widget
[22:49:23] <Sho> c74d: and that was the only thing working for some time, so it was "plasma is all about clocks"
[22:49:26] <ChrisMorgan> And :MatchDebug (turn on debug info for matchit.vim) fixes it :-/
