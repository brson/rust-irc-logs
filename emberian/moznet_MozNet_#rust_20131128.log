[01:37:22] <bstrie> it's actually a win for predictability

[01:37:51] <ssbr> which is bad because it's a really convenient pattern, _especially_ once you can move out of it
[01:38:34] <bstrie> ssbr: well 1) anywhere where you were using do previously and it was efficient, will still be efficient and 2) the things that used to be procs (~fns) always allocated anyway, so the things that are still do-able are no more inefficient
[01:38:50] <bstrie> nothing got *less* efficient as a result of this change
[01:38:58] <bstrie> it just was made clearer
[01:38:58] <ssbr> bstrie: I thought I was using do with &fns. Was I wrong then?
[01:39:25] <ssbr> I figured everything would get inlined and magic, because it had to be that way for loops to work nicely in older rusts
[01:39:30] <ssbr> maybe my intuition is out of date
[01:40:03] <ssbr> basically I was using do to encapsulate some common patterns, like "check if this is good, and if so do that, otherwise return Failure"

[01:41:47] <ssbr> to be fair, maybe macros are less magical and more predictable and more flexible and everything, so that's not so bad.
[01:42:02] <ssbr> (except that I can't get them to work, they seem to be disabled by default in newer rust versions...)
[01:42:27] <bstrie> ssbr: you were using do before for "closures in general", which used to either infer to a stack-allocated or a heap-allocated closure based on arcane rules that I'm not sure anybody was ever aware of
[01:42:54] <bstrie> and they both have different semantics as well, apart from having different perf profiles
[01:43:32] <ssbr> I guess. What's the idiomatic way to do the option monad in rust right now?
[01:44:16] <ssbr> I would've thought it'd be a series of nested do opt_foo.and_then |value| { ... } s, but you're making it sound like that was never a good idea, and I don't know what to replace that with in my code
[01:44:19] <bstrie> the option monad?

[01:46:33] <ssbr> (I kid, sorry,.)
[01:46:50] <bstrie> ssbr: the inference was arcane magic, and was part of closures in general :) removing that inference meant clarifying the closures rules, which is why stack-allocated closures with `do` got the axe
[01:46:56] <bstrie> ah :P
[01:47:36] <ssbr> bstrie: something like do ... &|x| { ... } could've still been an option
[01:47:59] <bstrie> ssbr: anyway, `do foo.and_then |x| { ... }` has become `foo.and_then(|x| { ... });`
[01:48:05] <bstrie> so it's an extra paren and a semicolon
[01:48:08] <ssbr> yes
[01:48:28] <ssbr> the more saddest issue is that there's no stack-allocated procs, or stack allocated once functions, or whatever :(

[01:49:29] <bstrie> er, stack
[01:49:57] <bstrie> ssbr: I agree that it seems from a high level to be an oversimplification. I think we were all just eager to avoid the complexity of C++ closures
[01:50:07] <ssbr> bstrie: it's not that I want procs on the stack, exactly, in that I don't know anything about why procs exist or what they're good for - it's that I want to be able to move out of a foo.and_then(&|x| {...})
[01:50:10] <bstrie> perhaps we'll need to change them again to make them more expressive, who knows

[01:53:39] <bstrie> actually, I'm not sure how it is that we can statically ensure that a proc only gets called once
[01:53:45] <dbaupp> ssbr: (also, it's just proc(..), ~proc(...) would be a box pointing to a proc, i.e. ~(~once fn) in old speak)
[01:53:51] <ssbr> I think probably for what I'm doing, I want to change everything to use procs, because it would actually simplify my code
[01:53:51] <bstrie> nmatsakis: what wizardry ensures that once fns only get called once?
[01:53:56] <dbaupp> bstrie: it moves when called
[01:54:05] <bstrie> ah ok, so we're just reusing linear types

[02:04:10] <Earnestly> brson: Can the videos be downloaded?
[02:04:18] <ssbr> Okay, sure, it doesn't eliminate the pattern, it makes it more verbose. But that's sort of like saying you don't need lambdas in java because of anonymous classes.
[02:04:31] <ssbr> it's definitely true, but making it inconvenient also discourages it.

[02:18:07] <aatch> ssbr, well we now have multi-item macros and they are (mostly) hygenic.
[02:18:19] <ssbr> aatch: Nice! (mostly :p)
[02:18:27] <dbaupp> aatch, bstrie : speaking of new, https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/10697
[02:18:28] <ssbr> I forgot about the multi-item problem, too.
[02:18:53] <bstrie> ssbr: we've already committed to marking macros as "experimental" for 1.0. they're just too half-baked to be shipped in a backwards-compatible way
[02:19:10] <bstrie> the exporting problem in particular is quite egregious
[02:19:17] <aatch> ssbr, sfackler did it, he's now working on multi-statement and multi-expression macros to round out the set.
[02:19:45] <ssbr> aatch: What does a multi-expression macro look like?
[02:20:01] <aatch> ssbr, it's more to do with expanding to multiple expressions.
[02:20:04] <bstrie> I mean, if someone magically descended from the sky with a patch that solved all of macros problems, then we could enable them by default for 1.0
[02:20:07] <bstrie> that would be killer
[02:20:13] <bstrie> but it seems unlikely
[02:20:17] <ssbr> aatch: as in, a macro that expands to fill more than one argument to a function, or...?
[02:20:29] <aatch> ssbr, not sure.
[02:20:46] <ssbr> it doesn't sound like a kind of macro I'm familiar with from scheme. that might be good though.
[02:21:03] <bstrie> dbaupp: I thought that was going to be the `~` to `new` change, that pull is a bit less exciting :P
[02:21:53] <aatch> ssbr, I might be wrong. I think sfackler edited the title of the issue and my brain filed the edited title as a separate issue.

[02:43:26] <ChrisMorgan> Yes, I know—that's why I was asking. That suggests that as it stands, I cannot cause a rust-http server to stop from inside the process without killing the entire process.
[02:44:09] <dbaupp> you can have a "should exit" boolean rigt?
[02:45:00] <aatch> ChrisMorgan, yeah, you do need to build the system explicitly to allow for that. And the fact that you can't select on both IO streams and ports makes it a little more difficult than it needs to be.
[02:45:54] <ChrisMorgan> dbaupp: at the very least, it would require manual stimulation of the port it is bound to as it will be blocking on acceptor.accept(). That would suggest I'd need the overhead of having another layer of abstraction, delivering the TcpStreams accepted through pipes so that I could select between two ports.
[02:46:17] <ChrisMorgan> (The first port mentioned there is a TCP/IP port.)
[02:46:19] <dbaupp> ChrisMorgan: oh, of course. :(
[02:47:37] <bstrie> brson: how did you get the "905 projects on github" stat?

[02:49:12] <ChrisMorgan> acrichto: see, there's another thing I want to be able to select across, an Acceptor.
[02:49:26] <o11c> in C you just send a signal to the thread
[02:49:46] <o11c> which makes the blocking call give an EINTR
[02:49:47] <aatch> o11c, on linux you just get fd for everything and select on them.
[02:50:05] <aatch> including signals (signalfd ftw)

[04:08:55] <ssbr> If I have multiple tests that all apply to multiple functions, how to I apply every test to every function?
[04:08:56] <bstrie> for anyone who's watched the new rust video, can anyone tell me the name of that vim plugin that pcwalton uses to search through filenames via partial matches?
[04:09:17] <ssbr> in xUnit I'd write an abstract test case with concrete subclasses that override the function being tested. Not sure what to do in Rust.
[04:10:10] <bstrie> ssbr: I confess I have no idea what you mean by multiple tests applying to multiple functions
[04:10:44] <AlexMax> klutzy: I didn't get errors.  I didn't get output.  At all.

[04:12:29] <klutzy> uh.. using binary (not built by you)? then it sounds strange
[04:12:32] <bstrie> ssbr: how about just a generic function? `fn my_test_case<T: TheTraitToTest>(foo: T)`, then just that function once with an instance of each type?
[04:12:36] <ssbr> bjz: no, I just mean I want to test that foo(x) == 3, for each foo in (bar, baz, quux)
[04:13:00] <AlexMax> rust-0.8-install.exe?
[04:13:01] <ssbr> bstrie: yes, but how do I make this happen when I do rustc foo.rs --test?
[04:13:03] <bjz> ssbr: you could make a macro
[04:13:26] <bjz> ssbr: macros are good because it tells you the exact call place
[04:13:30] <bjz> in your test
[04:13:34] <bstrie> ssbr: by putting #[test] on the function that makes the instance of each type and calls that function
[04:13:39] <klutzy> AlexMax: ah, 0.8 exe can crash silently if mingw version doesn't match
[04:13:48] <ssbr> bstrie: ah, I see.
[04:13:56] <ssbr> bstrie: that isn't scalable if I have hundreds of test cases though
[04:14:10] <ssbr> like, now I need hundreds of these meta-tests that call the tests with the right functions
[04:14:15] <klutzy> AlexMax: https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/9252 this was relevant issue, so currently we bundle such dlls (but was done after 0.8)

[04:16:41] <klutzy> AlexMax: if you just want to use 0.8 without compiling, you could download http://static.rust-lang.org/stage0-snapshots/rust-stage0-2013-11-10-b5e602a-winnt-i386-d1a0e2a3cfbc09e360aa0ac4f47b3e8a638b39f7.tar.bz2 and copy three dlls into your rust-0.8-dir/bin/
[04:16:59] <bjz> ssbr: I'd use a macro to generate the tests
[04:17:05] <ssbr> probably if I was writing code from scratch I think I'd use a macro
[04:17:13] <bstrie> ssbr: I was gonna say, you could make another trait that extends Foo, call it FooTest, and then just have the instance of each type invoke foo.test()
[04:17:17] <ssbr> and I guess that will eventually scale as well once macros work across crates
[04:17:33] <AlexMax> klutzy: Thanks, will try in a bit

[04:21:51] <ssbr> Maybe it should be a trait.
[04:22:01] <bstrie> ok

[04:30:51] <ww> is the any plan to add ternary operator?  like cond ? a : b?  using if {} else {} is getting tiresome
[04:31:35] <bjz> no, not that I know
[04:31:35] <bstrie> ssbr: then how about something like https://gist.github.com/bstrie/7687277
[04:31:38] <ChrisMorgan> ww: https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/4632
[04:31:47] <bjz> ww: what are you using it for?
[04:31:58] <bjz> ww: sometimes there are better ways
[04:32:01] <ww> bjz: just simple expression
[04:32:07] <bstrie> ssbr: code not tested, but how does the general approach look
[04:32:20] <ssbr> bstrie: I'm worried about what that does to the test output.
[04:32:37] <ww> e.g. let file_name = file_name.len() > 0 ? foo(...) : bar(...)
[04:32:39] <bstrie> what do you mean?
[04:32:50] <ssbr> bstrie: I think there'd only be one test case for this: "ssbr::test_foo"
[04:33:06] <ssbr> which is no good since I want to know the percent pass/fail
[04:33:09] <ChrisMorgan> ww: also https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/1698
[04:33:16] <ssbr> (or just for general niceness, of course.)
[04:33:28] <bstrie> ah ok, does the test runner already do that?
[04:33:37] <bstrie> if you have lots of things marked #[test] ?
[04:33:40] *** Joins: Sharp (Sharp@moz-780FECDA.washdc.fios.verizon.net)
[04:33:45] <ssbr> the test runner gives you a different test case name for each #[test] function, yeah
[04:33:53] <ssbr> and tells you individually which passed/failed.
[04:34:40] <bstrie> ssbr: the test runner was conceived a loooong time ago, long before rust 0.1. maybe it's time to reevaluate its use cases

[04:37:25] <ssbr> like, for what it does do, no complaints. It's super easy to write tests, and the output is readable (mostly).
[04:39:23] <ww> ok, read the argument for removing ternary op but it was just a few people's opinion.  i understand we want to have orthogonal feature set but there's a reason ternary op is popular - shorter syntax especially for oneliner.
[04:39:56] <ww> i'l would be happy if somehow "if" can be specified as if cond ? a : b

[05:54:50] <killerswan> :D
[05:55:02] <bstrie> wycats_: watching your presentation now, I'm curious to know if any customers took you up on the offer to use rust in their environments :)
[05:55:19] <wycats_> bstrie: it's not ready to ship yet
[05:55:31] <wycats_> I burned a few days this week on stupid bugs in our test suite
[05:55:33] <wycats_> next week I hope

[05:56:24] <wycats_> bstrie: I got like a 10x speed improvement though :P
[05:56:26] <wycats_> so that's good
[05:56:33] <wycats_> once I figured out that I needed -O
[05:56:36] <bstrie> wycats_: you do mention that this would only be for your more adventurous users, to what extent do they understand that this is rust code in their apps? :)
[05:56:37] <wycats_> before that it was roughly on par

[05:56:47] <wycats_> bstrie: they won't know, really

[05:57:33] <bstrie> cmr: no, the default is -O0 afaik
[05:57:35] <cmr> I think there's only a few optimizations at -O3, and they're all of dubious value.
[05:57:44] <cmr> Well, the default without -O is -O0 :P
[05:57:53] <bstrie> cmr: by "default" I mean what you get when you run "rustc foo.rs"
[05:57:57] <cmr> yeah
[05:57:59] <cmr> that is true
[05:58:05] <cmr> otoh it's slow :(
[05:58:12] * cmr looks forward to parallel LLVM
[05:58:15] <bstrie> cmr: I'd be curious to know how much slower
[05:58:16] <wycats_> cmr: would be easier to watch my talk :)
[05:58:22] <wycats_> bstrie: quite a bit slower
[05:58:40] <cmr> wycats_: it just started, so cool :D
[05:58:59] <o11c> one thing that was funny to me
[05:59:09] <bstrie> on the bright side, -O0 code is *so bad* that anyone observing its performance ought to be immediately incredulous that they aren't doing something wrong
[05:59:12] <o11c> was when I realized that gcc is faster at -O1 than at -O0 for large input
[06:00:03] <cmr> bstrie: for multibuilder, 2.478s unopt, 6.138s opt
[06:00:13] <wycats_> o11c: yes I was incredulous but didn't know what was wrong
[06:00:19] <bstrie> wycats_: so a 10x perf win, awesome, but what about memory usage? wasn't that the original purpose?

[06:27:37] <wycats_> the lack of segfaults has been very pleasant :P
[06:28:18] <bstrie> wycats_: so all this talk of FFIs has got me thinking, how hard would it be to add a rust FFI to ruby? :3
[06:28:27] <wycats_> bstrie: there is a small issue
[06:28:34] <wycats_> things like Qnil are defined in macros
[06:28:48] <wycats_> and like I said in the talk, Carl has forbidden me from reverse engineering the macros
[06:28:56] <wycats_> but you could build a C library that was very generic

[06:29:13] *** Joins: ab (alex@BC9D99CC.37C1012D.FE617B51.IP)
[06:29:17] <wycats_> which would expose all the macros as functions to Rust
[06:29:27] <wycats_> and then you could use the respective FFIs in Rust and Ruby to communicate directly
[06:29:55] <bstrie> wycats_: ok, but I was thinking of something even crazier, which would be to actually hack MRI (or $INSERT_IMPLEMENTATION) and avoid ever calling into C at all. just straight from ruby to rust
[06:30:08] <wycats_> bstrie: MRI already has an FFI
[06:30:10] <wycats_> but the problem is
[06:30:19] <wycats_> well
[06:30:26] <wycats_> I guess you could do all the twiddling on the Ruby side
[06:30:29] <bstrie> you say the problem is macros, but I'm not sure what they do :)
[06:30:40] <wycats_> NUM2INT(ruby_number)
[06:30:49] <bstrie> it is news to me that ruby's FFI is not specific to C, though
[06:30:51] <Sharp> I'm not really sure why there is a problem at all, except that the MRI maintainers wouldn't care about the Rust implementation.
[06:30:56] <bstrie> I always figured these things were tightly coupled
[06:30:59] <wycats_> another annoying thing is that all the Ruby FFIs require manual struct layouts

[06:32:42] <wycats_> bstrie: the manual struct layout in Ruby sucks hard

[06:33:13] <cmr> bstrie: that's not a good idea
[06:33:20] <cmr> our ABI isn't all that stable..
[06:33:26] <cmr> at least it's not a good idea yet
[06:33:47] <bstrie> cmr: I didn't say it was a good idea, in fact I think it's a bad idea, but it is also a hilarious idea
[06:34:08] <cmr> You have a very twisted sense of humor
[06:34:18] <wycats_> lolol
[06:34:20] <bstrie> aw, thanks :)
[06:34:37] <wycats_> it would be fun to write a C library that basically just exposed the Ruby macros as functions
[06:34:51] <o11c> As long as it fails in a predictable manner ...

[12:05:18] <benh> so you'd have to write blah.with_ref(|namebuf| { ... });

[12:10:58] <ChrisMorgan> Hang on—closures surely can't be more efficient than procs?
[12:11:12] *** Joins: Skif (emschwar@moz-4C5BB5A8.beyondbb.com)
[12:11:21] <benh> procs are also closures
[12:11:23] <geal> I have a crash on OSX while building 0.9-pre. ld segfaults while linking libextra-aaa96aab146eb38e-0.9-pre.dylib in stage1. Did anyone encounter that?
[12:11:24] <dbaupp> proc == ~once fn, i.e. ~ allocated environment
[12:11:38] <dbaupp> || == &fn => stack allocated environment
[12:12:27] <ChrisMorgan> dbaupp: is that going to be being fixed? I can't see any immediate reason why procs *should* be less efficient.
[12:12:57] *** Quits: Skif (emschwar@moz-4C5BB5A8.beyondbb.com) (Ping timeout)
[12:13:15] <dbaupp> ChrisMorgan: because one might want to store a proc?
[12:13:43] <dbaupp> ChrisMorgan: the reason is procs are sendable, which requires a heap-environment
[12:13:49] <ChrisMorgan> Can't closures be stored with the appropriate lifetime?
[12:13:59] <dbaupp> yes
[12:14:06] <dbaupp> but they're ont senadable
[12:14:09] <dbaupp> *not
[12:14:27] <dbaupp> (sendability is the real reason)
[12:15:26] <ChrisMorgan> A special case to avoid allocation if it's provably not sent?
[12:16:24] <bjz> I would have thought that things that are only going to be called once should use the semanticly correct thingy - ie. procs?
[12:16:39] *** Joins: Sorella_ (quildreen@D2D1E5DD.81EFC25A.A95FAE2B.IP)
[12:16:58] <bjz> would it be possible to have `proc` and `~proc`?
[12:17:11] <eddyb> i.e. ~~fn?
[12:17:14] <bjz> or is that just making things worse :P
[12:17:24] <dbaupp> ChrisMorgan: that seems like a lot of effort rather than just doing closures properly
[12:17:35] <eddyb> or, do you mean an unboxed closure?
[12:17:54] <eddyb> proc should die after we have the Fn trait, IMO
[12:18:21] <eddyb> then you could do whatever you want with a closure, proc seems such a special case
[12:18:24] <ChrisMorgan> dbaupp: I mainly mean: semantically, proc is a better match for with_*, because it's run exactly once. So is it in the plan to make that completely efficient (inline it and all)?
[12:18:33] <dbaupp> I mean Fn trait and closures are just then &Fn or ~Fn etc.
[12:18:39] <bjz> ChrisMorgan: ++
[12:18:49] <dbaupp> ChrisMorgan: I know pcwalton is pushing for more RAII
[12:19:22] <dbaupp> ChrisMorgan: and proc *isn't* designed as a replacement for &once fn and shouldn't be used as such
[12:19:36] * ChrisMorgan thinks the community is pushing for more APDK in various placse
[12:19:38] <bjz> dbaupp: ok, that's good to know
[12:19:55] <bjz> dbaupp: as in, that clarifies things for me
[12:19:58] <dbaupp> AIUI it's designed for packaging up jobs to send between tasks (e.g. the actual task function itself)
[12:20:07] <dbaupp> ChrisMorgan: APDK?
[12:20:18] <bjz> APDK?
[12:20:24] <ChrisMorgan> Acronyms People Don't Know. (Yes, I know what RAII is, but I've come across ones like the "never hear aliasable/mutable again" one with nothing supporting them.)
[12:20:55] <bjz> ChrisMorgan: oh woops, thought you meant 'Association for the Physically Disabled of Kenya'
[12:20:58] <dbaupp> ChrisMorgan: you just gotta read all the blog posts, hang out in IRC all the time, and read every email on the mailing list; what's the problem?
[12:21:04] <dbaupp> :P
[12:21:25] <ChrisMorgan> The cross-linking is typically quite poor, which will make historical examination fiendishly difficult.
[12:21:50] <ChrisMorgan> dbaupp: so what is proc designed for? And what's happening for the &once fn cases?
[12:22:03] <dbaupp> 23:19:59 - dbaupp: AIUI it's designed for packaging up jobs to send between tasks (e.g. the actual task function itself)
[12:22:32] <dbaupp> and &once fn is kinda dropped in favour of RAII
[12:22:33] <ChrisMorgan> Syntactically, `do x.with_y { ... }` is delightful.
[12:22:53] <dbaupp> you'll have to complain at pcwalton about this, but he's fairly firm in his plan.

[12:56:38] <ChrisMorgan> But my suggestion is basically just to have the type X | Y be equivalent to `enum { X(X), Y(Y) }`, but without the need to assign it as X(x).

[13:02:06] <geal> ok, the ld segfaults was due to a weird interaction with clang. Updatting XCode and the XCode command line tools solved the problem
[13:08:11] <diverse> What does feature gate mean?
[13:08:48] <kimundi> diverse: There are some features of the compiler that are currently not officially supported or working right
[13:08:56] <kimundi> diverse: Those are called a 'feature'
[13:08:58] <bjz> diverse: language features that need to be explicitly enabled with the #[feature(...)] attribute
[13:09:13] <bjz> like #[feature(macro_rules)]
[13:09:41] <kimundi> diverse: A feature gate is the fact that rustc disables the use of those features per default
[13:10:06] <kimundi> As bjz said, they can be enabled with atributes in your crate root

[13:10:24] <bjz> hah
[13:10:27] <bjz> yup
[13:10:49] <ChrisMorgan> They're disabled because the feature is not stable or complete and the Rust team are not willing to support it in its present form after Rust 1.0—it'll be prone to change at any time, outside the stability guarantees.
