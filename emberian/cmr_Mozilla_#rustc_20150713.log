[19:31:43] <doener> pnkfelix: do you know of a smaller testcase than the whole of rustc for the debug info assertion failure?
[19:33:35] <doener> and holy sh!t, is building with --enable-debug --enable-optimize slow...
[19:34:03] <nagisa> really? I always build like that, because otherwise you can do nothing useful with the produced binary
[19:34:48] <nagisa> which issue is that, doener?
[19:35:29] <doener> nagisa: gh26484 -- I have a fix, but not a testcase
[19:36:10] <doener> nagisa: the problem is that we assign the wrong DI to function pointers
[19:37:28] <doener> nagisa: re slowness, libsyntax in stage1 took a bit more 4 minutes, without any asserts (and on my slightly faster box), that takes <2 minutes
[19:37:32] <nagisa> oh ok, I’ve seen a few debuginfo issues myself when running test suite
[19:37:40] <nagisa> so I thought it might be the same thing
[19:38:01] <doener> fix is https://github.com/dotdash/rust/commit/2f7acfe16ec77d0a952d8ac1337acb210febe3e3
[19:38:34] <doener> a bit hackish, but I feel like all alternatives would need a not-so-small refactoring
[19:38:39] <nagisa> hmm, right, I always thought I didn’t really notice too many speedups people were boasting about lately. Now I know why lol
[19:38:40] <doener> maybe even changes to the type system
[20:03:47] <doener> acrichto: ping
[20:04:38] <arielb1> nagisa: the speedups were also in +assertions
[20:04:49] <arielb1> I was timing in both
[20:05:05] <arielb1> it is a ~50% perf hit on my machine
[20:05:12] <arielb1> a consistent one
[20:06:35] <arielb1> doener: anyway, you should monomorphize the fn sig, not the fn type
[20:06:43] <arielb1> otherwise this causes problems with associated types
[20:07:16] <arielb1> you should tcx.erase_late_bound_regions, then monomorphize
[20:09:02] <arielb1> doener: what's the issue anyway
[20:09:44] <doener> arielb1: there are two, in get_function_signature, what was called return_type is actually the function type
[20:10:11] <doener> arielb1: so for a fn(i64) we created debug info for fn(i64) -> fn(i64)
[20:10:28] <arielb1> and...
[20:10:51] <doener> and the other is that function pointers got the debug info for the function, not for a function pointer
[20:11:03] <arielb1> for the function?
[20:11:49] <arielb1> or does LLVM have distinct function and function ptr types?
[20:12:03] <doener> given fn foo() { let x = foo }, foo got debug info for a function "fn() -> fn()", and "x" got debug info that marked it as a subroutine instead of a pointer to a subroutine
[20:12:53] <doener> the function itself needs to get subprogram DI that points to the subroutine DI, and the function pointer needs pointer DI, also pointing to the subroutine DI
[20:13:52] <arielb1> why do you call subroutine_type_metadata *before* looking it up in the cache?
[20:14:46] <arielb1> actually, that's for caching self-recursion, right?
[20:15:23] <arielb1> we should wrap that into a monad :-)
[20:15:49] <doener> arielb1: right
[20:17:12] <arielb1> doener: you need to normalize after you tcx.erase_late_bound_regions
[20:17:12] <arielb1> through

[20:20:00] <doener> acrichto: I have a fix (minus comments by arielb1) for gh26484 but no idea how to create a test case, should I create a PR anyway?
[20:22:53] <doener> arielb1: like so?https://github.com/dotdash/rust/commit/b9b3485d74e1814a008a938e8246a504c4f12f73
[20:23:14] <acrichto> doener: yeah if there's no minimal reproduction it's fine to just commit
[20:23:44] <arielb1> I would extract-function the block that registers a type in the type-map
[20:24:19] <doener> arielb1: the intro to type_metadata you mean?
[20:24:53] <arielb1> I was talking about the block after the match at L830

[20:26:39] <doener> wth, I thought I double checked that I'm getting the right thing there
[20:26:45] <doener> but yeah, build failed
[20:26:58] <arielb1> doener: you need to do it to the signature
[20:27:16] <arielb1> the signature will always be an fn type before substituting
[20:27:21] <arielb1> (or closure type)
[20:27:31] <doener> regarding the extraction of that block, I'm not keen on adding any refactorings to this, not comfortable enough with that part of the codebase
[20:29:01] <arielb1> it really needs some refactoring through
[20:30:01] <arielb1> nrc: isn't it yours?
[20:30:05] <doener> most of trans does
[20:30:07] <arielb1> I guess we can do it in a future moment
[20:30:20] <doener> IIRC the DI stuff is courtesy of mw
[20:30:53] <arielb1> doener: debuginfo looks like it will survive when trans will get torn down aggressively
[20:31:59] * doener doesn't know debuginfo well enough to tell...
[20:32:09] <doener> I'm super excited for HIR/MIR to arrive though
[20:32:31] <arielb1> MIR?
[20:33:09] <doener> mid-level IR? nmatsakis had a pre-RFC a while ago
[20:33:29] <doener> https://gist.github.com/nikomatsakis/3c59b0a48e0dcafc85e0
[20:33:45] <arielb1> doener: debuginfo is the kind of library-interface-ey code with an half-life measured in years
[20:35:00] <Luqman> doener: yes! mir would be awesome!
[20:35:31] <arielb1> Luqman: nmatsakis's MIR doesn't contain match
[20:36:59] <doener> arielb1: it has them lowered a bit closer to llvm ir, which isn't necessarily bad. Our current codegen for match is awful
[20:37:10] <arielb1> doener: _match needs to die
[20:37:12] <arielb1> ina fire
[20:37:33] <Luqman> arielb1: i know! it'll be great
[20:37:38] <arielb1> does it generate terrible code as well as being evil
[20:37:53] <arielb1> Luqman: problem is that it is basically a paper-equivalent
[20:38:03] <doener> arielb1: we sometimes generate switched on i1 values with three arms
[20:38:07] <doener> arielb1: any more questions?
[20:38:14] <doener> s/switched/switches/
[20:38:21] <doener> ^^
[20:38:29] <arielb1> doener: I wasn't aware it was radioactive
[20:38:35] <doener> heh
[20:38:39] <arielb1> what?
[20:39:29] <arielb1> how do these three-armed i1 switches form?
[20:39:47] <doener> in IR, we have a case for false, one for true and a default arm
[20:40:12] <arielb1> it doesn't do this for enums I hope
[20:40:13] <doener> they originate from tuple matches with _ matches
[20:40:49] <doener> PartialEq or PartialOrd or so can generate that I think
[20:40:55] <doener> I don't recall exactly
[20:41:29] <arielb1> the problem is that fixing _match requires that somebody understand the algorithm
[20:41:47] <arielb1> well
[20:41:51] <doener> arielb1: hm, I get fulfillment errors now :-/
[20:42:01] <arielb1> fulfillment errors?
[20:42:15] <doener> ../src/libcore/lib.rs:1:1: 1:1 error: internal compiler error: Encountered errors `[FulfillmentError(Obligation(predicate=Binder(TraitPredicate(<I as iter::Iterator>)),depth=0),Unimplemented)]` fulfilling during trans

[20:43:47] <arielb1> actually, trans::erase_late_bound_regions(sig.skip_binder()) would work too

[20:45:16] <nagisa> holy universe! --disable-debug --disable-llvm-assertions is speed of light!
[20:47:27] <arielb1> nagisa: were you compiling with llvm assertions?
[20:47:32] <arielb1> that's explains why it was all slow
[20:47:52] <arielb1> you can compile with --enable-debuginfo --enable-debug-assertions

[20:48:14] <arielb1> has a 50% penalty but is worth it
[20:48:50] <nagisa> arielb1: I always do, because I treasure them
[20:49:01] <nagisa> (and I do get a few assertions in tests)
[20:49:13] <arielb1> nagisa: tests *should* be assertion-free ATM
[20:49:21] <arielb1> last time I checked they worked

[20:49:58] <nagisa> the last failing test
[20:50:12] <arielb1> except for that _Unwind_whatever thing that broke last week
[20:50:16] <arielb1> not an assertion, through
[20:50:23] <nagisa> unwind is 2nd out of 3
[20:50:44] <nagisa> 1st is jemalloc, 3rd is something about debuginfo
[20:50:58] <arielb1> nagisa: these are with --enable-debug
[20:51:14] <nagisa> yes, but without llvm-assertions that wouldn’t fire, would it?
[20:51:53] <arielb1> nagisa: yes
[20:51:56] <arielb1> these are bad
[20:52:02] <arielb1> you should report them as issues
[20:52:05] <arielb1> the jemalloc one is scary
[20:52:22] <nagisa> sure
[20:52:26] <arielb1> I think the LTO one is known
[20:52:44] <nagisa> yeah, I commented on issue a while ago
[20:55:02] <arielb1> doener: does it work?
[20:56:40] <doener> arielb1: had to restore my code, accidental rebase --abort... and now I'm not sure what to do... normalizing is what gives me the sig that I pass to erase_late_bound_regions, so I don't see how to call erase_late_bound_regions before normalizing..
[20:57:10] <arielb1> doener: the type you receive should already be an TyFn/TyClosure
[20:57:14] <arielb1> even before normalization
[20:57:23] <arielb1> (it is the type of a function/closure item)
[20:57:28] <arielb1> first match on it
[20:57:32] <arielb1> to get the signature
[20:57:35] <arielb1> then erase the signature
[20:57:39] <arielb1> then apply_param_substs
[20:59:43] <doener> arielb1: https://gist.github.com/dotdash/f633e5d9d7fb3fffed54
[21:00:22] <arielb1> exactly
[21:00:46] <arielb1> why are you calling infcx::closure_type?
[21:00:51] <doener> unless I hit enter at the wrong point in time, that's what gave me the fulfillment error
[21:01:21] <doener> basically, because that's what subroutine_type_metadata does :-/
[21:01:44] <arielb1> doener: you need ty::ctxt::closure_type
[21:01:53] <doener> type_metadata actually
[21:05:20] <arielb1> doener: added working version
[21:07:04] <doener> arielb1: thanks, just got that compiling as well now (though less elegant)
[21:07:50] <doener> arielb1: I really need to get more accustomed to that part of the compiler... if only time wasn't so constrained
[21:08:01] <arielb1> that part?
[21:08:07] <arielb1> (trait-matching?)
[21:08:32] <arielb1> jroesch and nmatsakis will refactor it soon anyway
[21:08:49] <doener> most of the stuff that happens before actual trans is rather vague in my head
[21:09:43] *** Joins: Tobba (Tobba@moz-4l45on.skybroadband.com)
[21:10:23] <arielb1> doener: most of trans gets erase_late_bound_regions/monomorphize wrong
[21:11:03] <arielb1> that causes ICE-s
[21:12:15] <doener> arielb1: did you compile-test your addition to the gist?
[21:12:26] <arielb1> I didn't
[21:12:41] <arielb1> why?
[21:12:56] <doener> arielb1: I don't want to interrupt my build right now, but IIRC using barefnty.sig like that complains that it can't move out of sig
[21:13:30] <doener> that's why I kept the calls to erase_late_* in the match arms
[21:14:11] <arielb1> I guess we need &-s
[21:14:24] <arielb1> we need the &-s anyway
[21:14:52] <doener> I can try a few variants, but IIRC depending on where they are, you either get "doesn't live long enough" or the move error
[21:15:08] <arielb1> doener: rvalue lifetimes
[21:15:26] <doener> anyway, calling erase_late_* twice doesn't seem that bad
[21:15:34] <arielb1> fine
[21:15:47] <arielb1> rvalue lifetimes need to be documented
[21:43:28] <nagisa> quick question: any simple way to get a Span from NodeId?
[21:45:19] <nagisa> oh ast_map
