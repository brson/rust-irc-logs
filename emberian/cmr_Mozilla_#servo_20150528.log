[00:09:11] <nox> The trait and type might share lifetime or type parameters and thus they are put on impl.

[00:16:09] <huon> bitte schoen
[00:16:17] <njn> like some kind of mutant Perl code
[00:16:30] <huon> :D
[00:16:58] <huon> (the : thing is a necessary hack because 'tt's are hamstrung at the moment :( )
[00:20:03] <njn> huon: 'tt's?
[00:22:15] <huon> njn: the '$stuff: tt' is a metavariable that can be essentially any single syntactic element (a "token tree"), e.g. '1', or '( ... )'.
[00:22:44] <njn> huon: do you have to understand how the parse tree is structured to do complex things?
[00:23:02] <huon> njn: not in detail
[00:23:50] <huon> the macro system does expose hooks into it (e.g. 'expr' to match any expression, 'ty' to match any type), but you don't have to wrangle it in detail
[00:24:00] <njn> huon: I've worked before on a system that involved this kind of syntax rewriting; it was really rewriting the parse tree but the exact structure of the parse tree wasn't specified explicitly and the rules tried to gloss over it and it was a mess
[00:24:51] <njn> huon: anyway, I'll just have to trust that it's been done in a reasonable way :)

[03:11:14] <jack> Manishearth: homu docs say that r- will unaccept a PR
[03:11:19] <jack> so that is definitely a homu bug.
[03:11:44] <Manishearth> jack: I think it doesn't work when tests are running
[03:11:50] <jack> And a regression from bors.
[03:12:00] <jack> Bors would definitely check before the final fast forward
[03:12:19] <Manishearth> ah

[03:13:09] <crowbot> Issue #81: Running builds aren't canceled by r- - https://github.com/barosl/homu/issues/81
[03:14:09] <pcwalton> oh wait, we use expat in servo?
[03:14:13] * pcwalton adds another 1M lines of code to the list
[03:15:26] <pcwalton> hmmm, maybe I found the reftest timeout bug?
[03:15:54] <pcwalton> I found a timeout that's easy to repro with DLBI on and looks like it's independent of my changes
[03:18:31] <pcwalton> Compiling script v0.0.1 (file:///home/odroid/Source/servo/components/servo)
[03:18:39] * pcwalton watches the graph of memory usage on the ARM board nervously

[03:20:39] <gw> pcwalton: if you want to look into why the reftest is timing out, add some logs to is_ready_to_paint_image_output to find why it doesn't think it's ready to output. We should actually make the compositor time out itself after 30s or so in reftest mode and print this information, so it can be debugged from build machines
[03:21:02] <pcwalton> gw: my theory is that it's checking the root layer's epoch, but the root layer is never painted because its layer ID is 0
[03:21:08] <pcwalton> I added that logging myself to find this issue
[03:21:44] <gw> pcwalton: it *should* be handling that - because it only requires layers to have buffers if they have ever requested buffers
[03:22:46] <gw> pcwalton: at least, that's the intent of https://github.com/servo/servo/blob/master/components/compositing/compositor.rs#L1218 - it might be a bug
[03:23:27] <mbrubeck> Excellent, just passing HB_DIRECTION_RTL to Harfbuzz gives somewhat correct RTL text rendering in Servo...

[13:49:10] <larsberg> Manishearth: It only got approved yesterday and I couldn't bring myself to tweet it :-) 
[13:49:41] <larsberg> I put it up there so that there was something citeable (in an academic sense); we had requests from the DIKU people and a few inquiries from others as well.
[13:50:51] *** Quits: jviereck (Adium@moz-nd4cre.ethz.ch) (Quit: Leaving.)
[13:51:24] <larsberg> Manishearth: also, the arXiv quality is... what you'd expect from completely unreferred / reviewed publications. "12 solutions to P != NP per day or your money back!" But it's a nice place for preprints, submissions, and rejected drafts before they're revised & resubmitted.
[13:51:28] <larsberg> (at least in CS)
[13:52:58] <Manishearth> larsberg: :D
[13:53:19] <jgraham> (my experience of astrophysics was that almost everything useful was on arXiv but not everything on arXiv was useful)
[13:53:28] <Manishearth> larsberg: ah, as far as nlin/astro-ph go arxiv is pretty clean, understandable, and easy to filter-by-abstract
[13:53:40] <Manishearth> on the other hand, hep-* is totally opaque
[13:54:06] <Manishearth> but an HEP postdoc friend of mine claims that it's the same for profs in the subject too, so .. :p
[13:54:26] <Manishearth> jgraham: pretty much same for nlin
[13:54:32] <Manishearth> but less so
[13:54:53] <Manishearth> I think the astroph community picked up the entire thread of open preprints and all
[13:55:25] <Manishearth> I'm continually amazed that *really* old astroph papers can be found on adsabs
[13:55:42] <jgraham> Yeah, so basically I think that people assumed that no one would read their paper in an actual journal and everyone would read preprints
[13:55:57] <Manishearth> hah

[13:57:07] <jgraham> Yeah, it seemed to work rather well. I vaugely remember that there was a paper showing that papers on arXiv were more widely cited than ones that weren't
[13:57:17] <Manishearth> hmm
[13:57:25] <jgraham> So there was strong incentive to put stuff there
[13:58:20] <Manishearth> Probably because we're too lazy to actually click through the panels needed to get a paper from a university network

[14:01:05] <jgraham> istr that it was rather easy to check for new, relevant things on arXiv (e.g. by email notification for papers matching a filter), which I'm not sure was true for papers that were "actually" published. Also there was a latency between acceptance and actual publication that arXiv let you avoid)

[14:06:36] <larsberg> Manishearth: hahaha! I can tell you more SourceDepot stories than I care to admit :-) But the short of it is that we (MS) acquired a source license to Perforce and did a bunch of work to make it scale to larger repo sizes, handle massive integrations better, etc.
[14:07:37] * larsberg created and owned the Developer Division source depot instance for many years, though they're now on Team Server for most things

[14:18:29] <crowbot> PR #6202: Freetype fixes - https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/6202
[14:18:41] <Manishearth> our build system ignores errors in lockfiles that it can fix
[14:19:00] <Manishearth> perhaps we should get travis to ./mach cargo generate-lockfile  and ensure there's no git diff
[14:19:03] <Manishearth> or something
[14:19:27] <larsberg> we can certainly just push up the net change to Cargo.lock as a separate E-superdupereasy commit
[14:19:40] <Manishearth> that was already made a part of the PR
[14:19:42] <larsberg> I'm not a huge fan of making it even *harder* to land changes related to cargo
[14:20:12] <Manishearth> the status quo doesn't *break* anything (except perhaps local git status)
[14:20:17] <larsberg> With the three lockfiles, it's already a bit of a hurdle. Maybe if we land the proposed changes by SimonSapin to get us back down to one toplevel Cargo.toml?
[14:20:20] <Manishearth> but we should avoid doing this

[14:21:18] <larsberg> It's more dangerous if it's an external package with a "*"  dependency, as if they push something wonky to crates.io it can suddenly brick the CI
[14:21:31] <larsberg> For local packages, it's just annoying

[14:27:30] <SimonSapin> why*
[14:27:33] <larsberg> Yeah, doesn't bother me too much, though I do worry that these PATH hacks will be relied upon by custom build scripts that attempt to "find" binaries to run. e.g., we have some bad examples of that today in the android toolchain.
[14:27:35] <Manishearth> because it's a drop in
[14:27:41] <Manishearth> larsberg: awesome!
[14:27:47] <Manishearth> DAYS SINCE LAST HACK: 0
[14:27:48] <SimonSapin> Manishearth: why does rustfmt need changing rustc more than we already do?
[14:27:55] <Manishearth> SimonSapin: rustfmt is a drop-in
[14:28:03] <Manishearth> it is to be used *in place* of rustc
[14:28:27] * SimonSapin is confused
[14:29:00] <Manishearth> SimonSapin: instead of `rustc foo.rs`
[14:29:01] <larsberg> back when *I* was a kid, you'd just set the RUSTC variable to something else and bob's your uncle, rather than doing all this newfangeldy PATH magic...
[14:29:05] <Manishearth> you do `rustfmt foo.rs`
[14:29:19] <Manishearth> haha
[14:29:31] <Manishearth> we also used makefiles
[14:30:00] <Manishearth> then again, makefiles+submodules ~= cargo+lockfiles given the recent lockocalypse
[14:30:04] <SimonSapin> Manishearth: but why?
[14:30:15] <Manishearth> SimonSapin: because rustfmt!
[14:30:31] <SimonSapin> does rustfmt does formatting while also building?
[14:30:46] <Manishearth> rustfmt doesn't build

[15:02:19] <Ms2ger> So JSRef removal... How do we prevent creating DOM objects on the stack?
[15:03:02] <mwu> they're required to be rooted
[15:03:13] <mwu> references to rooted things aren't considered
[15:03:51] <Ms2ger> Come again?
[15:03:51] <mwu> not that you'd be able to accomplish very much if you tried to create a dom object on the stack
[15:04:10] <mwu> dom objects are marked as [dom_struct], which marks them as [must_root]
[15:04:45] <mwu> so just making a dom object on stack will cause the appropriate lint to complain
[15:05:32] <Ms2ger> Okay, good
[15:05:49] <mwu> not that that's particularly useful, because just making a dom object doesn't attach it to a reflector, so I don't know what you're going to do with it
[15:06:08] <mwu> and attaching it to a reflector using the appropriate function automatically roots the thing

[15:08:32] <mwu> heh. fair
[15:09:07] <mwu> though - most methods are implemented on the reference to the object rather than the object itself
[15:09:44] <mwu> though if you're going to go this far, maybe you can just create a reference and start calling all the other methods

[15:13:05] <Ms2ger> So the issue I'm seeing is that you'd create a Document on the stack, say, and then the JS<>s inside it wouldn't actually be traced

[15:14:05] <mwu> yeah. that's actually also a problem during the proper dom object creation path

[15:14:57] <mwu> we might have gotten away with it before because of the stack scanner
[15:16:53] <mwu> and the must_root lint helps about as much unsafe in this regard

[15:22:09] <mwu> which still makes me uncomfortable, because it's *easy* to screw it up
[15:23:09] <mwu> for example, in performance.rs, Performance creates a PerformanceTiming in new_inherited
[15:23:41] <mwu> if this dom object created a second dom object in the same fashion, the first PerformanceTiming it created could've been GC'd
[15:25:17] <mwu> yeah this was probably all protected by stack scanning before

[15:27:24] <godlikesme> at least when I print them using headers.to_string() 
[15:27:26] <jdm> yep
[15:27:32] <mwu> Manishearth: I'm reworking the way dom objects work which will eliminate the need for so much static analysis
[15:27:42] <eddyb> Manishearth: do you happen to have a servo build around? I'm curious how http://sbp.so/supercombiner looks there
[15:27:54] <godlikesme> jdm, so, am I supposed to fill them in http_loader.rs 
[15:28:10] <Manishearth> mwu: cool
[15:28:12] <eddyb> also, does Servo use harfbuzz? I should look into fixing r3's text rendering story

[15:36:38] <Manishearth> ah
[15:36:51] <Manishearth> godlikesme: um, so all HTTP starts with GET / HTTP/1.1
[15:36:57] <Manishearth> unless it's not GET or not 1.1
[15:37:06] <Manishearth> the tcp looks like

[20:28:23] * jdm wonders how to decide when to take a MutableXHandle value vs. returning a raw pointer to X
[20:30:01] <pcwalton> here are some preliminary layout task numbers for 8-core ARM (the Hacker News ones are more interesting) https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1n6mtAquzZjST_NUIYzQlTj5mTxOXUIp_MiCR4gpXIeo/edit?usp=sharing
[20:30:29] <pcwalton> it's big.little, so the speedup when going from 4 to 8 is not expected to be as high
[20:30:57] <pcwalton> since the 4 "little" cores are one processor revision back (cortex a7) and are clocked at 1.3 GHz as opposed to 1.8 GHz
[20:31:26] <pcwalton> I think we should probably turn off parallel DL building… or figure out why we're getting swamped in overhead ;)

[20:44:33] <mwu> MutableXHandle does ensure things get done right
[20:44:48] <mwu> but the interface isn't so pleasant
[20:44:59] <jdm> ok, I'll keep leaving comments for places I see that could be improved by it
[20:46:37] <mwu> can probably convert everything outside of the conversion functions
[20:47:04] <mwu> and if the conversion functions are primarily used by codegen bindings, then that should also be easy to convert
[20:47:41] <mwu> it just seems like a poor interface, so I wasn't trying to convert everything to MutableHandleBase

[22:27:19] <pcwalton> seth mentions that perhaps we need to look at the generated asm for the work stealing
[22:27:33] <pcwalton> there may be way too many memory barriers or something like that

[22:29:13] <pcwalton> yeah, I could look into that

[22:29:30] <pcwalton> I first want to see how much performance I can squeeze out of the device ;)
[22:29:31] <Savago> AFAICT, that is not exposed through any API.
[22:29:40] <pcwalton> well, you can use CPU affinity
[22:30:09] <Savago> Specially for cellphones, faster + less energy would be nice to have. :-)
[22:30:23] <pcwalton> with the latest kernel for a big.LITTLE architecture like the XU3 board all of the CPUs are exposed as logical CPUs
[22:30:27] <pcwalton> so you can set affinity for them
[22:31:20] <Savago> pcwalton: just curious, but did you have to bootstrap rust to get servo running on odroid?
[22:31:39] <pcwalton> Savago: yeah, I did -- I used the rust snapshot from japaric's ruststrap and build rust from source
[22:31:43] <pcwalton> took many hours
[22:32:00] <Savago> crosscompiling or using the board to do it all?
[22:32:06] <pcwalton> I did it all on the board
[22:32:18] <Savago> yeah… that will take a while. :-)
[22:32:29] <pcwalton> well, it is an 8-core 1.7 GHz Cortex A15
[22:32:35] <pcwalton> so it was faster than you might think
[22:32:45] <Savago> Plus servo is not that huge code base.
[22:32:47] <pcwalton> most of the problems were false starts compiling rust with the wrong snapshot :)
[22:32:57] <pcwalton> compiling and bootstrapping rust was the biggest problem
[22:33:01] <pcwalton> servo itself wasn't too bad
[22:33:32] <Savago> And what about cargo? IIRC it will try to download some stuff that is x86 only...
[22:33:48] <Savago> (of course, it is a python script, can be changed).
[22:33:51] <pcwalton> I used the prebuilt cargo for ARM that japaric made

[22:34:36] <pcwalton> but I just ran in headless mode to get layout perf numbers
[22:35:01] <Savago> Yeah, this afternoon I looked into getting servo running on a raspberry pi 2. Was doing ok but run out of SD space for compiling (8GB disk is not enough for everything).
[22:35:07] <pcwalton> ah, yeah
[22:35:30] <Savago> Ordered a bigger SD, will resume as soon I have it. :-)
[22:35:41] <pcwalton> I did need to make 2GB of swap on the SD card
[22:36:03] <Savago> humm… 2GB wasnt enough for link?
[22:36:07] <pcwalton> it wasn't :(
[22:36:11] <Savago> damn.
[22:36:21] <pcwalton> swapping is really painful on SD, but you don't need that much swap to build Servo and linux's memory manager did a good job of putting the hottest parts in memory
[22:36:26] <pcwalton> so it wasn't too bad
[22:36:33] <Savago> I wasn’t aware that linking would be that bad.
[22:36:39] <pcwalton> it was actually building script
[22:36:41] <pcwalton> that was the problem
[22:36:46] <pcwalton> well, that was when I first got OOM killed

[22:37:46] <pcwalton> would be nice...
[22:37:51] <Savago> Well, you can always throw more hardware at the problem.

[22:41:17] <Savago> oh, indeed. Silly me.
[22:41:21] <pcwalton> I need to investigate why scaling seems worse on ARM than x86
[22:42:05] <pcwalton> my gut instinct tells me either the work stealing infrastructure isn't tuned well for ARM's memory model or there's disk I/O gumming up the works
[22:42:10] <pcwalton> (in particular, fonts)
[22:42:47] <jdm> mwu: why the UnsafeCell changes?

[22:42:56] <Savago> pcwalton: can you create a ram disk to store the fonts when you start servo?
[22:43:09] <pcwalton> Savago: that's a good idea, if that's indeed the problem
[22:43:14] <pcwalton> I need to get a profiler up and running though
[22:43:17] <pcwalton> guessing is not good
[22:43:20] <Savago> That would eliminate I/O from the equation.

[22:49:21] <mwu> or whatever else
