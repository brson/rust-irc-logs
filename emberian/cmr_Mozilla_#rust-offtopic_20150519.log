[13:03:06] <ChrisMorgan> JavaScript is making me feel insecure about mutability of GC objects that I’m returning which the caller might just touch. Rust has achieved that—I am genuinely feeling anxious about it!

[13:13:07] <ogham> Is that a good thing?
[13:14:15] <ChrisMorgan> I haven’t decided that yet.
[13:14:51] <ogham> heh
[13:15:17] <ChrisMorgan> Rust has definitely fostered my paranoia, through showing me a way of preventing certain nasty bugs caused by unintended mutation which *have* tripped me up before.
[13:15:46] <ogham> I think we've all had one of those
[13:15:53] <ogham> One piece of your program silently affecting another part
[13:17:39] <ChrisMorgan> But in Rust it’s such a simple thing, and of such great beauty: if I have a T, I own it and can do what I like with it; if I only have an &T, I don’t own it and can’t mutate it, by accident or otherwise.
[13:18:36] <ChrisMorgan> I wonder whether I should recommend that people stay away from Rust for a while because if they take trouble to grok it, it will proceed to break their heart when they then have to return to other languages.
[13:20:43] <ogham> Some people won't like being told what to do by the computer, though
[13:21:15] <Zoxc> ChrisMorgan: Just use RefCells all over!
[13:21:18] <ogham> I mean, I didn't at first. Stupid machine, why can't you understand what I want? Other languages allow (this construct)!
[13:22:05] <ChrisMorgan> Sure, it’s sometimes harder; DOM stuff and things like it in particular will be more difficult. But the other places where it makes it so much nicer… *ahh*
[13:22:41] <ChrisMorgan> I feel much safer in Rust than I do in Python and JavaScript, and normally happier too.
[13:24:35] <fmtq> ChrisMorgan: well
[13:24:38] <fmtq> DOM can be wrapped in unsafe

[13:31:20] <eddyb> ChrisMorgan: I had some fun on a medium-sized (3k+ LOC) project that did some UI with layout/draw/dispatch event functionality
[13:31:32] <eddyb> ChrisMorgan: initially everything was immutable and I had Cell's and RefCell's
[13:31:40] <eddyb> ChrisMorgan: turned out *none* of that was necessary
[13:31:41] <ChrisMorgan> If you said “get rid of parent and sibling tracking”, it’d become comparatively tolerable.
[13:32:07] <eddyb> well, the layout constraint solving algorithm still uses &Cell<T> but it's transmuted from &mut T
[13:32:20] <ChrisMorgan> trans… EEEK!
[13:32:35] * ChrisMorgan hurries off to bed to avoid transmutation
[13:32:39] <eddyb> I intend to make that into a safe API
[13:32:47] <eddyb> ChrisMorgan: I got lucky that my simplistic design doesn't need parent or sibling access
[13:33:11] <eddyb> so it's a strict ownership tree. a flattened and statically dispatched one, too
[13:34:09] <eddyb> ChrisMorgan: I am still amazed *nothing* broke when I changed all the traversals to &mut
[13:34:27] <eddyb> (well, I had to make the tree mutable in fn main, but that's about it)

[13:34:51] <eddyb> oh
[13:34:56] <eddyb> I'm missing newer commits than that
[13:35:16] <fmtq> oo I'm reaching the 4pm reprieve
[13:35:19] <eddyb> didn't get to push them when I last had time to spend on this project
[13:35:23] <fmtq> it's the beginning of the two hours where I don't feel like complete shit 
[13:35:27] <fmtq> and can get _some_ work done 
[13:35:34] <fmtq> then I just feel like passing out
[13:35:47] <ChrisMorgan> eddyb: and now shudder about the concept of doing something even vaguely like that change in a language like JavaScript.
[13:35:57] <fmtq> JavaScript is beautiful.
[13:36:12] <ChrisMorgan> fmtq: we should put it in an art gallery, then. And leave it there.
[13:36:18] <fmtq> there are few other languages where you can fuck everything up so easily.
[13:36:22] <ogham> haha
[13:36:36] <fmtq> Brendan Eich comes out and says it was all performance art this whole time
[13:36:40] <eddyb> ChrisMorgan: you can implement JS's type system in safe Rust, we just lack some primitives to make that job simpler
[13:36:42] <fmtq> it was a long term troll art project
[13:36:59] <eddyb> ChrisMorgan: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues/1106
[13:37:45] <eddyb> fmtq: JS is what you get when the enterprise wants you to come up with a spec-less language implementation in a week
[13:37:54] <fmtq> eddyb: no
[13:37:56] <fmtq> it isn't.
[13:37:57] <eddyb> it was even late
[13:37:57] <fmtq> really.
[13:38:03] <fmtq> you can come up with better shit than that 
[13:38:15] <fmtq> like why does void 0 even do anything
[13:38:16] <eddyb> while not getting fired?
[13:38:19] <fmtq> yes
[13:38:21] <fmtq> while not getting fired.
[13:38:26] <fmtq> I have... had experience here.
[13:38:33] <eddyb> void x is x, undefined
[13:38:39] <eddyb> except undefined can be defined
[13:38:44] <fmtq> I had to invent a schema language
[13:38:48] <fmtq> for some reason
[13:38:54] <fmtq> in a very short period of time 
[13:39:16] <ChrisMorgan> Most people don’t know of `void` in JavaScript, and most people that do know of it misunderstand it.
[13:39:17] <fmtq> I don't even remember what happened
[13:39:23] <fmtq> I think I may have just said "nope that's dumb" 
[13:39:27] <fmtq> and gave them like xs:schema

[13:39:57] <eddyb> ChrisMorgan: how far off was I?
[13:40:16] <fmtq> not too far of.
[13:40:17] <fmtq> off* 
[13:40:25] <fmtq> it was to allow evaluation of shit that returns, but force it to not return.
[13:40:27] <ChrisMorgan> eddyb: void is a unary operator that produces undefined, so you got it.

[13:41:09] <ChrisMorgan> eddyb: how long do you want the piece of string?
[13:41:22] <ogham> js has `void`??

[13:41:39] <fmtq> you people and your nightmares.
[13:41:46] <fmtq> my favourite one is 
[13:41:52] <ChrisMorgan> eddyb: you should have been more specific, then!
[13:41:52] <fmtq> "how do I remove an item from an array?"
[13:41:58] <fmtq> obviously you use .splice
[13:42:01] <fmtq> as if you wouldn't know that fuck 
[13:42:03] <ogham> obviously
[13:42:11] <ChrisMorgan> No, you use `delete x[i];` and leave a hole.
[13:42:12] <fmtq> also

[13:42:19] <fmtq> ChrisMorgan: you're bad and you should feel bad.
[13:42:35] <ChrisMorgan> fmtq: arrays, objects… why does JavaScript even *have* both of them?
[13:42:39] <fmtq> var x = [1,2,3,4,5]; x.length = 3; console.log(x); >> [1,2,3]
[13:42:51] <fmtq> ChrisMorgan: and why doesn't it consistently utilitse them 
[13:42:54] <fmtq> DOM is awful because NodeLists 
[13:43:06] <fmtq> no .forEach for you
[13:43:15] <eddyb> just fix its prototype
[13:43:23] <fmtq> ahhaha 
[13:43:27] <eddyb> it's monkeys all the way down
[13:43:44] <fmtq> Array.prototype.forEach.call(arguments, function(foo) { ... })
[13:43:47] <fmtq> I can't even remember if that works
[13:43:51] <fmtq> I suspect it doesn't.
[13:44:08] <ChrisMorgan> Quick quiz of something that bit me an hour ago: what’s the difference between `for (var x of document.getElementsByClassName("active")) { x.classList.remove("active"); }` and `for (var x of document.querySelectorAll(".active")) { x.classList.remove("active"); }`?
[13:44:09] <eddyb> you're too verbose
[13:44:30] <eddyb> fmtq: [].forEach.call(arguments, ...
[13:44:55] <fmtq> doesn't that allocate an array 
[13:44:58] <fmtq> just to access its prototype
[13:45:00] <eddyb> don't be silly
[13:45:06] <ChrisMorgan> fmtq: it works. Worse is that in Firefox Array.forEach(x, f) exists, so you write that, and then discover that other browsers don’t have it…
[13:45:19] <fmtq> haha
[13:45:21] <ogham> ChrisMorgan: Looks like nothing. But I'm guessing... not nothing?
[13:45:31] <ChrisMorgan> ogham: there is a rather important difference.
[13:45:45] <eddyb> fmtq: JITs are magic
[13:46:06] <eddyb> you can force v8 to turn your objects into Java structs
[13:46:12] <fmtq> I know
[13:46:15] <fmtq> I was reading about this recently
[13:46:21] <fmtq> JIT bugs, mostly
[13:46:21] <eddyb> I used it
[13:46:24] <eddyb> it wasn't enough :(
[13:46:25] <eddyb> fmtq: wat?
[13:46:28] <fmtq> how you can force it to optimise things through magi c
[13:46:29] <ogham> ChrisMorgan: I give up :(
[13:46:37] <eddyb> this is not a bug, it's one of the selling features :P
[13:46:46] <ChrisMorgan> ogham: first clue: getElementsByClassName produces an HTMLCollection, querySelectorAll produces a NodeList. A NodeList is static, but an HTMLCollection stays current.
[13:46:47] <fmtq> eddyb: no, you misinterpret
[13:46:53] <fmtq> I was looking into the JIT because of the bugs
[13:46:57] <eddyb> oh
[13:46:59] <fmtq> I found teh things it couldn't do right to be very interesting
[13:47:01] <ChrisMorgan> See if you can figure out the rest.
[13:47:02] <ogham> ChrisMorgan: So when you iterate through it, it changes the thing that you're iterating through?
[13:47:09] <fmtq> yep
[13:47:13] <fmtq> HTMLCollection, bffs
[13:47:16] <ogham> Daaaaaaaaang.
[13:47:30] <fkaa> eddyb: java structs?
[13:47:34] <fmtq> if x instanceof HTMLCollection -> CREATE AN ARRAY OR BAD HAPPEN
[13:47:36] <eddyb> https://developers.google.com/v8/design
[13:47:53] <eddyb> fkaa: as in, GC overhead, but not using a HashMap for fields
[13:47:56] <ChrisMorgan> ogham: precisely. And so the getElementsByClassName approach actually only removes the class from *half* of the matching elements, while the querySelectorAll approach does it from all of them.
[13:48:12] <fmtq> querySelectorAll is the best function name ever
[13:48:15] <ogham> Bet that took you a while to figure out

[13:48:37] <fmtq> $ is actually cool in a way 
[13:48:43] <ChrisMorgan> ogham: it didn’t, actually, because I possess the arcane knowledge.

[13:49:11] <ChrisMorgan> I was puzzled for almost half a minute before I realised what had happened.
[13:49:22] <ogham> Is 'lucky' the right word to use?
[13:49:52] <ChrisMorgan> Anyway, my nifty little project which this is a part of is coming along nicely.
[13:49:56] <fmtq> ChrisMorgan: you can get paid a lot just for knowing how to debug JS.
[13:50:02] <fmtq> i know this from experience.
[13:50:05] <ChrisMorgan> fmtq: it’s sad, isn’t it.
[13:50:17] <fmtq> in AU, I got a $10k payrise because I held the gun to their head
[13:50:20] <fmtq> "nobody else can debug this codebase."
[13:50:27] <ogham> haha
[13:50:34] <fmtq> I then did it again for another $10k
[13:50:37] <fmtq> then I quit.
[13:50:43] <fmtq> because I realise no amount of money makes it worth it
[13:50:45] <ChrisMorgan> The third step was possibly the best.
[13:50:58] <eddyb> fmtq: I thought you were in uni
[13:50:59] <fmtq> it was Adobe JS.
[13:51:03] <fmtq> eddyb: I do a lot of stuff.
[13:51:05] <fmtq> like.
[13:51:07] <fmtq> a lot.
[13:51:14] <ChrisMorgan> fmtq: money can definitely ameliorate, thouh.
[13:51:16] <ogham> I want to say that this is something specific to programming, but it probably isn't and I'm just blissfully unaware of it
[13:51:23] <fmtq> ChrisMorgan: it stopped me ragequitting for a year
[13:51:27] <fmtq> but priorities change
[13:51:33] <fmtq> and theres was an interest in being acquired in the US
[13:51:38] <fmtq> nobody else noticed this change in strategy but me 
[13:51:42] <fmtq> I left before they fired half the company
[13:51:56] <fmtq> they would not have made me redundant though 
[13:52:02] <fmtq> because I was needed -.-
[13:52:04] <fmtq> Adobe JS is amazing
[13:52:14] <fmtq> so LiveCycle backends flatten the scopes of all functions.
[13:52:16] <fmtq> that's right kids
[13:52:21] <fmtq> all variabels are global
[13:52:27] <fmtq> side effects++++++++++
[13:52:30] <ChrisMorgan> fmtq: staying around in such situations can sometimes be worth it if they pay for voluntary redundancy.
[13:52:37] <fmtq> ChrisMorgan: they would not.
[13:52:38] <fmtq> they did not.
[13:52:42] <eddyb> fmtq: like var wasn't fucked up already
[13:52:43] <fmtq> they selectively fired everyone one day 
[13:52:47] <fmtq> eddyb: yup
[13:52:47] <fmtq> OH
[13:52:49] <fmtq> and it doesn't log errors
[13:52:52] <fmtq> so the scripts just don't work
[13:52:55] <fmtq> and you can't know why
[13:52:57] <eddyb> sheesh
[13:52:59] <fmtq> you can't lgo line by line
[13:53:00] <fmtq> becausae
[13:53:03] <eddyb> I've been bitten by unkept promises
[13:53:04] <fmtq> it only prints the log if the file worked.
[13:53:04] <ChrisMorgan> OK, for that sort of approach getting out early is very likely to be best.
[13:53:14] <fmtq> yep
[13:53:17] <fmtq> I earn more doing contracting now anyway 
[13:53:19] <fmtq> which is ALSO SAD
[13:53:20] <eddyb> if there is no error handler, you don't get anything
[13:53:27] <ogham> when I was very very young, I realised I wrote "int i" a lot, so I made i global to save space
[13:53:41] <fmtq> ogham: haha that's beautiful 
[13:53:43] <ogham> It took me way longer than it should have to learn not to use globals.
[13:53:45] <fmtq> and logical
[13:53:47] <fmtq> just flawed.
[13:53:55] <eddyb> fmtq: same with function scope
[13:54:01] <ChrisMorgan> I constantly find myself writing `let` in JavaScript rather than `var`. It’s almost making me switch on JS 1.7 mode just so `let` works.
[13:54:08] <eddyb> ChrisMorgan: doit
[13:54:19] <eddyb> ChrisMorgan: also, use traceur or something else for compat with older browsers
[13:54:26] <fmtq> so like 
[13:54:30] <fmtq> fuck JavaScript.
[13:54:31] <ogham> Does 'let' have an older browser shim?
[13:54:48] <ChrisMorgan> Or maybe I should just `abbrev let var` for filetype=javascript just like I did `abbrev fn def` for filetype=python.
[13:54:50] <eddyb> ogham: there's at least two ES6 to ES5 compilers
[13:54:56] <eddyb> the oldest one, I believe, is traceur
[13:55:03] <ogham> #define let var, then run through cpp
[13:55:10] <ogham> ah right
[13:55:11] <eddyb> 5to6 and TypeScript come to mind, but...
[13:55:12] <ChrisMorgan> !!
[13:55:12] <rustbot> !!!
[13:55:24] <eddyb> ogham: they don't have the same semantics :|
[13:55:36] <eddyb> var is derply scoped
[13:56:00] <eddyb> there is only one thing in ES5 which behaves like let
[13:56:01] <ogham> yes, that was the only thing wrong with my suggestion.
[13:56:08] <eddyb> let's see if anyone here knows :P
[13:56:27] <ChrisMorgan> eddyb: in a language without expression orientation, I must confess that JavaScript’s silly `var` behaviour is actually a little more useful than `let`.
[13:56:47] <ChrisMorgan> Hazardous, maybe, but easier.
[13:56:51] <eddyb> (it was also slowmode in v8, but they've worked on it since. not sure how much better it's now)
[13:57:03] <eddyb> ChrisMorgan: meh, expression orientation is best orientation
[13:57:16] <eddyb> I wrote my ES6 like I write my Rust

[14:12:01] <saml> san francisco is so behind in time
[14:12:16] <eddyb> ChrisMorgan: I'm thinking along the lines of https://botbot.me/mozilla/rust/2015-01-09/?msg=29147793&page=31
[14:12:36] <eddyb> saml: he had a lighting talk at the (recorded) Rust 1.0 release party
[14:12:50] <ChrisMorgan> eddyb: sadly, botbot.me doesn’t seem to keep logs searchable six months ago.
[14:12:53] <saml> is it a quiz?
[14:13:09] <ChrisMorgan> But I do know that such a thing was not said while I was in #rust.
[14:13:09] <eddyb> the talk?
[14:13:13] <saml> so eddyb knows the answer to the quiz. and ChrisMorgan is trying to figure out
[14:13:22] <eddyb> huh
[14:13:36] <eddyb> ChrisMorgan: I have my own logs, lemme check
[14:13:37] <saml> https://air.mozilla.org/rust-release-party/
[14:13:40] <saml> so it's cmr 
[14:13:46] <eddyb> saml: wat
[14:14:00] <saml> you guys are solving who's that pokemon
[14:14:06] <saml> and IT'S CMR
[14:14:15] <saml> rustian
[14:14:22] <saml> who's that rustian
[14:14:35] <ChrisMorgan> eddyb: you’ve sown very substantial doubt in my mind, but I *do* like the idea of bstrie saying “nobody knows who it is” when it’s him.

[14:15:47] <eddyb> ah

[14:17:13] <eddyb> lel
[14:17:18] <ChrisMorgan> ☹
[14:17:21] <saml> so rust has more clarity than haskell?
[14:17:24] <eddyb> ChrisMorgan: rekt
[14:17:30] <eddyb> saml: depends what you're writing in it
[14:17:41] <eddyb> saml: they can both be horrible if abused properly
[14:18:01] <saml> of course
[14:18:12] <saml> isn't Go the clearest?
[14:18:52] <ChrisMorgan> Well, before Rust 1.0.0 I had p=0.5 pcwalton, p=0.4 bstrie and p=0.1 other, after Rust 1.0.0 I had p=0.95 bstrie and p=0.05 other, now thanks to you pointing out the obvious interpretation which I somehow missed and finding evidence for it, I’m back to p=1 unknown ☹
[14:19:15] <eddyb> ChrisMorgan: I have a data point

[14:19:28] <saml> that's horse_rust's email

[14:21:37] <eddyb> ChrisMorgan: this fits very well with my data point
[14:21:46] <saml> or matt coffin
[14:21:53] <eddyb> but I feel bad because it's cheating
[14:22:01] <ChrisMorgan> Cheating!?
[14:22:06] <eddyb> saml: that doesn't fit at all with my data point
[14:22:17] <ChrisMorgan> NOTHING is cheating in an investigation like this.
[14:22:32] <eddyb> it's data leakage from twitter
[14:23:00] <eddyb> this went beyond investigation and into doxing territory
[14:23:03] <ChrisMorgan> eddyb: if one wishes to maintain a secret persona and they slip, it’s their own fault if someone else jumps on that.
[14:23:10] <fmtq> that's not doxing 
[14:23:16] <fmtq> let us not be silly.
[14:23:20] <saml> i dox girls
[14:23:25] <saml> is dox stalking?
[14:23:28] <fmtq> saml: yes.
[14:23:35] <fmtq> also awful human being
[14:23:38] <saml> stalking is weird
[14:23:44] <saml> stalking is lonely
[14:23:47] <eddyb> :|
[14:23:58] <saml> i don't think you can stalk a person together as a team
[14:24:05] <fmtq> why is this suddenly happening
[14:24:13] <saml> i don't know
[14:24:18] <saml> we thought horse_rust was a girl
[14:24:23] <eddyb> fmtq: why is saml confessing? guilt?
[14:24:23] <fmtq> saml: stalking as a group is definitely still stalking.
[14:24:36] <eddyb> saml: who thought?
[14:24:42] <fmtq> and if merely the fact it _might_ be a girl makes you do it, that's a pretty fucked up thing.
[14:24:57] <saml> if i like boyz ii men, is it stalking
[14:25:07] <fmtq> dude.
[14:25:23] <fmtq> it is the fact that you are singling anyone out for reasons of gender or sexual preference 
[14:25:25] <fmtq> that intent 
[14:25:30] <eddyb> cmr: can I haz ops in here?
[14:25:33] <fmtq> and the aim.
[14:25:44] <eddyb> cmr: sometimes I feel like kicking ass
[14:26:12] <eddyb> saml: please tell me you're trolling

[16:58:39] <Twisol> Once upon a time, I thought people with more than 50 tabs were crazy. I'm approaching that number myself. It's only a matter of time before I break 100.
[16:58:58] <Tobba> Tiffany: I'm glad I'm not alone in having monsterous amounts of tabs
[16:59:03] <Tobba> it doesn't *feel* like 300
[16:59:07] <Tiffany> hah
[16:59:08] <Tiffany> yeah
[16:59:17] <Tiffany> I peaked at 350 a couple weeks ago
[16:59:21] <lahwran> I have been using tab pinning as a queue of cold tabs that I need to deal with
[16:59:42] <cmr> I use pinned tabs for the shit I actively care about
[16:59:46] <cmr> and tab groups for the shit I don't
[16:59:48] <Tiffany> I thought about installing that one extension that makes tabs expire
[17:00:03] <Tiffany> but it's like
[17:00:06] <Tiffany> I don't want these tabs to expire
[17:00:08] <Tiffany> I want to read them
[17:00:10] <cmr> yeah.
[17:00:22] <lahwran> cmr: I tried to do that
[17:00:26] <lahwran> but I found that I forget about pinned tabs
[17:00:27] <Tiffany> what I really want is an AI to read them for me and then just hand me the distilled knowledge
[17:00:37] <cmr> lahwran: I put email and music in there, usually the only things.
[17:00:41] <lahwran> so I use pinned tabs for "things I can't just close at a whim"
[17:00:41] <Tobba> so basically cpedia?
[17:00:47] <cmr> Tiffany: yeah. shame summarizing is a Hard Problem (TM)
[17:01:05] <Tiffany> some of these articles I would also like to be able to read from my kindle
[17:01:08] <GaryOak_> mechanical turk it
[17:01:09] <Tiffany> but there's no easy way to do that
[17:01:11] <lahwran> there are summarizing algorithms that choose which sentences to drop from a paragraph
[17:01:20] <lahwran> they actually produce some really surprisingly good results
[17:01:22] <cmr> Tiffany: Does the Kindle support Paper?
[17:01:26] <cmr> My Kobo does, which is nice.
[17:01:27] <XMPPwocky> algorithm choose sentences from a paragraph?
[17:01:33] <Tiffany> I used instapaper for a while if that's what you mean
[17:01:39] <Tiffany> I eventually stopped using it
[17:01:39] <cmr> Pocket, sorry.
[17:01:45] <Tiffany> since it has several days of latency
[17:01:48] <Tiffany> for no discernable reason
[17:01:50] <cmr> I always get Pocket and Instapaper confused.
[17:02:00] <Tiffany> also
[17:02:05] <lahwran> I am very annoyed that this site's latex thingy is unreadable on mobile chrome http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html
[17:02:08] <Tiffany> instapaper used amazon's cloud file thingy
[17:02:12] <Tiffany> which costs money now
[17:02:13] <cmr> s3?
[17:02:15] <Tiffany> no
[17:02:21] <Tiffany> a consumer-oriented one
[17:02:43] <cmr> oh, cloud drive?
[17:03:01] <Tiffany> probably
[17:03:08] <cmr> yeah I pay money for that now. $60 for "unlimited data" isn't bad. I'm using it to store backups etc now.
[17:03:28] <cmr> it's pretty shit quality though.
[17:04:28] <Tiffany> but yeah, of the tabs I have open, I've managed to work through most of the articles
[17:04:30] <Tiffany> which leaves the hard bits
[17:04:49] <Tiffany> all of the books, papers, and other deep sources of information that people have linked me and have gone to my tabs to die
[17:05:28] <Astrum|Lap> I have tons of tabs open
[17:05:39] <Astrum|Lap> the problem is I usuaully end up having duplicates
[17:05:56] <Astrum|Lap> like reddit or something
[17:05:59] <Tiffany> oh
[17:06:03] <Tiffany> I don't really have problems with duplicates
[17:06:15] <Tiffany> both because firefox will search open tabs and display those first
[17:06:35] <Tiffany> and because I don't have many duplicative sources of information
[17:06:36] <Astrum|Lap> well, not exact duplicates
[17:07:02] <Astrum|Lap> like having /r/programming and /r/rust open
[17:07:11] <Astrum|Lap> I don't really need two tabs to browse reddit, but it happens
[17:07:52] <Tiffany> I don't really browse reddit
[17:08:04] <Tiffany> I have /r/rust in my rss reader
[17:08:13] <Tiffany> and some other considerably less active subreddits
[17:08:29] <Astrum|Lap> those were just examples =P
[17:10:00] <Astrum|Lap> at the moment I have... tons of github tabs open, some random blogs and wikis, a few SO tabs, and a couple mailing list archives

[18:16:18] <saml> for example,  <font size="12">asdf</font>  =>  asdf
[18:16:27] <cmr> can probably do it pretty simply, the constructs "standard" markdown supports are few and easy to pattern match

[20:11:49] <Sho> to buy almond milk, we've been over that

[20:14:40] <Astrum|Lap> I don't mind having a deadline if the requirements are straight forward
[20:14:45] <Sho> or you haven't figure out how to portion work without pressure
[20:15:34] <Astrum|Lap> unlike this current project which is pretty much, 'do whatever, we'll tell you what we actually wanted the night before the deadline'

[20:39:41] <Havvy> brson:  What do you think about giving VOP to the bots in #rust ?
[20:41:16] <brson> Havvy: what would that do?
[20:42:43] <Havvy> Voice makes it so that they can still talk when the channel is moderated (+m). It's more used as a flag that pulls nicknames to the top of the userlist.
[20:44:01] <Astrum|Lap> ugh... why are you stripping out HTML tags, chrome? this makes no sense =/
[20:44:26] <lahwran> if it's invalid html it might be trying to fix it and failing
[20:44:59] <Astrum|Lap> it's just a simple <a> tag
[20:45:41] <brson> Havvy: what bots are currently running in #rust?
[20:45:54] <Havvy> playbot, rustbot, playbot-lite
[20:45:55] -playbot- <anon>:9:16: 9:17 error: expected one of `!`, `.`, `::`, `;`, `{`, `}`, or an operator, found `,`

[20:51:11] <Astrum|Lap> nevermind
[20:51:14] <Astrum|Lap> ugh -_-
[20:51:31] <Astrum|Lap> wasn't chrome being silly
[20:52:35] <brson> Havvy: why would bots having voice be helpful when moderation is on?
[20:53:03] <Sho> brson: He's just after identifying/marking the bots by affecting nicklist sorting
[20:53:20] <brson> hm
[20:53:29] <Havvy> brson:  It wouldn't. Unless somebody in the moderation team wants to call a bot command, though that's unlikely. The mode is used more as a visual flag than its intended purpose.
[20:53:41] <Sho> this is how skynet starts, though
[20:55:04] <brson> Havvy: ok those three bots are vop now in #rust

[21:50:02] <Havvy> niconii:  Yeah, I figured irssi doesn't since it's a terminal client.

[22:42:41] <brson> well, that's the only thing i think
[22:43:00] <cmr> that just means you didn't make a virtualenv but that can be ignored.
