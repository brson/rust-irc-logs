[20:27:54] <mitsuhiko> hello everybody
[20:28:46] <rocode> I am still catching up on context, but it looks like rustpkg as a whole is being scrapped.
[20:28:46] <mitsuhiko> i would like to join the efforts of fixing packaging in case there is one ongoing
[20:29:36] <rocode> There have been three proposals I have seen so far, Versions.io (blackbox at the moment), 0install, and rebuilding rustpkg from scratch.
[20:30:21] <mitsuhiko> may i throw in another option? :)
[20:30:48] <rocode> Go for it.
[20:31:42] <mitsuhiko> i would like to propose writing a combination of python's devpi+virtualenv+pip as a replacement for rustpkg
[20:31:47] <mitsuhiko> but separate it from the rust programming language
[20:31:59] <mitsuhiko> eg: you could use this for other stuff too
[20:32:17] <mitsuhiko> i have some notes on that, but i would need to structure them
[20:32:43] <rocode> mitsuhiko: 0install provides all of the above except a central search index, which we could easily provide.
[20:32:57] <mitsuhiko> i'm not a fan of 0install at all
[20:33:04] <mitsuhiko> it's quite complex for what it does
[20:34:01] <mitsuhiko> also it has very little adoption for how old it is
[20:34:13] <mitsuhiko> (aside from that it's LGPL :P)
[20:34:37] <rocode> So your proposal is a in-house solution with even less adoption/maturity? :)
[20:34:54] <mitsuhiko> yes
[20:35:02] <mitsuhiko> and i'm actually saying that with a straight face
[20:35:11] <mitsuhiko> i'm not saying it should reinvent the wheel
[20:36:38] <mitsuhiko> rocode: alternatively one could place a different toolchain on top of 0install
[20:37:15] <rocode> mitsuhiko: That is the proposal. Their 3.0 line (port to OCaml) addresses a lot of our concerns, and their developer has expressed interest in working with us.
[20:40:22] <mitsuhiko> hmm. no local installations? (etherpad)
[20:40:30] <mitsuhiko> what's the reasoning behind that?
[20:40:54] <rocode> The etherpad is out of date as far as I know.
[20:44:50] <mitsuhiko> rocode: do you have logs somewhere of this conversation?
[20:45:58] *** Quits: eddyb (eddy@EDE07015.D51DAF03.FB866788.IP) (Ping timeout)
[20:46:04] <rocode> No, I started looking into the issue today. I can tell you that the etherpad was entirely written on the 23rd of this month and appears to be ideas for a reimplementation of rustpkg.
[20:53:11] <o11c> I wrote the etherpad just as "what", not "how"
[20:53:27] <o11c> it is silly that everybody makes their own package manager
[20:54:11] <rocode> We have a conversation going on about it in #rust
[20:58:03] <mitsuhiko> o11c: it is, but a generic package manager is out of necessity a complex beast
[20:58:15] <o11c> yeah
[20:58:22] <mitsuhiko> if people can't even agree on how language specific things work, what do you think this is going to look like when you try to solve it for everybody
[20:58:27] <o11c> there are definitely advantages to rolling one from scratch
[20:58:36] <mitsuhiko> also i'm very concerned about windows support
[20:58:40] <o11c> but in the end, I think the winning argument will just be whoever implements it first
[20:58:55] <mitsuhiko> it shouldn't be a race though :)
[20:59:01] <mitsuhiko> otherwise the crappiest solution will win
[20:59:43] <mitsuhiko> i have been through 4 iterations of python packaging and every solution that replaced another one just fixed some of the issues and then forgot about lots of the problems that their predecessors fixed
[20:59:51] <mitsuhiko> very painful to watch
[21:00:23] <rocode> crate, crate-lite, rustpkg, rustpkg 2
[21:01:54] <mitsuhiko> in any case i am very interested in helping out, whatever the solution
[21:02:30] <mitsuhiko> and i will collect my notes on packaging, might be useful
[21:06:24] <cmr> cargo and cargo-lite, not crate :P
[21:06:35] <rocode> er yeah
[21:06:41] <rocode> My point stands.
[21:07:12] <rocode> mitsuhiko: https://github.com/0install/0install
[21:14:19] <mitsuhiko> rocode: i already got that you really like it :)
[21:14:54] <rocode> No, I was pointing you to the master-devel OCaml version, including its toolchain.
[21:16:03] <mitsuhiko> ah thanks, found it before :)

[22:17:43] <mitsuhiko> i'm still in favor of a rustpkg rewrite. am i crazy?
[22:18:11] <o11c> yes, but that's probably for the best
[22:18:45] <rocode> Whatever the case, this will be a blocker on 1.0
