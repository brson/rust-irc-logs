[05:43:05] <dcb> cool.  So warp is quite impressive, but the problem it solves is not equivalent to consensus

[14:30:05] <Ilari> Certificate forgery?

[14:34:07] <Tiffany> maybe you just got that impression because of the embargo, or maybe news sites were overly sensationalist about it
[14:34:22] <Tiffany> certificate forgery is a pretty big deal though
[14:35:10] <Tiffany> it's not exactly leaking private keys, but it allows an attacker with mitm to fool any openssl client into thinking they're connecting to the right server
[14:35:15] <Tiffany> as long as that server isn't using HPKP

[14:52:19] <Ilari> Hah, Debian stable has OpenSSL 1.0.1, but it is apparently too old to have the bug?
[14:53:45] <Ilari> Also, doesn't triggering the buggy code require violating TLS specifications?
[14:54:16] <Lurkin> 1.0.1k is a reliable branch imho.

[16:55:20] <bascule> lol Ilari 
[16:55:48] <Ilari> Well, looking at the testcase, the TLS certainly can't send certificate chain like that. At least if you are following requirements.
[16:56:44] *** Joins: dcb (dcb@moz-4hh.6p3.217.74.IP)
[17:02:19] <Ilari> But given the general attitude to security with X.509, no wonder one gets bugs like that.
[17:10:14] <Ilari> The X.509 way of parsing: Be liberal in what you accept, and liberal in what you send.
[17:18:48] <Ilari> If you ever get to security vs. compatibility situation, you must break stuff to get out. No other way.

[18:19:18] <eternaleye> Personally, I think that one week after Let's Encrypt launches, plain HTTP should result in a yellow bar in all browsers
[18:19:33] <eternaleye> Because at that point, there's no "but getting a cert is haaaard"
[18:19:37] <Ilari> Watch out for color blindness.
[18:21:06] <Ilari> (I don't have overt color blindness, but I know there are a lot of those who can't properly tell apart red, yellow and green).
[18:21:51] *** Joins: Tobba (Tobba@moz-oecqnu.plus.com)
[18:24:17] <Lurkin> What's wrong with generating your own CA and not doing OSCP and HPKP assuming you're ok with the extra overhead of not pinning your cert.
[18:25:10] <Lurkin> I would go to CA parties like PGP key parties.
[18:25:57] <Ilari> Let's encrypt certs might be bit funky tho: AFAIK, the cross cert is at issuing cert level, and those certs are also certified by IRSG root. Which would mean there is no way to validly chain to both.
[18:27:24] <eternaleye> Ilari: I don't know of any color blindness between white, yellow, or red
[18:27:25] <eternaleye> Ilari: There is between red and green, but the browsers already use those...
[18:28:06] <Ilari> Red, Yellow and Green (since for those with it, Red and Green show up as Yellow).
[18:28:17] <Ilari> Other kinds are much rarer.
[18:36:09] <bascule> Ilari: coming soon on making the address bar warn http:// is insecure
[18:36:19] <bascule> that's part of the reason why anti-security people are up in arms
[18:36:24] <bascule> including Tim Berners-Lee o_O
[18:40:50] <Tiffany> I have red-green colour blindness
[18:43:31] <Ilari> eternaleye: And well, after doing certain rather inadisable things (did not involve hallucinogens), I once temporarily saw green as white.
[18:45:25] <Tiffany> in general, something large like an address bar is pretty easy to tell a part
[18:45:32] <Tiffany> but little checkboxes or text are impossible
[18:45:40] <Tiffany> I definitely don't see red and green as yellow...
[18:47:30] <Tiffany> I could probably confuse red and green as brown though
[18:47:47] <Tiffany> and yellow as orange or lime green
[18:48:16] <Tiffany> there are differing degrees of severity though
[18:48:36] <Tiffany> and of course other rarer kinds of colour blindness
[18:51:05] <Tiffany> it looks like there's red-green, blue-yellow, and total colour blindness
[18:51:45] <Ilari> Blue-Yellow is very rare.
[18:52:11] <Tiffany> all of the ones other than deuteranomaly are very rare
[18:53:02] <Ilari> Also, one idea for showing HTTP as insecure: Like those green bars, but instead Red, and with text INSECURE SITE (in some color that has sufficient contrast).
[18:53:21] <Tiffany> I like that
[18:53:28] *** Quits: Tobba (Tobba@moz-oecqnu.plus.com) (A TLS packet with unexpected length was received.)
[18:53:42] <Tiffany> hmm
[18:53:50] <Tiffany> do browsers respect HSTS when sent over plaintext http?
[18:53:56] <Tiffany> I know they don't try https first
[18:53:59] <Ilari> No, they don't.
[18:54:04] <Tiffany> wow
[18:54:12] <Tiffany> it's pretty stupid
[18:54:17] <Ilari> So you need redirect on HTTP.
[18:54:19] <Tiffany> you type "google.com" and it tries http first...
[18:54:23] <Tiffany> well
[18:54:26] <Tiffany> it /only/ tries http
[18:54:40] <Tiffany> unless it's in the HSTS list
[18:55:05] <Tiffany> the redirect can be kind of annoying
[18:55:11] <Ilari> Well, at least I have disabled all the retarded address bar behaviour like submitting to search engine and search paths.
[18:55:24] <Tiffany> in particular, automated tools and stuff sometimes can't deal with https
[18:56:37] <Ilari> I actually can type 'ai' to address bar, and it actually connects to the site (yes, ccTLD with A record, with port 80 listening).
[18:57:20] <Tiffany> firefox gives me a thing saying it did a search and asks if I meant to go to 'ai'
[18:57:42] <Ilari> And typing something invalid gives an error instead of submitting the thing to who knows where.
[18:58:04] <Tiffany> I have my search engine set to duckduckgo
[18:58:24] <Tiffany> the default search engine on firefox for android is yahoo now
[18:58:34] <Tiffany> it's kind of weird
[18:58:45] <Tiffany> there is growing unhappiness with firefox because of it including all this weird stuff
[18:58:49] <Tiffany> it has integration with proprietary services now
[18:59:14] <Tiffany> they don't really force it on you though, I guess nobody changes their defaults though
[18:59:26] <Tiffany> I wonder what the story behind ai is
[18:59:35] <Ilari> Well, for certain people, any sort of UI changes are a _MAJOR_ problem.
[18:59:51] <Tiffany> like that guy who spammed mozilla IRC over the changes made like a couple years ago?
[18:59:57] <Ilari> One of the few ccTLDs with A records.
[19:00:27] <Tiffany> interesting
[19:00:39] <Tiffany> I have some entries in my /etc/hosts which don't use any TLDs
[19:00:49] <Ilari> BTW: gTLDs are banned from having top-level A records. ccTLDs can do what they want.
[19:00:59] <Tiffany> mostly to VPSes and stuff so I can get ssh access without having to remember an IP address
[19:02:10] <Ilari> Also, gTLDs can't have top-level wildcards. ccTLDs can, and some allegedly do, but I can't offhand give examples.
[19:02:28] <Tiffany> what about brand TLDs or whatever they're called?
[19:02:30] <Tiffany> like .blue
[19:02:37] <Tiffany> or are those considered gTLDs
[19:04:54] <Ilari> Well, as far as rules like no top A/AAAA records, no top wildcards, 30 day warning period (another things ccTLDs don't have, those can pop up immediately), etc are concerned, those are gTLDs. 
[19:06:26] <Ilari> There's a I-D that lists 16 ccTLDs with A records, and 1 with AAAA record.

[23:49:23] <Ilari> bascule: Respond to what? I haven't seen much about signatures.
[23:51:14] * Ilari upgrades OpenSSL.
[23:54:46] * bascule just finished upgrading OpenSSL, lol
[23:56:56] <Ilari> Wonder if I could get some discussion going with "what I don't like about other's proposals"...
