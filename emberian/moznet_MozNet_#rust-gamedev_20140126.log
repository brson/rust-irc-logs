[00:57:36] <cmr> csherratt: is the video quality supposed to be nonexistent?
[00:57:37] <csherratt> when you rotate the camera using Transform3D it is rotating the camera around the origin (0, 0, 0) not around the translation.
[00:58:45] <csherratt> cmr: The video quality is terrible on dropbox's preview. I have no idea why, if you download them they are decent.
[00:58:59] <cmr> oh ok

[01:09:11] <csherratt> Well, the only reason I keep pushing this is because I can't use cgmath-rs in its current state to get things done. And I don't like working on a fork.
[01:09:30] <csherratt> Now it could be that I have screwed up  some of the math. 
[01:10:05] <csherratt> Right now I am multiplying my projection matrix by the view matrix  then by the position matrix.
[01:10:34] <csherratt> if the view matrix is calculated using Transform3D it ends up rotation around the origin in a strange way.
[01:10:46] <bjz> yes
[01:10:55] <bjz> I don't want you to be working on a fork
[01:11:00] <csherratt> There might be another step to fixing this.

[01:15:13] <cmr> csherratt: don't be concerned, that's all I can say :)
[01:18:40] <csherratt> That being said. I have a config script that generates Makefiles that correct track build dependencies across crates. So when you modify cgmath, for example, it rebuilds my libraries that depend on it.
[01:18:56] <cmr> fancy!

[01:33:54] <cmr> there might be some corner cases I'm not aware of.
[01:34:18] <bjz> cmr: `cargo-lite.py build` seemed to just build it in the src/cgmath/ directory
[01:34:23] <cmr> bjz: correct.
[01:34:35] <cmr> cargo-lite.py build is mostly intended for working on actual programs.
[01:34:42] <cmr> it installs deps and then builds the crate.
[01:34:47] <bjz> ok
[01:34:59] <cmr> I'm not hard-set on anything it does btw
[01:35:04] <cmr> so if you have suggestions I'm all ears
[01:35:16] <bjz> yep
[01:35:21] <cmr> (can a pile of ears code? I guess we'll find out)
[01:35:23] <bjz> I will think on it
[01:36:37] <cmr> I *think* buildings + deps work now, so it should be fairly simple to add logic on when to rebuild.

[18:06:36] <h3r3tic> bjz_: I'm confused by the whole view matrix thread :p
[18:07:38] <h3r3tic> it's not dificult to build one. have your camera as any other model in 3d space and build the matrix in exactly the same way. then at the very end you invert it
[18:12:12] <kvark> h3r3tic: it is easy to build, but look_at would still save you 3-5 lines in case of a simple scenario
[18:12:58] <h3r3tic> if you want a look-at... depends on your use case. a look-at is neat for a target camera.
[18:13:57] <kvark> that was my impression that look_at was requested, and that's what I'm working on

[18:16:26] <h3r3tic> I think the original post is just a little bit confused. csherratt there tried to build a view matrix without changing the translation part in accordance to the rotation
[18:17:14] *** Quits: dmac (Adium@moz-94F55C3.hfc.comcastbusiness.net) (Ping timeout)
[18:17:29] <kvark> he did build the Matrix part just fine, it was the Transform3D that was done wrong, and I pointed to it in the later comments
[18:18:23] <h3r3tic> yeah, all I'm saying is that it needs a bit more cleanup of the theory rather than just code
[18:18:40] <h3r3tic> one needs to understand what the 'view' matrix actually is
[18:18:59] <h3r3tic> in fact, I don't even like the names, of 'view' or 'world' as they don't convey the underlying linear transformation
[18:19:50] <h3r3tic> the 'view' matrix I call 'world_to_view' most of the time. it's the matrix which transforms from world space to local space of the camera. it's the reverse of what you want for 'model' matrices, which tranfrom from local space of the model to the world space.
[18:19:59] <h3r3tic> and I think the inverse method plugs very clearly there
[18:20:26] <h3r3tic> just take the 'model' transform of your camera and invert it.
[18:20:55] *** Quits: brson (brson@moz-BBE3ABD.mv.mozilla.com) (Quit: leaving)
[18:21:10] <h3r3tic> and if you don't want to roll a full inverse, then decompose the math. basically world_to_view = ( Translation * Rotation )^-1 = Rotation^-1 * Translation^1 = Rotation^T * Translation^-1, and Translation^-1 is trivial.
[18:21:14] <kvark> actually, I didn't pay attention to the names he used (view/world), so you might very well be correct here
[18:22:53] <kvark> see, this kind of math is what I'm baking into look_at. You don't want to derive it from scratch every time you want to place a camera in a simple demo
[18:22:54] *** Joins: jeaye (jeaye@moz-34FEF2BB.hsd1.ca.comcast.net)
[18:24:28] <h3r3tic> nah you can derive it if you want to avoid using the inverse function :P
[18:25:23] <h3r3tic> how do you build a camera using look_at? it's somewhat awkward cause you need to manually build a view matrix first to construct your direction vector
[18:26:09] <kvark> I get it you are not the target audience for look_at at all ;) to be fair, I didn't need it so far either, but it might be useful anyway
[18:27:44] <kvark> you don't need to pre-construct anything, you build the view matrix (for the camera) by calling look_at in the same way GLU did it (by passing eye & center positions and an up vector)
[18:28:31] <h3r3tic> well you need the eye center and target
[18:28:41] <jeaye> And an up direction.
[18:29:26] <h3r3tic> and how do you calculate the direction/target? :P
[18:29:48] <h3r3tic> if it's a targeted camera, you have it. for the typicall free-cam, it's awkward to calculate
[18:29:51] <jeaye> h3r3tic: cm.look_at(player1.pos, player2.pos, vec3::up());
[18:30:19] <h3r3tic> yeah, that's a tracking/targeted camera.
[18:30:20] <jeaye> h3r3tic: Agreed.
[18:30:50] <kvark> h3r3tic: what are you trying to prove here in the end? that look_at() is useless?
[18:33:23] <kvark> bjz_, jeaye: I think our Mat3 look_at is wrong
[18:33:35] <h3r3tic> not trying to prove anything. I'm just afraid that the request for the look_at is somewhat misguided, and will end up sitting in rather awkward code. what would be more useful for the typical camera class is a few words of explanation on how to construct the view matrix for a free camera. or a pre-built camera class.
[18:33:50] <h3r3tic> the cases where look_at is the right solution are rather narrow
[18:34:02] <kvark> I clearly see where look_at shines
[18:34:13] <kvark> in small demoes that do *not* have a camera class at all
[18:34:28] <kvark> like for someone just trying out GL stuff, or doing a CG class lessons
[18:35:12] <h3r3tic> sure
[18:35:36] <h3r3tic> not saying that it's useless :)
[18:40:49] <csherratt> h3r3tic: I was using the terminology found in most of the tutorials. Model, View, Projection.
[18:41:48] <h3r3tic> not criticising you :) most folks use them
[18:42:58] <csherratt> also it's 530am in melboure. So it might be a little while till we see bjz.
[18:43:07] <h3r3tic> hehe
[18:44:02] <kvark> that's fine
[18:44:20] <kvark> I'll just fix whatever is not tested, since it was not guaranteed to work

[18:47:04] <csherratt> How would a look_at api work for a first person view?
[18:47:41] <kvark> you'd pass up = (0,0,1)
[18:47:56] <kvark> oops
[18:48:03] <kvark> nvm
[18:49:02] <kvark> don't use look_at for the first person view, make a proper generic camera class instead
[18:49:10] <csherratt> I just mean, I already have the position and rotation calculated. I want to create the view(world) matrix with one function call.
[18:50:11] <kvark> if that was what you originally requested (and not look_at) then I'm afraid you'll just need to write this function yourself
[18:51:08] <kvark> basically, you need to apply rotation and translation, just in a different order than the one built in Decomposed
[18:51:29] <kvark> you have to code already, so I guess it shouldn't be a big deal
[18:53:33] <csherratt> kvark: Just with the current cgmath I need to assemble the translation matrix myself before multiplying it with the rotation matrix. That feels really dirty.
[18:54:41] <kvark> that's not dirty. You have translation followed by rotation, so you construct them as transformations and concatenate.
[18:55:28] <kvark> I don't recall facing the same use-case before, so it must not be a common one, in which case just having a function yourself seems like the proper thing to do (cgmath should include only common use patterns)
[18:55:52] <kvark> think of it this way: GLU didn't have your custom function either
[18:56:19] <csherratt> Assembling the translation matrix in my code feels dirty. Not using the matrices.
[18:57:52] <kvark> "Decomposed{ scale:1.0, rot: Quat::identity(), disp: translation }" does not look dirty to me, your code just needs a little cleanup
[19:01:29] <kvark> ok, it looks like to_quat doesn't work correctly :( That's what we pay for the poor test coverage...
[19:02:57] <csherratt> this https://gist.github.com/csherratt/8637573 specifically the creation of the translation matrix.
[19:03:39] <kvark> this is a bit ugly
[19:03:49] <kvark> why don't you use Decomposed instead?
[19:04:05] <rsaarelm> Any consensus on using rust-opengles or gl-rs for OpenGL bindings?
[19:04:56] <rsaarelm> q3 seems to be using opengles and kiss3d gl-rs.
[19:05:44] <kvark> I don't even know if openglES is supported on windows
[19:06:02] <rsaarelm> I find the "aim for the lowest common modern OpenGL denominator" argument for doing desktop development with ES potentially good. Otoh, yeah, Windows support would be kinda important.
[19:07:18] <kvark> ES is still pretty limited (talking about 2.0), so I guess go for it if it satisfies your needs.
[19:08:43] <kvark> has anyone read "http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~vbz/resources/quatut.pdf" ?

[19:22:00] <csherratt> kvark: I can get what I want done via Decomposed, it just seems like a rather round about way to build the matrix I want. This is not worth arguing over.
[19:24:46] <kvark> csherratt: just keep in mind that Decomposed implements Transform, so you don't need to convert it to mat4 until you need to apply projection

[20:32:44] <JesseH> and doomlord_, I don't personally know you I think, but I played doom.
[20:32:56] <JesseH> and FrozenCow for having just an awesome name
[20:33:14] <doomlord_> heh
[20:33:21] <doomlord_> its not a reference to doom
[20:33:33] <JesseH> Yes, but it has the four letter word in it.
[20:33:40] <doomlord_> its a reference to an obscure 80s comic character
[20:34:11] <JesseH> Oh I see!
[20:34:21] <doomlord_> i should try rust again, been out of it for a few months
[20:34:32] <JesseH> I have been too, but I have lots of free time now.
