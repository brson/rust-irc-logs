[12:37:46] <Quxxy> OMG
[12:37:48] <Quxxy> #[doc(inline)] works
[12:37:50] <Quxxy> !!!!
[12:37:51] <rustbot> !!!!!
[12:38:11] <benh> The one rust toy project I still hack on specifies its dependencies as github urls in a gesture of protest against the flat cargo namespace :P
[12:38:17] <benh> Quxxy: What does it do?
[12:38:26] <benh> I assume it's not equivalent to /// inline
[12:38:50] <Quxxy> It makes rustdoc pretend that a `pub use` has the same definition as the thing it points to
[12:39:05] <Quxxy> So if you have `pub const BLAH: u32 = 0;` and `#[doc(inline)] pub use self::BLAH as FOO;`
[12:39:24] <Quxxy> Then in the documentation, instead of FOO being listed as a re-export, it's just listed as a regular constant which happens to have the same type and value as BLAH
[12:39:45] <Quxxy> The "code snippet" it shows for it even lies about it, saying `pub const FOO: u32 = 0;`
[12:40:10] <benh> right
[12:40:20] <benh> sounds neat
[12:40:40] <benh> imo rustdoc is still unusable until it adds [src] links to methods/impls though
[12:40:56] <Quxxy> It's not unusuable; just less than optimally convenient

[12:42:43] <WindowsBunny> Tobba: You mean like for fs::copy?
[12:42:57] <benh> someone should fix unix copy :P
[12:43:00] <Tobba> WindowsBunny: that's what I was thinking of
[12:44:03] <WindowsBunny> Tobba: how about set_file_times being unable to set only one of the times?
[12:44:17] <WindowsBunny> because posix doesn't expose a way to set only one (although Windows does)
[12:44:22] <Tobba> :/
[12:44:31] <benh> Well, if it's an OS limitation we can't really blame Rust
[12:44:59] <WindowsBunny> benh: winapi is a glorious beacon of nearly everything you could ever want in an awful unsafe verbose C manner
[12:45:19] <Quxxy> :D

[14:28:52] <Tobba> eddyb: I'd go with a slightly less abstract approach, where Point returns a "closed" trait over all possible values of a Point struct, and the trait it returns also implements PointLike

[14:31:28] <Tobba> hah
[14:31:33] <eddyb> I try to call them "entities" or whatever instead of "traits"
[14:32:13] <Tobba> I think higher-kinded traits/entities could also deal with some issues that people want to use deriving for, but I'm not sure
[14:32:23] <Tobba> it'd deal with union types swiftly anyways
[14:33:36] <Tobba> (u32 | f32) is simply a "closed" entity over u32 and f32
[14:35:52] <Tobba> and memory representation isn't a problem in my system
[14:37:42] <Tobba> closed trait/entities are either compiler-builtin (u32, f32, etc) or represented like an enum is

[14:50:38] <Tiffany> well, on 64-bit you have more space than you will ever need

[14:51:19] <Tiffany> 32-bit you're a lot more limited

[21:53:30] <Binero> I am a bit confused by this paper on monotone subdivision 
[21:53:31] <Binero> Could someone help me with this Monotone Subdivision paper? 
[21:54:32] <Binero> On page 20 it describes an algorithm where every split vertex gets a diagonal to the vertex one to its left, and each merge gets a diagonal to the vertex one to the right 
[21:54:38] <Binero> It ignores a few cases though 
[21:54:46] <Binero> (in the image) 
[21:56:45] <Binero> Mostly vertices which have an inner angle < 180°
[21:57:10] <Binero> ah never mind, it does have it being a reflex vertex as a requirement
