[14:41:17] <bstrie> thanks for the heads up, I did a little damage control in the hn thread
[14:41:37] <bstrie> one of my big worries is that when rust actually reaches 1.0 the internet will just be stuffed full of inaccurate documentation

[15:01:39] <bstrie> triple karma strike
[15:02:09] <bstrie> just don't upvote it and hopefully it will go away
[15:02:26] <bstrie> google never has to remember that this article exists
[15:02:50] <bstrie> once 1.0 comes out we're going to have to go on a SEO crusade to wash all misleading information from the web
[15:03:01] <bstrie> this includes updating every single SO question
[15:03:17] <SiegeLord> Maybe change the language name? :P
[15:03:24] <bstrie> that's even worse!
[15:03:26] <Associ8or> bstrie: they did that with F# too
[15:03:53] <bstrie> the "ideal" way to handle it would be to *always*, from the very beginning, refer to your project as "Foo Beta"
[15:03:59] <bstrie> then you can drop the Beta at 1.0
[15:04:15] <bstrie> that way you don't lose all your brand recognition
[15:04:54] <bstrie> we can't drop the name now, because 1) it's actually a friggin awesome name and 2) we already have huge hype and recognition attached to it
[15:04:59] <bstrie> and swag, can't forget the Rust swag
[15:08:56] <bstrie> amusingly I haven't even done more than skim the article because I've been too busy commenting about it

[19:06:20] <_Vi> How long does it usually take to recompile Rust after "git pull"?
[19:06:29] <bstrie> _Vi: are you also recompiling llvm?
[19:06:45] <bstrie> if you haven't compiled since 0.6, that will be likely
[19:06:46] <homa_rano> Jeaye: (having just built 0.7) use extra::num::complex; yields "failed to resolve import"
[19:06:56] <Jeaye> _Vi: Up to a couple of hours. Make sure you multithread if you can.
[19:07:07] <Jeaye> make -j6 # for example
[19:07:09] <bstrie> _Vi: if you have a fast machine it takes like 12 minutes
[19:07:29] <bstrie> Jeaye just needs a heftier computer!
[19:07:29] <_Vi> It (llvm) got updated using submodules (probably all submodules received an update). Also it downloaded a new "stage0"...
[19:07:48] <bstrie> _Vi: yeah, if you don't run make in parallel you're gonna have a bad time building llvm
[19:07:52] <_Vi> Does it (building after update) significantly faster that building from scratch?
[19:07:52] <Jeaye> bstrie: I've a very hefty computer. ;) I just assume most don't.
[19:08:33] <bstrie> _Vi: most of the time building doesn't require llvm to be rebuilt. otherwise no, building previously doesn't help
[19:08:34] <Jeaye> If you don't build llvm
[19:09:00] <_Vi> Is LLVM always being built from scratch?
[19:09:15] <Jeaye> When it builds, it seems to clean build.
[19:09:55] <_Vi> (Wonder will it finish today on my EeePc...)
[19:10:09] <Jeaye> But you should be fine building it once in only a while. Just `git checkout master; git pull origin master; make clean; make -j6`
[19:10:24] <Jeaye> Then make TAGS.vi, etc.
[19:10:42] <_Vi> Currently using -j4 (2 cores + HT).
[19:10:47] <Jeaye> Sure.
[19:10:50] <_Vi> s/-j4/-j5/
[19:13:00] <_Vi> Does Rust already support (or will it support by 1.0) building little stand-alone programs using part of features? Like in C with musl library.
[19:15:12] <bstrie> _Vi: I'm not familiar with musl, but we can sort of do that
[19:15:37] <_Vi> With musl or uClibc you can built little static binaries.
[19:15:41] <bstrie> _Vi: https://github.com/pcwalton/zero.rs might be an example of what you're looking for?
[19:15:54] <bstrie> don't we already build static binaries?
[19:16:26] <Jeaye> bstrie: Our static lib support is experimental, I believe.
[19:16:36] <bstrie> what do you currently compile to then?
[19:16:44] <bstrie> <-- bad at systems programming
[19:17:25] <Jeaye> We compile to dynamic libs, really.
[19:17:27] <Jeaye> -Z static               -- Use or produce static libraries or binaries (experimental)
[19:17:36] <_Vi> Can Rust easily use not usual system libc, but some other (musl/uClibc) C library?
[19:17:41] <Jeaye> Fomr: rustc 0.7 (f850777 2013-07-04 12:07:56 -0700)
[19:18:05] <Jeaye> bstrie: If it ends in .so or .dylib, it's not static. :P
[19:18:05] <_Vi> A static binary with usual system libc is already too big (about 300 kb minimum on my system).
[19:18:07] <bstrie> Jeaye: ok, so what is the difference between a dynamic and a static lib?
[19:18:34] <bstrie> _Vi: https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/7283
[19:18:37] <Jeaye> bstrie: Generally, dynamic libs are loaded at runtime. They're DLLs in the Windows world, and "shared objects" in the Unix world.
[19:18:50] <bstrie> ah, I always that .so meant "static object"
[19:18:58] <Jeaye> Nope.
[19:19:23] <Jeaye> Static libs have a .a extension and are packaged with the ar(1) util.
[19:20:18] <_Vi> bstrie, "issues/7283" -> Shall I add a comments just to logically "vote up" the issue?
[19:20:37] <bstrie> _Vi: sure thing
[19:20:37] <_Vi> (Maybe issues should also have star and star counter on Github?...)
[19:21:04] <bstrie> comments are good ways of signifying that an issue is important
[19:21:33] <Jeaye> bstrie: libc, for example, is a shared lib that the OS loads once into RAM and all processes that want to dynamically link to it can share the same executable code in RAM. This is a great space saver, compared to linking libc into each binary statically, which would result in some pretty large binaries and tons of duplicated functions in RAM.
[19:21:48] *** Joins: reanguia1o (~devnull@ricardoanguiano.com)
[19:22:25] <bstrie> can static libs talk to dynamic libs and vice versa?
[19:22:26] <Jeaye> Also, a shared object can be changed without the program using it being recompiled. So any C program using libc can stay just as it is, but the user can swap in and out libc shared objects.
[19:22:39] <Jeaye> bstrie: Static libs just become the executable at link time.
[19:22:58] <Jeaye> They're just like extra translation units that get brought into the final executable.
[19:23:16] *** Joins: ipoulet (~azbefz@sd-15014.dedibox.fr)
[19:24:21] <Jeaye> So I could create an executable from a couple of object files and a static lib like: $ ld -o my_prog foo.o bar.o spam.a
[19:24:31] <_Vi> That thing (linking or other C lib / "zero.rs") are for special use, not for general usie.
[19:24:46] <Jeaye> But if my_prog wants to use code from a shared lib, it has to ask the OS for it during runtime.
[19:26:14] <Jeaye> Rust's shared objects are kind of a mixture between shared and static, since there are compile-time checks for existence. But they're not normal static libs, so they're not compatible with other static libs and object files like ou'd expect.
[19:26:46] <Jeaye> At least, this is how it seems. I'm just a hobby hacker.

[19:49:41] <_Vi> Seems like new commits come into master faster than Rust builds... Is there a build server that provides ready-made "nightly" Rust?
[19:50:11] <Jeaye> For Arch Linux, there is.
[19:50:21] <Jeaye> I haven't seen any for anything else.
[19:50:24] <bstrie> _Vi: not yet. one of these days we'll get around to it
[19:50:56] <bstrie> _Vi: if you don't have a fast computer, I recommend just building once a week before you go to bed
[19:51:34] <Jeaye> Yeah, I build about once a week on my way home from work. SSH in; start build; get home from work and it's done.

[19:53:47] <_Vi> How to determine which commit is better to use for building? The last commit in a chain of "fix issue #n"-like ones?
[19:54:02] <bstrie> all commits are equal
[19:54:06] <bstrie> by which I mean
[19:54:29] <bstrie> none of them really make rust any less broken to the point that you'd notice :)
[19:54:50] <_Vi> Each commit can fix something or break something (or both). There can be heuristic things that tells "these commits are stabilizing and these ones are adding new features"...
[19:54:54] <Jeaye> If it makes it into master, it's been tested quite a bit anyway.
[19:55:05] <bstrie> _Vi: all commits are tested on a ton of different configurations before they get merged. if it's in master and it doesn't work, then that's a problem
[19:55:16] <_Vi> OK.

[23:00:57] <bstrie> oh dear
[23:01:06] <bstrie> _Vi: are you just building master?
[23:01:32] <_Vi> bstrie, Yes. Probably just ran out of memory (but not OOM Killer).
[23:04:03] <_Vi> Let's see tomorrow if it will build successfully.
[23:04:54] <Jeaye> :(
[23:08:19] <_Vi> When building usual C/C++ project, you can Ctrl+C and then just continue a build... With Rust you [think](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/2369) whether you really need to interrupt the compilation...

[23:11:34] <Jeaye> That's because it doesn't break into separate translation units.
[23:11:44] <Jeaye> Rust compiles (essentially) as one translation unit.
[23:12:08] <Jeaye> You can break your compilation steps into multiple "crates" to help remedy this.
