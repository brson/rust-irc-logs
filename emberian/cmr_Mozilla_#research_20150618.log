[18:58:35] <cmr> (and have other things to do with my time, busy with research...)
[18:59:10] <aturon> cmr: we are actively looking for additional sponsors but don't have extra funds at the moment. however, paying for speaker expenses would likely be the first target. can't promise anything though :-/
[18:59:29] <cmr> Alright, that's what I figured.
[19:00:06] <cmr> It sounds like it's going to be an excellent event!
[19:01:01] <aturon> cmr: that's my sense as well! going to be very hard to winnow down the already-submitted talks to make the program, and i'm still expecting a bunch more proposals
