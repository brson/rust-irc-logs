[21:07:38] <bstrie> haha
[21:07:58] <bstrie> such a serious-looking paper on such a pithy topic
[21:08:13] <bstrie> er, not pithy
[21:08:18] <bstrie> what's the word I'm thinking of...
[21:08:19] <bstrie> trivial
[21:09:45] <Associat0r> I actually wished Rust got rid of the snake_case
[21:12:35] <bstrie> you're free to use it in your own code, they just needed to pick a style for the stdlib and so they did
[21:12:46] <Jeaye> You can't tell me thatSomethingLikeThis is easier to read than_something_like_this.
[21:13:08] <Jeaye> Consistency is key though, really.
[21:13:13] <Jeaye> Unfortunately Rust is not consistent.
[21:13:24] <Jeaye> rustc, anyway.
[21:13:29] <Araq> sure it's easier if you actually parse source code and don't care that much for the single words
[21:13:57] <Araq> my brain can lex much faster withTheseThings
[21:14:04] <x0f_> ich really wished stdlib stuff was more verbose, format! is so much nicer than fmt!
[21:14:28] <Jeaye> I agree.
[21:15:41] <bstrie> now that we have a printf! macro, maybe it would make sense to turn fmt! into format!
[21:15:51] <bstrie> it's not possible to talk about macros without getting excited
[21:16:55] <Associat0r> Araq: agreed
[21:17:06] *** Quits: jvrmaia (~jvrmaia@179.99.212.51) (Quit: Leaving)
[21:19:25] <Associat0r> under_scores are just unnecessary noise to me
[21:19:50] <Associat0r> and waste horizontal space too
[21:20:44] <Jeaye> The whole thing is not even worth discussing.
[21:21:40] <Associat0r> I disagree
[21:21:52] <Jeaye> Too much of it is personal preference.
[21:22:26] <Jeaye> I use underscores (initially because the C++ stdlib and boost do, but ultimately) because I juat like how they look.
[21:22:29] <Jeaye> jsut
[21:22:31] <Associat0r> especially since Rust is leaning toward FP style more than most langs it's worth discussing
[21:22:32] <Jeaye> -_-
[21:23:16] <Jeaye> Yeah, my Rust doesn't follow common convention at all.
[21:23:43] <Jeaye> But that's how I *want* to write it, since it's what I like.
[21:23:43] <Associat0r> I used undercore initially too in C and C++ but changed to camelCase and PascalCase soon somewhat later
[21:23:58] <Jeaye> I went the opposite path.
[21:24:08] <Jeaye> Used camelCase for several years.
[21:24:37] <bstrie> Associat0r: well if this were lisp or scheme we'd be using hyphens instead of underscores :P
[21:24:45] <bstrie> I don't see how being functional has anything to do with it
[21:25:08] <Associat0r> also since I'm using F# a lot, curried functions are a pain to read with underscores, a thing I hated from OCaml and they got right in Haskell
[21:26:22] <Associat0r> bstrie: well since you use longer expressions on 1 line
[21:27:06] <Associat0r> also LISP's use a consistent hyphen style so it only violates one of my issues
[21:27:55] <Jeaye> Rust is inconsistent in that functions are_like_this and types AreLikeThis. Types should Be_Like_This.
[21:28:09] <k00mi> ugh
[21:28:15] <k00mi> that's horrible Jeaye :D
[21:28:20] <Jeaye> hah
[21:28:27] <bstrie> yes, that's literally the worst :P
[21:28:34] <bstrie> actually
[21:28:40] <bstrie> this_Would_Be_The_Worst
[21:28:47] <Jeaye> haha
[21:28:50] <Associat0r> it's both horrible but Be_Like_This is less horrible than the mixed thing we have now
[21:29:43] <bstrie> what really irks me is using thisCase alongside ThisCase... it's just too damn similar
[21:30:09] <bstrie> so I'm fine with rust where it is
[21:30:15] <Associat0r> it's not so similair
[21:30:35] <Associat0r> it works fine in Haskell
[21:30:35] <k00mi> combined with syntax highlighting, it's quite nice
[21:31:01] <k00mi> yeah, you can immediately recognize a constructor just from the case
[21:31:31] <Araq> does Rust enforce the style?
[21:32:31] <Associat0r> the reason Rust uses underscore for functions is because of Unix and C tradition but even Go got rid of undercores so I don't see a reason to cling to that style
[21:34:45] <Araq> C tradition islikethisthough
[21:35:43] <bstrie> Araq: almost, C tradition islkthth

[21:50:11] <Jeaye> no
[21:50:21] <Jeaye> Well, if you're committing to rustc yes.
[21:50:30] <Araq> that doesn't count
[21:50:33] <Jeaye> But otherwise, not that much.
[21:50:51] <Jeaye> There are warnings for statics that are not FULLCAPS
[21:51:04] <Jeaye> But nothing is "enforced"
