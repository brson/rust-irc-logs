[02:46:35] <SimonSapin> cimes: This looks ok to me. The lifetime of CStr is fine here since you’re using Cow::into_owned
[02:48:49] <SimonSapin> cimes: by the way, you can avoid allocating in Err() by changing the return type to Result<_, &'static str>, or (if you want a non-static string *sometimes*) Cow<'static, str>
[02:53:44] <cimes> hey SimonSapin , thanks.  I haven't looked too much into how to be efficient with returning strings and definitely haven't played around with specifying lifetimes
[02:53:59] <cimes> SimonSapin, I did try changing it to this, havent decided which is better though - http://pastebin.com/Zs82Mak9
[02:54:48] <cimes> rust was being a pain with the type, I guess c_char is treated as i8 but in converting to a string it seemed to want u8.
[02:55:07] <SimonSapin> isn’t that transmute a no-op?
[02:55:53] <cimes> i dont know the specifics of what rust is doing, but i think buf was originally [i8, 100]
[02:56:40] <SimonSapin> hum, the type of the first buf gets inferred based on the signature of fsource
[02:57:20] <cimes> yeah that's what i think as well.  I could specify it as i8 or c_char and it works, but it didn't like when i specified u8
[02:58:15] <cimes> kind of silly given both the return value and the buffer being passed in are actually pointing to the same thing.  the return value is really just for convenience in C
[02:58:41] <cimes> in the first example i parsed the return value, but in the second i just used the original buffer
[02:58:46] <SimonSapin> depending on how Sufficiently Advanced the compiler is, this transmute might copy the whole buffer. You could transmute &buf to avoid this
[02:59:17] *** Joins: laleh (Adium@moz-ufln3q.dedicated.allstream.net)
[03:00:31] <SimonSapin> also, I’d type-annotate the transmute: mem::transmute::<&i8, &u8>(&buf). Too much type inference with transmute makes me uncomfortable.

[03:03:19] <cimes> that's a good point, i'm playing around with it now, getting some compile errors
[03:06:59] <cimes> do i need to specify the array length in the type annotation?  It seems to want it, but i still got other errors
[03:14:31] <cimes> SimonSapin, it looks like I needed mem::transmute::<&[i8], &[u8]>(&buf);
[03:17:51] *** Joins: mbx (textual@moz-d9isok.ca.comcast.net)
[03:21:00] <SimonSapin> ah, yes, sorry :)
[03:21:44] <cimes> no problem, good learning exercise
[03:22:02] <cimes> I'm still not sure why the char* passed to the function is a different type in rust than the char* that is returned
[03:24:24] <huon> the char on the platform you're on is signed (i.e. i8), while Rust generally works with unsigned types (i.e. u8)
[03:24:42] <huon> on some platforms, c_char will be u8
[03:26:32] <cimes> thanks huon , but if this is a common use case, I think rust needs to be able to easily build strings from either without required different code
[03:26:57] <cimes> presumably if i was on a system that treated c_char as u8, I wouldn't have noticed this and the code will fail to compile on other systems

[03:29:51] <SimonSapin> uh, I didn’t know it was platform-dependent
[03:30:22] <SimonSapin> cimes: probably ignore my advice on 0_i8 and use &[c_char] instead of &[i8]
[03:33:09] <cimes> SimonSapin, that seems to compile ok, hopefully it's more portable :)
[03:34:48] <cimes> on the topic of String and &str (or &'static str) - is there a standard on which to return as error messages in Err?
[03:35:20] <cimes> I suppose I could make an enumeration of error types, but that seems overkill for my case
[03:36:02] <SimonSapin> There isn’t a well-established convention that I know of
[03:36:19] <huon> using an enum is probably the standard
[03:38:16] <cimes> huon, it's certainly a better way to handle errors!  Realistically though, these functions don't get called often, they are mostly setup and teardown
[03:39:22] <cimes> the underlying C libraries aren't sophisticated enough to return good error codes
[03:41:32] <cimes> thanks for the help SimonSapin and huon

[18:49:47] <larsberg> cimes: #rust is a great place to get help with Rust language or interop questions :-)
[18:50:05] <Manishearth> we need #rust-mordor for FFI
[18:50:20] <cimes> yeah larsberg i know, I prefer this smaller room if people are around :)
[18:50:39] <cimes> haha Manishearth , FFI seems to be all I'm doing in rust
[18:51:18] <cimes> So I guess the first question is - if I create a Vec around this C-allocated memory, will rust take ownership of it and free it when the vec goes out of scope?
[18:51:43] <Manishearth> cimes: yep
[18:51:47] <Manishearth> cimes: also!
[18:51:52] <Manishearth> remember that Rust uses jemalloc
[18:52:03] <Manishearth> not sure if Rust's free() and your malloc() are compatible 
[18:52:09] <Manishearth> (but I don't know how jemalloc works)
[18:52:19] <cimes> Really? That's great.  I assumed it didn't and was trying to clone the vec, which was causing a strange segfault somewhere else
[18:52:35] <Manishearth> ick
[18:52:49] <Manishearth> cimes: are you using from_raw_parts?
[18:52:57] <cimes> yeah i know, but i didnt want the user calling the function ot have to explicitly free the data themselves

[18:53:41] <cimes> still doesn't explain why i was segfaulting elsewhere when returning a cloned vec though
[18:54:52] <cimes> it wasnt even the vec it's segfaulting on, I was passing Some(&str) and it seemed to segfault when turning that into a CStr...
[18:55:40] <Manishearth> uh oh

[18:55:56] <Manishearth> be careful
[18:56:11] <Manishearth> rust strs are utf8 strings with an associated length

[19:16:34] <Manishearth> cimes: what does poet_init do under the hood?
[19:16:36] <cimes> looks like it fails during deallocation of memory if I pass None instead of Some("poet.log")
[19:17:13] <cimes> if I use Some, it fails trying to build that CString
[19:17:40] <Manishearth> well, you passed a nullptr to ffi as a string, it probably didn't like that
[19:18:06] <Manishearth> cimes: of course, the string isn't null terminated
[19:18:14] <Manishearth> cimes: Some("poet.log\0")
[19:18:31] <Manishearth> but that will crash, not segfault
[19:19:25] <cimes> Manishearth, if I add the null terminator it doesn't fail there anymore.  I can do some manipulation in the code to ensure that the string is null terminated

[19:29:42] <cimes> Manishearth, yes that seems to work! Test is failing for another reason, let me just try my complete test app
[19:30:02] <cimes> it's not a test i want to add anyway since it depends on system files atm
[19:32:29] <cimes> Manishearth, I think I'm in business now - thanks so much!
