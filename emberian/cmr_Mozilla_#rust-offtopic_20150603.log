[03:04:48] <Havvy> The last two topic changes have been additions.
[03:05:44] <c74d> (I'm assuming that means that this channel has been brought under the general Rust code-of-conduct?)
[03:06:00] <XMPPwocky> Please Rust responsibly.
[03:06:09] <Havvy> c74d:  It's the addition of at least four ops to the channel.
[03:06:19] <Havvy> I've assumed this channel has always been under the Rust code of conduct.
[03:06:27] <c74d> oh
[03:07:19] <c74d> my client hid most of the opping because the new ops hadn't spoken recently enough :p
[03:08:51] <c74d> …recanting my own assumption, I see no evidence for this channel being under the Rust code-of-conduct.
[03:16:04] <niconii> er, i'm pretty sure the code of conduct extends across all of the official rust community stuff
[03:16:35] *** Joins: swgillespie (swgillespie@moz-rn1.vmq.232.104.IP)
[03:17:07] <Havvy> And it extends across the majority of the unofficial Rust community stuff too, if not in letter, than by spirit.
[03:18:59] <eddyb> is Idris the only purely functional language with a focus on vectors and linear types?
[03:19:31] <eddyb> I'm guessing a lot of FP patterns are hard or impossible without a GC
[03:21:38] <c74d> niconii: Ah, this channel is official?
[03:23:07] <eddyb> hmm, so I read this a couple days ago http://www.cracked.com/article_19194_6-intimate-details-you-can-tell-just-by-looking-at-someone.html
[03:24:03] <eddyb> and now I'm wondering whether you can reliably check some of those predicates from video footage available on the internet
[03:24:31] <c74d> I had assumed it wasn't on the basis of it having been seemingly owned and run solely by cmr since the network upgrade, and AFAIR by no-one before that.
[03:25:57] <niconii> i'd say it's de-facto official if nothing else
[03:26:24] <niconii> especially now that the moderation team are ops here, and considering this is on mozilla's server
[03:26:35] <c74d> that sounds a bit oxymoronic :p
[03:28:03] <c74d> s/oxymoronic/contradictory-in-terms/ >_>
[03:28:21] <niconii> in any case, i would be very surprised if the code of conduct wasn't enforced here
[03:30:27] <c74d> it… never seems to have been.
[03:33:40] <niconii> maybe it's been enforced a bit more loosely than #rust, but i can't really think of any time it's just been disregarded
[03:34:37] <niconii> you might want to take another look at what the code of conduct says?
[03:37:55] <c74d> It specifically bans (well, threatens “exlcu[sion] from interaction” for) insults, which I'm sure I've seen go unpunished.
[03:38:28] <c74d> “Please be kind and courteous” isn't enforced, though it's not so rigidly worded.
[03:38:57] <niconii> serious insults?
[03:39:59] <c74d> (I'm not complaining about past stuff; as far as I know/knew, I had no formal basis for complaint.)
[03:40:21] <niconii> anyway, part of it might also just be the fact that cmr isn't omnipresent
[03:40:59] <niconii> hopefully it'll be better-enforced now that we have more ops
[03:41:39] <Havvy> I don't recall anything in here being against the code of conduct.
[03:46:16] <c74d> (to be clear, by “I'm not complaining about past stuff”, I don't mean “I'm complaining about present stuff”, but rather “past stuff is past, and I'm not complaining about it”.)

[05:35:31] <c74d> Isn't it “PILE OF POO”?

[07:13:21] <XMPPwocky> on saturdays, dereferencing null pointers, even as an rvalue, causes a read of 0x00000000, so you can't use offsetof (which is UB)

[14:24:08] <Layl> honestly I'm alright with that if it runs okay
[14:24:12] <Quxxy> On the bright side, that means it *might not* get a last-minute downgrade :3

[14:28:32] <Quxxy> Vault 111 was the one from F3, wasn't it?
[14:28:37] <Quxxy> Or was that 101?
[14:29:04] <Mutabah> 101
[14:29:08] <Mutabah> 111 is new I think?
[14:29:21] <Sho> F3 was by far the weakest game in the series
[14:29:39] <Quxxy> 111 is new, according to the Fallout wiki
[14:29:46] <Quxxy> 108 and 112 are the closest
[14:29:57] <Mutabah> Sho: Fo3 was an experiment, had issues, but not a bad game really
[14:31:03] <Sho> It wasn't *bad*, but Bethesda just doesn't have any writing chops - F3 had almost no memorable characters or anything in the way of interesting factional dynamics in the game world
[14:31:23] <Sho> New Vegas was much more thoughtful again
[14:31:37] <fmtq> yes
[14:31:51] <fmtq> then they got the shits with Obsidian because they are incompetent.
[14:31:52] <fmtq> the end 
[14:32:22] <Sho> ?
[14:32:22] <Quxxy> Not to worry, they can just get iD to write the story!
[14:32:27] <Quxxy> They did so well with Rage, after all
[14:32:31] <Quxxy> And Doom 3
[14:32:51] <Quxxy> And let's not forget the *seminal* Rescue Roger
[14:34:39] <Rym> Rescue Rover was amazing!
[14:36:12] <Quxxy> *Rover*, that's it
[14:36:39] <Quxxy> I was bummed when the iD Super Pack didn't have it
[14:38:10] <fmtq> Sho: New Vegas was made by Obsidian Studios
[14:38:20] <Sho> fmtq: Yeah
[14:38:20] <fmtq> and they lost the rights to make further games because it didn't get 90 on metacritic or some shit 
[14:38:26] <Sho> Ah
[14:38:40] <Rym> Quxxy: holy shit you can play it in the browser right here: http://www.myabandonware.com/game/rescue-rover-2bj/play

[14:38:53] <fmtq> no.
[14:38:57] <WindowsBunny> I'm so excited about Fallout 4 being in Boston :D
[14:39:00] <fmtq> this was after that.

[19:44:29] <pcwalton> yes, it seems like it is
[19:44:35] <c74d> o_ò
[19:46:27] <vikaton> pcwalton, since you have more knowledge in that area, are segaults considered undefined behaviour ? 
[19:46:58] <pcwalton> if they're defined to happen in consistent situations, no
[19:47:51] <vikaton> I always thought undefined behavior is unexpected code executing
[19:48:02] *** Quits: sigma (sigma@moz-im7cik.range86-135.btcentralplus.com) (Connection closed)
[19:48:15] <cmr> No, undefined behavior has a very narrow scope.
[19:49:12] <cmr> there are plenty of resources online.
[19:49:54] <cmr> A segfault itself can be a result of undefined behavior but segfaults themselves are relatively well defined per-OS.
[19:51:08] <vikaton> segfaulting from dereferencing a null pointer is undef behavior?
[19:51:22] <cmr> No, dereferencing a null pointer is UB.
[19:51:42] <cmr> Just because it usually results in a segfault does not make the segfault UB.
[19:51:53] <cmr> (in C)
[19:52:11] <niconii> vikaton: undefined behaviors are situations where the language can't guarantee what will happen
[19:52:49] <Astrum|Lap> so is Nim tacking on safety (which people will later lament) or are they being very thoughtful about it?
[19:52:53] <Astrum|Lap> I don't follow Nim at all

[19:53:30] <vikaton> if dereferencing a null pointer returns a NullPointerException (Java), is the deref still UB ?
[19:53:48] <cmr> vikaton: In Java, dereferencing a null pointer is not undefined behavior.
[19:53:53] <zofrex> Java doesn't have UB
[19:54:14] <vikaton> Astrum|Lap: Yes Nim has been adding more safety features lately
[19:54:27] <vikaton> cmr, because of what factor?
[19:54:45] <niconii> vikaton: because it's defined to return a NullPointerException
[19:54:46] <cmr> vikaton: that's just how java is defined.

[20:00:36] <Astrum|Lap> I'm actually using chromebooks for a project
[20:01:07] <Astrum|Lap> but seriously, the atom editor is... huge
[20:01:10] <cmr> Chromebooks are decent cheap computers.
[20:01:19] <Astrum|Lap> someone thought that was a great idea
[20:01:31] <Astrum|Lap> they're also good for locked down applications, cmr 
[20:01:50] <cmr> I haven't used them in that context but I believe it.
[20:02:02] <Astrum|Lap> well they have an honest to god kiosk mode
[20:02:11] <cmr> (my old highschool deployed a few hundred chromebooks while I worked for them)
[20:02:31] <Tiffany> what does kiosk mode do?
[20:02:43] <Astrum|Lap> locks the device into a particular application
[20:02:47] <Tiffany> oh
[20:02:54] <Tiffany> so it's like those fullscreen VB applications that everyone uses
[20:02:57] <Tiffany> but less shitty
[20:03:01] <Astrum|Lap> you pretty much have to wipe the device to use it any other way
[20:03:14] <Astrum|Lap> plus chromebooks come with a TPM module and all that stuff
[20:03:28] <Tiffany> most intel systems do these days
[20:03:41] <cmr> Astrum|Lap: are you using them as mobile kiosks or are you using a chromebox?
[20:03:51] <cmr> Or, like, embedding the panel in something
[20:03:52] <c74d> a Trusted Platform Module module?
[20:04:29] <Astrum|Lap> for this project they go into an enclosure which is available to the public
[20:04:39] <Astrum|Lap> c74d: yes, aka a TPMM module
[20:04:48] <cmr> mm
[20:05:28] <Astrum|Lap> like I said, I think kiosks are stupid since so many people have smart phones now
[20:05:33] <Astrum|Lap> but... that wasn't my call
[20:05:45] <Astrum|Lap> and chromebooks work out pretty well for that purpose
[20:05:59] <Astrum|Lap> oh, and you can also remotely manage them
[20:07:22] <Astrum|Lap> also they're cheap
[20:08:38] <VShell> Astrum|Lap: so many people have smart phones, but I seem to exist in a little bubble of the world which wilfully avoids them. (personally, atm, I don't have a phone at all... need to remedy that soon.)
[20:09:23] <Astrum|Lap> actually... I should say that in a lot of cases I think kiosks are stupid, they do work in some instances for the time being
[20:09:30] <Astrum|Lap> like the self-checkout lanes at grocery stores
[20:09:42] <cmr> I was going to bring up the example of food ordering kiosks or in bookstores.
[20:09:51] <Astrum|Lap> until I can just load up my cart, walk out the door, and have my bank automatically charged that's a decent way to go
[20:10:12] <cmr> I dunno, I don't think phones are a great replacement for kiosks in a lot of cases.
[20:10:21] <cmr> Unless you're also providing free wifi.
[20:10:26] <cmr> And even then
[20:10:43] <Astrum|Lap> well I'm under NDA so I can't say much more, but in this case... I don't think a kiosk was necessarily the right way to go
[20:10:51] <cmr> surel

[20:38:40] <eddyb> then you will *have* to care :D
[20:39:41] <eddyb> http://themindunleashed.org/2015/06/new-mind-blowing-experiment-confirms-that-reality-doesnt-exist-if-you-are-not-looking-at-it.html
[20:39:49] <Astrum|Lap> well then I'd become a hermit who lives on top of Mt Everest, all those who are brave and strong enough to reach me will receive lessons in how awesome programming could have been before the Great JavaScript Singularity
[20:40:19] <eddyb> I have friends subscribed to "The Mind Unleashed" and other such sources
[20:40:32] <c74d> I'm fairly certain that in sixty years there will be plenty of people who don't care about JavaScript being pervasive.
[20:40:52] <eddyb> like nobody cares about the COBOL codebases
[20:40:54] <Astrum|Lap> well in reality it'll probably be like COBOL
[20:40:56] <Astrum|Lap> lol
[20:40:58] <eddyb> is that what you're saying c74d?
[20:41:04] <eddyb> DO YOU WANT ANOTHER COBOL?
[20:41:05] <Astrum|Lap> great minds think alike, eddyb 
[20:41:10] <eddyb> because that's how you get COBOL
[20:41:25] <eddyb> sheesh, you'd think we'd learn our lesson
[20:41:46] <Astrum|Lap> javascript programmers will be able to earn tons of money, but nobody will want to touch it
[20:41:50] <c74d> I'd think that most people alive now don't know what COBOL even is.
[20:41:51] <Astrum|Lap> just like COBOL
[20:42:02] <Astrum|Lap> c74d: most people alive now don't know what C is
[20:42:31] <c74d> yes…?
[20:42:50] <Astrum|Lap> or are you saying most programmers alive don't know what COBOL is
[20:42:58] <eddyb> most people who can write trivial C programs don't know what COBOL is
[20:43:20] <c74d> No, I was referring to people in general, though that might be true too.
[20:44:10] <Astrum|Lap> also eddyb, if I really were immortal I'd probably just amass as much knowledge as possible
[20:44:19] <VShell> COBOL is a monster and involves things like fixed-width data records. that is all I know of it.
[20:44:20] <Astrum|Lap> I'm great at knowing things, terrible at being useful though
[20:44:21] <Astrum|Lap> hehe
[20:44:39] <c74d> What I meant was to question the implication that living in a future where JavaScript has become the new COBOL/the new C would necessarily make one *care* about JavaScript's ascendancy.
[20:44:54] <eddyb> VShell: PIC
[20:44:57] <Astrum|Lap> VShell: I know COBOL has a LOT of keywords... but I don't know many details
[20:45:08] <c74d> When, presumably, most wouldn't even understand it.
[20:45:36] <cmr> Some variants of COBOL aren't turing complete.
[20:45:44] <Astrum|Lap> it'd be great to live forever, the future always looks brighter
[20:46:09] <Astrum|Lap> well... I guess the maximum brightness happens when the sun goes red giant and gobbles up/ejects the earth
[20:46:15] <c74d> eh, who needs Turing-completeness
[20:46:17] <Astrum|Lap> after that it's a bit bleak
[20:46:26] <Astrum|Lap> templates, c74d 
[20:46:31] <eddyb> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9PxOanFjxQ "just not for long" always seems deeper to me than it probably is
[20:46:35] <Astrum|Lap> templates need to be turing complete
[20:46:49] <cmr> whoa fall out boy is still relevant?
[20:47:05] <eddyb> cmr: fallout4 is very relevant
[20:47:07] <eddyb> :P
[20:47:52] <Astrum|Lap> time to quit my job, move back in with my parents, and stock up on mountain dew
[20:48:00] <Astrum|Lap> gotta play FO4
[20:48:01] <Astrum|Lap> hehe
[20:48:07] <c74d> ew, why Mountain Dew?
[20:48:13] <Astrum|Lap> red bull?
[20:48:23] <Astrum|Lap> I dunno, insert a caffeinated drink of your choice
[20:48:28] <Astrum|Lap> I love how that's the part you take issue with btw
[20:48:42] <eddyb> Astrum|Lap: you need style
[20:48:42] <c74d> :>
[20:49:01] <c74d> my drink of choice is water though
[20:49:38] <c74d> (preferably not contaminated with anything harmful)
[20:49:40] <Astrum|Lap> well most days I start off with tea (unsweetened, drop of milk) and move on to water
[20:49:57] <cmr> Astrum|Lap: I hope it's not as buggy as FNV or some other Bethesda games.
[20:50:15] <cmr> i'm looking forward to it.
[20:50:20] <Astrum|Lap> oh man, speaking of, I'm glad I don't live in Las Vegas anymore
[20:50:24] <Astrum|Lap> tap water there is undrinkable
[20:50:32] <Astrum|Lap> Colorado tap water is awesome though
[20:50:46] <c74d> FNV… the hash function?
[20:50:52] * eddyb popcorn
[20:51:01] <cmr> c74d: Fallout: New Vegas
[20:51:04] <c74d> ah
[20:51:07] <Astrum|Lap> cmr: well unless they totally revamped the Gamebryo engine (I think that's what they used) or got a different engine, it absolutely will be buggy
[20:51:58] <cmr> One can hope :(
[20:52:11] <cmr> I had a really hard time playing FNV because I'd get too pissed off when it broke.
[20:53:01] <Astrum|Lap> oh wait... I guess Skyrim used the Creation Engine
[20:53:25] <bstrie> why did bethesda buy id if they weren't going to use idtech
[20:53:42] <Astrum|Lap> maybe they are for FO4
[20:53:46] <Astrum|Lap> we'll have to wait and see
[20:54:10] <Astrum|Lap> cmr: I didn't play either FO3 or FONV upon release
[20:54:23] <Astrum|Lap> computer couldn't handle FO3 when it came out, and FONV was just too buggy to play
[20:54:44] <bstrie> https://i.imgur.com/vEYUozV.png
[20:54:46] <Astrum|Lap> played through both about a year after they came out... a couple thousand hours I dumped into them
[20:55:22] <Astrum|Lap> lol bstrie 
[20:55:26] <fmtq> bstrie: because bethesda has never made a good business decision
[20:55:31] <fmtq> what is the second game in that screenshot
[20:55:36] <bstrie> fallout 4
[20:55:40] <Astrum|Lap> I'm in the 'I don't care that much' camp
[20:55:42] <fmtq> wait what
[20:55:44] <fmtq> really?
[20:55:45] <Astrum|Lap> I still like old games
[20:55:54] <fmtq> really?
[20:56:19] <Astrum|Lap> I'll gladly play games from the late 90s whose graphics are... bad
[20:56:20] <Astrum|Lap> heh
[20:56:34] <Astrum|Lap> (deus ex and system shock 2 come to mind)
[20:56:44] <bstrie> I'd play morrowind if I could be bothered to find mods to make the combat bearable
[20:56:53] <dfockler> ^ great game
[20:57:22] <dfockler> they actually had class and race issues in the story in morrowind
[20:57:44] <Astrum|Lap> wait... was morrowind the 3rd one? with horse armor?
[20:57:51] <bstrie> that was oblivion
[20:58:02] <bstrie> well, morrowind was the third one. oblivion had horse armor
[20:58:13] <c74d> The graphics in the top screen-capture look pretty high-quality to me, though I suppose I haven't the background to qualifiedly judge that.
[20:58:19] <Astrum|Lap> ah, okay
[20:58:27] <Astrum|Lap> I never really played either morrowind or oblivion
[20:58:35] <Astrum|Lap> I... glitched my way to max level in skyrim though
[20:58:40] <Astrum|Lap> also looted everything not nailed down
[20:58:49] <bstrie> c74d: the graphics in the above one are of the witcher 3, which got lambasted because the graphics were only really great
[20:59:01] <fmtq> I don't mind
[20:59:04] <fmtq> the problem is
[20:59:06] <bstrie> (the graphics in the trailer were slightly only greater)
[20:59:09] <fmtq> they will charge like 80 USD
[20:59:11] <fmtq> for a dated engine.
[20:59:32] <eddyb> bstrie: those graphics look fine
[20:59:34] <c74d> “only really great”?

[21:01:51] <c74d> eddyb: ??? about bstrie making that image?
[21:02:00] <WindowsBunny> eddyb: The real problem was the lack of ambient occlusion
[21:02:15] <WindowsBunny> That was the most noticeable difference between witcher 3 trailer and game
[21:02:17] <eddyb> WindowsBunny: that's interesting
[21:02:25] <eddyb> causing perf issues?
[21:02:34] <eddyb> or was it never in the game?
[21:02:55] <c74d> (I was referring to the “people” in “people think that I made this image”)

[21:09:35] <Astrum|Lap> I thought AMD was giong to do that
[21:12:21] *** Joins: Dabo (dabo@znc.dabo.guru)
[21:13:37] <WindowsBunny> Astrum|Lap: Ha, FPGA's are an entirely different process
[21:13:41] <c74d> bstrie: I think there isn't the technology yet to decontaminate cadavers of potentially infectious prions without also destroying most or all of the nutrients, though?
[21:14:06] <Astrum|Lap> WindowsBunny: yeah, I read up on that a while ago actually
[21:14:19] <Astrum|Lap> still, it'd be awesome to have an FPGA you can configure for your application
[21:17:18] <bstrie> c74d: that just results in even more material with which to make soylent green. that's called a virtuous cycle
[21:22:10] <dfockler> I don't understand how the FPGA circuitry allows it to be rewritten
[21:22:41] <dfockler> or why there are certain ones that will blank out after being exposed to UV light
[21:22:55] <eddyb> the UV light is typical for EEPROMs
[21:23:29] <dfockler> is it chemically stored?
[21:23:34] <eddyb> as for rewriting... well, it's a big ROM
[21:23:49] <eddyb> used as lookup tables
[21:24:22] <eddyb> dfockler: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPROM
[21:24:42] <eddyb> "Photons of the UV light cause ionization within the silicon oxide, which allow the stored charge on the floating gate to dissipate."
[21:26:36] <Astrum|Lap> dfockler: well if UV light does blank an FPGA I've never come across one that does that
[21:26:46] <Astrum|Lap> I have seen plenty of EEPROMs with a little UV window thingy tho
[21:26:51] <dfockler> no, it's only for EPROMs
[21:27:02] <Astrum|Lap> as far as FPGA circuits being rewritten
[21:27:20] <Astrum|Lap> the basics of them are just lots of connected LUTs
[21:27:28] <dfockler> I realize now that they are just programmable memory chips, whereas FPGA's are completely different
[21:27:56] <Astrum|Lap> programmable LUTs
[21:28:23] <Astrum|Lap> though the actual implementation of how this works is beyond me and there aren't exactly a lot of open source tools for FPGAs... in fact there's nearly none
[21:29:31] <dfockler> I don't think the chips makers have a real incentive to do that
[21:30:01] <Astrum|Lap> well there's basically only two, xilinx and altera
[21:30:17] *** Quits: Gyro (gyro@moz-38c.96l.252.66.IP) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[21:30:29] <Astrum|Lap> and they're definitely stuck in the 90s mindset of open source = competitors will steal all our secrets and win
[21:31:22] <Astrum|Lap> which is a shame, because their tools are atrocious on so many levels
[21:33:14] <dfockler> FPGAs use little memory units that store the logic block type and the routing
[21:33:37] <dfockler> and it is a shame because they could be as user friendly and more useful than something like Arduino
[21:33:58] <Astrum|Lap> absolutely
[21:34:04] <Astrum|Lap> I have a mojo v3
[21:34:06] <fmtq> AVR lel
[21:34:19] <Astrum|Lap> they've done quite a bit of work making a decent IDE and even a new HDL
[21:34:32] <Astrum|Lap> but it still requires xilinx ISE
[21:34:46] <Astrum|Lap> which is massive, terrible, crash prone, etc...
[21:35:02] <fmtq> https://chisel.eecs.berkeley.edu/
[21:35:12] <fmtq> look, Astrum|Lap
[21:35:23] <Astrum|Lap> fmtq: what about it? there's also a python one
[21:35:35] <Astrum|Lap> they all get transpiled to VHDL/Verilog
[21:35:41] <fmtq> TYPESAFE
[21:35:43] <Astrum|Lap> where the traditional toolchain from xilinx or altera has to be used
[21:36:24] <dfockler> I think the overhead to learn enough to write a toolchain is so high, that most people can't even start to do it
[21:36:28] <Astrum|Lap> well it may be type safe, but it's using Scala, so expect it to blow up and report back a billion line error message as it tries to unify the universe or whatever =P
[21:36:38] <fmtq> wot
[21:36:47] <dfockler> let alone finding a chip maker that won't sue the beans out of you

[21:39:43] <Astrum|Lap> not sure what happened with that... or scala... nobody ever talks about scala anymore

[21:40:38] <dfockler> How do you pronounce Xilinx?
[21:40:40] <c74d> They tried to have me agree to an NDA, but then I was allowed in without agreeing to it because I tried to actually read it first and the receptionist didn't want to wait…
[21:41:01] <Astrum|Lap> lol

[21:41:43] <c74d> dfockler: /zaɪlɪŋks/
[21:41:50] <Astrum|Lap> anyway, I really do wish they'd open up their tool chains or specs or something
[21:42:01] <dfockler> c74d: that makes it clear thanks
[21:42:15] <Astrum|Lap> heck, you can't even program a Spartan 6 on xilinx's new toolchain
[21:42:15] <dfockler> it's like reading a regex for the first time

[22:33:01] <dfockler> wasn't bruce jenner's job kind of being in the public eye?
[22:33:36] <niconii> dfockler: her name's caitlyn, not bruce, but she's fairly famous, yeah
[22:33:55] <Astrum|Lap> wait... news reporter?
[22:34:34] <Sho> i thought she was an athlete
[22:34:43] <niconii> she's famous for a few things, she used to be an olympic athlete, some various tv stuff afterward
[22:34:54] <niconii> married to a kardashian for a while...
[22:35:15] <Sho> well, *now* I'm judging her
[22:35:16] <Sho> :-)
[22:35:29] <Astrum|Lap> I don't follow any of this stuff tbh

[22:36:03] <Sho> that's what i meant
[22:36:33] <Astrum|Lap> not sure why people care about this sort of thing
[22:36:48] <eddyb> Astrum|Lap: taboo?
[22:36:52] <dfockler> niconii: do trans people consider their previous identity to have not existed?
[22:36:55] <eddyb> novelty?
[22:37:04] <Astrum|Lap> eddyb: I suppose...
[22:37:17] <Sho> Astrum|Lap: on the list of things to care about it strikes me as fairly legitimate, there's a lot of trans-related policy issues for society still to mull and decide on
[22:37:32] <dfockler> niconii: I'm sure it's really dependent on the person
[22:37:33] <Astrum|Lap> Sho: that's... not quite what I mean

[22:38:43] <Astrum|Lap> I'm all for trans-rights, but that pre-supposes people are against them
[22:38:47] <Astrum|Lap> that's what I don't understand
[22:39:09] <Astrum|Lap> I don't understand why we're in a position where it becomes an issue because I can't place myself in their shoes
[22:39:12] <Sho> it's not that simple as "against them", though
[22:39:17] <eddyb> if gender swapping worked like it did in rapture of the nerds, I would totally try it

[22:40:01] <Sho> going to the women's restroom because you self-identify as a woman turns out to be complicated
[22:40:03] <eddyb> Sho: this puts gender separation in a similar light to color separation
[22:40:17] <dfockler> I think it bothers more people that there isn't really a discrete line between genders

[22:40:46] <Astrum|Lap> Sho: alright, I get that

[22:41:50] <Astrum|Lap> perhaps I'm weird
[22:41:52] <niconii> dfockler: it's more along the lines of "you were always this person, but had to live under this mask"
[22:41:54] <Astrum|Lap> I just don't get other people
[22:41:54] <WindowsBunny> I see no use for a distinction between genders when your current gender can be decided purely by what you identify as
[22:41:55] * Astrum|Lap shrugs
[22:41:57] <dfockler> niconii: yeah, I can only guess, but it's like getting your body to match your internal self identity

[22:46:34] <Astrum|Lap> why would it, eddyb? there's no point =P

[22:46:58] <eddyb> you think it's funny, but I've seen it corrupt young minds

[22:47:30] <Sho> Havvy, yay
[22:47:30] <Havvy> WindowsBunny:  I imagine you as a bunny on the WinXP desktop background image.
[22:47:37] <dfockler> I used to pretend I was a nihilist in high school, then I became a liberal
[22:47:44] <Astrum|Lap> you shouldn't peer into my brain then... I am extremely nihilistic
[22:47:48] <WindowsBunny> Havvy: Hopping through that lush hill of grass?
[22:47:53] <Havvy> Yesh.
[22:47:57] <eddyb> Astrum|Lap: like the vegetable generation isn't bad enough

[22:48:17] <WindowsBunny> eddyb: I wanna eat the vegetable generation

[22:48:39] <Astrum|Lap> being a nihilist doesn't mean you're automatically lazy
[22:48:47] <eddyb> no, but combine the two
[22:49:00] <Astrum|Lap> but it's fun to explore the concepts of life
[22:49:51] <Astrum|Lap> it's fun to explore just how long your life will be remembered, just how finite your existence (including your memory) is
[22:50:03] <Astrum|Lap> err... including the memory of you
[22:50:08] <Sho> Havvy: usually these two crop up close together in my playlist, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G13Tj1H2cx4&t=1m

[22:51:14] <Astrum|Lap> eddyb: perhaps
[22:52:01] <Astrum|Lap> still, how many millions of humans have lived and died that we have no record of, much less know who they were on a personal level
[22:52:31] <eddyb> very few, compared to what's coming
[22:52:48] <c74d> Are NixOS's live-CD images not EFI-bootable?
[22:52:49] <fmtq> I refuse to join a singularity 
[22:52:54] <eddyb> c74d: they should be

[22:53:10] <Astrum|Lap> anyway, I have fun with these questions
[22:53:30] <Astrum|Lap> but I've been told I'm a bit off =P
[22:54:08] <fmtq> I'm an existential nihilist
[22:54:22] <Sho> speaking of 'having records of', i kind of find the idea of replacing burial rites with just keeping sequenced genomes on file appealing
[22:54:25] <fmtq> I still spend an inordinate amount of time helping people
[22:54:43] <eddyb> Sho: that's not enough
[22:54:49] <eddyb> it's... better, I guess
[22:54:54] <Tiffany> existential nihilism is depressing
[22:54:59] <fmtq> not for me
[22:55:00] <Tiffany> I prefer existential absurdism
[22:55:08] <fmtq> I find it absurd, Tiffany
[22:55:40] <Astrum|Lap> Tiffany: pretty sure life is depressing, but we have a pre-programmed desire to live until we've procreated
[22:55:48] <Astrum|Lap> then we enter nature's blind spot
[22:55:48] <eddyb> ha ha ha
[22:56:05] <Tiffany> I don't feel any desire to procreate
[22:56:06] <eddyb> Astrum|Lap: that's so vanilla
[22:56:31] <eddyb> I feel desire to *create*
[22:56:32] <fmtq> I've always been interested in stoicism
[22:56:43] <Sho> I rather look forward to having kids
[22:57:18] <eddyb> well, that's your choice
[22:57:19] <Astrum|Lap> Tiffany: mmm... procreation is a tricky subject
[22:57:34] <Astrum|Lap> for instance, I don't think I'd be a good father, so I don't think I should procreate
[22:57:39] <Astrum|Lap> however, I still have that desire
[22:58:09] <Astrum|Lap> in sort of a non-descript I'm-missing-something kind of way
[22:58:11] <Astrum|Lap> if that makes sense...
[22:58:42] <eddyb> https://keybase.io/triplesec/
[22:58:55] <Astrum|Lap> in either case, pretty sure we all have a desire to live, otherwise we wouldn't
[22:58:55] <eddyb> Astrum|Lap: how about "stimuli"?
[22:59:05] <Astrum|Lap> again, in a non-descript kind of way
[22:59:12] <niconii> i prefer the "kidnap the child of your worst enemy and raise them to resent their true parent as the ultimate revenge" route imo
[22:59:44] <c74d> Trying to boot the NixOS image in a EFI laptop, I get told that booting of it is forbidden by the “security policy”; I'd assume that's about the kernel etc. being unsigned, except that this firmware seemingly prefers prompting me as to whether I'm okay with running unsigned executables.
[22:59:58] * Sho still always disables EFI
[22:59:59] <eddyb> Tobba: ^^
[23:00:10] <c74d> I'll take it to #nixos though; I don't want to interrupt the discussion of life and stuff.
[23:00:18] <Astrum|Lap> sorry, c74d 
[23:00:20] <Sho> niconii: but you have to find an arch nemesis first
[23:00:36] <Sho> niconii: that seems harder than finding a spouse, although maybe you could convert them
[23:00:43] <Astrum|Lap> I should probably relegate myself to #rust-philosophy or #rust-discussion or something heh
[23:00:55] <Sho> #rust-weltschmerz
[23:00:57] <Tobba> c74d: sounds like a secure boot problem
[23:01:04] <Tobba> c74d: try using shim?
[23:01:50] <eddyb> Astrum|Lap: my desire to live is correlated to the amount and intensity of stimuli I experience
[23:02:40] <eddyb> it's getting kind of hot around here and that's making it harder to keep cool and focus
[23:02:55] <eddyb> so, good night. another day I did nothing of note

[23:30:18] <c74d> On the network in question, I formerly went by 8680, and was regarded as very formal and “robotic”, then, while using a new IRC client, began using the nick c74d, under which I adopted a significantly more casual and less “robotic” persona, such that people who knew me as 8680 joke about being disturbed by it.
[23:30:24] <Tiffany> sho: I can assure you that english is not isomorphic between spoken and written forms
[23:30:29] <Sho> dfockler: Yes and no. It's read linearly and when various letters meet their normal sounds sometimes change due to effects like nasalization
[23:30:36] <dfockler> oh ok
[23:30:42] <Sho> dfockler: It's far more predictably rule-governed than English, though
[23:30:52] <c74d> WindowsBunny: I think dfockler was asking about Hangul.
[23:31:06] <WindowsBunny> c74d: Yes, I know, I just like making comments on things taken out of context
[23:31:12] <c74d> 'k.
[23:31:15] <c74d> dfockler: oh, <https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Semantic_relations#Coordinate_term>.
[23:31:16] <Sho> dfockler: The orthography isn't entirely phonemic though, it's morphophonemic which is actually pretty cool
[23:31:56] <eddyb> playbot: 0xc74d
[23:31:57] -playbot- 51021
[23:32:01] <eddyb> hmm
[23:32:13] <eddyb> 5.10.21
[23:32:29] <eddyb> 5 October 2021?
[23:32:45] <Sho> dfockler: Ok, so in the alphabet, letters are grouped into syllabic blocks - each block has at least a consonant and a vowel
[23:32:57] <Sho> dfockler: e.g. 한 (han) is actually ㅎ (h) + ㅏ (a) + (ㄴ)
[23:33:38] <Sho> dfockler: the English word 'cats' consists of two morphemes, the stem 'cat' and the plural suffix 's'
[23:33:50] <Sho> dfockler: in written Korean, the boundaries between syllabic blocks tend to match up with the boundaries between morphemes
[23:34:06] <niconii> eddyb: damn europeans, it's May 10 2021 like jesus intended when he founded the united states of america 2015 years ago
[23:34:17] <Sho> dfockler: and when the rules allow distributing letters over blocks in multiple ways, the orthography always prefers the variant that keeps the same morpheme spelled the same way across uses in different words
[23:34:25] <dfockler> so each block generally represents a syllable
[23:34:50] <Sho> dfockler: which promotes morpheme reuse, and so things become very lego block-like
[23:34:57] * c74d smacks niconii with a large copy of ISO 8601.
[23:35:06] <dfockler> Sho: which is totally cool!
[23:35:32] <c74d> eddyb: “2015-01-13 04:20:11 <c74d> ChrisMorgan: "c74d" is a substring of the radix-16 representation of the 512-bit SHA-3 hash of my name.”
[23:35:47] <eddyb> wow
[23:36:05] <eddyb> that's smart
[23:36:10] <Sho> dfockler: yeah, it's a very cool combo of being able to write down things phonetically and retaining higher-level morphological information
[23:36:21] <niconii> c74d: heh, yeah, ISO 8601 is my preferred date representation
[23:37:54] <pingveno> RFC 7168 is my preferred date representation.
[23:38:06] <c74d> niconii: Mine as well, though I use, e.g., “2015-Jun-06” when writing things that are to be read by my fellow US citizens (who still occasionally gripe about me putting the year first).
[23:38:40] <Tiffany> I also prefer ISO 8601
[23:38:43] <c74d> s/citizens/& off the Internet/
[23:38:46] <Tiffany> also, what?
[23:39:23] <Tiffany> how can you possibly interpret 2015-01-06 as anything other than the sixth day of the first month of the twenty-hundred and fifteenth year?
[23:39:47] <Tiffany> I can understand the confusion between dd/mm/yy[yy] and mm/dd/yy[yy]
[23:39:56] <Tiffany> but who the hell would ever write yyyy-dd-mm?
[23:39:58] <c74d> Tiffany: because in the normal US format the day comes before the month?
[23:40:10] <Tiffany> this is obviously not the normal US format though

[23:43:40] <dfockler> random standard date format - just mixes all of them up
[23:43:53] <c74d> Tiffany: it is obviously not the normal US format, but I guess (some) people try to understand it by approximating from the normal format, and only interpreting the year as having been moved.
[23:44:00] <c74d> uh
[23:44:02] <c74d> drat
[23:44:19] <c74d> apparently I forgot my locale's date format
[23:44:53] <Gankro> Tiffany: I'm stealing middle-endian
[23:44:56] <c74d> > in the normal US format the day comes before the month
[23:45:10] <huon> we could just number days from some epoch and skip the whole year thing

[23:49:34] <VShell> D:
[23:49:43] <niconii> it was a 32-bit value encoded as two 16-bit values, but the two values were arranged in big-endian order rather than little-endian

[23:50:56] <fmtq> no, iam ent ire lyi nco ntr olo fth esp aci ng.
[23:51:05] <niconii> but of course, each 16-bit value was little-endian, this being on a x86 computer -- hence, middle-endian
