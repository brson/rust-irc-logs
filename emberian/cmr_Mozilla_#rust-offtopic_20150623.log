[00:40:36] <amstrad> web stuff right?
[00:40:44] <aatch> Yep
[00:42:30] <amstrad> aatch: i forget what web stack you roll with, ever considered Rust a viable language to use for day to day web work?
[00:45:14] <aatch> amstrad, I'm not really sure. I use Hack (Facebook's PHP dialect/extension), which is pretty much designed for web work.
[00:45:29] <amstrad> aatch: php?
[00:45:34] <amstrad> geez mate
[00:46:12] <aatch> amstrad, eh, Hack isn't too bad. It adds a decent typesystem over the top and a few cool features.
[00:47:03] <aatch> amstrad, it also rejects some of the more terrible PHP features.
[00:47:20] <amstrad> aatch: so, its opinionated?
[00:47:51] <brandonson> whoo, my 2-year-old project builds again.
[00:48:06] <amstrad> aatch: the thing about php, is it is usually tied to a web server like apache
[00:48:40] <amstrad> i think that is fine for a lot of cases, but mostly the world seems to be moving away from that idea
[00:49:06] <aatch> amstrad, not really, any more. It's fairly common to use FastCGI and then just use a web server that speaks that.
[00:49:07] <amstrad> aatch: i haven't been heavily invested in PHP related tech since 2004
[00:49:21] <amstrad> aatch: ah yup
[00:53:17] <aatch> amstrad, as for using Rust day-to-day? I think it could work, but it wouldn't be my first choice. I'd probably consider it for an computation-heavy system.
[00:53:53] <aatch> amstrad, though writing components of a larger site in Rust wouldn't be too insane.
[00:54:10] <amstrad> aatch: i do wonder about how practical it might be
[00:56:30] <aatch> amstrad, it's more that I often don't need the performance of a natively-compiled language. Getting stuff working in a language like PHP or Python is much easier.
[00:56:59] <amstrad> aatch: do much with web sockets?
[00:57:20] <XMPPwocky> and, of course, compile times do suck
[00:57:32] <amstrad> XMPPwocky: for rust?
[00:57:43] <amstrad> i haven't found the compiler to be too bad
[00:57:43] <aatch> amstrad, there's a couple parts of the product I work on that are mostly number-crunching, but the rest is just shuffling around data to/from the database and rendering it to HTML.
[00:58:45] <amstrad> aatch: last project i was on was writing a against the web socket spec (a C# implementation of RFC6455) and then a whole application over the top. 
[00:59:11] <amstrad> i found the most challenging part of that was detail with the .NET GC 
[00:59:28] <amstrad> it would be nice to have had finer level control for things like that
[01:00:05] <amstrad> aatch: i have pondered writing network components with Rust, then layering a scripting language over the top, something with a bit more flexibility
[01:00:40] <amstrad> aatch: again, have to wonder about the practicality of doing that

[02:33:23] <c74d> *realizations
[02:33:29] <WindowsBunny> I thought it was so obvious that XMPPwocky is based on Jabberwocky that I saw no need to comment on it
[02:34:16] <c74d> zacts: Servo (#servo) is a new Mozilla Web engine being developed in Rust, but I don't know whether it's going to be used for Firefox.
[02:34:35] <zacts> ah yeah, #rust sent me there
[02:34:35] <WindowsBunny> zacts: It is a testing ground for new ideas, some of which may be pulled into firefox
[02:35:06] <zacts> I'm hoping to work towards a lightweight browser based on mozilla technologies
[02:35:10] <WindowsBunny> Over time firefox will slowly be replaced Rust
[02:35:17] <zacts> personally I'm a tiling wm kind of guy (i3wm / xmonad / stumpwm)
[02:35:25] <zacts> and I love how great mozilla browsers are
[02:35:29] <zacts> but I like lightweight solutions
[02:35:33] <zacts> all I do is read blogs and stuff
[02:35:37] <zacts> and I know many others like me
[02:35:40] <c74d> Does Mozilla have browsers other than Firefox?
[02:35:45] <zacts> c74d: seamonkey?
[02:35:51] <zacts> although, I don't know if it's still owned by mozilla
[02:36:06] <zacts> I've been toying with jumanji browser a bit lately
[02:36:07] <c74d> hm, 'k. I'd heard the name, but I didn't know what it is.
[02:36:10] <zacts> also xombrero
[02:36:31] <zacts> c74d: yeah, it's a nice integrated mozilla based browser / gui web tool
[02:36:44] <zacts> but it now arguably runs on less resources than firefox
[02:36:54] <WindowsBunny> zacts: You should write some rust code, so we can better judge you
[02:37:14] <zacts> WindowsBunny: I need to walk the coding hall of shame / critiques for a while

[03:14:05] <zacts> WindowsBunny: huh, maybe I'll try a simple irc bot in Rust as a first newbie project

[03:16:07] <zacts> ah yeah
[03:16:17] <zacts> I should try to bootstrap Rust on minix3
[03:16:24] <zacts> does rust run directly on-top of llvm?
[03:16:36] <zacts> and must I have a rust binary to bootstrap rust to a new platform, or how would this work?
[03:16:43] <WindowsBunny> zacts: rustc uses llvm as the backend
[03:16:54] <zacts> ok
[03:16:55] <WindowsBunny> Which means you can only target platforms that llvm can target at the moment
[03:17:11] <zacts> well Minix3 uses clang/llvm by default as its primary C/C++ compiler
[03:17:19] <zacts> it comes with Minix3 out of the box
[03:17:21] <WindowsBunny> and since rustc is written in Rust you will need rustc to build rustc
[03:17:26] *** Quits: yjv_ (yjv@moz-ll38tk.pa.comcast.net) (Connection closed)
[03:17:31] <WindowsBunny> Fortunately you can build a cross compiler
[03:17:42] <zacts> so I'm assuming I would do something like: compile Rust to llvm bytecode on x86_64 linux for example.
[03:17:48] <zacts> then transfer that bytecode over to minix3
[03:17:52] <WindowsBunny> Well really you just need to cross-compile the libraries
[03:17:56] <zacts> and then bootstrap on minix3 via minix3 llvm?
[03:18:03] <WindowsBunny> The compiler itself can target any platform
[03:18:20] <zacts> what is the channel for the Rust compiler? #rust-internals?
[03:18:32] <WindowsBunny> that's for discussion of development of rust
[03:18:37] <zacts> hm... so #rust?
[03:18:47] <WindowsBunny> zacts: Cross compiling is a pretty easy thing
[03:19:10] <zacts> ah ok, neato!
[03:19:16] <WindowsBunny> Just set --build --host and --target during the ./configure script and then copy over the results
[03:19:19] <zacts> I'm going to try this either tonight / this week / or this weekend
[03:19:34] <zacts> because I would love to start doing minix3 servers / core utilities in Rust
[03:19:39] <zacts> eventually, once I learn some Rust
[03:20:02] <zacts> and perhaps make a Minix3 fork, that gradually replaces core Minix3 services from C --> Rust
[03:20:16] <zacts> until I get to the actual microkernel and do it in Rust too

[04:02:55] <WindowsBunny> dpc: I should update my docs some day
[04:03:02] <WindowsBunny> I have a lot of new winapi stuff that needs documenting
[04:03:29] <dpc> There's a directive to make lack of documentation an error. Forces good habits.
[04:03:44] <WindowsBunny> dpc: Ha, I'm not documenting everything in winapi
[04:04:34] <Quxxy> WindowsBunny: random thought: program that scrapes docs from MSDN and reformats them as Markdown, then attaches them as doc comments
[04:04:43] <Quxxy> I'm sure MS Legal won't have a problem with that *at all*
[04:05:26] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: ha
[04:05:50] <Quxxy> I'm not even sure if you could put a *link* to the docs in
[04:06:03] <Quxxy> It's not like they do anything sensible like, oh I don't know, use the *name* of the symbol in the URL
[04:06:25] <Quxxy> WriteFile is (apparently) better known as "aa365747"
[04:06:36] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: Sure would be nice if we had a lawyer from Microsoft on IRC so we could ask them for clarification on stuff
[04:06:48] <WindowsBunny> Instead all we have is people like Manishearth
[04:07:33] <Quxxy> amstrad was going on the other day about how pro-open source MS is these days... maybe it'd be possible to convince them to release a high-level, easier-to-parse representation of Win32 so open source languages could do a better job of binding to it :P
[04:07:55] <Quxxy> *With* metadata that lets us emit links to the correct docs
[04:08:02] <Quxxy> Wouldn't that be grand? :D
[04:08:13] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: you get on that
[04:08:17] <amstrad> Quxxy: im sure that metadata must exist somewhere
[04:08:30] * Quxxy snorts
[04:08:38] <Quxxy> I would *genuinely* be surprised if it does
[04:08:45] <WindowsBunny> amstrad: Probably as a half-baked project of some over-worked Microsoft intern
[04:09:05] <amstrad> WindowsBunny: possible i suppose
[04:09:06] <Quxxy> If it *did*, why has .NET never shipped with full Win32 bindings? :P
[04:09:19] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: Because .NET discourages using win32?
[04:09:24] <WindowsBunny> They want you to use .NET toys
[04:09:30] <Quxxy> Why do there need to be multiple websites solely dedicated to *listing* how to import everything from Win32 into .NET
[04:09:34] <amstrad> WindowsBunny: it doesn't really (not as far as im aware)
[04:09:48] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: Wanna help me write this SSL code using schannel?
[04:09:57] <Quxxy> And even if it *did*, they'd probably only do the app partition because MS hates desktop users now
[04:10:06] <amstrad> Win32 is still a thing, and MS doesn't mandate you use .net, in fact, there are scenarios where .net just isn't appropriate (namely anything involving the kernel)
[04:10:07] <Quxxy> WindowsBunny: I know nothing about SSL or schannel
[04:10:33] <amstrad> Quxxy: haha, everyone hates desktop users :P
[04:10:48] <amstrad> as a rule "if it aint in a browser, its WRONG"
[04:10:56] <Quxxy> amstrad: I'm serious; the "modern" start menu doesn't even use windows
[04:11:10] <Quxxy> It just renders everything on to one flat surface
[04:11:13] <cmr> what does "even use windows mean"?
[04:11:14] <amstrad> Quxxy: just on a personal note, i f**king hate windows 8
[04:11:17] <cmr> oh
[04:11:27] <Quxxy> So when you have a pop-up to, say, uninstall something, the popup is *clipped to the size of the start menu*
[04:11:28] <WindowsBunny> cmr: As in, win32 widgets or something
[04:11:29] <amstrad> cuz hate and 8 rythems 
[04:11:39] <niconii> see this is the problem with microsoft calling their OS "windows"
[04:11:52] <Quxxy> So if you're using a narrow start menu because you've realised that tiles are useless, you can't actually see the uninstall pop-up
[04:11:59] <Quxxy> You have to resize the start menu to make it bigger, then do it again
[04:12:01] <niconii> you can never tell if "windows" means microsoft windows, or like... windows *in* microsoft windows
[04:12:01] <Quxxy> *Oh*
[04:12:10] <Quxxy> And I counted *four different kinds of context menu* on the start menu *alone*
[04:12:25] <Quxxy> Not different in content: different in style, rendering, animation and interaction
[04:12:27] <amstrad> i can't stand the windows 8 metro API, i own a windows surface pro, and even on tablets, its questionable
[04:12:27] <cmr> Quxxy: do you mean the start screen in win8 or the start menu in win10?
[04:12:28] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: I hope they clean shit up for RTM
[04:12:33] <Quxxy> cmr: 10
[04:12:36] <cmr> yeah
[04:12:42] <amstrad> in fact, the only place that the Win8 interface works is on phones
[04:12:43] <Quxxy> WindowsBunny: It's, what?  A month away from full release?
[04:12:55] <Quxxy> Where is this army of designers and programmers who have hitherto been completely unavailable?
[04:13:01] <WindowsBunny> Okay, I hope they fix it in an update to win10
[04:13:06] <amstrad> MS shoehorned the interface in on the desktop, i blame steve balmer
[04:13:18] <WindowsBunny> I blame the shoehorns
[04:13:24] <WindowsBunny> I also blame Quxxy
[04:13:27] <Quxxy> I will be *really* pleasantly surprised if Windows 10 isn't a mess for quite a while to come
[04:13:31] <amstrad> WindowsBunny: look on the brightside tho, least its fixed in win10
[04:13:38] <Quxxy> WindowsBunny: I'm a Sith; hate gives me strength
[04:13:58] <amstrad> Quxxy: i have high hopes for win10
[04:13:58] <aatch> I noped out of Windows 8 the moment pressing the windows key caused my entire 30" monitor to be filled.
[04:13:59] <Quxxy> amstrad: Yes.  Now you can only have one instance of calc open!
[04:14:04] <Quxxy> And it *HAS A LOADING SCREEN*
[04:14:12] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: I don't hate you, I love things which I blame
[04:14:32] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: Isn't the old calc still hiding somewhere?
[04:14:41] <Quxxy> WindowsBunny: Nope!  calc.exe redirects to metro calc
[04:14:42] <amstrad> Quxxy: to be fair, i think internally at least, windows is still a A grade operating system (UI aside)
[04:14:48] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: dumb
[04:15:03] <Quxxy> amstrad: That's like saying "to be fair, there's a grade A steak under that mountain of dead badgers"
[04:15:05] <WindowsBunny> Windows has solid internals, with a gig of backwards compatibility craft
[04:15:34] <WindowsBunny> How much of Windows' size is actually for older APIs?
[04:15:39] <amstrad> Quxxy: id still sooner use windows 8 than any linux front end (especially Unity)
[04:15:47] <Quxxy> Oh!  And the new context menus?  No keyboard shortcuts.  This includes context menus that *used* to be "normal" but got "modernised"
[04:16:17] <amstrad> Quxxy: for all win8's stupid UI decisions, it is functional
[04:16:21] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: You should send Microsoft a finely worded e-mail
[04:16:34] <Quxxy> WindowsBunny: I've been shoving bile through their feedback tool
[04:16:40] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: Actually, you should write a blog, with finely worded complaints every week
[04:16:42] <Quxxy> Doesn't seem to be working
[04:16:45] <WindowsBunny> and get everyone to follow your blog
[04:16:46] <amstrad> Quxxy: ill note tho, i was forced into using Win8 due to Win7 not supporting 8 physical cores
[04:16:53] <Quxxy> I'm tempted to record myself going through Windows 10, bitching about literally everything
[04:17:04] <amstrad> had i been able to leverage all 8 cores in win7, i would have stayed with win7
[04:17:07] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: doit
[04:17:11] <Quxxy> Except the image on the (twitches) lock screen

[04:17:48] <amstrad> Quxxy: also, what's with all the steak references?
[04:17:52] <Quxxy> I think that's it
[04:18:02] <WindowsBunny> But I don't know how to take screenshots of the lock screen
[04:18:11] <Quxxy> amstrad: I thought I only made one
[04:18:34] <WindowsBunny> the most I can do is give you a nice picture of my start screen
[04:18:36] <WindowsBunny> http://i.imgur.com/kHmEXnT.jpg
[04:18:40] <amstrad> Quxxy: you made another steak reference the other night also, i can't remember what it was in relation to, something about .net / nodejs
[04:18:51] <aatch> I got the feeling that in their rush to get in on the mobile market, MS kinda forgot that they had desktop users.
[04:19:27] * amstrad wishes the whole "my little pony" thing would die already
[04:20:11] <amstrad> aatch: well, to be fair, what applications do you run on the desktop nowadays anyway?
[04:20:19] <aatch> amstrad, games
[04:20:27] <amstrad> games aside :D
[04:20:34] <WindowsBunny> amstrad: All my programming stuff?
[04:20:44] * Quxxy looks at his desktop, having just woken up
[04:20:51] <amstrad> WindowsBunny: yeah, and how many people do "programming stuff"?
[04:20:56] <Quxxy> Four browser windows, VLC, three editors, sticky notes, some terminals
[04:21:27] <WindowsBunny> music, torrents, sharex, irc, evolve, steam, notepad++, procexp, a few consoles, teamspeak
[04:21:52] <amstrad> Quxxy: i don't think its hard to imagine what MS were thinking with regards to ignoring desktop users, more folk out there (your average consumer) can get 90% of everything done in the browser, 
[04:22:15] <Quxxy> amstrad: Here's the thing: how does restricting calc to one instance help those people?
[04:22:16] <amstrad> id be suprised if the majority of people use their computers for actual work stuff 
[04:22:23] <Quxxy> How does adding a lock screen to the desktop help those people?
[04:22:28] <passcod> In my experience, random people use Windows for two things: games and accounting software.
[04:22:36] <Quxxy> How does removing (normally invisible) keyboard shortcuts help those people?
[04:22:49] <aatch> amstrad, what about the business users? Who are arguably the biggest market?
[04:22:51] <Quxxy> How does *changing* normally invisible keyboard shortcuts help those people?
[04:22:53] <amstrad> Quxxy: *shrug* maybe MS thought more than one instance of calc might confuse people
[04:23:12] <WindowsBunny> amstrad: that's silly
[04:23:19] <aatch> amstrad, I mean, if everything can be done via the browser, why use Windows to start with?
[04:23:20] <Quxxy> amstrad: I'd almost accept that, except they went and made calc.exe (which they could have just not listed in the start menu) redirect to metro calc
[04:23:20] <amstrad> Quxxy: lets be fair, calculators are pretty damn confusing, all those buttons and all >_>
[04:23:30] <Quxxy> It's not the things that help normal users I hate
[04:23:45] <Quxxy> It's the things that *don't*, but which *do* make things harder or less useful to me
[04:23:49] <amstrad> Quxxy: you can pin it to the start menu, right click it and launch more than one instance that way
[04:23:56] <aatch> amstrad, OSX updates are at least free.
[04:24:05] <niconii> calculators are very confusing, i mean
[04:24:06] <niconii> there's like
[04:24:09] <niconii> numbers and stuff
[04:24:20] <amstrad> Quxxy: same goes for terminal prompt
[04:24:24] <Quxxy> amstrad: You're joking, surely
[04:24:33] <Quxxy> Why the hell would I sacrifice precious screen space for *calc*
[04:24:40] <Quxxy> Why, if I wanted it, would I even *touch* the mouse?!
[04:24:48] <Quxxy> Win+R calc enter
[04:24:50] <amstrad> Quxxy: well, you can launch it, then right click it, it doesn't need to be pinned
[04:24:58] <amstrad> (just tested)
[04:25:14] <amstrad> Quxxy: im not saying its very intuitive, its not, but its possible
[04:25:33] <amstrad> Quxxy: you're just not thinking with your win8 hat on :D
[04:25:45] <WindowsBunny> the start screen in 8+ doesn't open new instances
[04:25:55] <WindowsBunny> it'll open the existing instance if one already exists
[04:26:00] <Quxxy> I shouldn't have to; there was nothing wrong with my Win7 hat
[04:26:05] <WindowsBunny> if you want to open a new instance, just middle click on the thing in the taskbar
[04:26:07] <WindowsBunny> and boom
[04:26:08] <WindowsBunny> new thing
[04:26:10] <amstrad> WindowsBunny: no, it opens a single instance, once its on the taskbar, you can launch additional instances of it from there
[04:26:37] <WindowsBunny> I'm very used to opening multi-instances through middle clicking on things on the taskbar
[04:26:45] <amstrad> Quxxy: i don't like win8 either, your preaching to the converted
[04:27:09] <Quxxy> amstrad: *LIES*
[04:27:19] <Quxxy> I just tested middle-clicking: does not work
[04:27:20] <amstrad> Quxxy: honestly, i don't <_<
[04:27:29] <Quxxy> Right-clicking, doesn't work
[04:27:36] <amstrad> Quxxy: dunno
[04:27:39] *** Joins: Havvy[Hex] (Havvy@moz-epv20b.wa.comcast.net)
[04:27:50] <Quxxy> WindowsBunny: You too, *liar*
[04:27:58] <WindowsBunny> Well, when I get onto windows 10 soon, I'll find out whether they changed that
[04:28:00] <Quxxy> Liar, liar, tail's on fire
[04:28:04] <WindowsBunny> but middle clicking totally works on win8.1
[04:28:12] <Quxxy> WindowsBunny: Now, it minimises the window
[04:28:18] <Quxxy> Sorry
[04:28:20] <Quxxy> Let me be more accurate
[04:28:21] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: i hat u
[04:28:28] <Quxxy> It minimises the window, and changes its size when you restore it
[04:28:30] <amstrad> i think win10 is what win8 should have been, and Microsoft is giving away win10 for free.....can't really hate on that 
[04:28:42] *** Quits: Havvy (Havvy@moz-epv20b.wa.comcast.net) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[04:28:51] <WindowsBunny> I'm pretty happy with 8.1
[04:28:59] <Quxxy> Win10 is better than Win8... but they're both worse than Win7
[04:29:14] <WindowsBunny> I just don't want win10 to be an even bigger shift than win8.1
[04:29:25] <amstrad> just back to basics
[04:29:32] <amstrad> start button
[04:29:34] <WindowsBunny> If win10 is less usable for power users than win8.1, I will be sad
[04:29:47] <Quxxy> WindowsBunny: I really doubt that's the case
[04:30:06] <aatch> I would have much preferred an improved Win7.
[04:30:11] <Quxxy> But having used it for a few months... I honestly can't see any worthwhile reason to install it
[04:30:29] <Quxxy> Virtual Desktops is kinda nice, but can be done with 3rd party software
[04:30:43] <amstrad> Quxxy: if you run 8 cores (like i do) then its the best OS to actually do that
[04:31:03] <Quxxy> ... being able to *resize* the console window is a nice feature 35 years late
[04:31:17] <Quxxy> amstrad: I can accept hard technical limitations of Win7 as a legitimate reason to switch
[04:31:30] <amstrad> Quxxy: its why i switched
[04:31:40] <WindowsBunny> I'm probably going to switch to win10 just for the console really
[04:31:53] <WindowsBunny> those console improvements mean everything to me
[04:32:02] <Quxxy> But at the end of the day... Win10 doesn't do anything I couldn't already do in Win7 that makes any major difference
[04:32:14] <Quxxy> WindowsBunny: If you're already on 8, I think you'd be *insane* not to jump to 10
[04:32:15] <amstrad> i do think you get used to win8 tho, outside of a few small issues here and there, it hasn't really gotten in the way too much
[04:32:31] <WindowsBunny> my parents both use win8
[04:32:36] <WindowsBunny> it took them a while to adjust
[04:32:47] <WindowsBunny> especially since they moved to it from windows xp
[04:32:53] <amstrad> guys, is there a way to generate documentation for a Rust project?
[04:32:57] <Quxxy> You can get used to a lot of things; it doesn't mean you should have to
[04:33:01] <Quxxy> amstrad: cargo doc
[04:33:05] <Quxxy> *bam*
[04:33:09] <amstrad> Quxxy: what does it output to?
[04:33:13] <cmr> html
[04:33:14] <Quxxy> target\docs, I think
[04:33:14] <WindowsBunny> amstrad: shitty html
[04:33:38] <Quxxy> I wish I was a skilled designer, but... I mean, https://danielkeep.github.io/
[04:33:43] <cmr> lol
[04:33:44] <amstrad> is it that "themed" looking html on the rust site docs?
[04:33:55] <cmr> if you mean http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/master/std/index.html, yes.
[04:34:04] <cmr> I have no idea what "themed" could mean
[04:34:10] <WindowsBunny> You'll get docs that look like that link
[04:34:12] <amstrad> cmr: you know the look of it
[04:34:17] <amstrad> yes, in that link
[04:34:50] <WindowsBunny> Of course, the implementation of the docs, being pure html/js is shit
[04:34:53] <cmr> you can also get it to emit json.
[04:35:00] <WindowsBunny> A separate .html page for each item
[04:35:07] <WindowsBunny> which means winapi.... has a lot of files
[04:35:21] <WindowsBunny> tens of thousands of files
[04:36:12] <amstrad> cmr: json docs sound a bit more sane, either json or xml
[04:36:42] <Quxxy> WindowsBunny: Why, oh why, is there no open equivalent to CHM?
[04:36:51] <Quxxy> Hell, why, oh why, did MS *kill* CHM?
[04:36:52] <cmr> Quxxy: it's called epub
[04:36:54] <Quxxy> That never made sense to me :'(
[04:37:05] <Quxxy> cmr: That sounds stupid and lacking in alcohol and peanuts
[04:37:09] <cmr> chm is really nice though.
[04:37:22] <cmr> easily the best format to consume docs.
[04:37:28] <cmr> kde has a really nice chm viewer too
[04:37:36] <Quxxy> "Hey, here's a shitload of HTML files in a zip file with an index; go nuts"
[04:38:22] <Quxxy> epub has a *seven part* spec?! :O
[04:39:03] <cmr> and it's not free >:(
[04:39:08] <cmr> ISO sucks.
[04:39:15] <Quxxy> ... well, then it's not really an open alternative, is it?
[04:39:36] <amstrad> guys, later on im going to be looking for some win32 / opengl rust libs
[04:39:44] <cmr> it's as open as any other standards body.
[04:40:02] <WindowsBunny> amstrad: win32 I have
[04:40:08] <WindowsBunny> opengl.... glium?
[04:40:17] <cmr> amstrad: gl-rs on the one end, glium on the other
[04:40:19] <amstrad> WindowsBunny: i just need the bindings really
[04:40:19] <cmr> take your pick
[04:40:29] <amstrad> cmr: LOW level
[04:40:33] <amstrad> the lower the better
[04:40:40] <cmr> then use gl-rs
[04:40:40] <amstrad> raw bindings
[04:40:44] <cmr> have fun
[04:40:44] <amstrad> cool
[04:40:53] <cmr> Quxxy: it appears to be available as http://idpf.org/epub
[04:44:00] <WindowsBunny> $ git add --all
[04:44:20] <Quxxy> Oh nice; I can't disable the antivirus on Windows 10
[04:44:32] <Quxxy> I guess I just have to ... let it peg my hard drive for as long as it wants
[04:44:34] <WindowsBunny> I wonder how long this command is gonna take
[04:45:12] <WindowsBunny> Only 20,458 files
[04:45:38] <WindowsBunny> Can rustdoc PLEASE learn a better format for docs?
[04:45:44] <WindowsBunny> something that generates less files?
[04:45:59] <WindowsBunny> took 150 seconds to do `git add --all`
[04:47:02] <Quxxy> So I can't stop it scanning, and I can't even kill the process any more
[04:47:18] <WindowsBunny> now to wait for it to git push all this shit
[04:47:26] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: git is not winapi doc scale
[04:47:33] <Quxxy> Quxxy: :P
[04:47:39] <Quxxy> Webscale?  Pfft.  Try *desktop scale*
[04:47:42] <WindowsBunny> talking to yourself?
[04:48:20] <WindowsBunny> Now I wait for it to upload the massive amount of data
[04:48:31] <WindowsBunny> I wonder how much 7z could compress the docs
[04:48:55] <WindowsBunny> dat compression ratio
[04:49:20] <WindowsBunny> 100,825,893 -> 2,571,078
[04:49:38] <Quxxy> Aaah... I had to shut down Windows 10, but my hard disk is *finally* silent again
[04:50:05] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: Check out these lovely updated docs https://retep998.github.io/doc/winapi/
[04:51:02] <Quxxy> WindowsBunny: Oh!  That reminds me; a ULONG_PTR is *always* a 64-bit value, right?
[04:51:07] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: Oh, that's a shame, rustdoc only shows a single level of Deref

[06:42:29] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: lol
[06:43:01] <Quxxy> WindowsBunny: I need to rethink the basic design; what I had was going to be complicated and not very flexible
[06:43:24] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: yeah, IOCP is _really_ hard to design in a way that is easy to use in rust
[06:43:29] <Quxxy> And *so many* nested Arcs and Mutexes
[06:43:37] <WindowsBunny> mmm, efficiency too
[06:43:42] <WindowsBunny> now that's the killer
[06:43:44] <Quxxy> I was trying to have tasks that owned the OVERLAPPED slots
[06:43:57] <Quxxy> If you wanted to do an async operation, you had to return a Request enum out of your handler
[06:44:17] <Quxxy> The lower-level handler would then start the async op and suspend you
[06:44:30] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: I think carllerche has a rather cool design for using iocp
[06:44:34] <WindowsBunny> although it only works with sockets
[06:44:34] <Quxxy> But that precludes the possibility of having multiple async ops in flight in a single task
[06:45:50] <Quxxy> I'm seriously tempted to have some sort of arena allocator for OVERLAPPEDs and require all async operations to require a handle to the current task
[06:46:00] <WindowsBunny> lol
[06:46:00] <Quxxy> That or some kind of task-local storage (*eurgh*)
[06:46:19] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: good luck with your design adventures :D

[07:29:09] <Quxxy> ChrisMorgan: This is really cool :D
[07:30:12] <ChrisMorgan> I’m preparing some large-scale training resources for Rust; a couple of rather interesting things that can be used separately have come out of it thus far—this is one.
[07:31:43] * Quxxy sees that ChrisMorgan uses rST; good man!
[07:32:28] * ChrisMorgan only ever uses Markdown as a concession to others
[07:32:54] <Quxxy> I've actually been wondering whether doing a pure-Rust impl of rST would be worth it...
[07:33:03] <ChrisMorgan> Define “worth it”.
[07:33:10] <ChrisMorgan> Will it get traction? No.
[07:33:18] <Quxxy> :P
[07:33:20] <ChrisMorgan> Markdown has, alas, triumphed for now.
[07:33:35] <Quxxy> Like JavaScript
[07:33:55] <ChrisMorgan> … there are rather strong parallels there, aren’t there.
[07:34:50] <Quxxy> ... why ^]?
[07:35:25] <niconii> Quxxy: some irc clients render that as italics
[07:35:32] <Quxxy> Ah
[07:35:42] <niconii> Quxxy: mirc, and recent versions of irssi too
[07:35:51] <niconii> Quxxy: no idea who started it though
[07:36:02] <Quxxy> Well that explains it, but mine seems to prefer %'s
[07:36:54] <Quxxy> I never bothered much with them, though, since I don't know how well they're supported.
[07:38:12] <ChrisMorgan> I had the general impression that non-supporting clients didn’t show the codes.
[07:38:40] <Quxxy> But if they don't support them, how do they know not to show them? :P
[07:39:05] <ChrisMorgan> No one said my general impression had to be logical, did they?
[07:39:52] <ChrisMorgan> italic, bold, reverse, 08yellow, 03,05green on red, &c. 
[07:40:11] <ChrisMorgan> Fun stuff.
[07:40:31] <Quxxy> All but italic shows for me
[07:40:53] <niconii> yes, i distinctly remember someone saying three months ago that "ChrisMorgan's general impressions must always be logical, for their logic is the only thing keeping our earth from crashing directly into the sun"
[07:41:05] <ChrisMorgan> niconii: logs or it didn’t happen.

[07:42:08] <ChrisMorgan> In WeeChat (which I use) italic doesn’t show up. Dunno why they don’t use it, it’s just a simple CSI 3 m to turn on and CSI 23 m to turn off.
[07:42:18] <ChrisMorgan> Doesn’t stop me from typing it, though 😀
[07:42:25] <niconii> i immediately destroyed them to ensure no nefarious evildoers and/or people mistaking the sun for a particularly large piñata would use that knowledge to crash the earth into the sun
[07:42:33] <ChrisMorgan> (Just like I can type fancy characters like that even though they don’t show up at all…)
[07:42:46] <niconii> so unfortunately i cannot produce any logs

[07:43:53] <Quxxy> ChrisMorgan: What was wrong with ":)" or even ":D"
[07:44:15] <Quxxy> :D is 2 code units; that thing is four!
[07:44:19] <ChrisMorgan> Quxxy: I’ve gotten into the habit of using appropriate Unicode characters where such things exist rather than using the plain ASCII versions.
[07:44:26] <ChrisMorgan> Quxxy: no it’s not, it’s one code unit.
[07:44:34] <ChrisMorgan> Not my fault if you’re using UTF-16.
[07:45:19] * ChrisMorgan retracts that line
[07:45:26] * ChrisMorgan was tangling his terminology terribly
[07:45:43] <ChrisMorgan> Quxxy: OK, use UTF-32! Then 😀 is 1 and :D is 2!
[07:46:11] <Quxxy> No sane person would use UTF-32 for anything
[07:46:20] <Quxxy> Also :D shows up, 😀 doesn't

[09:33:52] <eddyb> maybe I'm thinking too much of flowers and bees
[09:33:53] <fmtq> it's like a false tautology. It ascribes social sexuality as an adjective to a biological process that only has limited rules to function.
[09:33:58] <fmtq> it is just reproduction.

[11:20:45] <eddyb> Tiffany: don't even attempt to fix the error (AFAIK DNA has some kind of error correction)
[11:21:00] <eddyb> amstrad: that's suboptimal
[11:21:15] <amstrad> eddyb: in what way?
[11:21:23] <amstrad> lack of inlining, or the copies?
[11:21:27] <eddyb> neither
[11:21:32] <amstrad> lack of simd?
[11:21:34] <eddyb> it's going to be inlined anyways
[11:22:00] <eddyb> amstrad: even if LLVM can figure out how to apply SIMD to that code, it's not going to be the best you can do

[13:35:23] <XMPPwocky> there seems to be some impedance mismatch between what browsers think i use bookmarks for and what I actually use them for
[13:35:42] <XMPPwocky> they seem to think it's, like, my favorites, that i'll constantly go back to and want to be easily accessible

[13:37:10] <Tiffany> firefox on android has one, but I think that might integrate into that stupid proprietary service

[19:11:52] <Astrum|Lap> well I'm sure there's plenty of memes I don't get

[19:13:48] <Tobba> (it's less classic but better imo)
[19:13:57] <Astrum|Lap> there was a maze in it... or perhaps the sequel

[19:14:14] <Tobba> that fucking cave-subway maze
[19:14:19] <Astrum|Lap> uh... there were stones or something?
[19:14:41] <Tobba> Astrum|Lap: the ship puzzle?
[19:14:52] <Tobba> I have my myst disk somewhere here actually, it's scratched to hell though :(
[19:14:53] <Astrum|Lap> I dunno, it has been so long I really don't remember anything beyond the general feeling I had while playing the game
[19:15:02] <c74d> “2015-06-23 07:43:54 <ChrisMorgan> In WeeChat (which I use) italic doesn’t show up. Dunno why they don’t use it, it’s just a simple CSI 3 m to turn on and CSI 23 m to turn off.” — The way I heard it, WeeChat uses ncurses for its rendering, and only a recent, then-development version of ncurses supports outputting italic text.

[19:18:29] <Tiffany> wait what?
[19:18:33] <c74d> <https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/revolucion>
[19:18:44] <Tiffany> battlefield 1942 was praised as the first war shooter
[19:19:16] <Astrum|Lap> c74d: perhaps I spelled it wrong, but Manny (forget the voice actor) said it SO well
[19:19:19] <Tobba> also if you're feeling like playing old games, give system shock a spin (with the mouselook mod)
[19:19:24] <Tiffany> as opposed to whatever quake and doom are
[19:19:34] <Astrum|Lap> Tiffany: battlefield: 1942 took a LOT of inspiration from Starsiege: Tribes
[19:19:41] <Astrum|Lap> so did Halo interestingly enough
[19:19:48] <c74d> oh, I guess you likely left off the accent on the final vowel that would make it Spanish
[19:19:53] <Tiffany> I don't know anything about starsiege: tribes
[19:19:57] <Tobba> Tiffany: cheetah-strapped-to-200kg-of-weaponry simulator
[19:20:18] <Astrum|Lap> it didn't start off that way, Tobba 
[19:20:22] <Astrum|Lap> Tribes was an interesting game
[19:20:38] <Astrum|Lap> because it's original premise changed drastically once people figured out how to ski
[19:21:05] <Tobba> Astrum|Lap: I was referring to doom and quake
[19:21:09] <Astrum|Lap> oh
[19:21:13] <Astrum|Lap> it... applies to tribes too

[19:21:17] <Astrum|Lap> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJUU2S3S5SM
[19:21:21] <Tobba> doom lets you move at 40% over the intended speed by straferunning, and with quake, well yeah
[19:21:27] <Astrum|Lap> it really is my absolute favorite online FPS
[19:21:43] <Astrum|Lap> so tribes had an interesting physics... glitch? kind of
[19:21:54] <Astrum|Lap> if you jumped while going down a hill you'd lower your friction
[19:21:59] <Tobba> yeah I know
[19:21:59] <Tiffany> eh
[19:22:03] <Tiffany> I suppose that is 40% faster
[19:22:09] <Tiffany> I never thought about it as a percentage
[19:22:21] <Tiffany> just a failure to pythagorean hard enough
[19:22:40] <Astrum|Lap> hnnnggg... I want a Tribes: Remastered
[19:22:56] <Tiffany> oh that's interesting
[19:23:00] <Tiffany> sqrt(2) == 2 / sqrt(2)
[19:23:37] <Tiffany> oh, duh
[19:23:57] <Astrum|Lap> I see a sqrt in the denominator
[19:24:00] <Astrum|Lap> must fix!

[19:26:12] <c74d> “<Astrum|Lap> we should all play” — why, out of curiosity?
[19:26:22] <Tiffany> how many people can be on a multiplayer server, astrum?
[19:26:34] <Tiffany> and does it have a linux version or run well in wine?
[19:26:39] <Astrum|Lap> c74d: it really did influence a lot of games, halo and bf being the two big ones
[19:26:41] <Tiffany> (old games that use opengl generally run fine in wine)
[19:26:56] <Astrum|Lap> Tiffany: 64, though I think you can bump it up? I don't remember exactly
[19:27:02] <Astrum|Lap> not sure about wine tbh
[19:27:09] <c74d> Astrum|Lap: I'm assuming bf is something other than Brainfuck?
[19:27:17] <Astrum|Lap> battlefield
[19:28:05] <Astrum|Lap> though interestingly, halo also took influence from starcraft, back when it was still an rts
[19:29:20] <Astrum|Lap> Tiffany: I know the second one supported 128 players, and there was a linux port... though I doubt anyone has maintained it at all
[19:29:52] <Tobba> my experience with that is "everything somehow works perfectly except the sound"
[19:29:53] <Astrum|Lap> source code to Tribes 2 has been lost, source code to the first was updated ~6 years ago
[19:29:54] <Tobba> fuck alsa
[19:30:29] <c74d> hm, so you're recommending running this program out of historical interest, rather than the usual arguments in favor of play, like, um…

[19:35:42] <Astrum|Lap> even if they sacrifice good programming practices to do it...
[19:35:46] <Elaine> battlefront 2 was suuuuch a good game.
[19:36:34] <Elaine> I'm so pumped for the new one
[19:36:39] <dfockler> The maps were mostly well balanced so you couldn't landslide

[19:37:34] <Tiffany> it's basically battlefield 1942 but star wars
[19:37:41] <Tiffany> but they tied it into the star wars universe very well
[19:37:46] <Tiffany> there's a lot of gameplay that wasn't in 1942
[19:38:01] <Tiffany> like the ability to sometimes spawn as a jedi, and the vehicle mechancis

[19:51:48] <brandonson> eddyb: I know, but there are some cases where a loop works better
[19:51:53] <eddyb> (it's shorter *and* more efficient. guarantees only one allocation)
[19:52:33] <eddyb> brandonson: my_vec goes on its own line, so I don't see the issue
[19:52:53] <eddyb> having to scan for trailing `foo` and `return foo;` is extra work
[19:53:01] <eddyb> the function block is *just* a block
[19:53:49] <brandonson> eddyb: I find that if something returns right after the for loop, I want the return there explicitly, otherwise I assume it was doing something for the side effects
[19:54:05] <eddyb> wat
[19:54:27] <eddyb> it's not like there is no "my_vec" at the end of the block
[19:54:39] <eddyb> and good luck doing this nested in, e.g. a match arm
[19:54:48] <eddyb> which doesn't happen to be at the end of a function
[19:56:34] <brandonson> eddyb: it's a lot easier to see the return than to notice that a semi-colon is missing
[19:56:36] <Elaine> I was just introduced to http://www.goblinscomic.org/. Seems like it will be good.
[19:56:54] <eddyb> brandonson: but you don't look for semicolons
[19:57:00] <eddyb> you look for trailing expressions
[19:57:35] <brandonson> eddyb: and how do I know the trailing expression isn't actually a statement being executed for its side effects?
[19:57:43] <eddyb> because it's a single identifier
[19:58:29] <brandonson> eddyb: you're focusing too much on the exact example I gave, I think
[19:58:39] <eddyb> your example depends on being at the end of the function
[19:58:57] <eddyb> there's a lot of value flow *inside* functions
[19:59:45] <eddyb> in `let foo = if cond { a; b; c } else { x; y; z };` I know to expect a trailing expression because of the leading `let`

[20:00:46] <eddyb> brandonson: give a better example if you want to argue for explicit returns :P
[20:01:35] <Elaine> I often use explicit returns for error values in error branches of match arms, even if it's the last expression in a function.

[20:34:06] <c74d> I had duct-taped the holes over (inside and outside), then the tape came off, and I left them with holes for months, then some shoe store convinced me that the shoes were wrong for my feet, and here were the right shoes for my feet… out of their selection of “right” shoes, I did go straight for the cheapest, though.

[20:34:31] <lahwran> below a threshold, it adds only one extra layer
[20:34:34] <eddyb> that sounds too good to be true
[20:34:54] <Astrum|Lap> c74d: my last pair of shoes were free (long story), this pair was... $110 iirc
[20:34:58] <lahwran> neural networks are kind of like that in general, the things that work and the things that don't work all sound too good to be true
[20:35:02] <Astrum|Lap> they do last quite a while
[20:35:07] <lahwran> so it's hard to tell from how it sounds whether it will have good performance
[20:35:10] <Astrum|Lap> they're also leather

[20:36:02] <Sho> Astrum|Lap: I can't really pull off Doc Martins
[20:37:35] <lahwran> from 0 to 0.5, fade between whether the layer is used; from 0.5 to 1, fade between whether the layer's continue neuron is used
[20:38:12] <lahwran> maybe
[20:38:56] <Tobba> idea: stop using neural networks
[20:39:05] <lahwran> and replace them with what
[20:39:23] <lahwran> if you have a viable alternative that is worthy of research, then fire away
[20:39:37] <lahwran> there are other machine learning techniques still under research
[20:42:07] <Elaine> Tobba: don't be such a reductionist, gosh.
[20:42:09] <Elaine> ;p
[20:42:24] <lahwran> so what this would look like in practice is that you multiply the weights of layer n <-> output by 1 - layer n's fade, and layer n+1 <-> output's weights by layer n's fade
[20:42:27] <Tobba> I don't know, but it's looking pretty obvious they're not going to be very useful for things other than pattern recongition (CNNs)
[20:42:33] <lahwran> it is?
[20:43:07] <c74d> Oh, I contacted edolstra about Hydra building from unauthenticated package definitions, and they re-configured it to download them via HTTPS rather than via the unauthenticated Git transport protocol.

[20:44:17] <Tobba> lahwran: RNNs are promising if you manage to train them properly, but if we haven't come up with anything else by the time we get enough computing power for them to be practical we've clearly run out of ideas

[20:45:02] <lahwran> here's another http://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.00387v1.pdf
[20:45:10] <lahwran> I think variable depth would combine well with highway networks
[20:46:07] <lahwran> but I'd rather use neural turing machines than highway networks
[20:47:14] <lahwran> RNNs on their own aren't that interesting
[20:47:59] <Astrum|Lap> Sho: I have no idea if I can pull off DMs
[20:48:07] <Astrum|Lap> I just know they last a long time and are reasonably comfortable
[20:48:08] <Astrum|Lap> lol
[20:48:15] <lahwran> but just dump some glue on them, hook them up to other stuff, and they're awesome
[20:49:23] <lahwran> Tobba: your position has sufficient evidence against it. please update it.
[20:52:42] <Tobba> lahwran: I'll admit there are some really nice practical uses of non-CNNsm but I maintain that they're going to be a dead end
[20:53:42] <lahwran> do you have any point besides "people should stop trying"?
[20:54:37] <brandonson> Tobba: Given that humanity has gotten as far as it has largely because we're good at pattern recognition, I'm not sure *only* being good at pattern recognition is as bad as you seem to think.
[20:54:44] <lahwran> ^
[20:54:57] <lahwran> I mean, neural networks are definitely approximate
[20:55:02] <lahwran> there's no question there
[20:55:29] <dfockler> humans just have more context to realize what to do with the patterns we find
[20:55:45] <lahwran> right. the more context you add, the better things work
[20:56:08] <dfockler> and we have some sort of goal or agency that causes us to continue doing stuff
[20:56:12] <Tobba> all I'm saying is that we're clearly out of ideas if all we can think of is hoping wacky approximations will lead to anything more than wacky approximations
[20:56:34] <lahwran> ._.
[20:56:41] <lahwran> it sounds like you're just being negative
[20:56:44] <lahwran> I'm going to put you on ignore now

[20:59:47] <brandonson> sure
[20:59:53] <Tobba> I'm just being cynical, go on

[21:00:25] <dfockler> depending on your attenuation algorithms
[21:00:53] <Tobba> brandonson: also pattern recognition is great, but it's hard to apply NNs in more general cases than imagery (even there you get iffyness beyond the first few layers)

[21:06:11] <lahwran> intelligence isn't about computation power

[21:15:11] <Astrum|Lap> either cybernetics as in deus ex, or transfer consciousness to a computer
[21:15:22] <Tobba> figure out the telemere and mithocondria degradation first
[21:15:46] <Tobba> iirc they're the biggest problems you run into aging wise
[21:15:58] <Tobba> oh and the fact that the brain degrades horribly as well but that might be related
[21:16:06] <Astrum|Lap> I mean
[21:16:18] <lahwran> you can increase neuroplasticity
[21:16:21] <Astrum|Lap> I have an occular condition
[21:16:27] <lahwran> I mean, so, part of the thing is there fundamentally should be shortcuts here
[21:16:34] <lahwran> we have strong evidence that they're hard to find
[21:16:34] <Astrum|Lap> I don't want new eyes that'll eventually go bad as well, I want cybernetic eyes =)
[21:16:57] <lahwran> but we also have evidence that they probably exist in there somewhere
[21:16:59] <Tobba> Astrum|Lap: I'm just imagining my eyes going into VGA resolution for some reason
[21:17:12] <Astrum|Lap> Tobba: meh, better than my current eyesight
[21:17:35] <Astrum|Lap> https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Keratoconus#/media/File:Kc_simulation.jpg
[21:17:38] <lahwran> the brain is a whiz at superresolution
[21:17:47] <Tobba> Astrum|Lap: ouch
[21:17:49] <lahwran> move an image around in a low res video, it looks higher res than it is
[21:18:16] <Astrum|Lap> on the plus side I could play Judge Doom in a Roger Rabbit sequel
[21:18:20] <Astrum|Lap> =D

[21:19:20] *** MrBurns is now known as erickt
[21:20:56] <Tobba> Astrum|Lap: couldn't you just replace the front half of the eye, instead?
[21:21:00] <Tobba> the retina is perfectly fine
[21:21:27] <Astrum|Lap> I can get intacts (little rings inserted into the cornea) or a cornea transplant
[21:21:31] <Astrum|Lap> still
[21:21:38] <Astrum|Lap> I'd rather have new eyes
[21:22:05] <Astrum|Lap> you know, if the technology was there
[21:23:01] <Astrum|Lap> with a HUD and other fancy features, obv
[21:23:10] <Astrum|Lap> virtual reality
[21:23:25] <Tobba> I'd rather not have that integrated into my eyes
[21:23:49] <Tobba> at the point where that's possible, you'd be looking at the slight possibility of shitty neural implants :D
[21:24:11] *** Joins: pcwalton (pcwalton@moz-ilu.bfn.243.173.IP)
[21:24:17] <Astrum|Lap> I'd love that integrated into my eyes
[21:24:35] <WindowsBunny> Guys, I'd just like to say, there's a tornado warning and a severe thunderstorm warning
[21:24:43] <Astrum|Lap> but... I doubt I'll be alive long enough for that to exist or at the very least be common place and inexpensive
[21:24:47] <Tobba> it'd get in the way of your vision though, and it means my eyes having buggy firmware
[21:24:48] <WindowsBunny> if I disconnect suddenly, blame tornados/thunderstorms
[21:24:59] <Tobba> I'd rather just *know* somehow
[21:25:06] <Astrum|Lap> hmm...
[21:25:09] <Astrum|Lap> that's actually a good point
[21:25:32] <Astrum|Lap> maybe an overlay is just a crappy substitute for directly manipulating the brain
[21:26:07] <Astrum|Lap> look at a picture of a storefront and you'll just instantly know that it's at 123 Cherry Lane
[21:26:21] <Tobba> and importantly: where that information came from
[21:26:27] <Tobba> otherwise you're looking at utter madness
[21:26:53] <Astrum|Lap> or if you see a restaurant you've never been to before you'll be able to recall what it looks like in your head
[21:26:57] <Astrum|Lap> man... that'd be awesome
[21:27:43] <Tobba> if it worked "naturally", you could use a search feature like that more like a limb rather than instant magic knowledge from nowhere
[21:28:07] <Tobba> as for "naturally", imagine having a third eye in the back of your head and that being perfectly normal
[21:28:23] <Tobba> or rather, feeling normal (as for what I mean with that)
[21:29:17] <RC9> so
[21:29:46] <RC9> good search is basically having transparent access to all knowledge stored on the internet?
[21:29:58] <Astrum|Lap>  Tobba I think I'd prefer instant magic knowledge
[21:30:01] <RC9> yeah
[21:30:10] <RC9> it wouldnt be insanity imo if you got used to it
[21:30:11] <Astrum|Lap> I mean in effect your memory would be more global
[21:30:13] <RC9> it just becomes
[21:30:16] <RC9> everyone is super smart
[21:30:19] <RC9> and good at math and stuff
[21:30:25] <RC9> im kinda okay with that
[21:30:26] <RC9> mostly
[21:30:30] <Tobba> I wouldn't, imagine the filter bubbles
[21:30:38] <RC9> all the people speaking with google translate though would be funny
[21:30:50] <RC9> i could see either though really
[21:30:58] <RC9> having to will the implant to search
[21:31:01] <Astrum|Lap> Tobba: well I think the goal of it would be to have a unifying consciousness
[21:31:09] <Astrum|Lap> filter bubbles would be antithetical to that
[21:31:23] <Tobba> and I mean, you get information that you don't know where exactly it came from, which would be *very* dangerous
[21:31:50] <Astrum|Lap> I think it'd be the opposite of dangerous
[21:32:01] <Astrum|Lap> assuming everyone has access to all information
[21:32:08] <Astrum|Lap> which... I guess is a big assumption
[21:32:13] <Tobba> it'd be fine if you knew "google says X and Y", but there are also privacy concerns about the automatic queries
[21:32:37] <Astrum|Lap> I think privacy is overrated
[21:32:42] <Astrum|Lap> I think individuality is overrated
[21:32:50] <Tobba> I'd love to magically be able to remember a full copy of wikipedia though
[21:33:11] <Astrum|Lap> well... I don't think it's good to visualize it in those terms
[21:33:28] <Astrum|Lap> more like your brain thinks it knows things despite having never 'learned' them in the traditional sense
[21:33:37] <Tobba> it's all mostly a question of how the interface works
[21:33:54] <Astrum|Lap> I'm thinking it'd emulate how the brain already works
[21:34:22] <Astrum|Lap> we just interrupt the brain when it's searching for a bit of knowledge and redirect it to a server farm
[21:34:34] <Astrum|Lap> and the brain can consume it as if that information was already there
[21:34:41] <Tobba> the internet outages in that universe must suck
[21:34:54] <Astrum|Lap> yeah, that'd be catastrophic...
[21:34:55] <brandonson> Astrum|Lap: idk, I'd rather have to actually mentally trigger a search
[21:35:03] <Tobba> word
[21:35:16] <Astrum|Lap> eh, fair enough
[21:35:23] <brandonson> Astrum|Lap: basically, instead of integrated with your brain, it's a computer that talks to directly to your brain
[21:35:35] <Astrum|Lap> I've actually thought about this before, I'd like to write a book, but I'm a poor writer =)
[21:35:41] <Tobba> Astrum|Lap: I think it would work best as a side-thing of the "normal" memory searching process
[21:36:06] <Astrum|Lap> (soft sci-fi)
[21:36:08] <Tobba> well, actually exactly what you said, but localized
[21:36:29] <Tobba> if you had a local copy of wikipedia, you'd search that and generate new memories of it on the fly as a part of the lookup process in the brain
[21:36:41] <brandonson> Tobba
[21:36:52] <brandonson> Tobba: idk, I'd still rather query it explicitly
[21:37:09] <brandonson> Tobba: otherwise what happens when I update wikipedia?  My memories get edited?
[21:37:29] <Astrum|Lap> also, if we can inject knowledge into the brain, who says we can't record it as well
[21:37:30] <Tobba> your memory of wikipedia gets updated, that's the important distinction
[21:37:38] <Astrum|Lap> it'd be fun experiencing life from literally everyone else's perspective
[21:38:19] <brandonson> Astrum|Lap: TSIs (Total Sensory Immersion) in at least one sci-fi series are basically that
[21:38:39] <Tobba> Astrum|Lap: I personally place a rather high value on the healthy amounts of entropy resulting from individuality
[21:38:49] <Astrum|Lap> might have to look it up, brandonson 
[21:39:12] <Astrum|Lap> my idea for a novel would basically focus around the transition to that state, which I imagine would be very turbulent
[21:39:13] <Tobba> also there was obviously a star trek episode about this
[21:39:30] <brandonson> Astrum|Lap: I believe that was a Peter Hamilton series where the TSI idea came from
[21:39:30] <Tobba> (the memory replay thing)
[21:39:31] <Astrum|Lap> as Tobba just demonstrated, there would be a very large individualism vs collectivism debate
[21:39:38] <brandonson> Astrum|Lap: I don't think it focuses on it much
[21:39:57] <Astrum|Lap> but, I don't think my English abilities are sufficient for such an endeavour =(
[21:40:13] <brandonson> Astrum|Lap: as far as the collectivism idea goes, Edenists in the Night's Dawn Trilogy are about as collectivist as it gets
[21:40:43] <brandonson> Astrum|Lap: well, except for ANA in the void trilogy, which is an actually collective consciousness
[21:41:05] <Astrum|Lap> that'd be what my story would be transitioning to
[21:41:14] <Astrum|Lap> sort of... merging the concept of individualism and collectivism
[21:41:56] <brandonson> Astrum|Lap: hmm, edenists might be closer, ANA was basically a computer located within the quantum fabric of the universe around Earth or something like that.
[21:42:01] <Astrum|Lap> I don't read fiction much, will have to check that stuff out
[21:43:56] <brandonson> Astrum|Lap: Peter Hamilton does a pretty god job of sci-fi, but the collectives don't necessarily get much focus.  The Night's Dawn trilogy is probably the closest to your idea, but it's set a while after the transition IIRC
[21:44:27] <Tobba> looking at group dynamics I'd say both ends of the individualism<->collectivism scale are bad
[21:44:58] <Tobba> unless you change how humans work a pure collective would probably be catastrophically unstable
[21:45:59] <Tobba> (I can elaborate on that if you want to)
[21:46:11] <Astrum|Lap> I'd love to talk about this a lot more tbh
[21:46:14] <brandonson> Tobba: Most sci-fi I read is either 'generally part of the collective, but you can back out to a private space if needed' or the opposite, 'integrate as a collective if called/needed'
[21:46:16] <Astrum|Lap> I enjoy conversations like this
[21:46:20] <Astrum|Lap> unfortunately I have work to do =(
[21:46:30] <brandonson> Astrum|Lap: pfft, work is overrated
[21:46:41] <Astrum|Lap> and underpaid, but I still have bills =(
[21:46:44] * brandonson is running a 20 minute test script
[21:48:09] <Tobba> brandonson: one of the particularily dangerous things would be ejection from a collective (of any form), since you could end up with an "evaporative cooling" effect and then the whole thing would go bonkers
[21:48:24] <Tobba> you could argue that wouldn't happen in a true collective, but still
[21:49:18] <brandonson> unfortunately, the script appears to be failing due to the vagaries of hardware
[21:50:08] <brandonson> Tobba: I lean to the side of 'individual unless we need collective action/support/etc.' personally, which helps avoid that.
[21:50:44] <brandonson> Tobba: also, I suspect that humans being human, we'd end up with multiple collectives that are slightly different, though possibly with some looser connections between them.
[21:51:26] <Tobba> brandonson: with humans being humans that'd also be the ultimate us vs. them scenario
[21:53:35] <brandonson> Tobba: well, perhaps.  That depends on whether the overall effect of a collective is calming, and whether we're alone in this corner of the galaxy.  Also possibly on how the inter-collective connections work
[21:54:19] <Tobba> brandonson: I feel like you could also draw some connections between collectives and badly designed voting systems which always turn into two party systems
[21:56:00] <brandonson> Tobba: depends, a properly done collective could be a direct democracy, which would seem to eliminate that.  Unless I'm missing some of the connections you're thinking of.
[21:57:15] <Tobba> I mean inter-collective, I need to think through this for a bit but it seems like you could get in a deadlock with two collectives with radically differing opinions, with no middle ground able to form
[21:58:14] <Tobba> there seem to be quite a lot of failure modes to large collectives
[22:01:16] <brandonson> Tobba: hmm I suppose, depends on how the inter-collective interactions work
[22:03:36] <brandonson> hmm, apparently my home router has dropped off the internet, interesting
[22:06:12] <Tobba> improvements to animal cells would also be rather cool to see, you could probably achieve quite a lot just by tinkering with the DNA thanks to the inefficiencies of evolution
[22:06:42] <Tobba> although you'd probably risk destroying traits that provide long-term evolutionary benefits, but who needs that when you have DNA modification
[22:17:20] <brandonson> Tobba: It'd be cool to see genofixed traits for rapid adaptation of strength/build to things like gravity, atmospheric composition, etc.  Assuming of course we manage interstellar travel
[22:17:52] <Tobba> it's the only way we'll ever leave earth for longer periods of time
[22:18:08] <Tobba> unless you can come up with some miracle drugs to fix the fact that nothing really works properly in zero gravity
[22:18:31] <brandonson> Tobba: well, we can fake gravity if we try hard enough
[22:18:48] <Tobba> or we can just fix the most glaring issues, like the pressure distribution through the body changing screwing things up
[22:19:37] <Tobba> and that our knack for adaptation backfires with atrophying while in space, meaning we can't handle the rapid change back to normal conditions well
[22:19:48] <brandonson> Tobba: the hard one is when you're on a low-g planet (or, alternatively, high-g has its own weird stuff)
[22:20:16] <brandonson> Tobba: space, you just rotate your living are around the ship's center
[22:20:42] <brandonson> s/are/area
[22:20:46] <Tobba> so really you need to both make the body adapt better to being in space, and make it not adapt as well
[22:20:52] <Tobba> should be interesting

[22:56:16] <bstrie> eddyb: I have a new comment on https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues/1169
[22:57:21] <eddyb> bstrie: vec! uses Clone AFAIK
[22:57:45] <eddyb> which means you can't switch it to use `box [expr; N]`
[22:58:06] <bstrie> ah, I didn't realize
[22:58:10] <eddyb> (also N might be runtime)
[22:58:24] <bstrie> so they've already diverged, in which case I don't really care :P
[22:58:25] <brandonson> eddyb, bstrie: yeah, vec! is runtime
[22:58:43] <brandonson> (the N I mean)
[22:58:43] <bstrie> [expr; N] can also be runtime, if expr is Copy
[22:59:31] <eddyb> not sure what you mean with 1.
[22:59:54] <eddyb> `box Foo` is not a constant rvalue
[23:00:21] <eddyb> (though, well, it could be, if Foo is zero-sized)
[23:01:19] <eddyb> having a destructor is probably going to disallow it still
[23:01:26] <bstrie> eddyb: I just want to know what direction you have in mind for const expressions to make sure that they don't violate the restrictions we voluntarily impose on the expr
[23:01:57] <eddyb> bstrie: no side-effects is a given
[23:02:40] <bstrie> some languages are perfectly fine with side effects at compile time :P I think D allows it, for instance
[23:02:46] <eddyb> [const_rvalue; N] is const VALUE: T = const_rvalue; [VALUE, VALUE, VALUE, ...]
[23:02:48] <bstrie> not that I think that's a good idea, mind you
[23:02:56] <eddyb> bstrie: oh so you're a bit out of the loop :P
[23:03:06] <eddyb> impurity at compile-time is not planned
[23:03:14] <bstrie> other than the const fn RFC I have no idea as to the direction of const exprs
[23:03:16] <eddyb> and I'm highly against it
[23:03:16] * brandonson relaxes
[23:03:30] <bstrie> this is why I'm asking the lang team :)
[23:03:46] <eddyb> bstrie: @rust-lang/language
[23:03:51] <eddyb> or is it just /lang? I don't know
[23:05:05] <eddyb> bstrie: we might get the ability to run arbitrary algorithms in a "black box" (including allocations, as crazy as that may sound)
[23:05:16] <eddyb> bstrie: but the interface to that would have to be pure
[23:06:13] <eddyb> bstrie: and besides, we can keep the current constexpr constraints on [expr; N] even if we get some sort of crazy CTFE
[23:06:39] <eddyb> so I wouldn't worry about it
[23:06:49] <bstrie> kk
[23:07:15] <eddyb> bstrie: if you write an RFC, could you also do one for &const_rvalue being 'static?
[23:07:24] <WindowsBunny> eddyb: You'll know the group names as soon as rust-lang gets the new organization stuff from github :D
[23:07:38] <eddyb> all the work has been there for months, waiting for a patch to enable it

[23:10:07] <eddyb> forgot Rust actually can do that
[23:10:28] <brandonson> eddyb: didn't that get disabled/feature-locked at some point?
[23:10:50] <eddyb> I don't write stable code so I don't care
[23:11:09] <brandonson> eddyb: well, if it got completely taken out...

[23:22:53] <Tobba> err
[23:23:10] <Tobba> s/and/yeah,
[23:24:00] <brandonson> Tobba: I always got annoyed when I wanted to log values as they went through my calculations
[23:24:05] <Tobba> dfockler: collective minds as a final outcome of massive advances in biology and understanding the brain
[23:24:14] <dfockler> ah borg
[23:24:17] <dfockler> sort of
[23:24:23] <Tobba> basically borg
[23:24:26] <Tobba> brandonson: that
[23:24:32] <Tobba> brandonson: that's why you have a time travelling debugger
[23:25:13] <Tobba> it's not really sane to debug functional code with debug prints
[23:25:35] <brandonson> Tobba: yeah, in fairness, I never looked into debugging haskell much
[23:26:12] <brandonson> so chances are my way of trying to do it was terrible
[23:26:29] <eddyb> https://gist.github.com/eddyb/119828550bd0fc911619
[23:26:58] <Tobba> I'm not sure if haskell really has a good time travelling debugger, but there are functions which you can also use for debug prints (T -> T functions that print it in the process)
[23:27:12] <eddyb> oh, B is for background and F for foreground :D
[23:27:22] <brandonson> Tobba: I feel like laziness probably would bite you with those
[23:27:31] *** Havvy[Hex] is now known as Havvy
[23:27:31] <Tobba> it will, but it's better than nothing
[23:27:51] <Tobba> but in some cases like Nix laziness is a massive win
[23:27:59] <Tobba> s/laziness/purity, sorry
[23:29:31] <Tobba> eddyb: that's both awesome and terrifying
[23:30:02] *** Quits: pcwalton (pcwalton@moz-ilu.bfn.243.173.IP) (Client exited)
[23:30:45] <Tobba> also why are you comparing sigma to omax twice
[23:30:55] <eddyb> that's the algorithm
[23:31:04] <eddyb> and that's σmax not omax
[23:31:15] <brandonson> Tobba: >= vs. >
[23:31:18] <Tobba> well I don't have a goddamn sigma key
[23:31:31] <eddyb> I don't either
[23:31:35] <Tobba> brandonson: yeah I noticed, but it still seems weird
[23:32:24] <Tobba> eddyb: oo that's a good idea for driving someone mad
[23:32:26] <Tobba> subtle sigmas
[23:32:40] <eddyb> there's easier ways to drive someone mad
[23:32:43] <eddyb> οo
[23:32:49] <eddyb> that's greek and latin
[23:33:01] <eddyb> I don't think you can tell the difference :P
[23:33:04] <Tobba> fun
[23:33:12] <Tobba> it might show differently in some programming fonts for this exact reason
[23:35:12] <brandonson> I wonder how terrifying brainf*ck would be if the instructions were like that (i.e. greek o for increment, latin for decrement)
[23:35:24] <Tobba> that probably exists
[23:35:48] <brandonson> Tobba: wouldn't surprise me
[23:35:48] <Tobba> someone should make a version of whitespace but with zero-width characters
[23:36:23] <Havvy> How many zero width characters are there?
[23:36:35] <eddyb> breaking and non-breaking space
[23:36:39] <eddyb> that's enough :P
[23:36:43] <Tobba> + control characters
[23:36:56] <Tobba> huh, "pop formatting" is a thing
[23:37:03] <Tobba> I wonder if text shaping is turing complete
[23:37:49] * WindowsBunny shapes Tobba
[23:38:13] <Tiffany> it would explain why there's been a million and a half RCE vulnerabilities in windows' font implementation
[23:38:33] <Tobba> someone please remind me why windows renders text in kernel space
[23:38:57] <eddyb> probably predates NT
[23:38:58] <Tiffany> wait, it does?
[23:38:58] <Elaine> truetype has a turing complete language for hinting.
[23:39:01] <eddyb> one way or another
[23:39:05] <Tobba> Tiffany: win32k.sys
[23:39:07] <Tobba> a classic.
[23:39:14] <eddyb> Elaine: of course it does
[23:39:37] <Tobba> Elaine: yep, but that's less of a weird machine
[23:39:41] <Tobba> it's also horribly specified
[23:40:04] <Tobba> "This operation is anachronic" *no explanation of what it does, and it's name and arguments are nonsensical*
[23:40:06] <Elaine> indeed
[23:42:10] <Tobba> truetype fonts are also over-engineered in general, and kinda awful to deal with
[23:43:02] <Tobba> non-zero rule instead of even-odd, no restrictions on self-intersection, funky-ass variable-length encoding that doesn't save much space at all
[23:43:54] <Tobba> (you'd get way better results by just slapping LZ4 on, especially since there's no compression on the hinting bytecode)
[23:45:14] <Tobba> actually, I'm not so sure if a quick LZ would work too well in this instance, but nonetheless

[23:53:13] <WindowsBunny> google play music has so many lovely curated radio channels
[23:54:04] <Tobba> hm
[23:54:13] <Tobba> I wonder how many buggy drivers windows has which would allow RCE over USB
[23:54:33] <Tobba> some flash drives allow their controllers to be programmed...
[23:55:10] <brandonson> WindowsBunny: like, the 'It's Tuesday afternoon, play music for...'?  Or something else?
