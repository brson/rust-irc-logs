[02:42:11] <Gankro> jroesch: Why so generic?
[02:43:36] <jroesch> Gankro: Nick had made mention he would rather have a generic BitSet so I just abstracted the operators
[02:43:45] <Gankro> Ah, k
[02:44:07] <Gankro> This can replace BitSet anyway, eh?
[02:44:15] <Gankro> Well, hmm
[02:44:19] <jroesch> maybe overkill? allows us to pick different sizes for the allocation
[02:44:46] <jroesch> I didn't waste too much time though only took like 30-40m just hadn't updated it until now
[02:44:52] <jroesch> had my head buried in the inferencer 
[02:45:31] <eddyb> jroesch: when I tried to do it, integer fallback had different semantics (it was eager)
[02:46:21] <Gankro> jroesch: btw, what's the interaction with integer fallback? Who wins?
[02:46:35] <eddyb> right now there's some passes for using fallbacks. the way inference variables are stored has changed. and I had no idea how to unify defaults from different variables
[02:47:00] <eddyb> ... or even unify an type inference variable with a default, with an integer inference variable
[02:47:20] <eddyb> Gankro: presumably the user default
[02:47:31] <Gankro> eddyb: Which is a breaking change..?
[02:47:49] <eddyb> oh I didn't consider that
[02:48:01] <jroesch> eddyb: yeah I just don't know that current inference implementation very well so I'm using it as an excuse to learn how everything works in detail. According to the RFC any unbound integral or floating point variables are handled first (https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0213-defaulted-type-params.md)
[02:48:08] <eddyb> Gankro: blame the early stabilization of defaults
[02:49:02] <eddyb> jroesch: it changed a lot since so I don't know much either, just some vague ideas. can't wait to see some code though
[02:49:30] <eddyb> jroesch: so that means type param defaults are ignored for integer literals?
[02:50:22] <jroesch> eddyb: that is my reading of the pseudo-code there, step vi. seems to bind integer and floating point values first
[02:50:24] <eddyb> Gankro: I'm not sure changing the result of inference is considered a breaking change
[02:50:28] <jroesch> then deals with default fault backs
[02:50:34] <Gankro> eddyb: Yes and no
[02:50:38] <jroesch> fallbacks*
[02:50:51] <Gankro> eddyb: Obviously "turn off all inference" would be pretty a pretty awful change!

[02:56:50] <eddyb> jroesch, Gankro: this contrived example doesn't actually use fallback, so the method call that could fail if the result of inference changes - it actually determines the type

[02:59:23] <eddyb> found a bad case :(
[03:00:47] <eddyb> jroesch: I would really want to try crater out with a version of rustc that prefers type param defaults to integer/float defaults, just to see what happens
[03:01:47] <jroesch> so after re-reading the RFC I was misinterpreting its intent: "his RFC gives defaulted type parameters precedence over integer/float literal fallback" the algorithm allows for fallbacks to be applied before the final unification 
[03:02:26] <eddyb> jroesch: there's also some support I cobbled up (trying to remove integer suffixes, before 1.0. got away with only a small set of removals) for large-scale pretty-printing with type ascriptions
[03:03:20] <eddyb> it's a few months old but I should be able to rebase it, if you need to compare the inference results for basically everything

[03:20:02] <eddyb> jroesch: it would've been merged a couple months before 1.0 or so - but it was ran over by the IO reform
[03:20:24] <eddyb> there's probably still some full output buffering left around in pretty-printing
[03:20:52] <jroesch> eddyb: I think this would be great, esp. in the light of inference changes in the future
[03:21:02] <jroesch> because we were talking about something like this during the versioning meeting

[07:00:50] <Peach> Hi, does anyone know how the rust compile handles type inference and what part of Rust's source code is relevant to that?

[07:03:51] <eddyb> Peach: depends, do you have a more specific query?
[07:04:04] <eddyb> a lot of it is in src/librustc/middle/infer
[07:05:34] <Manishearth> nrc: should just copying WindowsBunny's code and making that the windows version of get_proc_self_statm_field work?
[07:05:36] <eddyb> but it's driven by typeck and many other details are all over the place
[07:06:16] *** Joins: gen_battle (genbattle@moz-4v0.gkd.16.182.IP)
[07:06:20] <Peach> I'm just curious about the overall structure of complex expressions having types resolved
[07:06:31] <Peach> for example     let x = 5;   is simple
[07:06:36] <WindowsBunny> Manishearth: Don't worry, I'll file a PR soon
[07:06:39] <Peach> but say  let x = somefunction();
[07:06:50] <nrc> Manishearth: from the reporting side of things, yes. I have no idea if that code will work - Windows is a mystery to me
[07:06:53] <aatch> Peach, it's the pretty much the same process, just applied over and over.
[07:06:56] <Manishearth> WindowsBunny: ah
[07:06:59] <nrc> WindowsBunny++
[07:07:14] <Manishearth> WindowsBunny: I wanted to make use of my Windows pc while I still have iut :p
[07:07:25] <eddyb> Peach: the type of x would be an "inference variable" that can receive more information as typeck progressed inside the function
[07:07:27] <WindowsBunny> Manishearth: Of course, you could work on a PR
[07:07:46] <nrc> Manishearth: no shortage of Windows bugs :-p
[07:08:11] <eddyb> Peach: once typeck is done, it requires that all the AST nodes have a concrete type, no type or lifetime inference variables
[07:08:31] <WindowsBunny> nrc: A lot of it is in ugly things like debug info and unwinding though

[16:21:28] <oli_obk__> is there any reason why there isn't also an impl of `Clone` for all `T: Copy` except of course that this would be a breaking change?
[16:21:53] <Mutabah> oli_obk__: Because it would collide with existing impls I think

[20:01:56] <SimonSapin> Thanks Elaine. I was looking at --help and missed --help -v
[20:02:11] <Elaine> yeah, easy to do :(
[20:02:26] <Elaine> I sorta think that -h -v was a bad call

[20:02:51] <SimonSapin> it works, thanks!
[20:03:02] <Elaine> It's the sort of "And I wonder why I didn't think of that!" usability gotcha that is annoying

[20:23:38] <Manishearth> imperio_: you really need to work on your translation of "bon" :)
[20:25:04] <imperio_> Manishearth: where did I make the mistake (again ><)
[20:25:05] <imperio_> ?
[20:27:39] <Manishearth> https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/26742/files#diff-0827bbd2c0dfd5eaf2059ca7f0c35a56R1381
[20:27:42] <Manishearth> s/good/correct
[20:27:53] <Manishearth> though there were other issues so I just rewrote it :)
[20:28:39] <imperio_> erf
[20:28:51] <Manishearth> SimonSapin: got any way of explaining the words "bon" can translate into (right/correct/good)?
[20:28:55] <imperio_> this "good" word is just perfectly fine haha
[20:28:59] <Manishearth> hah
[20:29:12] <imperio_> I fix the typos ^^
[20:29:16] <SimonSapin> Manishearth: translating French to English?
[20:29:45] <imperio_> SimonSapin: yes, that's because I never translate "bon" correctly...
[20:30:11] <Manishearth> SimonSapin: imperio has trouble with that word, he uses "good" everywhere, and I realized he was translating from "bon" and explained it (since he asked before to help with his English), but I may not have explained it properly enough :)
[20:30:49] <SimonSapin> yeah, in the context you linked to, "correct" sounds nicer
[20:30:55] <imperio_> Manishearth: I come here more for english lesson than rust issue ^^
[20:31:03] <Manishearth> imperio_: as far as diagnostics go "correct" is usually the ... correct term to use ("good" is too qualitative), but in general you probbly want to figure out which word works
[20:31:33] <imperio_> Manishearth: I'll try to figure a better way to force myself to translate "bon" correctly
[20:31:35] <Manishearth> imperio_: writing code is how I learned programming (screw books), writing docs is how you're learning english. works for me :p
[20:31:48] <SimonSapin> compiler message: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BMNG2h4CQAI2dtY.jpg
[20:32:08] <imperio_> Manishearth: I learned programmation that way too, I prefer "learning by testing"
[20:32:36] <imperio_> SimonSapin: we should add it in case of ICE
[20:32:40] <Manishearth> imperio_: "good" is for stuff that has a general positive feel to it. "correct" is when there is a correct and a wrong. So is "right".
[20:32:43] <Manishearth> SimonSapin: lol
[20:32:54] <Manishearth> I am a big supporter of embedding memes in Servo and Rust
[20:33:50] <imperio_> you could make emoticon art

[20:53:26] <larsberg> admittedly it's usually one of those "don't put that in there!" situations rather than an Arc bug, but that's certainly where we see multithreaded resource release contention-related crashes first
[20:53:50] <aturon> larsberg: hm, how feasible would it be for me to build/test servo with my own rustc build before landing this?
[20:55:58] <larsberg> aturon: should be pretty straightforward, so long as you don't have changes to compiler plugins
[20:56:16] <larsberg> aturon: nrc was just doing it last night (america-time), so he can confirm/deny that statement :-)
[20:57:57] <nrc> probably going to deny that - Servo needs a RustUp before it is compatible with nightly, so you'll need to modify an old version of rustc
[20:59:52] <larsberg> nrc: that's why I checked :-) we're only one week behind, though, aren't we? I made a new snapshot *during* the workweek that we landed... man, those unstable apis.

[23:45:59] <jethrogb> is there a reason libstd contains the 'ud2' instruction multiple times?
[23:46:58] <Elaine> yes, it corresponds to std::intrinsics::abort()
