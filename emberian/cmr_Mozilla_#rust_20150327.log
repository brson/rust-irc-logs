[00:16:18] <bstrie> RCIX: as I said earlier, the best way to solve this would be to file a bug against the rand library to derive Clone as well where it currently only derives Copy
[00:16:37] <bstrie> RCIX: that said, if you really want to stick to this approach, I have a gross workaround that should suffice: http://is.gd/XV3Djl
[00:16:53] <blaenk> is it possible to do separate derive() directives?
[00:16:54] <ChrisMorgan> richo: I think it needs a note somewhere at least indicating that https://github.com/mattn/webapi-vim is required; that and the command should go into the documentation.
[00:17:03] <blaenk> #[derive(A)] #[derive(B)] item;
[00:17:06] <ChrisMorgan> blaenk: sure
[00:17:10] <blaenk> oh!!!!!
[00:17:13] <richo> I can do that. (I explicitly engineered it to silently do nothing if you don't have webapi)
[00:17:28] <blaenk> then adding a 'concurrent' feature shouldn't be much harder !!?!?
[00:17:30] <ChrisMorgan> blaenk: #[derive(A, B)] is syntax for #[derive_A] #[derive_B], as a matter of fact
[00:17:35] <blaenk> ohhh

I just realized the hairy part will be with src/with_clone.rs, cause I was thinking you'd be able to mix them up, so you could enable the 'clone' and 'concurrent' feature to have both, cause I need both, but it doesn't seem that'd be possible

[00:21:06] <blaenk> but the problem I'm thinking about is having it compose well with your 'clone' feature
[00:21:11] <blaenk> and I don't think that's possible
[00:21:24] <blaenk> i.e., don't think it's possible to enable a 'clone' feature plus a 'concurrent' feature and have it work
[00:21:31] <blaenk> you'd need 'cloneandconcurrent' feature or something

[02:40:57] <dcrewi> it just starts with one...
[02:40:58] <Savago> And it would be nice if the default value is the correct one (so callers don’t need to bother).
[02:40:59] <blaenk> you using something like the url crate?
[02:41:09] <blaenk> dcrewi: just starts with one what
[02:41:16] <Savago> blaenk: is the url type used in servo.
[02:41:21] <blaenk> ah okay
[02:41:27] <Savago> rust-url?
[02:41:30] <blaenk> yeah
[02:41:31] <Savago> something like that.

[02:42:23] <blaenk> I agree with dcrewi that if you're gonna do the None route for specifying "use default", that may not be very descriptive
[02:42:32] <blaenk> somefunc(34, 452, None)

[02:43:14] *** Joins: SpaceWizard (RJones@moz-anbpsl.east.myfairpoint.net)
[02:43:21] <blaenk> it works the way you intend, that it's not _necessary_ to pass the parameter
[02:43:39] <blaenk> but if it's more than one then it can get pretty confusing, func(3, 2, None, None, None)
[02:44:04] *** Joins: zxq9 (ceverett@moz-c1f1em.asahi-net.or.jp)
[02:44:19] <Savago> It can be a single parameter. But that being said, I may just change the function interface to always require a valid URL.
[02:44:41] <Savago> That will require some code duplication (i.e. at call site), but there only 1 instance of use.
[02:44:52] <Savago> And it will enable the unit test with invalid url.
[02:45:31] *** Quits: reem (reem@moz-2icmmi.ca.comcast.net) (Connection closed)
[02:45:35] <dcrewi> another option would be to have a second function that calls the first with the default argument. I don't know whether that makes sense for you though.
[02:46:03] <blaenk> yeah that's a good alternative
[02:46:05] <Savago> dcrewi: it may work, as the function is already private.

[04:12:10] <Yurume> Go has a good green thread scheduler which Rust currently lacks (and also, does not support by default). Rust however supports a native threading which maps well with the underlying OS.
[04:12:19] <talchas> Go uses green threads, m:n threading, rust is just native threading
[04:12:45] <talchas> rust has no shared memory without unsafe, go leaves it up to you to not screw up

[04:13:00] <talchas> (and encourages channels which help towards not screwing up)

[04:45:37] <squeezer> they complicate the control flow, sure
[04:45:48] <squeezer> but at least your function return signatures are not cluttered with error handling
[04:45:52] <richo> they're difficult if you want to make guarantees about when and how memory is freed
[04:46:07] <richo> you can mostly get exceptions with Result and try! though
[04:46:42] <FreeFull> I think failure should be clearly indicated in the signature in some way
[04:46:48] <FreeFull> Rust has the simplest solution for that. There are also things like effect systems, which are pretty cool
[04:46:54] <scott> squeezer: that would depend on your specific implementation of exceptions. Java and C++ both put exceptions into function signatures in some ways
[04:47:04] <richo> does c++?
[04:47:14] <richo> i actually don't know enough about it, but I was unaware of exceptions being in sigs
[04:47:25] <Skyler> FreeFull: I kind of wish panics were required to be indicated in a signature :/ like `unsafe` is required
[04:47:34] <Mutabah> richo: It has throw specifications, but they're optional, and I don't think enforced
[04:47:41] <richo> Ahh, ok
[04:47:59] <richo> on the one hand that's neat, on the other hand "awesome even more features and syntax D:"
[04:47:59] <scott> it has throw specifications and noexcept specifications
[04:48:10] <scott> and exceptions in C++ seem like a mess in general
[04:48:15] <richo> noexcept sounds like a thing
[04:48:30] <scott> LLVM/Clang and Google both disable C++ exceptions entirely, for example

[05:44:34] <nstoddard> How do I add a #[cfg(test)] annotation to a #![feature(..)] annotation? The tests use a feature that the rest of the code doesn't, and I don't want the build output to have warnings.

[05:47:52] *** Quits: blaenk (blaenkdenum@moz-em283u.res.rr.com) (Connection closed)
[05:47:58] <eddyb> yes, it's very much so
[05:48:06] <mbrubeck> Yeah, returning slices makes sense.  It can complicate the types, but should be possible.
[05:48:14] <kerrick> again, the idea is to read the entire file into a String called data, then each CcedictWord will have &strs that point into data
[05:48:14] <eddyb> kerrick: wait, not like that
[05:48:22] <eddyb> kerrick: you can't keep them in the same structure

[05:48:51] <SiegeLord> Can you set a global linker path for cargo?
[05:48:56] <eddyb> kerrick: the String has to be on the stack "higher up" than the references pointing inside it
[05:49:14] <SiegeLord> Or does every single -sys package need to provide a flag to set the search path?
[05:49:30] <mbrubeck> SiegeLord: In .cargo/config, you can set `linker =` in a [target.*] section
[05:49:39] <eddyb> kerrick: the compiler can't tell between &'a String and &'a str pointing inside the String allocation or even &'a u8 to a single byte in the string

[05:52:22] <SiegeLord> dougxxx: I don't see why I have to add that to my package
[05:52:39] <SiegeLord> Or are you saying that can be done by a package that uses some -sys package?
[05:53:05] <dougxxx> SiegeLord: yeah... because sys packages suck and assume that the library is global. Um, there's an override isn't there

[05:54:00] <scott> kerrick: probably something like fn parse_dict(dict : &'a str) -> Vec<CcedictWord<'a>>
[05:54:02] <dougxxx> But if it doesn't (ie. most crates) you can override.
[05:54:23] <SiegeLord> dougxxx: I don't see why 1000 crates have to provide 1000 keys to set the same search path :P

[06:41:05] <huon> Rust has slicing via `s[start..end]`

[06:41:34] <kerrick> hmm, I happen to know the data is ASCII, but say I didn't
[06:41:39] <Mutabah> because rust strings are utf-8, you can't access a cahracter by index without iteration

[09:15:58] <bombless> try! isn't about IO, it's only about error handling, or say about playing with Result<U, V>
[09:16:20] <scott> RCIX: File::create returns a Result because it could possibly fail - one way to deal with this failure is try! which returns the error from the current function if one occurs - another way to deal with it is .unwrap() which either returns the Result's value or panics, crashing your program, when there is an error

[09:16:57] <RCIX> (line 15 is the try! macro)

I need to check the address of a member's function/closure to make sure the C

[17:47:36] <scott> sw17ch: I think the issue with polymorphic values is the whole monomorphism deal
[17:47:38] <sw17ch> so, we’d have to assume that all polymorphic values are also non-mut, right?

[19:17:23] <jviereck> The current docs use "option" and "Option" and "Option<T>" when the type is relevant. Maybe all of the options should be renamed to `Option` to make clear the trait is meant and have a consistent wording?

[23:42:48] <zgerd> I actually was not reading it properly and just wondered why llvm would generate such an inefficient loop by doing a recursive call

[23:43:24] <FreeFull> "callq memset@PLT"
[23:43:45] <FreeFull> I imagine this memset is an LLVM intrinsic, rather than something libc dependent
[23:43:48] <zgerd> so I guess I can not implement memset in rust then and I have to provide this as a C function?
[23:44:28] <bluss> zgerd: this is what you need, this line https://github.com/hackndev/zinc/blob/668c3dcf4be1ba2559a64a8bdc294fcf79035e51/thirdparty/librlibc/src/lib.rs#L29
[23:44:37] <bluss> those 3 lines
[23:44:59] <bluss> someone did this before, so of course it's possible :)
[23:45:01] <zgerd> bluss, ah nice :)

[23:45:44] <FreeFull> And of course, to avoid iterators, a for loop isn't used
[23:46:06] <bluss> FreeFull: which is foolish, because it's just the same
[23:46:17] *** Joins: hhhhhhhh1 (mike@moz-969kuj.cable.virginm.net)
[23:46:39] <bluss> the range iterator is made to compile to a perfect loop, it doesn't it's a bug
[23:46:47] <FreeFull> bluss: It does mean that even if you're not using libcore and don't have Iterator defined, you can still use those
[23:47:06] <bluss> ah yes, zgerd did have core though
[23:47:07] <FreeFull> Assuming the compiler doesn't say "You have to define iterator anyway"
[23:47:28] <acrichto> richo: nah I think it's probably best to just set the env var on the bots, I'll try to do that soon and then I'll r+

[23:49:11] <richo> sure, I just commented on the PR, while hacking on it I noticed that the variable name doesn't make sense any more. I'll update the name today.
