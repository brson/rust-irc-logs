[01:18:53] <bvssvni> turtles!
[01:19:08] <mcpherrin> TECHNO. TURTLE.
[01:19:15] <mcpherrin> regular turtles are slow
[01:19:19] <bvssvni> with an R on the back
[01:19:20] <mcpherrin> it has to be a sweet cybernetic fast turtle
[01:19:34] <mcpherrin> made of metal with the rust gears powering its cyberlegs

[01:20:22] <Denommus> cool
[01:20:32] <Denommus> (but it's as movimented as #lisp-cafe in freenode)
[01:21:18] <cmr> movimented?

[01:22:10] <Denommus> I don't even know if this word exists
[01:22:47] <mcpherrin> hexapod turtle? wierd
[01:23:28] <mcpherrin> #rust-offtopic more like #rust-mascot-hunt

[01:23:49] <mcpherrin> fits pretty well; rust has a bunch of robot named things already
[01:24:01] <mcpherrin> I should make a robot-mascot in time for a 1.0
[01:24:08] <Denommus> I'm sad about rustpkg's death. I kinda liked it
[01:24:11] <bvssvni> [o o] R
[01:24:14] <Denommus> maybe I should fork it
[01:24:39] <mcpherrin> Denommus: I don't know if it's death is as deathy as people claim; I think it will live on out-of-tree
[01:24:58] <Denommus> mcpherrin: what do you mean?
[01:25:08] <mcpherrin> I think people are still going to use rustpkg.
[01:25:16] <mcpherrin> It just won't be a tool by default
[01:25:19] <mcpherrin> (for now, maybe)
[01:25:31] <mcpherrin> The Servo folk tried really hard to use it before failing
[01:25:58] <Denommus> well, I like the concept of having a default package manager. But one package manage will prevail anyway
[01:26:18] <Denommus> I just didn't want it to be cargo-lite because Python
[01:26:22] <cmr> I recommend not worrying about the package management situation...

[01:28:12] <Denommus> cmr: so that's why I'm worrying
[01:28:12] <cmr> sure, it will improve.
[01:28:16] <cmr> I'd just recommend not worrying.

[01:29:56] * ChrisMorgan hasn't been in here for six weeks
[01:29:57] <mcpherrin> I wonder if the turtle should have like tank treads
[01:30:07] <Denommus> ChrisMorgan: I don't see why rolling a wheel should be difficult, it's just rotation
[01:30:07] <mcpherrin> or robot legs
[01:30:14] <ecr> both
[01:30:24] <mcpherrin> tank treads on legs??
[01:30:25] <ChrisMorgan> Denommus: it's merely a question of whether SuperTuxKart supports it.
[01:31:15] <Denommus> ChrisMorgan: well, I never hacked it, but I don't imagine it being difficult to support
[01:31:24] *** Joins: japaric (japaric@55D04ADF.DC1425E6.84437BC5.IP)
[01:31:35] <mcpherrin> If it doesn't, just make 4 wheels that all coincide
[01:31:46] <ChrisMorgan> Hopefully it already simulates wheels realistically.
[01:31:48] <mcpherrin> i'm sure you can make something work
[01:31:53] <Denommus> mcpherrin: it would become awkward when you turn
[01:31:57] <mcpherrin> wheels appear to rotate in this video I'm watching
[01:32:06] <mcpherrin> Denommus: heh, yeah
[01:32:13] <ChrisMorgan> mcpherrin: I'd be astonished if it didn't support vehicles with just one wheel.
[01:32:19] <Denommus> mcpherrin: you could make the back wheels invisible, though
[01:32:36] <mcpherrin> I just saw a two wheeled vehicle in a video
[01:32:51] <mcpherrin> also a hovercraft with whatlooks like the xfce mouse?

[01:33:29] <Denommus> Rust's kart could be a monocycle without a driver
[01:33:55] <ChrisMorgan> Indeed. Just the logo, extruded.
[01:34:07] <mcpherrin> TECHNO TURTLE TANK
[01:34:08] <mcpherrin> :p
[01:34:39] <bvssvni> the mascot can not be approved before it works in SuperTuxKart
[01:36:10] <Denommus> there's no other monocycle in the game, it would be interesting
[01:36:20] <bvssvni> downloading the game
[01:39:33] <Denommus> hm. SuperTuxKart needs a better wiki
[01:39:39] <Denommus> with the list of characters and all that
[01:46:49] <photex> robot on bike
[01:46:58] <photex> are there other bikes in tuxcart?
[01:47:43] <mcpherrin> I saw a thing that looked like an egg with two wheels on youtube
[01:47:44] <Denommus> photex: we're actually thinking about a wheel. Just a wheel
[01:48:15] <photex> but but but... ok this could be rad! https://encrypted.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=monowheel&tbs=imgo:1
[01:48:28] <photex> the R doesn't have to rotate at all
