[02:50:22] <Peach> I'll just go with the unquestionably clear keyword infiniteloop
[02:51:06] <Mutabah> Peach: Well, the fact that rust has 'loop' which takes no arguments makes it pretty clear that it's infinite (barring return/break)
[02:51:42] <aatch> Peach, but most loops aren't infinite.
[02:52:18] <Peach> infiniteloop will be specifically the same as for(;;)   while(true) aatch 
[02:52:26] <Peach> only for the purpose of self documenting code
[02:52:50] <aatch> Peach, yeah, and unless you don't have `break` or `continue` it's not going to be true.

[02:54:49] <aatch> Peach, the vast majority of the time loops have *some* sort of deliberate exit condition.
[02:55:13] <aatch> I'd argue that the absence of one is a sign of poor engineering.
[02:56:06] <Peach> alright - I guess I'll go with plain "loop" for the equivalent of for(;;) while(true)
[02:57:24] <Peach> I'm trying make a programming language that's more beginner friendly yet still fully featured. I want to be as accurate to Computer Science concepts and terminology as possible, but not be super idiomatic
[02:57:56] <Peach> I suppose a plain "loop" with no arguments is self documenting enough
[02:59:19] <aatch> In Rust `loop` is actually kinda necessary. Since the compiler knows that the only way to break out of a `loop` is via `break` or `return`.

[03:07:40] <Quxxy> (See people complaining about Rust's use of MinGW GCC on Windows)
[03:07:46] <Elaine> Peach: Using C is a bad idea IMO because there is a lot of undefined behavior you need to be very careful to avoid
[03:08:11] <Elaine> And this includes lots of behavior that is completely sensible on the machine.
[03:08:21] <Peach> Hmmmmmm
[03:08:26] <Elaine> eg pointer casting, defined float representation
[03:09:14] <Peach> I'm aware of C's undefined behavior in terms of syntax, I guess one thing I don't know is integer overflow
[03:09:17] <aatch> Elaine, does C not require IEEE representation for floats?
[03:09:21] <Elaine> aatch: of course not.
[03:09:25] <Peach> :O
[03:09:35] <aatch> Elaine, not even C99?
[03:10:19] <aatch> I mean, I get earlier versions not specifying it, since hardware floating point wasn't something you could rely on *existing* let alone following a specific spec.
[03:12:35] *** Quits: ELD (textual@moz-tbcsac.co.comcast.net) (Quit: Textual IRC Client: www.textualapp.com)
[03:13:19] <Elaine> aatch: nope, at least my memory says it doesn't, and my reading of the C99 draft just now agrees.
[03:13:46] <Peach> I totally want floating point consistency since I want to make the language cross platform and as platform independent as possible, would software based floating point be the only way to gaurentee consistency? Because Software based floating point calculation isn't even an option for real high performance I want to achieve D:
[03:14:07] <aatch> Elaine, ouch. I can't say I'm surprised though.
[03:14:34] <Elaine> aatch: in particular reinterpreting the bytes of a float is UB iirc
[03:14:47] <Elaine> (and reinterpreting non-float bytes as a float)
[03:16:23] <aatch> Peach, software floating point *would* be the only way to absolutely guarentee consistency. However in practice you'd be better off either 1) assuming IEEE floats (not unreasonable) or 2) falling back to software floats in the even of hardware not supporting it.
[03:18:29] <niconii> you'd be surprised what is still implementation-defined in C
[03:18:44] <niconii> the size of a byte is still implementation-defined as of C11
[03:19:35] <aatch> Isn't almost every type implementation-defined to some extent. I remember most of them being defined in terms of the range of values they can hold.
[03:20:14] <scott> I think most of them have a minimum range they have to include, but it's pretty loose.
[03:20:25] <Quxxy> I remember seeing some weird-ass C implementation that was *technically* correct years ago, but broke basically *all* existing code
[03:22:46] <Peach> niconii: no, sizeof(char) HAS to be 1
[03:22:53] <Peach> it HAS to right ;-;
[03:23:03] <Elaine> Peach: that's true.
[03:23:16] <Elaine> But that says nothing about sizeof(anythingelse), or about how many bits that is
[03:23:19] <Elaine> or if it's even binary!
[03:23:24] <aatch> Peach, sure, but the size of a byte is implementation defined.
[03:23:42] <aatch> 1 byte == ? bits
[03:23:51] <Peach> Huh? 1 byte = 8 bits = char
[03:23:54] <Elaine> Nope.
[03:24:01] <Peach> x_x
[03:24:01] <Elaine> sizeof(char) = 1 is the only equality.
[03:24:04] <scott> cppreference has an interesting page about this: http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/types#Integer_types
[03:24:11] <scott> Not C, but I think the C++ rules are very similar.
[03:24:27] <scott> > Note: this allows the extreme case in which bytes are sized 64 bits, all types (including char) are 64 bits wide, and sizeof returns 1 for every type.
[03:24:40] <aatch> Peach, nope. In fact the (admittedly fictional) MIX computer has bytes that are *either* 6 bits *or* 4 decimal digits.
[03:24:58] <Peach> ;-;
[03:25:33] <Elaine> scott: iirc the C++ rules diverged quite significantly.
[03:25:50] <Peach> I'm REALLY surprised that no architecture has been designed from the ground up to have a programming language that cleanly integrates with it, without any undefined behavior or unknown type size
[03:25:55] <niconii> i still feel that the whole concept of a "portable assembler" is an oxymoron
[03:26:14] <Peach> Wait, does Rust have any guarantees of size of bytes?
[03:26:21] <Elaine> u8 is 8 bits.
[03:26:27] <Elaine> etc
[03:26:37] <Elaine> in the way you'd expect :P
[03:26:42] <niconii> Peach: oh, no, there have been architectures like that, it's just that those languages aren't portable
[03:26:54] <niconii> Peach: on account of cleanly integrating with the architecture
[03:27:55] <aatch> Also, "good for languages/compilers" often clashes with "good for CPUs".
[03:28:47] <Peach> Assuming Rust has a better system of type size guarantees than C, how would you even get Rust working on a system where Rust hasn't been used before?
[03:29:10] <Elaine> by porting LLVM to that system and cross-compiling.
[03:29:26] <Peach> "by porting LLVM" < that sounds hard
[03:29:27] <aatch> Peach, depends on the system in question, but if LLVM can target it, then we'll probably run on it.
[03:29:42] <Elaine> It's not as hard as it sounds.
[03:29:58] <aatch> Peach, it varies. "Tedious" is probably the most universal aspect.
[03:30:07] <Elaine> yeah.
[03:30:12] <Elaine> it is *really* tedious
[03:30:25] * Elaine has been writing a PDP-11 target.
[03:30:38] <aatch> I haven't even done it, I've just looked at the target definition files.
[03:30:53] <aatch> I know how tedious those must have been to write.
[03:32:52] <Peach> Does Rust guarantee consistent floating point across platforms, or is that just an impossible goal without software emulation?
[03:33:24] <aatch> Peach, I'm pretty sure we define them as IEEE-754 floats.
[03:33:26] <Elaine> we guarantee IEEE floats.
[03:39:03] <FreeFull> What about the inconsistency due to the FPU using 80-bit floating point?
[03:39:27] <Elaine> that's a separate type in LLVM.
[03:39:33] <Elaine> and we don't use it
[03:40:18] <sunfish> llvm uses it for float and double too, if it thinks the subtarget may not have SSE
[03:41:07] <Elaine> I'm pretty sure it also doesn't introduce any inaccuracies, I don't remember
[03:41:13] <sunfish> it does
[03:41:17] <eddyb> http://stuffin.space/ aka Earth has rings
[03:41:19] <Elaine> it doesn't round correctly?
[03:41:32] <sunfish> it doesn't round according to float or double rules
[03:41:50] <Elaine> interesting, I need to revise my understanding of x87
[03:42:00] <FreeFull> The x86 FPU defaults to 80-bit internal precision, though

[04:00:42] <aatch> Quxxy, NZ. Aren't you in Australia?
[04:00:51] <Quxxy> aatch: Aye
[04:01:19] <Quxxy> But a quick search revealed vague references to something in the UK with a similar slogan
[04:01:34] <Quxxy> And I'd assumed it was (like many things), just another US export
[04:01:50] <eddyb> http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4798
[04:01:52] <Quxxy> Though I'm now curious if you know who Big Kev is
[04:01:59] <eddyb> NP=P?
[04:02:45] <scott> eddyb: It says "non-Turing paradigm" so their "polynomial time" might not mean P.
[04:02:56] <aatch> Quxxy, doesn't ring a bell.
[04:03:04] <Quxxy> Ah well
[04:03:14] <Quxxy> He was a fat guy who sold cleaning products on TV
[04:03:28] <Quxxy> He was quite possibly *the* most energetic person in the country
[04:03:37] <eddyb> scott: yeah, I don't know if P in NP =? P requires Turing machines
[04:03:45] <Quxxy> ... until he died, of course.  He slowed down *a lot* after that
[04:03:53] <eddyb> but it should have the same practical implications
[04:04:14] <scott> The P means polynomial time on a deterministic Turing machine and NP means polynomial time on a non-deterministic Turing machine iirc.
[04:04:36] <eddyb> huh
[04:04:51] <eddyb> I thought NP meant simply "non-polynomial"
[04:05:15] <Elaine> No, nondeterministic polynomial-time
[04:05:44] <Elaine> It's obviously unknown how much time it takes, in general :P
[04:05:47] <aatch> eddyb, ah, I saw that. The problem, it turns out, is that while you can *compute* the answer in polynomial time, but reading the answer is NP.
[04:06:30] <aatch> It basically moves from one NP problem to a different NP problem.

[06:57:37] <eddyb> 1-10
[06:57:39] <eddyb> 5 to pass
[06:57:41] <benh> which is better
[06:57:50] <benh> 1 or 10
[06:57:56] <eddyb> take a guess :P
[06:58:04] <benh> Do you get details on how you fucked up CS?
[06:58:07] <eddyb> which is better, HB10 or HB1?

[06:58:29] <eddyb> I looked at the "barem" which is like the grading "logic"

[06:58:45] <eddyb> modulo minor mistakes
[06:58:56] <eddyb> 9.60 at worst if I were stupid
[06:59:20] <eddyb> 8.70 mostly means someone has only formal *training* and can't actually read code
[06:59:45] <eddyb> that or I am blind and I read everything wrong
[06:59:56] <benh> I guess TAs not knowing C++ isn't unheard of

[07:01:29] <benh> idk
[07:01:43] <benh> most grading in germany goes from 1 to 6, where 1 is best and uh 4 is the passing grade i think
[07:02:02] <benh> but for high school leaving certs it's 1 to 15 where 15 is best and i don't remember the passing grade

[07:03:49] <benh> yeah i wouldn't be surprised
[07:04:08] <eddyb> (which change your grade if the difference between the original grade and the new evaluation is at least 0.5)
[07:04:45] <benh> my babby C++ course for physicists marked me down two whole points!! because the TAs didn't know that 'unsigned' is a valid type and that 'new T()' would zero-initialize the new object even for primitive Ts

[08:50:11] <Quxxy> Just blindly stumbling into things until it explodes and set their house on fire
[08:51:09] <kimundi> Mutabah: Heh. Reminds me of my Rust-C++ comparison where I accidentally truncated the length of an array to a byte on C++ side and wondered why it was so damn fast :P
[08:51:28] <Mutabah> kimundi: I've spent three days on this
[08:51:43] <kimundi> Quxxy: *shrug* Its inconceivable to me as well.
[08:53:01] <Quxxy> kimundi: Incidentally, the ffi binding generator is probably stalled until I work up the stomach to go diving into rustc's guts again
[08:53:11] <kimundi> Quxxy: Heh
[08:55:15] <kimundi> Quxxy: I'm currently toying around with ideas about an improved manual C/C++ FFI by having a cpp! { #include <stdio> #include <rust> ... } macro that autogenerates a cpp file per module set up so that you get extern function s that call into the C/C++ code on Rust side
[08:56:18] <Quxxy> So embed the C->C++ translation layer in the Rust code?
[08:57:31] <kimundi> Yeah. Initially it would do the same as build.rs + gcc-rs, but long term it could get the codegen closer together to enable stuff like cross-language inlining
[08:58:24] <Quxxy> Could that's just be done by having gcc-rs support clang? :P
[08:58:39] <kimundi> It would be a workable fallback solution if we never get a good automatic C++ - Rust FFI layer that, say, works by exposing C++ classes as trait objects or so
[08:59:13] <Quxxy> I'm not sure how this is significantly better than just having an embedded C++ library that exposes a C api
[08:59:18] <kimundi> Quxxy: It already does :). It just calls $CC, set that to clang beforehand it it compiles with it instead
[08:59:54] <kimundi> Quxxy: Well, the idea is to be a bit more hassle-free by needing to write the minim amount of glue code locally
[09:00:26] <Quxxy> But... you still have to write the glue code
[09:00:41] <kimundi> Wether or nopt it actually works in practice is a different question of course, haven't done enough C++ dev to know that yet :P

[09:01:33] <kimundi> Quxxy: The compiler could start generating more of the glue code for you over time accessible via a autogenerated #include <rust>
[09:02:28] <kimundi> say, but autoexposing C++ types and functions corresponding to what is visible in the current Rust module
[09:02:44] <eddyb> kimundi: don't overthink it
[09:03:05] <kimundi> [[rust_fii]] extern void foo (rust::ref_slice s) { cout << s << endl; }
[09:03:10] <eddyb> putting the same effort into C++ -> Rust conversion is more profitable than bindings
[09:03:17] <kimundi> eddyb: yeah yeah, its just wild speculation of possibilities here :P
[09:03:46] <eddyb> interop should be focused on moving C++ code to Rust, one class at a time, or something
[09:04:01] <kimundi> I'm aware that you can do the conversion from both side, and I'm just thinking about which one might be more useful

[09:39:44] <kimundi> So far, at least
[09:40:40] <niconii> probably because of borrow-checking, it's pretty much rust's killer feature
[09:41:12] <niconii> i think "worse is better" is probably the reason, as wrl says
[09:41:23] <kimundi> well, the community and working package manager and openness of developers are also big features imo

[09:47:10] <kimundi> heh, yeah
[09:47:13] <Quxxy> And that's *with* the advantage of the primary author having his own C++ compiler on hand
[09:47:24] <Quxxy> *And* with a template system that's a strict superset of C++'s
[09:47:32] <Quxxy> *And* they have classes.  *And* overloading
[09:49:17] <niconii> direct interop with C++ might be a long shot, yeah...
[09:49:19] <kimundi> Maybe that just really means that its easier to define the interop from C/C++ side out

[09:56:56] <bluss> you can use [T; 0] for alignment. Pretty sure it's in the implementation defined territory though
[09:57:12] <benh> oh that's neat

[09:58:11] <bluss> for a dst struct,  struct Foo<T> { header: Header, data: T };  Foo<[T; 0]> will have correct size & alignment to let you set up the allocation manually

[11:26:18] <amstrad> already lost me 
[11:26:23] <eddyb_> a type constructor (e.g. for<T> Option<T>)
[11:26:37] <amstrad> k wait
[11:26:42] <amstrad> type constructor?
[11:26:45] <eddyb_> a value constructor (e.g. for<T> Some: T -> Option<T>)
[11:27:26] <eddyb_> and a transformation (e.g. for<T, U> (Option<T>, T -> Option<U>) -> Option<U>)
[11:27:40] <amstrad> eddybk wait
[11:27:40] <eddyb_> (that last one is Option::and_then)
[11:27:56] <amstrad> the transformation is mapping from one function to the next ? as in a bind?
[11:28:04] <eddyb_> the transformation is bind
[11:28:07] <eddyb_> aka >>=
[11:28:16] <amstrad> eddyb: so, its preforming a "map" of sorts?
[11:28:19] <eddyb_> amstrad: no, it's mapping from one wrapped value to another
[11:28:28] <eddyb_> well

[11:28:57] <eddyb_> like Some(x)
[11:29:06] <eddyb_> I am not being very coherent
[11:29:15] <amstrad> eddyb_: do we assume in the monad case that values are wrapped in monads, and the bind maps from monad A to monad B?
[11:29:21] <eddyb_> amstrad: a monad wraps values *conceptually*
[11:29:32] <eddyb_> bind maps the inner type, the monad stays the same
[11:29:49] <amstrad> eddyb_: so, maps a int to a string?
[11:29:59] <eddyb_> ugh
[11:30:09] <amstrad> or maps a int to Monad<int> ?
[11:30:21] <eddyb_> let me try to come up with a stricter definition
[11:30:31] <eddyb_> a monad is a generic type M<T>
[11:30:44] <eddyb_> with a way to construct a M<T> value from a T value (T -> M<T>)
[11:31:10] <amstrad> eddyb_: so, a constructor would achieve this
[11:31:39] <eddyb_> yes, M is called a type constructor
[11:31:46] <eddyb_> and T -> M<T> is what I call a value constructor
[11:32:01] <eddyb_> it's Some for Option, Ok for Result, etc.
[11:32:24] <amstrad> ok, Some, Ok == type constructors
[11:32:36] <eddyb_> no
[11:32:37] <amstrad> Option, Result = M<T>
[11:32:41] <eddyb_> those are value constructors
[11:32:47] <eddyb_> type constructor makes a type from another type
[11:32:50] <amstrad> sorry, yes, thats what i meant
[11:32:59] <amstrad> Some, Ok == value constructors
[11:33:08] <amstrad> Option, Result = M<T> 
[11:33:19] <amstrad> analogies are good
[11:33:25] <eddyb_> for<T> Result<T, E> is a M
[11:33:40] <eddyb_> type M<T> = Result<T, SomeConcreteError>;
[11:33:50] <eddyb_> so the `bind` operation doesn't change the error type
[11:34:13] <amstrad> alright
[11:34:31] <eddyb_> bind is and_then in both cases in Rust
[11:34:50] <amstrad> bind is a continuation ?
[11:35:11] <eddyb_> allows access to the wrapped value and lets you chain a new value from the same monad
[11:35:15] <eddyb_> amstrad: kinda
[11:35:16] <amstrad> so, bind(M<T>, M<U>); ?
[11:35:20] <eddyb_> no
[11:35:36] <eddyb_> bind takes a M<T> and a T -> M<U> function (or closure)
[11:35:51] <amstrad> so, bind(M<T> method); ?
[11:36:01] <amstrad> where method is...
[11:36:05] <amstrad> method(u:U)
[11:36:25] <eddyb_> you have it reversed :/
[11:36:26] <amstrad> or, does U have to be T?
[11:36:36] <eddyb_> in the case of Option, you have
[11:36:41] <amstrad> bind(method, M<T>); ?
[11:36:58] <eddyb_> and_then(Option<T>, T -> Option<U>) -> Option<U>
[11:37:09] <eddyb_> amstrad: reversed as in, returns something with U, doesn't take U
[11:37:43] <amstrad> eddyb_: so, whats the point to all this?
[11:37:57] <amstrad> what are monads really expressing here?
[11:38:22] <eddyb_> amstrad: wrappers
[11:38:29] <eddyb_> *composable* wrappers
[11:38:42] <eddyb_> Option and Result are simple
[11:38:47] <amstrad> eddyb_: can i put forth a concrete example?
[11:38:57] <amstrad> method1(a: string) -> void
[11:39:00] <eddyb_> amstrad: but any vector/list/set is also a monad
[11:39:17] <amstrad> method2(a: int) -> void
[11:39:24] <eddyb_> why do you use "method"?
[11:39:29] <eddyb_> those are two simple functions
[11:39:34] <amstrad> well, i want to compose them
[11:39:43] <eddyb_> in the case of a collection, the closure passed to `bind` gets executed multiple times
[11:39:55] <eddyb_> I guess iterators are a good example
[11:40:10] <amstrad> like a map ? or reduce?
[11:40:13] <eddyb_> neither
[11:40:20] <eddyb_> if you had a single M<T> = Box<Iterator<Item = T>> type
[11:40:38] <eddyb_> then flat_map on that would be bind
[11:40:52] <eddyb_> (if the closure takes a T and returns a M<U>)
[11:41:21] <eddyb_> bind on Vec would be self.into_iter().flat_map(|x| closure(x).into_iter()).collect::<Vec<_>>()
[11:41:25] <amstrad> eddyb_: flat map being "take the inner value out of this thing" ?
[11:41:38] <eddyb_> amstrad: flat_map expands each element into a sub-iterator
[11:41:55] <eddyb_> and the resulting iterator is basically all those sub-iterators, chained together

[11:43:23] <eddyb_> C#/LINQ use weird names, just like Ruby
[11:43:32] <amstrad> eddyb_: yeah, thats the one
[11:43:35] <eddyb_> Ruby has smalltalk heritage, LINQ is trying to be SQL or something
[11:43:44] <amstrad> heh, kinda
[11:44:57] <eddyb_> in Haskell, a [T] list is a monad, I believe
[11:44:59] <amstrad> eddyb_: the explanations of monads are very long winded, and likely describe things i have seen and used before, there is clearly a concept in there somewhere, and a win to knowing all about them, 
[11:45:03] <eddyb_> and bind on it does the flatmap thing
[11:45:21] <eddyb_> amstrad: it's an abstraction that capture a common wrapper pattern
[11:45:54] <eddyb_> *captures
[11:46:02] <eddyb_> amstrad: it's not magical and it's not omnipotent
[11:46:11] <eddyb_> amstrad: now, in Haskell, there's the IO monad
[11:46:21] <eddyb_> which is like a "future"
[11:46:26] <eddyb_> for impure operations
[11:46:46] <eddyb_> you cannot just execute the impure operation, but you chain it
[11:47:10] <eddyb_> you can think as all things IO producing a command buffer of syscalls
[11:47:33] <eddyb_> which is executed outside of Haskell code
[11:47:48] <eddyb_> that's not the case because GHC is cheating :P
[11:48:07] <eddyb_> but it's a good way to view it, I think
[11:48:28] <eddyb_> amstrad: so IO doesn't hold any value inside, just a description of how to produce the value with an impure operation
[11:48:43] <eddyb_> and you need this contortion to isolate impurity
[11:49:20] <amstrad> eddyb_: yeah
[11:49:23] *** Quits: yjv (yjv@moz-ll38tk.pa.comcast.net) (Connection closed)
[11:50:06] <eddyb_> thanks to laziness, you can create an infinite chain of these futures
[11:50:12] <eddyb_> an event loop, if you will
[11:50:30] <amstrad> eddyb_: still rather confused about a lot of this, is a monad a data structure?
[11:50:35] <eddyb_> I personally think pure functional programming doesn't have a place in the mainstream
[11:50:43] <eddyb_> amstrad: Monad is a trait
[11:50:50] <eddyb_> (a type class in Haskell)
[11:50:59] <eddyb_> amstrad: it's HKT so you can't write in Rust yet
[11:51:10] <eddyb_> amstrad: there are various "implementations" ("instances" in Haskell)
[11:51:28] <eddyb_> Option, Result in Rust. Maybe, Either, lists, IO etc. in Haskell
[11:51:35] <eddyb_> each of those is a monad
[11:51:46] <Havvy> Result is technically two monads...
[11:51:47] <amstrad> eddyb_: with a different implmentation for each?
[11:52:00] <Havvy> With a different implementation for each, yes.
[11:52:03] <eddyb_> and operations occur between the same monad (applied with different "element" types)
[11:52:05] <eddyb_> amstrad: yeah
[11:52:19] <amstrad> so, there is no "atomic" one size fits all for a monad then
[11:52:34] <Havvy> amstrad:  "monad" is like "iterator"
[11:52:51] <amstrad> Havvy: monad is also like future
[11:53:08] <Havvy> Future implements Monad.
[11:53:40] <amstrad> Havvy: are there any instances of a monad that isn't a iterator?
[11:53:59] <Havvy> Result
[11:54:00] <eddyb_> amstrad: it's hard to iterate monads though
[11:54:32] <Havvy> Isn't Box<T> monadic?
[11:54:36] <amstrad> Havvy: so a monad "might" be like "iterator"
[11:54:40] <eddyb_> you can implement "for each" by just calling bind with |x| { callback(x); construct(()) }
[11:54:48] <amstrad> a monad can be anything
[11:54:51] <eddyb_> Havvy: yeah, that too
[11:55:02] <eddyb_> I have a P<T> type that has a monadic interface
[11:55:06] <eddyb_> it's an immutable Box<T>
[11:55:08] <amstrad> ^ you can see where the confusion resides when literally anything could be a monad
[11:55:23] <eddyb_> amstrad: that's the point
[11:55:25] <Havvy> amstrad:  Monad is like Iterable/Iterator in that they're generic concepts where what it means to Iterate over depends on the type itself.
[11:55:30] <eddyb_> "monad" is like "iterator" or "collection"
[11:55:32] <eddyb_> or "wrapper"
[11:55:36] <eddyb_> lots of things are those
[11:55:50] <amstrad> do two monads compose ?
[11:55:52] <eddyb_> heck, most generic types could be monads
[11:55:55] <Havvy> It's a collection of methods with specific signatures.
[11:56:03] <eddyb_> amstrad: maybe, but I'm not sure in what conditions
[11:56:20] <eddyb_> [Result<T>] -> Result<[U]> is a good test
[11:56:26] <eddyb_> sorry, Option
[11:56:31] <eddyb_> Result is trickier
[11:56:44] <eddyb_> Havvy: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/libsyntax/ptr.rs#L62-L66
[11:56:53] <amstrad> eddyb_: well, if a monad must fit a set of criteria in order to be a monad, if monads compose, it would mean anything that conforms to a monad specification would compose
[11:56:54] <Havvy> eddyb_:  [Result<T, E>] -> Result<[T], E> exists via collect.
[11:57:10] <amstrad> hense, there is a win for monads
[11:57:43] <amstrad> eddyb_: so, if things compose, then the study of monads is really the study of composable softwares
[11:58:10] <amstrad> with a monad being a specification on how a thing should compose
[11:58:18] <amstrad> (without thinking about all the ways a thing can compose)
[11:58:19] <eddyb_> Result::and_then(result, |option| Ok(Option::and_then(option, |value| Some(value)))) you can do this... but that's just nesting
[11:58:26] <eddyb_> *shrug*
[11:58:31] <amstrad> eddyb_: ^ would these statements be true?
[11:58:46] <Havvy> I've had a hard time with monadic composition in both JS and Rust personally.
[11:59:05] <eddyb_> amstrad: they're confusing
[11:59:21] <amstrad> eddyb_: i could see merit to monads if they were a specification for ensuring composibility
[11:59:31] <eddyb_> that's not what they are
[11:59:45] <eddyb_> they're specifically chainable within the same monad
[11:59:58] <amstrad> not different monads ?
[12:00:22] <amstrad> eddyb_: but, couldn't you reduce a iteractor monad to a Result monad ?
[12:00:27] <amstrad> *iterator
[12:00:48] <amstrad> or a maybe monad or whatever
[12:01:22] <eddyb_> amstrad: there are things for composing two specific monads
[12:01:26] <eddyb_> but that's not the intention
[12:01:40] <amstrad> eddyb_: is it just FP fappery?
[12:01:55] <eddyb_> well, with purity IO is kinda necessary
[12:02:04] <eddyb_> and the other monads are also pretty handy

[12:02:31] <eddyb_> but monads as a concept is not that relevant outside of pure FP
[12:02:49] <amstrad> eddyb_: without monadic ideals, there wouldn't be LINQ in C#
[12:03:12] <amstrad> where i see a bunch of Enumerable<T> and yeilds, someone saw something "
[12:03:16] <amstrad> monadic"
[12:03:22] <eddyb_> meh
[12:03:51] <eddyb_> the fact that Haskell has monads is as relevant as the fact that Rust has iterators
[12:04:00] <eddyb_> it's just a thing they use
[12:04:11] <eddyb_> there's worse parts of Haskell
[12:04:26] <eddyb_> composing functions is a hell I do not want to partake in
[12:04:27] <amstrad> eddyb_: so, porting monads to Rust or other languages is maybe not the best idea
[12:04:32] <Havvy> Haskell uses the fact that monads exist to save on function names.
[12:04:35] <eddyb_> amstrad: Rust has monads
[12:04:46] <amstrad> Result, Option and the like?
[12:04:55] <Havvy> Yes.
[12:04:59] <eddyb_> it doesn't have HKT so you can't write a Monad trait to be generic over monads
[12:05:02] <Havvy> It just doesn't reify Monad into a type.
[12:05:06] <amstrad> but how are they monads?
[12:05:19] <eddyb_> they have a value constructor and and_then methods
[12:05:21] <Havvy> They are Monads because they implement the method signature for monads.
[12:05:23] <eddyb_> that's enough to make them monads
[12:05:28] <delma> If it quaks like a monad...
[12:05:35] <Havvy> eddyb_:  There's also another method...
[12:05:37] <eddyb_> but Iterator::flat_map isn't technically a monad
[12:05:43] <eddyb_> Havvy: return and bind, what else?
[12:05:45] <Havvy> "map"?
[12:06:02] <eddyb_> that's a composition of bind and return
[12:06:07] <amstrad> Havvy: so, is a Promise<T> in js a monad?
[12:06:11] <eddyb_> I forget exactly how it goes in haskell
[12:06:13] <eddyb_> amstrad: yes
[12:06:13] <Havvy> amstrad:  Yes.
[12:06:25] <amstrad> it has a continuation
[12:06:32] <amstrad> it has a value
[12:06:38] <eddyb_> but map(x, f) is bind(x, \y -> return(f(y)))
[12:06:38] <Havvy> It's `return` is called `then`.
[12:06:40] <amstrad> and some way to construct ir
[12:06:50] <amstrad> so, therefore its a monad
[12:06:51] <eddyb_> Havvy: isn't `then` `and_then`?
[12:07:03] <Havvy> eddyb_:  Yes.
[12:07:09] <eddyb_> that's bind, not return
[12:07:12] <Havvy> Oh.
[12:07:19] <eddyb_> return is the value constructor
[12:07:21] <eddyb_> T -> M<T>
[12:07:22] * Havvy blames Haskellers for choosing such terrible names.
[12:07:32] <eddyb_> Some and Ok are return
[12:07:34] <Havvy> Isn't there a `lift` operator needed too?
[12:07:36] <amstrad> is.... var func = createfunc(123); func(); // outputs 123 
[12:07:41] <amstrad> ^ this a monad?
[12:07:42] <eddyb_> Havvy: what would lift do?
[12:07:50] <eddyb_> amstrad: not really
[12:07:53] <eddyb_> amstrad: you need types

[12:08:57] <eddyb_> our Iterator::flat_map is more flexible than a monad
[12:09:00] <Havvy> eddyb_:  He's asking if it implements `Monad`, and no, I don't see it implementing that interface.
[12:09:09] <eddyb_> so monads are less useful in Rust
[12:09:34] <eddyb_> Rust doesn't need monads. HKT would be useful for other things
[12:10:01] <amstrad> eddyb_: is this a monad ? http://pastebin.com/syJAGsR0
[12:10:04] <eddyb_> (like an algorithm that works on Vec, HashSet, BTreeSet, etc.)
[12:10:07] <amstrad> it has the types

[12:12:23] <eddyb_> amstrad: (Action<T>, T -> Action<U>) -> Action<U> is the signature
[12:12:29] <amstrad> eddyb_: all its doing is allowing me to pass a "string" to a method that accepts a int
[12:12:41] <eddyb_> you have (Action<U>, T -> U) -> Action<T> which is nonsensical
[12:12:48] <eddyb_> amstrad: that has nothing to do with monads
[12:12:59] <eddyb_> amstrad: that's function composition

[12:13:09] <eddyb_> which is common as heck
[12:13:17] <eddyb_> (and makes Haskell a nightmare)
[12:13:17] * amstrad is a commoner
[12:13:34] <eddyb_> amstrad: your composition thing is more common than monads

[12:50:15] * Quxxy starts riot before the chariot race has even started
[12:50:16] <amstrad> people, this doesn't bring us any closer to deciphering the mysteries of the monad
[12:50:43] <duncan> i think we are getting closer
[12:50:51] <fkaa> what would be good to put on a gfx-rs site?

[12:51:19] <fkaa> i'm worse than a salmon at web design
[12:51:25] <amstrad> duncan: i thought i was getting pretty close with http://pastebin.com/LLXf8h9R, but i think it blew a few minds and never got a response
[12:53:03] <ijks> ok so basically, a monad is... crap I can't explain it
[12:53:30] <amstrad> ijks: its a thing alright, 
[12:54:05] <duncan> ok, so we've established that monads are: 1) a thing 2) incomprehensible...I think we are done here, let's go home everyone
[12:54:17] <ijks> just read 'You could have invented monads'
[12:54:37] <duncan> something something category of endofunctors
[12:55:08] <niconii> we're sure monads exist, right
[12:55:22] <niconii> this isn't just some extremely elaborate practical joke started by haskellers or anything
[12:55:40] <ijks> well I haven't learned Haskell for nothing, right?
[12:56:00] <duncan> niconii: we have already established they are "a thing"
[12:56:08] <duncan> now, whether it is an imaginary "thing" or not, IDK
[12:56:15] <ijks> but monads exist just as much as π does
[12:56:16] <delma> "There is small monad inside all of you. You just have to *believe*"
[12:56:22] <amstrad> niconii: they are a description of a "thing" with certain traits on it
[12:56:24] <duncan> ijks: you might have...
[12:56:37] <amstrad> or put another way, anything can be a monad if it has these characteristics
[12:56:41] <delma> well tau is better
[12:58:10] <amstrad> so, to understand a monad, perhaps one needs to write a thing with monad specifications, and stare at it for a while?
[12:58:26] <amstrad> wondering what it does
[12:58:43] <ijks> well understanding 'a' monad doesn't mean that much
[12:58:55] <fkaa> tau?
[12:59:32] <ijks> understanding the monad typeclass, that's the hard part
[12:59:34] <delma> If monad is trai, what does it allow implementor to do?
[12:59:43] <delma> traitL
[12:59:45] <delma> *
[12:59:54] <amstrad> delma: no idea
[13:00:01] <amstrad> it wasn't elaborated on
[13:00:08] <delma> tau us one whole rotation
[13:00:38] <ijks> well basically if have a type called M<T>, and M is a monad, that means that I apply functions on that T that is contained by the M
[13:01:15] <ijks> ... it makes sense if you just read the Haskell definition of it, really
[13:01:22] <benh> that's functors >:U
[13:01:25] <ijks> yeah
[13:01:58] <ijks> I mean, I was going to explain the other stuff that doesn't make a Monad *just* a Functor but then my brain died
[13:02:10] <delma> xD
[13:02:22] <benh> There also doesn't have to be an actual T in there, I dunno
[13:02:29] <ijks> let's just go full circle and say that monads are burritos and they taste very good
[13:02:51] <benh> Monads are basically machinery for chaining computations in an abstract enough way that you can define lots of generic helpers, idk
[13:02:54] <amstrad> benh: T's are important for monads
[13:02:56] <ijks> benh: don't monads always have to be of kind * -> * though?
[13:03:22] <benh> no, I mean, sure there has to be a type parameter, but in a given value of m X, there doesn't have to be an actual X inside
[13:03:31] <delma> Monad is kinda like Quartinenion (the 4 dimensional rotation thingymabob)
[13:03:41] <delma> as hard to undertand
[13:03:49] <ijks> you mean Quaternions
[13:03:55] <ijks> and yeah quaternions are weird
[13:04:01] <benh> like getLine :: IO String but there isn't a String stored inside that function >:U
[13:04:10] <amstrad> i understand Quaternions
[13:04:24] <amstrad> imaginary numbers
[13:04:44] <amstrad> Hamilton was clever, he carved his equations on a bridge somewhere (Scotland iirc)
[13:05:10] <amstrad> imaginary numbers are easier to grasp than monad
[13:05:12] <amstrad> s
[13:05:43] <delma> Well I understand what quaternions do but same time I got no clue
[13:05:49] <delma> like monads
[13:06:48] <niconii> math is too complicated
[13:06:52] <niconii> let's just get rid of it

[13:13:13] <niconii> shopping: the one activity that definitely doesn't involve math at all, especially not prices, currency denominations, balances, tax calculations, or anything of the sort
[13:15:22] <delma> So you are saying that if you don't want to math you have to steal?
[13:17:01] <niconii> well, until you get arrested and need to figure out how much of your lifespan will be spent in jail, i guess

[23:59:08] <Layl> in fact, virtualbox is only taking up 100mb
