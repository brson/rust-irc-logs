[03:27:43] <Peach> Hey, does anyone here have a handy list of math symbols an explainations of them?
[03:27:57] <Peach> complex Math symbols are impossible to google for
[03:28:01] <Peach> and I can't find an index
[03:29:03] <Peach> seriously, people could just use short names instead of obscure symbols for math
[03:29:45] <Peach> ∑∩∪⊄∏∫  like SERIOUSLY
[03:31:50] <Peach> I can't even google "math symbol ∑"   : (
[03:34:19] <Mutabah> Peach: It's maths, what do you expect :)
[03:34:31] <Mutabah> I think wikipedia has a good list, so does the latex wikibook
[03:34:36] <Peach> I expect the most powerful scientific concept to be accessible
[03:34:40] <Peach> that's what I except
[03:34:47] <Peach> *expect
[03:35:07] <Mutabah> Let's see what I can see in that list, - Sigma = Sum, three set theory ones, unkown, and integral
[03:35:07] <c74d> Peach: if I search it in <https://codepoints.net>, it's "N-ARY SUMMATION".
[03:35:43] <c74d> IRI: <https://codepoints.net/∑>
[03:36:32] <Peach> but what about type theory which is a different math context:  " F to F^\omega"
[03:37:00] <c74d> (URI: <https://codepoints.net/%E2%88%91>)
[03:37:33] <c74d> Peach: also try searching the symbols in Wikipedia.
[03:37:38] <Mutabah> Peach: Everything has its own jargon and symbols
[03:38:05] <Mutabah> Peach: e.g. rust's use of & and * for pointers
[03:38:54] <Peach> I wanna make a symbol-less programming language save for elementary math
[03:39:23] <Peach> & for references is so obscure
[03:39:33] <Peach> and * for pointers is obscure
[03:40:25] <Peach> Rust's     '  for memory management is super obscure

[05:25:28] <GBGamer> mwahahahaha! I am back!
[05:26:34] <GBGamer> hello everybody
[05:27:48] <c74d> Hello.
[05:29:33] <Peach> I'm gonna use "ref" for pointer synta
[05:29:34] <Peach> x
[05:29:38] <Peach> short for reference
[05:29:42] *** Quits: eerie (eerie@moz-ru7.rf4.64.109.IP) (Connection closed)
[05:30:09] <c74d> I think I was too.
[05:30:13] <GBGamer> I'm using & for pointers
[05:30:28] <GBGamer> because you take a reference using &, so &(int) => &int
[05:31:26] <c74d> (well, `Ref` at the time, but I since switched to not capitalizing type names)
[05:32:18] <niconii> Peach: hmm, sounds confusing from the perspective of a rust programmer, since rust also uses "ref" for something that's similar but not quite the same
[05:33:00] <GBGamer> I don't really understand the logic behind not having a pointer be a sigil
[05:33:09] <GBGamer> Peach: could you explain it to me?
[05:33:11] <c74d> Rust using `ref` to... destructure references, right?
[05:33:13] <c74d> *uses
[05:33:29] <GBGamer> c74d: it creates a reference in destructuring
[05:33:51] <niconii> in rust, matching Some(Structures(ref x)) with Some(Structures(123)) makes x a reference to that 123 inside the structures
[05:33:59] <c74d> GBGamer: the meaning is more obvious, which is a design goal of Peach's programming language.
[05:34:17] <c74d> oh, 'k.
[05:34:36] <GBGamer> c74d: but isn't the meaning obvious after programming for a small amount of time?
[05:34:53] <GBGamer> Or do I just not remember the difficulty because I've been programming so long?
[05:36:13] <c74d> It was to me at least, I don't know about other people. I think Peach wants their language to be obvious even to people with no programming experience, though.
[05:36:46] <GBGamer> well, I mean, pointers at all are a confusing prospect for beginners
[05:37:03] <GBGamer> they're surprisingly non-obvious
[05:37:21] <c74d> However, I don't think that people with no programming experience would recognize `ref` as meaning "reference", or -- that, necessarily understand the concept.
[05:38:03] <GBGamer> maybe I've just always used sigil-ptr languages, so I don't mind
[05:40:17] <GBGamer> rrgh
[05:40:32] <GBGamer> writing a parser is unsurprisingly difficult
[05:52:41] <swgillespie> try! is the parser-writer's godsend

[06:02:09] <Mutabah> I had one from a while ago, last I checked I had broken it by changing to postfix types

[06:02:39] <GBGamer> and yet I can't even implement the main function :/
[06:02:45] <swgillespie> haha
[06:02:47] <swgillespie> compilers are hard
[06:03:01] <swgillespie> you can't define your own types in my language. :/

[06:04:04] <GBGamer> one sec, let me get the notebook
[06:04:17] <GBGamer> (I wrote the spec on a plane)
[06:04:34] <swgillespie> haha
[06:05:04] <GBGamer> turns out, seven hours of doing nothing does wonders for your creativity :P
[06:05:48] <GBGamer> anyways, it basically takes out all the annoyances that I have with rust, and takes out RAII and borrowck
[06:06:50] <GBGamer> it also adds unsized struct definition
[06:07:03] <c74d> Rust without borrowck? D:
[06:07:41] <GBGamer> and defined enums
[06:08:18] <GBGamer> where enum { variant, variant } becomes (big enough integer)
[06:08:42] <GBGamer> enum { variant(type)*, variant } become struct { (big enough integer), (union) }
[06:09:22] <GBGamer> traits are similar to Rust, I think?
[06:09:39] <GBGamer> I haven't actually done any work/research to figure out better systems
[06:11:10] <GBGamer> and then you have generics, which I'm actually pretty proud of, and is actually fairly unique, I think
[06:11:42] <GBGamer> c74d: I never used Rust for the borrowck :P
[06:11:59] <GBGamer> (the syntax is not final, but:
[06:12:32] <GBGamer> generic<T> enum Option { None, Some(T) }
[06:12:46] <GBGamer> which is just the generic, used for non-specialized types
[06:13:03] <GBGamer> then, in type modules, you can define specializations
[06:14:11] <GBGamer> specialize Option<NonZero<T>> { None = T::Zero, Some(NonZero<T>) }
[06:14:40] <GBGamer> or for structs:
[06:16:34] <GBGamer> generic<T> struct Vec { ptr: &own T, len: usize, cap: usize } impl Vec<T> { pub fn push(...) {...} }

[06:18:41] <GBGamer> the syntax really needs work
[06:18:48] <GBGamer> but the idea, I think, is there
[06:19:25] <GBGamer> oh, and enums can also be enum { v1 = (T), v2 = (T), ... vN = (T), v(T) }
[06:19:33] <GBGamer> where (T) would be a literal of type T
[06:19:50] <GBGamer> which would just make that enum == T
[06:20:06] <GBGamer> which is where the NonZero thing comes from
[06:21:23] <GBGamer> oh, and there's &, &mut, and &own
[06:21:48] *** Quits: eerie (eerie@moz-ru7.rf4.64.109.IP) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[06:21:48] <GBGamer> & and &mut are pretty much equal to *const and *mut in Rust
[06:22:02] <GBGamer> &own is pretty much a Unique<T>
[06:22:11] <GBGamer> but I thought it should be a real type
[06:22:20] <swgillespie> without a borrow checker?
[06:22:54] <GBGamer> swgillespie: well, I'm pretty sure it'll eventually have a borrow checker
[06:23:19] <GBGamer> I just haven't actually built it yet
[06:24:05] <GBGamer> and I won't build it until pretty late, probably, because it's probably difficult
[06:24:39] <GBGamer> I wouldn't even know where to start
[06:24:57] <swgillespie> it's definitely difficult, haha. although the borrowck docs are really great in the rust compiler

[06:28:06] <GBGamer> and better enums

[06:29:29] <c74d> You like safety, yet you want to delete the borrow checker?
[06:29:34] <GBGamer> actually, honestly, I don't really like Lisp

[06:30:03] <GBGamer> it's so pretty
[06:30:21] <Zoxc> c74d: That's why I added the GC
[06:31:35] <c74d> My programming language concept has the conceit that its syntax is "purer" than Lisp's, in the way that Lisp syntax is typically said to be "pure" (in that all syntax is supposedly equal).
[06:32:15] <GBGamer> how is its syntax purer than Lisp's?

[07:22:37] <Astraea> well... rust has them, but I'm thinking of elixir atm
[07:22:46] <Astraea> *has them in some areas
[07:23:44] <GBGamer> what makes elixir so good for guard clauses
[07:24:08] <Astraea> def function(a) where a > 0 do
[07:24:17] <Quxxy> GBGamer: Looks like my occasional use of match match x { ... } { ... }

[07:24:47] <GBGamer> Quxxy: lol yeah
[07:24:50] <Astraea> if a <= 0 then that function doesn
[07:24:57] <Astraea> *doesn't run
[07:25:24] <GBGamer> does it throw an exception?
[07:25:24] <Astraea> you can overload the function and make one for <= 0, or a default if nothing else sticks
[07:25:37] <Astraea> def function(a) do
[07:25:51] <GBGamer> oh so like a match but in the top level
[07:25:51] <Astraea> that one would get run if a <= 0
[07:26:08] <Astraea> I think an exception is raised if there is no match
[07:26:10] <Astraea> yeah
[07:26:14] <GBGamer> doesn't Haskell have something like that?
[07:26:32] <Astraea> it's pretty much just syntactic sugar
[07:27:14] <GBGamer> yeah, but it's pretty nice syntactic sugar
[07:27:19] <Astraea> indeed
[07:27:39] <Astraea> I still wouldn't mind seeing something like that in rust

[07:31:29] <Astraea> if they can ensure all branches are accounted for in a match, why not for functions?
[07:31:53] <GBGamer> hmm
[07:31:57] <GBGamer> yeah, I can see it
[07:32:12] <GBGamer> I wouldn't mind it, I guess

[07:37:34] <GBGamer> damn these sewing machines
[07:38:03] <cyndis> rustc can only ensure a match is complete in very few cases though
[07:41:07] <cyndis> in general, it's undecidable
[07:42:09] <GBGamer> would be nice for enum impls tho
[07:43:08] <cyndis> yeah, for just pattern matching, it should be fine

[08:43:23] <GBGamer> you must use unsafe

[08:43:49] <GBGamer> cyndis: what's wrong with .chars()?
[08:44:09] <cyndis> it is wrong if you intended to iterate by human visible characters
[08:44:43] <GBGamer> ah, I guess that is true
[08:44:48] <cyndis> (graphemes. then again, using just graphemes() might also be wrong depending on what you are doing..)

[15:40:22] <WindowsBunny> eddyb: Rust can be used on Windows, so it is real
[15:40:36] <Tiffany> if the mill gets popular enough there will be windows on mill
[15:40:45] <WindowsBunny> Tiffany: But until then it isn't real
[15:40:49] <eddyb> Tiffany: not a necessary condition
[15:41:08] <Tiffany> I mean, historically NT has run on lots of architectures
[15:41:16] <Tiffany> alpha, ARM, powerPC, x86, itanium
[15:41:30] <Tiffany> it would not be an optimal fit for the mill though
[15:41:36] <Tiffany> the mill is designed for running microkernels really fast
[15:41:57] <eddyb> has anyone hooked up qemu to LLVM yet :D?
[15:43:16] <WindowsBunny> and NT is pretty massive
[15:43:38] <eddyb> Tiffany: I expect x86 code to run on the Mill before we see any hardware
[15:43:43] <dw> eddyb: i can't imagine that would end well
[15:43:52] <eddyb> I mean, all you need is the sim to start experimenting with it
[15:44:35] <Tiffany> I'm not sure JITing x86 to mill would work out that well
[15:44:37] <eddyb> dw: sure, it would have terrible warm-up times
[15:44:49] <eddyb> Tiffany: you can cache the results ;)
[15:44:52] <Tiffany> there have been previous attempts to JIT or microcode VLIWs to run x86
[15:45:09] <Tiffany> the performance characteristics are different, which throws off a lot of optimized software
[15:45:10] <eddyb> so it's more like what Android does, than a JIT
[15:45:31] <Tiffany> and it also has that tradeoff between accuracy and performance
[15:46:05] <Tiffany> not only that, but you actually need to deal with the fact x86 has OoO and the mill does not
[15:46:11] <Tiffany> you'd have to have a pretty complex compiler
[15:46:17] <dw> eddyb: qemu's soft emulation is mostly there to remind you to get real hardware. it sounds like adding llvm to the mix would just also make it a bitch to compile :P
[15:46:19] <eddyb> Mill gives you branch predictor data, which means PGO could be applicable
[15:46:25] <eddyb> dw: lol
[15:46:30] <Tiffany> you'd have to reverse x86 into a higher-level form and then compile it into mill

[15:48:55] <Tiffany> yep, transmeta
[15:49:03] <Tiffany> but it's a good compatibility shim, I guess
[15:49:13] <eddyb> well, there is an upside to doing this, if the performance it at least half-decent
[15:49:37] <eddyb> you can start porting to it
[15:49:49] <Tiffany> you can run lightweight OS instances for individual applications
[15:49:59] <Tiffany> to enforce capability architectures for applications from linux or windows
[15:50:06] <eddyb> hmmmm
[15:50:31] <eddyb> is there a middle ground between running NT in Xen, and wine?
[15:50:47] <eddyb> oh, I've mentioned this before: what if wine only implemented NT?
[15:51:06] <Tiffany> like run the real windows subsystem on top of a fake kernel?
[15:51:09] <eddyb> yupp
[15:51:27] <Tiffany> that sounds interesting, but you'd have to deal with HAL
[15:51:41] <Tiffany> I guess you could use fake drivers too
[15:51:45] <eddyb> is HAL worse than having to reimplement everything?
[15:51:52] <Tiffany> idk
[15:52:03] <Tiffany> you'd probably have to own a copy of windows to legally do this though
[15:52:29] <eddyb> it's not like WINAPI is a spec or something
[15:52:37] <eddyb> Tiffany: yeah
[15:53:26] <eddyb> that's the only plausible argument for wanting to implement every single quirk ever in what's otherwise a boring black box
[15:59:04] <mrmonday> eddyb: isn't that what reactos does?
[15:59:28] <eddyb> mrmonday: does it use windows DLLs for the userspace?
[16:00:02] <eddyb> I thought it was strictly more than wine
[16:00:36] <mrmonday> I'm not sure, I seem to recall that its primary effort is an NT compatible kernel
[16:01:05] <mrmonday> then wine or windows userspace stuff can just be dumped on top of it
[16:01:12] <eddyb> hmm
[16:01:33] <mrmonday> "The developers aim to make the kernel more compatible with Windows NT version 5.2 (Windows Server 2003), the usermode APIs with Windows NT 6.3 (Windows 8.1),[41] and to add support for more applications and hardware"
[16:01:40] <mrmonday> from wikipedia
[16:01:43] <eddyb> mrmonday: you know how qemu does userspace emulation?
[16:01:57] <mrmonday> I do not, no
[16:02:11] <eddyb> by translating linux syscalls to library calls
[16:02:40] <eddyb> AFAIK it only can do this for linux userspace apps
[16:02:49] <mrmonday> oh, here you go - https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/Wine_on_ReactOS.svg
[16:03:01] <eddyb> but if we had a qemu/ReactOS/wine hybrid...
[16:03:13] <mrmonday> diagram of how reactos works
[16:03:25] <mrmonday> that would be awesome
[16:04:12] <eddyb> I mean, you can already run x86 windows apps on ARM linux
[16:04:12] <mrmonday> although it honestly wouldn't surprise me if MS made Windows free within the next few years
[16:04:24] <eddyb> mrmonday: all that work for nothing :P
[16:04:28] <mrmonday> exactly :p
[16:04:45] <mrmonday> well, not exactly, it's nice to have open source stuff to see how things work
[16:04:56] <mrmonday> although, I wouldn't say an open source Windows is out of the question either
[16:05:01] <mrmonday> unlikely, I'd say
[16:05:11] <mrmonday> but probably within the realms of possiblity

[17:21:33] <niconii> right
[17:21:51] <eddyb> same thing goes in software, you throw out old crappy code if you can do it better

[17:25:51] <Peach> I see like no projects revolving around ASTs for static code checking
[17:26:04] <eddyb> Peach: the AST doesn't tell you enough
[17:26:13] <Peach> you sure?
[17:26:46] <eddyb> and AST doesn't have the results of type inference and various desugarings *in* it
[17:27:00] <eddyb> pretty much by definition
[17:27:12] <Peach> var x = 0.0;    AST: localdeclare ->  (x  -> constant float)
[17:27:13] <eddyb> unless it's an AST for something like the LLVM IR

[17:28:05] <Peach> From the AST you can build a symbol table
[17:28:22] <eddyb> do you resolve things during parsing?
[17:28:30] <eddyb> because that means use-before-definition doesn't work
[17:28:41] <eddyb> which makes hygiene simpler, I guess, if you want macros
[17:29:29] <eddyb> but it also makes it impossible to have two functions, a, and b and a can call b and b can call a

[17:57:13] <GBGamer> I find it interesting that (often) C++ and Rust have opposite capitalization styles wrt types and variables
[17:57:29] <GBGamer> Rust: `var: T`
[17:57:36] <GBGamer> C++: `t Var`
[17:59:16] <eddyb> GBGamer: snake_case is common mainly in the STL
[17:59:41] <eddyb> most C++ code I've seen is UpperCamelCase for types and lowerCamelCase for almost everything else
[18:00:00] <GBGamer> eddyb: really? maybe it's just the C++ code I've read
[18:00:14] <eddyb> if it's stuff using the STL, you're going to see snake_case
[18:00:22] <eddyb> because that's how the STL is written
[18:00:22] <GBGamer> I don't do a lot of C++
[18:00:31] <eddyb> GBGamer: the std namespace
[18:00:38] <eddyb> and maybe boost, I guess
[18:00:45] <GBGamer> hmm
[18:01:03] <GBGamer> I remember Handmade Hero did it that way
[18:04:14] <eddyb> Peach: syntax is merely a form of expression
[18:04:17] <Zoxc> GBGamer: if T were a template argument, then it would be capitalized in C++

[18:05:10] <eddyb> Peach: what it looks like is not important. and the fact that I came up with it is not important
[18:05:23] <eddyb> what's important is its intermediary role

[18:06:43] * Zoxc wonders how to do destructors with a GC
[18:06:44] <eddyb> structural types and matching are important, but they have to be dilluted to their essence
[18:06:50] <eddyb> Zoxc: finalizers?
[18:07:13] <eddyb> that way lies madness
[18:07:14] <Zoxc> Not great for non-memory resources
[18:07:46] <eddyb> well, you could have stack-local resources
[18:08:04] <Zoxc> Yeah, but you'd want to allow to to escape the stack too
[18:08:14] <eddyb> that turn their destructors into finalizers if boxed as GC resources
[18:08:18] <eddyb> Zoxc: sorry, I mean
[18:08:28] <eddyb> you know the struct/class difference in C#, right?
[18:08:43] <eddyb> classes are auto-boxed, while structs are passed by value
[18:08:59] <Zoxc> I'm thinking having manual destructors and having them GC-ed would be an error
[18:09:13] <swgillespie> Zoxc: have you seen this? https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/161
[18:09:21] <eddyb> now allow adding destructors to structs, but not classes
[18:09:30] <eddyb> so you can kinda have RAII

[18:11:04] <swgillespie> a little more than half-assed, but yes, it's move semantics and RAII for C#
[18:11:05] <Zoxc> Where either the resource must escape the stack or be destroyed
[18:11:05] <eddyb> they're hip these days
[18:11:07] <swgillespie> for some types
[18:11:38] <eddyb> swgillespie: if it looks like Rust before Rust figured out move semantics, it is most likely half-assed
[18:11:43] <swgillespie> haha
[18:11:49] <eddyb> it's likely better than C++11
[18:12:09] <eddyb> because C# is supposed to be safer AFAIK
[18:12:16] <eddyb> but it's still manual and bleah
[18:13:04] <swgillespie> A lot of the bugs I deal with at work (C#) are due to not disposing things that are IDisposable
[18:13:11] <swgillespie> the compiler can warn sometimes, but not always

[18:27:29] <eddyb> HashMap::<K, V, H>::new() would require H: Default
[18:28:38] <swgillespie> rust is so exciting
[18:28:39] <eddyb> depending where you import HashMap from, you get no default for H (or maybe FNV) or the randomized SIP hash
[18:28:45] <eddyb> but the default comes from a type alias
[18:29:07] <eddyb> so not just the type itself, but all methods on the type, also get the default
[18:29:25] <eddyb> it behaves as if the type parameter is not there, if you only use types and methods with the same default
[18:29:35] <eddyb> which means it's backwards compatible to add all sorts of things

[21:06:31] <Peach> Some languages differentiate classes and structs, C++ doesn't do that, but for other languages why do they?
[21:06:56] <Peach> what semantics are different? classes pass by reference and structs pass by value?
[21:07:12] <Peach> I wonder why a language design would do this
[21:08:12] <Elaine> I don't know how many languages do that but at least in C# that's the case.
[21:08:26] <Elaine> and you do it because sometimes you really want value semantics, for performance reasons
[21:09:07] <fkaa_> Peach: for me struct means POD, and class means inheritance
[21:09:12] <Peach> I like how C++ is value semantics all the time
[21:09:15] <Peach> and ah
[21:09:37] <Elaine> C++ isn't garbage collected, it doesn't have any other choice.
[21:16:08] <Tiffany> in C++, structs are public by default, whereas classes are private by default
[21:16:13] <Tiffany> only difference, both can use inheritance
[21:16:21] <Peach> Does Rust have return value optimization?
[21:16:24] <Peach> like C++ has
[21:17:13] <Elaine> No, because we don't have move or copy constructors, the optimization can't be observed, so the language doesn't need to make admissions for it.
[21:17:18] <Elaine> But the compiler *will* do that optimization.
[21:17:23] <Elaine> (copy elision)
[21:17:24] <Tiffany> yeah, rust does not allow you to prevent moves
[21:17:48] <Tiffany> C++ didn't get move semantics until C++11, and return value optimization is allowing return to move instead of copy
[21:18:23] <Peach> Oh! does rust allow function expressions?
[21:18:35] <Peach> like     let x = function () { code }    ?
[21:18:49] <Elaine> not like that yet, but you can do that with closures.
[21:18:57] *** Quits: pczarn (piotr@moz-9un7t9.izacom.pl) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[21:19:25] <Peach> Are function expressions even a good idea? Javascript uses them and they can be ugly
[21:19:38] <Peach> cause you   (function() { code }) ();
[21:19:56] <bluss> let x = || code; possible in rust
[21:20:05] <Peach> *calling* an expression, and I don't know if that's a good idea
[21:20:21] <Elaine> Being able to anonymously create a callable is useful.
[21:20:28] <Peach> Oh?
[21:20:40] <whipsch> IIFEs are useful in javascript (and everywhere) because of scoping concerns
[21:20:46] <whipsch> and used everywhere*
[21:21:16] <bluss> playbot: (|x, y| println!("sum = {}", x + y))(1, 2)
[21:21:17] -playbot- sum = 3
[21:21:17] -playbot- ()
[21:21:30] <Peach> what does the | | do? make a closure?
[21:21:40] <niconii> Peach: yes, those are the arguments
[21:22:28] <niconii> the syntax is `|args| expr`, where expr could be something like `1 + 1`, `foo()`, `{ some(); block(); }`, etc.
[21:23:34] <niconii> it captures outside variables via reference; to move them into the closure, it'd be `move |args| expr`  instead
[21:24:12] <Peach> I'm thinking of disallowing function expressions in the language I'm working on, only because it clutters the syntax tree because it means an expression can introduce scope
[21:24:33] <Peach> I mean I *can* allow it
[21:24:36] <Peach> but should I?
[21:24:40] <Elaine> If you have scope-based resource management, you need to allow expressions to introduce scope anyway, for blocks.
[21:24:55] <Elaine> assuming you have block expressions
[21:25:03] <Elaine> (which you totally should, statements are so last-century)
[21:25:43] <Peach> lol "statements are so last century"
[21:25:55] <Peach> sell me on block expressions and why they're useful
[21:25:58] <niconii> yeah, `{ ... }`, `if condition { ... } else { ... }`, `match thing { ... }`, `|x| 2*x`
[21:26:03] <niconii> all of those are expressions in rust
[21:26:07] <niconii> and all of those introduce scope
[21:26:26] <Elaine> Peach: do you have scope-based resource management?

[21:27:20] <Elaine> Then you really need either block statements or block expressions, to control the scope of things easily without explicitly calling destructors,
[21:28:01] <Elaine> and having everything be an expression (except for perhaps variable binding, but even that is arguable, see ML-family) is great for consistency and expressiveness.
[21:28:43] <niconii> having so much stuff be an expression makes things so nice to use
[21:28:49] <Peach> I have block statements yeah they organize everything into neat scopes
[21:29:00] <Peach> Going "everything is in expression"
[21:29:03] <Peach> kinda scares me
[21:29:05] <Elaine> why?
[21:29:14] <Elaine> more languages have done that than the other way around!
[21:29:34] <Peach> Because it becomes harder to give the user a nice error message
[21:29:36] <Elaine> it's natural, really, if you're not in the Algol/Strachey tradition.
[21:29:44] <Elaine> Does it, though?
[21:30:05] <Peach> I think so,     let x = (function() { code} ) ;
[21:30:12] <Elaine> More work in the implementation, *maybe* (seems doubtful to me), but any good UX has an implementation cost
[21:30:14] <Peach> there aren't any names to help the user

[21:31:47] <Peach> each "VarDeclaration" becomes potentially complex
[21:32:00] <Elaine> It's still just an expression on the RHS.
[21:32:01] <Peach> it could make the compile time slower
[21:32:32] <Peach> yeah true it is just an expression
[21:34:36] <Peach> but what does the programmer even do with {} being an expression? I supposed you could easily pass it around but
[21:35:09] <Peach> var somethinginthisscope = 0;    var x = { somethinginthisscope++ }
[21:35:16] <scott> {} as an expression is commonly used as the RHS of match arms in Rust.
[21:35:18] <Peach> I dunno, it could get ugly

[21:35:49] <eddyb> Peach: Rust compile times are in LLVM
[21:35:54] <eddyb> not rustc
[21:36:03] <eddyb> the Rust compiler is much faster than a C++ compiler
[21:36:13] <Peach> oh?
[21:36:20] <eddyb> before optimizations
[21:36:37] <eddyb> a C++ compiler has to do a lot of pointless repeated crap
[21:36:51] <scott> C++ is much more complex than Rust (especially syntax/parsing-wise)
[21:37:00] <eddyb> like parsing and type-checking (during parsing) header files
[21:37:57] <eddyb> we could do better for optimizations, too, but it's a lot of work to speed that up
[21:38:18] <eddyb> might help if LLVM wasn't written in C++, but what'ya gunna do
[21:38:29] <scott> Is there much room for generating less/better LLVM IR to speed it up?
[21:38:38] <eddyb> there is *some* room

[22:12:20] <WindowsBunny> scott: Like, the horizontal lines blur across two rows
[22:12:25] <WindowsBunny> particularly noticeable in "e"
[22:12:48] <Elaine> chrome: http://i.imgur.com/epERntw.png
[22:12:59] <WindowsBunny> hmmm, nobody really has good vertical hinting
[22:13:13] <scott> WindowsBunny: Yours doesn't look any different from mine on my screen.
[22:13:23] <WindowsBunny> scott: Yeah, mine is about the same
[22:13:44] <eddyb> wtf
[22:14:00] <WindowsBunny> whipsch has a serious problem with their PDF subpixel rendering though
[22:14:01] <eddyb> ofc now it's worse, since it renders the same crap with less smoothing
[22:14:12] <whipsch> WindowsBunny: it's chrome's problem!
[22:14:14] <whipsch> :(
[22:14:23] * scott updates chrome and braces for the worst.
[22:14:27] <whipsch> nothing else on my system renders text like that
[22:14:27] <eddyb> oh gawd

[22:15:34] <eddyb> check out that "Furthermore" in the middle of the paragraph
[22:15:41] <scott> lol
[22:15:47] <eddyb> Γurthermore
[22:16:30] <eddyb> maybe it's the material design UI
[22:16:42] <eddyb> I mean, that's the only PDF-specific setting I've touched
[22:16:47] <Havvy> Why do error messages say things are illegal?
[22:17:07] <whipsch> rust-police are going to kick in your door
[22:17:14] <eddyb> Havvy: bad habits *shrug*
[22:17:56] <eddyb> (such as, C spec saying things are illegal, then C compilers following suit and Rust may end up copying such phrasing)
[22:18:06] <scott> 'valid' and 'legal' are used pretty synonymously
[22:18:32] <eddyb> nope, still shit even on the pre-material-design UI
[22:18:46] <Elaine> eddyb: have you considered then that your system fonts are shit?
[22:18:49] <Elaine> what font is it using?
[22:18:59] <eddyb> Elaine: I only have this issue in PDFs
[22:19:05] <scott> playbot: 3f4

[22:19:15] <eddyb> Elaine: PDFs that work fine in okular
[22:19:15] <Elaine> Ok, the PDF renderer could be using a different font than everything else.
[22:19:18] <scott> Here he use legal *and* valid
[22:19:18] <Elaine> Is it every PDF?
[22:19:24] <eddyb> yupp
[22:19:28] <eddyb> all text in all PDFs ever
[22:19:32] <Elaine> Does Chrome even use the same font rendering stack as the rest of the system?
[22:19:41] <eddyb> I don't know
[22:19:51] <eddyb> everything in Chrome works fine except for the PDF viewer
[22:20:14] <whipsch> ^
[22:20:25] <whipsch> same for me, but at least mine is readable
[22:20:30] <eddyb> I even played with the font settings in it recently and made everything tiny
[22:20:34] <whipsch> lets see if it does it on windows as well
[22:20:42] <eddyb> I have thin text in places now, but it looks great
[22:21:22] <eddyb> the larger PDF text somehow manages to be thinner. scratch that, it's the decaying corpse of a dead anorexic horse
[22:22:47] <whipsch> chrome on windows renders it fine for me, same pdfs
[22:23:09] <eddyb> oh you know what it is?
[22:23:29] <eddyb> I bet the PDF viewer is in Chromium, aka opensource
[22:23:30] <scott> Here's what my chrome links to: http://paste.ubuntu.com/11939138/
[22:23:39] <scott> Lots of normal font stuff.
[22:23:49] <eddyb> which means NixOS builds it. so it could be the derivation's fault
[22:24:04] <eddyb> scott: it's not in chrome
[22:24:13] <eddyb> it's a plugin
[22:24:23] <scott> I just assume the plugin uses a similar approach
[22:24:37] <eddyb> well, hmm
[22:24:50] <eddyb> the plugin might have to render text through an API
[22:27:00] <eddyb> grrr they use those weird pak files
[22:28:46] * Peach looks back at channel
[22:28:52] <eddyb> whoa
[22:29:02] * Peach sees 100 responses about PDF rendering
[22:29:27] <eddyb> libexec/chromium/natives_blob.bin is just the preprocessed and concatenated JS code for v8
[22:29:43] <scott> I can't even find anything in my chrome package that might be the PDF plugin
[22:30:14] <eddyb> presumably libexec/chromium/snapshot_blob.bin is the equivalent heap snapshot
[22:30:18] <eddyb> so it's not in one of those
[22:30:41] <eddyb> scott: if you have any clue how to open .pak files... I'm not sure, but I expect it to be in there
[22:31:08] <eddyb> either that or the chromium binary is a common entry point for a dozen different things *including* the PDF viewer
[22:31:10] <scott> ~> dpkg -L google-chrome-stable | grep '\.pak' | grep -v locales

[22:31:26] <eddyb> yeah
[22:31:55] <Peach> Ok guys and girls so like what are common features that are probably best to *take out* of a programming language?
[22:32:32] <Elaine> turing completeness

[22:32:33] <rustbot> [Issue 27288] <open> Error messages MUST NOT say "illegal". <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/27288>
[22:33:00] <Havvy> Peach:  Binary operators (&, |, ^, ~)
[22:33:04] <scott> Nullable pointers / nullable everything
[22:33:17] <eddyb> ahhhahaha --v8-snapshot-passed-by-fd
[22:33:22] <Peach> check for no null
[22:33:25] <eddyb> Havvy: bitwise you mean?
[22:33:38] <Peach> I have no idea if Elaine is serious
[22:33:41] <Elaine> I am.
[22:33:47] <Peach> please educate us
[22:33:49] <Elaine> See: Gallina/Coq.
[22:33:50] <Havvy> eddyb:  Yes.
[22:34:12] <scott> Peach: "check for no null" is why you want to have non-nullable pointers, so you don't have to check
[22:34:29] <eddyb> scott: I think they mean "check"
[22:34:46] <Peach> "check" feature "no null" is implemented

[22:38:03] <eddyb> Peach: it's not as simple as that, and it's not the focus of those languages' existence
[22:38:09] <Peach> I suppose bitwise ops are widely liked, Havvy could you explain why you'd what them out?
[22:38:33] <eddyb> you probably need to at least understand what they're used for before the turing incompleteness makes sense
[22:39:12] <eddyb> in general, DSLs are usually better at what they do than general-purpose programming languages
[22:39:34] <scott> One basic thing that turing-incompleteness can make possible is guaranteeing no infinite loops.
[22:39:41] <c74d> I guess having library functions named `AND`, `OR`, `XOR`, `NOT` could be seen as clearer.
[22:39:53] <eddyb> you can design a bad DSL, sure, but it's easier to design an almost perfect DSL than it is to design a half-decent general-purpose programming language
[22:40:22] <eddyb> c74d: surely not SCREAMING_CASE
[22:41:14] <Peach> I like the no infinite loop thing
[22:41:22] <Peach> but I want a general purpose language so I can't :(
[22:41:30] <c74d> eddyb: well, that's how those operations' names seem to usually be cased, unless one says "bitwise and" etc.
[22:41:33] <Peach> I want to replace C++ for at least my use case
[22:41:58] <Peach> So I wanna make a half decent general purpose language :P
[22:42:08] <Peach> hopefully better than half decent
[22:42:13] <scott> I would use names like bit_and, bit_or, etc.
[22:42:42] <scott> Oh, Rust already uses bitand, bitor, etc
[22:43:18] <Peach> xor band
[22:43:25] <niconii> aww
[22:43:37] <niconii> i'd rather make bitwise stuff *easier*, not harder
[22:43:45] <Peach> eh that seems too long, how common is are bit operations anyway?
[22:43:54] <Peach> niconii: how would you make bitwise stuff easier?
[22:43:55] <scott> Depends on the domain.
[22:43:58] <c74d> Does a programming language *need* Turing-completeness to be general-purpose?
[22:44:18] <niconii> dealing with binary data using just bitwise operations is a pretty primitive way to do it
[22:44:25] <eddyb> hahahaha
[22:44:29] <Peach> I need to understand "Turing completeness" cause it's really confusing
[22:44:32] <eddyb> I can tell you a font that the PDF process is using
[22:44:41] <eddyb> 7f5a53060000-7f5a5306b000 r--s 00000000 00:11 26524116                   /nix/store/l488lb9vhra5v25vwqpwj5gkvpg10ycl-oxygen-fonts-5.3.1/share/fonts/truetype/oxygen/Oxygen-Sans.ttf
[22:44:46] <Peach> Turing complete I just read as "can calculate anything"
[22:44:48] <niconii> Peach: there's things like bitfields, or if you want to really get fancy, erlang's binary pattern matching is *really* nice
[22:44:54] <eddyb> the file is mmaped *and shared* between Chromium processes
[22:45:14] <eddyb> niconii: I feel like Rust deserves binary pattern-matching :(
[22:45:24] <scott> Chrome process share lots of stuff
[22:45:33] <scott> processes*
[22:45:42] <niconii> eddyb: same, i think it'd be really great
[22:45:47] <Elaine> Peach: If you're not turing complete you can have all programs halt, and also make it easy to prove things about them.
[22:45:56] <Elaine> It's not useful for "real" programming languages.
[22:46:15] <Peach> Aww, well I'm making a "real" programming language
[22:46:15] <scott> Idris is trying to make it useful for a real programming language
[22:46:19] <c74d> Peach: Turing-completeness is the ability to simulate a Turing machine, which is a theoretical computer with a primitive instruction set and infinite memory.
[22:46:25] <niconii> i do like nom though
[22:46:30] <Tiffany> I was about to mention Idris
[22:46:32] <Peach> so I'd like to know what I can take out of a language to make it better
[22:46:38] <Peach> a programming language
[22:46:48] <Elaine> What do you start with?
[22:46:54] <Elaine> scott: Idris made that optional iirc
[22:46:55] <Peach> at least C
[22:47:00] <Peach> start with C
[22:47:02] <Tiffany> the safe subset of Idris is not turing complete
[22:47:07] <Elaine> cool.
[22:47:12] <Tiffany> this is because all programs must halt, and unbounded recursion is not allowed
[22:47:13] <c74d> "<~Elaine> It's not useful for "real" programming languages." -- "It" being Turing-completeness or lack thereof?
[22:47:18] <niconii> please don't start with C :c
[22:47:20] <Elaine> c74d: lack thereof.
[22:47:22] <scott> Elaine: It is, but you can get pretty far without unbounded recursion.
[22:47:41] <scott> Elaine: You can even have infinite loops that are proven to always be making progress, which is also considered okay.
[22:47:44] <Peach> What should I start with :P
[22:47:45] <Elaine> It has coinductive types?
[22:47:49] <Elaine> That's a statement.
[22:47:55] <Elaine> Like, it has unbounded recursion.
[22:48:06] <Peach> Do we start at javascript and take out all the stupid stuff?
[22:48:18] <Tiffany> peach: what languages have you actually used?
[22:48:22] <eddyb> JS isn't even statically typed...
[22:48:25] <scott> Elaine: I'm pretty sure I've seen it in Idris, at least. Hopefully I'm not misremembering...
[22:48:43] <Peach> C,C++, Java  GLSL, Lua, ObjC
[22:48:46] <eddyb> starting with a subset of Rust is a better choice than many others
[22:48:47] <Peach> C and C++ are my fav
[22:48:51] <Peach> and I can't stand Java
[22:48:58] <Peach> Oh I've also used Javascript
[22:49:06] <eddyb> Peach: out of those, only Java and GLSL are regular enough
[22:49:11] <Tiffany> you should try some functional languages and poke at some of the research before you go off and make something terrible
[22:49:31] <Peach> I know, I study Haskell
[22:49:35] <Peach> and a bunch of others
[22:49:43] <Peach> and I read papers
[22:49:58] <Peach> and angry blog posts that complain about programming languages
[22:49:58] <eddyb> scott: oh how did I miss this
[22:50:26] <eddyb> Plug-in: Chromium PDF Viewer. Memory: 0K. Process ID: 0
[22:50:37] <eddyb> so it's embedded in chromium :(
[22:50:38] <Elaine> Peach: J and Rust are my favorite languages to use, so I'm a bad person to ask about taste :P
[22:50:47] <Peach> awww
[22:51:18] <Tiffany> rust is my go-to language for anything crypto related
[22:51:31] <eddyb> Peach: if you want to fiddle with something, start with... nothing. or a very small subset of something existing
[22:51:35] <Peach> I like languages that aren't so mathy like J and Haskell are
[22:51:44] <Peach> eddyb: wha?
[22:52:16] <niconii> my favorite languages are rust and forth... which honestly are so at odds with each other it's not even funny
[22:52:34] <eddyb> if you start with C, C++ or JS, you'll need to remove a lot before you get to a minimal subset that you can improve
[22:52:55] <Peach> What should I start with eddyb 
[22:53:08] <eddyb> like I said, nothing. or as close to nothing as you can get
[22:53:08] <Peach> (I already started but tell me anyway :P)
[22:53:11] <Peach> Oh
[22:53:14] <Peach> "nothing"
[22:53:16] <Peach> ????
[22:53:27] <eddyb> minimal subsets
[22:53:36] <Peach> You mean imagine a programming language from nothing?
[22:53:51] <c74d> the computer game project The Battle for Wesnoth, having a dearth of active developers, posted this call for help: <http://r.wesnoth.org/t42912>... now apparently it's hit the top of the front pages of Hacker News and /r/programming, and apparently has also made the front page of /r/games.
[22:54:03] <c74d> I'm thinking they might need me to un-retire as a forums moderator. :x
[22:54:15] <niconii> i like rust because everything's safe and i can rely on the compiler a lot; i like forth because it's small, i can understand all of it, and i have the power to do anything i want with it, including hijack the parser and fun stuff like that

[22:55:02] <scott> Elaine: An example of Idris' coinduction: https://github.com/idris-lang/Idris-dev/blob/master/libs/prelude/Prelude/Stream.idr#L15-L23
[22:55:09] <eddyb> don't spend your time fixing design flaws, exclude them from the start
[22:55:26] <scott> Elaine: I wouldn't count it as unbounded recursion, since coinduction imposes its own restrictions just like induction.
[22:55:36] <eddyb> honestly, if you're making anything new in systems programming land
[22:56:09] <niconii> it's just nice that i can totally write a forth if i want
[22:56:19] <eddyb> you either take everything Rust does into account, or you give up on some of *its* goals
[22:57:53] <eddyb> if you're higher-level, you have more wiggle room
[22:58:27] <eddyb> Peach: so, is what you want to build a systems programming language?
[22:58:48] <Elaine> scott: Ok, fine.
[22:58:58] <niconii> imo rust is the cutting-edge of the systems programming world right now, you've gotta take it into account if you're planning to surpass it
[22:59:12] <eddyb> that's what I said :D. just less precisely
[22:59:29] <eddyb> Peach: i.e. do you achieve safety via enforced garbage collection, or are you lower-level than that?
[22:59:50] <Tiffany> I got the impression peach doesn't intend to achieve safety
[23:00:08] <eddyb> sorry, I meant "memory safety" just now
[23:00:13] <eddyb> Tiffany: okay, that simplifies things
[23:00:18] <Peach> no
[23:00:22] <Peach> I want safety
[23:00:40] <eddyb> Peach: so, garbage-collected, or not?
[23:00:43] <Elaine> niconii: Cyclone has the core ideas and is simpler in many respects.
[23:01:06] <Peach> eddyb: It is NOT garbage collected
[23:01:20] <niconii> Elaine: oh? i've never heard of cyclone before now
[23:01:22] <eddyb> Elaine: when I looked at Cyclone, it only seemed like it handled scope enforcement
[23:01:44] <Peach> Design wise it's higher level than Rust / C++  -  the language I want to build is for media rich application development and high performance 3D graphics - the fun parts and interactive of programming. The language is designed to be safe, and have zero cost abstractions like C++
[23:01:55] <eddyb> not the borrowing and shared-vs-mut semantics Rust has
[23:02:22] <eddyb> Peach: does it have concurrency?
[23:02:41] <eddyb> Peach: i.e. can different threads get access to the same memory?
[23:03:09] <c74d> that's the definition of concurrency?
[23:03:12] <eddyb> idk
[23:03:20] <c74d> not just things running concurrently?
[23:03:21] <eddyb> but it's what I meant in my question
[23:03:30] <eddyb> c74d: that's parallelism
[23:03:34] <c74d> mm
[23:03:35] <Elaine> no...
[23:03:39] <eddyb> or not...
[23:03:44] <Elaine> things running concurrently and in parallel are still separate
[23:04:05] <Tiffany> eddyb: shared memory is not a fundamental requirement of either concurrency nor parallelism
[23:04:08] <eddyb> oh, I read what c74d said just now

[23:08:00] <scott> c74d: And then you would google "rust impl" and/or read the book
[23:08:05] <Elaine> https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/src/grammar
[23:08:10] <eddyb> scott: why would you not start *there*?
[23:08:10] <Elaine> parser-lalr.y
[23:08:14] <c74d> mhm
[23:08:20] <scott> You might have the same reaction to "struct", or "enum", or "implementation" if that was the keyword name.
[23:08:27] <c74d> well, "rust programming language "impl""
[23:08:43] <scott> "rust impl" is enough for Google for me
[23:08:48] <Peach> I need to understand C++11 threads
[23:08:48] <eddyb> the first thing I read about Rust was the tutorial
[23:08:51] <Peach> please help
[23:09:03] <Peach> (Also I'm using tinythread C++03)
[23:09:13] <Peach> (cause I'm never using C++11)
[23:09:19] <eddyb> using C++03 in 2015 is a sin
[23:09:31] <eddyb> it could be worse, it could be an older standard. but still
[23:09:35] <eddyb> Peach: do you have a reason?
[23:09:49] <eddyb> I'll eat my hat if you have a good reason for not using C++11
[23:10:05] <eddyb> or should I say, using C++03 instead of C++11
[23:10:20] <eddyb> because I'm using Rust instead of C++11, and there's plenty of reasons :P
[23:10:50] <Tiffany> "Also used for proc() to cause things like proc() a + b to parse as proc() { a + b }." uh... wasn't proc removed?
[23:10:59] <scott> It was
[23:11:11] <Elaine> yeah it's a little bit out of date.
[23:11:20] <Elaine> but there have only be removals, not additions.
[23:11:45] <eddyb> what about `in place {expr}`?
[23:11:57] <Elaine> when was that added? :P
[23:12:10] <eddyb> today, maybe
[23:12:12] <eddyb> let me check
[23:12:19] <Elaine> lol
[23:12:36] <eddyb> it says "2 days ago" on github
[23:12:53] <eddyb> (on the merge commit)
[23:12:55] <eddyb> but "a day ago" on the PR https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/27215
[23:13:27] <Elaine> neat
[23:14:34] <eddyb> after wasting a couple hours in this channel and going back to my text editor: "I have no recollection of this place"
[23:20:20] <Peach> Peach: do you have a reason? eddyb: I'll eat my hat if you have a good reason for not using C++11    < I run code on an embedded system that doesn't have a C++11 compiler  
[23:20:36] <eddyb> I... I need to find a hat
[23:20:46] <eddyb> Peach: what kind of system is that, if you don't mind me asking?
[23:20:47] *** Quits: Murarth (Murarth@moz-m3g.78t.166.46.IP) (Quit: Screw you guys. I'm going home.)
[23:20:51] <Tiffany> are you compiling code on the embedded system, or are you using a shitty proprietary toolchain?
[23:21:06] *** Joins: Murarth (Murarth@moz-4t8fs2.phnx.qwest.net)
[23:23:10] <eddyb> test [run-pass] run-pass/coerce-box-protocol.rs ... ok
[23:23:13] <eddyb> mwhahahhaha
[23:23:33] <eddyb> it only took us more than half a year to get here
[23:26:04] *** Joins: fkaa (fkaa@moz-501od2.business.telia.com)
[23:26:58] <scott> I didn't realize you could use make without a Makefile...
[23:27:17] <eddyb> scott: with the built-in rules?
[23:27:23] <scott> Yeah.
[23:27:28] <Tiffany> what built in rules?
[23:27:34] <eddyb> Tiffany: heh
[23:27:45] <scott> `make foo.c` can be used as a shortcut instead of `cc foo.c -o foo`
[23:27:58] <Tiffany> oh
[23:28:05] <Tiffany> I was expecting something fancier
[23:28:08] <Peach> Tiffany: eddyb: seriously not every platform and compiler can keep with C++, there are often hundreds of static libraries compiled for a particular platform, and going to C++11 can cause issues - it's best practice to recompile libs for the new language spec but some systems: Xbox360/PS3/DS/Wii just don't have enough developer concern to switch to newer standard
[23:28:12] <Tiffany> like being able to compile a directory into an executable
[23:28:23] <Peach> I can't say the specifics of the system I'm on
[23:28:32] <scott> make foo*
[23:28:38] <scott> not .c
[23:28:43] <eddyb> Peach: you don't update a platform-specific compiler to C++11, that's wasteful
[23:28:54] <Tiffany> it's been four years though, and C++11 isn't getting any younger
[23:29:05] <Peach> C++14 and C++17....
[23:29:10] <eddyb> Peach: the sane thing to do is to get LLVM support for the platform
[23:29:11] <Peach> you think it's easy to keep up
[23:29:17] <eddyb> Peach: can you say what CPU architecture it is?
[23:29:24] <Peach> :X
[23:29:42] <Tiffany> yes, because it is easy to keep up
[23:29:53] <Tiffany> I have the latest version of clang about a day after it's released
[23:30:06] <Tiffany> which has native cross compilation
[23:30:19] <eddyb> Peach: let's see
[23:30:40] <eddyb> xbox360 is PPC
[23:30:55] <Peach> Tiffany: your use case is different than mine, I can't afford to update all my other libraries
[23:30:55] <Tiffany> PS3 is also PPC
[23:31:03] <scott> Peach: I can compile C++11, C++14, and Rust for DS
[23:31:09] <scott> LLVM support is the way to go
[23:31:10] <eddyb> the PS3 is also PPC
[23:31:12] <eddyb> Tiffany: lol
[23:31:20] <Tiffany> I think the Wii might be PPC too
[23:31:29] <eddyb> yupp
[23:31:44] <eddyb> the DS is ARM
[23:31:49] <swgillespie> even the wii u is PPC I think
[23:31:54] <scott> (of course probably no C++ stdlib for DS without trouble, and only libcore for Rust)
[23:31:54] <Tiffany> what other libraries?
[23:31:58] <Tiffany> and what do you mean you can't afford?
[23:32:03] <eddyb> Peach: you listed 3 PPC and 1 ARM device
[23:32:11] <eddyb> Peach: LLVM supports both PPC and ARM
[23:32:30] <Tiffany> are you using proprietary libraries without source license?
[23:32:34] <eddyb> Peach: do you know for sure that LLVM doesn't support your CPU?
[23:32:41] <Peach> eddyb: did I say that *any* of those was actually my platform :P
[23:32:48] <eddyb> Peach: no, I was just pointing out
[23:32:49] <Tiffany> C++11 is backwards compatible, after all
[23:32:51] <Peach> ah
[23:32:57] <eddyb> that clang will work for all of them
[23:33:03] <eddyb> with C++17
[23:33:12] <Tiffany> C++1z, you mean
[23:33:15] <eddyb> sorry
[23:33:27] <wrl> peach are you working on the mill cpu
[23:33:45] <Tiffany> the mill wouldn't be stuck with an outdated C++ compiler
[23:33:47] <eddyb> the platforms don't switch to a newer standard, the compilers that implement the new standard also support the older platforms
[23:33:54] <eddyb> the Mill uses LLVM so no
[23:34:05] *** Quits: Peach (Fancy3D@moz-500.6lb.246.96.IP) (Client exited)
[23:34:10] <Tiffany> ragequit?
[23:34:13] <fkaa> z80?
[23:34:14] <eddyb> I hope that's a reconnect
[23:34:22] <eddyb> I really really want to know
[23:34:29] <fkaa> TIS-100?
[23:34:52] <eddyb> it's likely some weird platform with a CPU actually supported by LLVM
[23:35:01] <eddyb> or it's a microcontroller
[23:35:08] <swgillespie> TIS-100 has consumed my life
[23:35:14] <eddyb> maybe a DSP?
[23:35:32] <fkaa> swgillespie: i'm stuck on trying to multiply two inputs
[23:35:33] <eddyb> wrl: I blame you :P
[23:35:47] <swgillespie> fkaa: haha. I'm stuck on the state machine one
[23:35:54] <swgillespie> recognizing a sequence of numbers
[23:35:57] <fkaa> TIS-100 makes me feel like the mcgyver of code
[23:36:01] <swgillespie> i can't get it to fit :<
[23:36:02] <fkaa> ah
[23:36:11] <eddyb> fkaa: what's so hard, while(--a) c += b;
[23:36:23] <fkaa> eddyb: only have one register to read and write from
[23:36:27] <eddyb> what part of that does TIS not express?
[23:36:29] <swgillespie> eddyb: TIS-100 has two registers, one of which is addressible
[23:36:33] <fkaa> ah
[23:36:33] <eddyb> oh
[23:36:34] <fkaa> that
[23:36:39] <swgillespie> and 10 instructions per node
[23:36:46] <Tiffany> it's actually 15
[23:36:48] <swgillespie> oh
[23:36:51] <swgillespie> a small number :P
[23:37:09] <Tiffany> also, there's only like 15 instructions as well
[23:37:19] <eddyb> so you use two nodes
[23:37:31] <Tiffany> multiple kinds of conditional jumps, addition, subtraction, synchronous inter-core communication
[23:37:32] <eddyb> one of them does x = x - 1
[23:37:40] <Tiffany> swap the two registers
[23:38:00] <fkaa> i have to make use of a stack i think
[23:38:03] <eddyb> the other one reads the result and if not zero, keeps adding
[23:38:05] <Tiffany> and yeah, the multiplication one isn't too hard once you have it down
[23:38:10] <fkaa> since it was introduced on that level
[23:38:11] <wrl> eddyb: :c
[23:38:13] <Tiffany> I think I only needed one node for it
[23:38:20] <Tiffany> I'm pretty sure you don't need the stack fkaa
[23:38:24] <fkaa> aww
[23:38:24] <Tiffany> it's just there if you want to do crazy stuff
[23:38:25] <wrl> eddyb: this is more weight than i am prepared to carry on my shoulders
[23:38:34] <swgillespie> eddyb: the if not zero instruction operates on the accumulator register and you can't add the acc register to the unaddressable one
[23:38:38] <eddyb> Tiffany: too bad it blackscreens for me :(
[23:38:41] <swgillespie> you can only swap them
[23:38:44] <fkaa> Tiffany: can i add you on steam to compare scores?
[23:38:51] <eddyb> swgillespie: so... lots of swaps?
[23:38:56] <swgillespie> lots of swaps indeed
[23:39:09] <swgillespie> it's kinda tricky to add the acc and bak registers
[23:39:16] <swgillespie> i think you need two nodes
[23:39:21] <Tiffany> I've done that before
[23:39:22] <swgillespie> i'm pretty bad though
[23:39:28] <Tiffany> MOV RIGHT, RIGHT has saved me a couple times
[23:39:32] <swgillespie> haha
[23:39:42] <fkaa> MOV ANY, ANY works too apparently
[23:40:07] <Elaine> fkaa: not always.
[23:40:14] <Elaine> Not if you're multiplexing a bounce.
[23:40:26] <fkaa> oh, right
[23:40:57] <swgillespie> it seems like the secret to wicked optimization is the JRO instruction
[23:41:01] <swgillespie> in general
[23:42:29] <Elaine> Oh?
[23:42:34] <Tiffany> yeah
[23:42:39] <fkaa> this must look horrible to you people http://puu.sh/jcRh4/3ae573c7fe.png
[23:42:41] <Tiffany> it lets you turn any node into a 7-entry jump table
[23:42:44] <Tiffany> and you can daisy chain them
[23:42:46] <Tiffany> among other things
[23:42:47] <Elaine> Oh right that's the indirect one
[23:43:19] <Tiffany> you could use less belt nodes fkaa
[23:43:41] <Elaine> I usually have two or three solutions to each problem
[23:43:47] <Elaine> to hit fastest, least insn, least node.
[23:43:53] <swgillespie> i'm trying to do jump tables for the signal pattern detector one
[23:43:54] <Elaine> (the last two usually share)
[23:44:04] <swgillespie> haha, I'm lucky if I can get one
[23:44:15] <Elaine> I got bored of TIS-100 :(
[23:44:18] <Elaine> too easy
[23:44:21] <fkaa> i'm feeling pretty blocked on this one
[23:44:32] <swgillespie> Elaine: you can make your own
[23:44:35] <swgillespie> puzzles, I mean
[23:44:36] <swgillespie> i think
[23:44:42] <Elaine> I know, but I'd rather just work on real software lol
[23:45:23] <swgillespie> also, the signal pattern detector definitely changed since the last time i played this game
[23:45:24] <swgillespie> o_o
[23:45:31] <swgillespie> the pattern used to be 1 4 5 but now it's 0 0 0
[23:45:42] <Elaine> whoa really?
[23:45:45] <Elaine> huh
[23:45:50] <Elaine> that's much easier.
[23:45:58] <swgillespie> yeah haha
[23:46:05] <Elaine> counter instead of FSM
[23:47:37] <fkaa> gah
[23:47:40] <fkaa> making me mad
[23:47:47] <swgillespie> haha
[23:47:59] <Elaine> fkaa: that's how you know you're winning :D
[23:48:03] <Elaine> keep fighting
[23:48:08] <fkaa> too late
[23:48:11] <fkaa> already closed it
[23:48:13] <Elaine> heh
[23:48:19] <fkaa> it's 2am over here
[23:48:42] <Elaine> oh, definitely do that sleep thing
[23:48:48] <fkaa> now for some late night crazy talk: how crazy would a lua implementation in rust be?
[23:49:11] <Elaine> not too crazy, at least not for a decent one.
[23:49:57] <swgillespie> people have made some excellent interpreters in rust
[23:50:02] <swgillespie> there's a great scheme one
