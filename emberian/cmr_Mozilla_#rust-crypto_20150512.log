[03:18:12] <Ilari> bascule: It seems to me that with that requirement dropped, the client just would need to do extra sort after completing the chain?
[03:18:50] <bascule> Ilari: err, how do you handle having effectively two paths to root certificates that the client may or may not have in their truststore?
[03:20:24] *** Joins: erickt (erickt@moz-njt.vqi.14.76.IP)
[03:20:34] <Ilari> Patch two segments between sent and in-store?
[03:21:34] <bascule> ?
[03:21:42] <bascule> I think that's what Sleevi is suggesting?
[03:21:54] <Ilari> Of coure, that gets bit sticky with certificate pinning, but any form of rewriting gets sticky with that.
[03:21:59] <bascule> but if they can't directly certify the previous cert
[03:22:05] <bascule> they're nonlinear
[03:22:15] <bascule> I mean, ideally you'd have multiple chains, right?
[03:23:16] <Ilari> Sleevi is suggesting allowing sending certificate chain in arbitrary order, like A C B, where C signs B and B signs A.
[03:23:39] <Ilari> (Or it might still have to have EE Cert first, but still...)
[03:24:33] <bascule> I think he's suggesting that you can encode multiple paths to potential root certs?
[03:24:49] <bascule> and yes, by doing that, you break the next-cert-certifies-previous-cert ordering
[03:25:06] <bascule> I don't think he's suggesting that it be done capriciously
[03:25:13] <bascule> even though that will work as a side effect

[03:26:16] <Ilari> Also, isn't there negotiation about hash functions?
[03:26:38] <bascule> you would have to present a different cert, no?
[03:26:59] <Ilari> So you can choose between chains for SHA-1 vs. SHA-256.
[03:27:08] <bascule> how?
[03:27:38] <bascule> the server has already presented its cert before you could negotiate that, no?

[20:55:02] <eternaleye> Ilari: Actually, even funnier than an ad.
[20:55:35] <eternaleye> Ilari: I mean, it's a post from a company that makes static analysis tools for C++
[20:55:35] <eternaleye> Ilari: The motivation becomes pretty clear there :P
[20:56:48] <eternaleye> I consider their comparison with D far less telling than that they felt a need to disparage Rust, but never did a similar set of posts about D.
[20:57:07] <Ilari> Also fun are articles that trash X, and then have banner ad for X.
[20:57:25] <eternaleye> Heh
[20:59:01] <kmc> "I can't but remind you for one more time that the source of troubles is usually in humans, not technology . If your C++ code is not good enough or Java code is painfully slow, it's not because the technology is bad - it's because you haven't learned how to use it right. That way, you won't be satisfied with Rust either, but just for some other reasons. Isn't it easier to learn how to use more popular tools and start liking them?"
[20:59:33] <kmc> lol
[20:59:40] <eternaleye> And the whole point of the borrow checker is to *catch* those human errors, yeah
[20:59:47] <kmc> software is apparently the 1 area of human activity where it doesn't matter if you pick "good" or "bad" tools and indeed this idea is meaningless
[20:59:51] <Ilari> Also, how is one supposed to copy (or clone) contents of a slice into another (mutable) slice?
[20:59:56] <eternaleye> I find it rather hilarious that *that* is their strongest defense
[21:00:02] <kmc> just use whatever tools you want! build a house by bashing nails in with a rock!
[21:00:03] <eternaleye> Ilari: .clone_from() ?
[21:00:14] <kmc> and people wonder why computers are terrible
[21:00:27] <kmc> and people bemoan the fact that totalitarian governments (US, UK, China) can hack into everything and spy on everyone all the time
[21:00:30] <kmc> this is why
[21:00:40] <kmc> because my industry is full of people who don't fucking care
[21:02:00] <eternaleye> Ilari: .clone_from() used to be on a slice extension trait, but with unsized Self it's now just impl<T> Clone for [T] { ... }
[21:02:08] <kmc> though in this case it would seem that they do care about bugs but have a financial interest in people addressing them a different way
[21:03:58] <Ilari> eternaleye: I don't see implementation for [T] on Clone...
[21:04:23] <kmc> Rust is gonna bruise a lot of egos for people who feel that "real programmers" don't need a safety net
[21:04:29] <eternaleye> Ilari: https://huonw.github.io/rust/build/doc/std/slice/primitive.slice.html
[21:04:38] <kmc> somehow these "real programmers" never appear when you need to write software like OpenSSL or bash
[21:04:41] <kmc> just ordinary humans
[21:06:13] <Ilari> Also, it is quite likely that whatever the element type is, it is Copy, so the thing can be bulk memory copy...
[21:06:21] <kmc> if they do exist, maybe they're all employed by the NSA, securing USG systems while breaking everyone else's shit
[21:06:24] <kmc> :P
[21:06:45] <eternaleye> kmc: Now now, there's probably a few at MI? and the GRU as well!
[21:07:03] <kmc> and like 10x as many as all those put together in China :3
[21:11:50] <Ilari> What I regard as _the_ reason why one can't write reliable software in C: One can't abstract one's way out of paper bag. And without abstraction, the limits of human mind come across very quick.
[21:24:34] <kmc> yeah
[21:25:13] <kmc> this also explains why disproportionately many C programs seem to believe they have super-human minds and are quick to bring this up if you mention the language's failings
[21:25:22] <kmc> disproportionately many C programmers*
[21:25:23] <kmc> lol
[21:25:35] <kmc> I have not run into a C program that's convinced it has a superhuman mind... yet
[21:28:41] <kmc> "the source of troubles is usually in humans, not technology"  dude... your company sells a static analyzer
[21:28:44] <kmc> lol
[21:29:48] <kmc> bolt-ons = great, carefully designed and integrated features = for losers
[21:30:02] <kmc> just like the C preprocessor or "go generate"
[21:33:54] <Ilari> There was also some DJB lecture, where he predicted that in future there are essentially two kinds of code: 1) So hot that compiler optimizers just don't cut it  and 2) So cold that it isn't even worth enabling compiler optimizations for.
[21:34:11] <kmc> strange claim
[21:34:13] <kmc> what was his basis?
[21:34:52] <kmc> djb may have a ... narrow perspective on software development
[21:35:00] <Ilari> Basically, as data volumes increase, code tends to either become hotter or colder.
[21:35:08] <kmc> I think almost no part of rustc or Servo falls into either category
[21:35:32] <eternaleye> kmc: The hasher for HashMap may approach the former though
[21:35:47] <kmc> and compiler optimizations are a critical part of safety thru abstraction -- the thing Ilari was talking about
[21:36:22] <eternaleye> kmc: But at some point you get low enough that abstraction isn't especially meaningfull
[21:36:29] <kmc> well, naturally
[21:36:33] <kmc> but I can speak from specific experience here
[21:36:37] <eternaleye> kmc: A hasher that operates on a bag'o'bytes is a very fitting case of that
[21:36:45] <kmc> replacing unsafe bit twiddling thruout a library with a conversion to/from an enum
[21:36:58] <Ilari> Also, even if the code is "balanced" with today's data volumes, it tends to become "unbalanced" as volumes increase.
[21:37:03] <kmc> also, web pages and source code aren't homogenous data and they don't increase in size exponentially the way "big data" does
[21:37:04] <eternaleye> kmc: Sure, but put that in a tight loop and it costs you. Hard.
[21:37:14] <kmc> eternaleye: it was in a tight loop
[21:37:18] <kmc> that's all I was measuring
[21:37:21] <eternaleye> Mm
[21:37:24] <kmc> zero * anything = zero
[21:37:28] <kmc> *zero*-cost abstractions
[21:37:30] <kmc> they are possible
[21:37:33] <eternaleye> Sure
[21:37:46] <eternaleye> I'm just wondering what the bit twiddling was though
[21:37:49] <kmc> in this case, inlining + SROA means that the enum is basically a protocol and not an actual data structure
[21:38:02] <kmc> https://github.com/servo/string-cache/blob/master/shared/lib.rs
[21:38:16] <eternaleye> Because for a large subset of "bit twiddling" enums will lose you at least one of memory-size, speed, or codesize.
[21:38:36] <kmc> https://github.com/servo/string-cache/commit/d7bf22ead1a90fb596401d9262994477aa3a0ee9
[21:38:45] <eternaleye> And those map directly to D$, cycles, or I$ performance.
[21:39:09] <kmc> i'm not sure you understand what I'm talking about (I didn't explain it fully)  but anyway that diff should tell the tale, if you care enough to dig into it
[21:39:14] <kmc> if not that's cool
[21:39:36] <eternaleye> He also gave empirical results regarding specific real-world code, hand-tuned versus gcc/clang in various optimization profiles
[21:39:50] <kmc> C compilers? the language where you can't abstract at all?
[21:40:02] <kmc> anything that would be generic in Rust is monomorphized *by hand*
[21:40:06] <kmc> lol
[21:40:32] <kmc> is djb gonna write a html5 parser in assembly now?
[21:40:34] <Ilari> And there is very cold code. I wrote some test code for ECC signatures. Wheither or not I enable optimizations compiling it makes very little speed difference.
[21:40:37] <kmc> it's just a ludicrous claim
[21:41:00] <kmc> "there is very cold code" yes.  "there is very hot code" yes.  "all code is very hot or very cold"... wow maybe a different claim?
[21:41:03] <kmc> anyway
[21:41:03] <kmc> I'm pissy today
[21:41:06] <kmc> about everything being terrible
[21:41:14] <kmc> so i'll wander off
[21:41:17] <eternaleye> kmc: You're drawing the boundary between hot code and cold code at a higher level of abstraction than he was
[21:41:31] <eternaleye> kmc: For him, it was at the subroutine (or even portion of subroutine) level
[21:41:32] <kmc> his statement implies that compiler optimizations are useless
[21:41:33] *** Quits: jtdowney (jtdowney@moz-obnifk.il.comcast.net) (Quit: )
[21:41:45] <kmc> that's just absurd
[21:42:37] <eternaleye> kmc: IIRC, another point on his slides was that using profile-guided stuff to *find* the hot code is where compiler optimizations would be best able to help
[21:42:46] *** Parts: kmc (keegan@moz-gjgn5n.compute.amazonaws.com) ()
[21:43:17] <eternaleye> Ilari: Anyway, the actual slides: http://cr.yp.to/talks/2015.04.16/slides-djb-20150416-a4.pdf
[21:43:27] <eternaleye> I dislike his habit of tall-and-narrow slides
[21:44:31] <Ilari> Well, there will still be some medium-perf code: In my prototype ECC lib, actually writing proper FieldImp:s would probably be a big performance win, but not not optimizing the rest would likely cost a lot (but that code is much much colder than FieldImp code)...
[21:46:07] <eternaleye> Ilari: Sure, but he really is talking about asymptotics
[21:46:30] <eternaleye> Ilari: "As volume goes to infinity, any profile not perfectly flat is dominated by few, small hotspots"
[21:46:52] <eternaleye> Ilari: And then he also posits that no modern profile is that flat.
[21:47:39] <eternaleye> Ilari: And "few, small" is a pretty ideal case for handrolling, which he brings up good evidence for still being significantly superior to optimizing compilers.
[21:50:16] <Ilari> Also, this reminds me of: If one has has some kind of optimized asm() block, the compiler might be able to inline it with the function it is in. But external .asm files are not so easy to inline...
[21:51:26] <eternaleye> Yup
[21:51:39] <eternaleye> And the point at the end, about interactive optimization, is very important
[21:52:09] <eternaleye> Wish kmc was still here, since the slices have a lot more than just "lol, optimizers are irrelevant"

[22:45:08] <Ilari> At least I think that requring a DAG rules out PSPACE-hard or similar behaviour (if there is some way to make X.509 certificate validation PSPACE-hard). :->
[22:45:49] <Tobba> NP-scary
[22:51:36] <Ilari> That PSPACE-hard was mostly as a joke, as PSPACE-complete is thought to be loads worse than NP-complete. :-)
[22:53:33] <Ilari> IIRC, evaluating if classic sokoban puzzle is solvable is PSPACE-complete (since one can simulate arbitrary computation with bounded memory).
