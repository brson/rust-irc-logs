[00:38:31] <aydinkim> Ok. I see. Thanks!
[00:39:49] <pcwalton> I got it to work, BUT I had to force override a sanity check in Mesa :(
[00:39:56] <pcwalton> I can try to find something cleaner
[00:40:01] <pcwalton> but it'll involve a nasty hack
[00:41:14] <kmc> at ksplice we had a script to binary patch gcc on disk to remove a sanity check

[05:43:05] <pcwalton> success!
[05:43:09] <pcwalton> I have gotten cross process sharing to work
[05:43:15] <pcwalton> on linux, without an X connection
[05:43:57] <eddyb> that talk did wonders :P
[05:44:08] <pcwalton> it won't work on NVIDIA
[05:44:10] <pcwalton> too bad for them
[05:44:32] <eddyb> a friend of mine now wants a custom GUI stack with Rust/Servo
[05:44:45] <pcwalton> it's still not *that* secure because the renderer process can still read the contents of any GPU buffer in the system
[05:44:49] <pcwalton> but this will be fixed soon
[05:44:51] <pcwalton> like, in the next year
[05:44:53] <pcwalton> so I don't care
[05:45:05] <pcwalton> DRI3 will fix that
[05:46:00] <pcwalton> I think it's better than proxying all GL calls to a separate process AIGLX-style like Chrome does 
[05:46:15] <pcwalton> the mobile GPU manufacturers are telling us to not do that anyway from what I hear
[05:46:48] <eddyb> hmm. could Servo run on top of a framebuffer with Mesa and no X?
[05:46:56] <pcwalton> eddyb: using this technique, yes!
[05:47:00] <pcwalton> it's pretty awesome
[05:47:08] <pcwalton> the renderer will have no X in it at all
[05:47:13] <pcwalton> the compositor does but it's small
[05:48:03] <eddyb> pedigree (that C++ OS pcmattman and I worked on. he's still fiddling with it) can already do the 3D gears :)
[05:49:29] <eddyb> and if I had the time to work on rustic (and rustc wouldn't take 2+GB to compile that code), it would already have a framebuffer
[05:49:46] <eddyb> hmm. maybe someone should port Mesa to Rust just to make it safe :P
[05:50:17] <pcwalton> eh, Mesa isn't that much of a security risk I don't think
[05:50:23] <pcwalton> it's all userspace and untrusted
[05:50:41] <pcwalton> and code doesn't interact with it directly… well I guess WebGL does
[05:51:13] <eddyb> pcwalton: the context I was thinking of was kernel-level tasks made safe by Rust
[05:51:23] <pcwalton> ah
[05:51:45] <eddyb> embedded systems with no MMU or where you get some performance from doing that
[05:52:21] <eddyb> safe and HTML5 in the kernel. how cool would that be?
[05:52:37] <pcwalton> in practice all of this would make me a lot less worried if we had a safe JS engine
[05:52:45] <pcwalton> then content really wouldn't be touching anything unsafe
[05:54:30] <eddyb> is there any Rust/Servo policy against forking?
[05:54:38] <pcwalton> against forking upstream libraries or...?
[05:54:59] <eddyb> fork as in the system call
[05:55:02] <patrickkim> jdm : ping
[05:55:03] <pcwalton> oh
[05:55:07] <jdm> patrickkim: pong
[05:55:10] <pcwalton> well, Servo shouldn't because Windows is bad at it
[05:55:23] <eddyb> pffffft. windows again
[05:56:05] <patrickkim> i find my pr failed in test, so i looked build log. but i can't understand what is error
[05:56:11] <eddyb> pcwalton: the usecase would be loading servo with an UI toolkit and whatnot in JS (think node-webkit) and forking that process to start apps, reusing as much memory as possible
[05:56:31] <jdm> sounds like firefox os
[05:57:09] <eddyb> jdm: do they do that already? I have to check it out then. but I'd rather do it after s/firefox/servo :P

[06:23:18] <patrickkim> i build that my own linux machine, it build success
[06:23:31] <jdm> bleah
[06:23:46] <jdm> this is probably because aydinkim's build keeps failing
[06:23:53] <jdm> and I think that's updating rust or something
[06:24:04] <jdm> or else this is just one of those races we keep seeing
[06:24:52] <jdm> let's see if a retry fixes it
[06:25:02] <patrickkim> ah ok.

[15:12:07] <jgraham> Dumb, but related question. How does one iterate over the attrs_insert_order list. I assumed something like for &(name, _) in  elem.attrs_insert_order.iter() {} but the compiler had other ideas
[15:12:21] <jgraham> (I guess this will conflict with Ms2ger's change)
[15:12:27] <Ms2ger> Right
[15:12:53] <jdm> jgraham: what's the error that throws?
[15:13:09] <Ms2ger> Why the &?
[15:13:29] <jgraham> error: cannot move out of dereference of & pointer
[15:13:42] <jdm> jgraham: you probably want ref name, then
[15:13:56] <jack> jdm: i havne't pushed any submodules because i wasn't sure all of them were final
[15:14:09] <jack> os x "works" but only if you don't compile with any debugging
[15:14:10] <jgraham> Ms2ger: Without the & it said something about expected an &(~str, Namespace) got a tuple
[15:14:40] <jack> linux needs a bit more work on a submoule or two. i forgot which one off hand but will find out shortly.
[15:15:02] <jack> i have no idea right now what to do about the osx problem. i'm hoping it's broken on linux as well so that you or brson can take a look.
[15:15:10] <Ms2ger> Oh right
[15:15:16] <jack> or that the recent PR that landed fixes it.
[15:15:20] <Ms2ger> That's actually the same thing that annoyed me just now
[15:15:21] <jdm> jack: "the osx problem"?
[15:15:24] <jdm> oh
[15:15:34] <jack> but now i have like another 10 days of rust upgrades to do.
[15:15:49] <jdm> sisyphus
[15:16:02] <jack> and it has to be rebased over all the android changes and whatever else happened.
[15:16:17] <jack> oh, and i was waiting for android to land first.
[15:16:36] <jack> jdm: do you have an osx machine at all?
[15:16:53] <jack> does michael woerrister use irc? :)
[15:17:11] <jdm> jack: I have a 10.6 machine; I don't think it's at the office so I can't get to it until tonight though
[15:17:31] <jdm> and mw has used IRC in the past, but I don't think he idles

[15:32:39] <jdm> so much nicer to read
[15:34:10] <jgraham> Well presumably the way to make the old thing easy to ready would have been to indroduce a python-style ordered map

[15:34:39] <jgraham> (not saying that would have been the right thing to do)
[15:34:53] <jdm> jgraham: no, the hashmap mangle operation was the real burden there

[15:35:56] <Ms2ger> Having the two definitely made it messy
[15:36:05] <jgraham> In any case if servo actually ships I guess this code will get some special cases for perf that will kill readability again :)
[15:36:52] <Ms2ger> I dunno, Gecko's storage doesn't look much unlike this
[15:37:21] <Ms2ger> Well, no, it doesn't store Attr objects
[15:37:40] <Ms2ger> But it's a loop over an array too

[16:44:20] <jack> yay
[16:46:09] <jgraham> Ms2ger: BTW what's the current deal with w-p-t in servo?
[16:47:00] <Ms2ger> No deal right now :)
[16:47:11] <Ms2ger> I was hoping to steal most of your code
[16:47:23] <Ms2ger> But that'd probably involve a Servo-marionette
[16:47:26] <Ms2ger> (A serviette?)
[16:47:26] <jgraham> Right
[16:47:32] <jgraham> Heh
[16:47:44] <jgraham> We have the project codename at least
[16:48:03] <jgraham> I just meant in terms of getting them to run at all\
[16:48:25] <jgraham> I need to pull your fork of w-p-t?
[16:48:32] <Ms2ger> I've got some code I pointed you at
[16:48:36] <jdm> w-a-t i-s w-p-t?
[16:48:50] <jgraham> web-platform-tests
[16:48:54] <Ms2ger> Yeah, branches in my w-p-t, th.js and servo repos
[16:49:04] <jgraham> Ms2ger: OK
[16:49:13] <Ms2ger> The main thing I wanted to get done was expected failures
[16:50:24] *** Joins: canhtak (canhtak@moz-59105D0.wl.t.ulaval.ca)
[16:51:01] <jgraham> So it might be possible to reuse a bunch of my code without serviette. I will have a look/think
[16:52:13] <Ms2ger> Great, thanks :)
[16:55:32] <jgraham> Ms2ger: At first glance the only thing that looks challenging is starting the browser all the time. The current code really assumes that firefox starts once and keeps running until it crashes

[17:52:39] <Ms2ger> At that point you can just click "Back to Review" rather than submitting the draft
[17:52:53] <Ms2ger> And only submit once you've reviewed everything

[18:35:50] <discomfitor> for https://github.com/mozilla/servo/issues/1169 is this naming only servo tasks or tasks from rust itself?
[18:36:01] <discomfitor> because in servo there seems to be only 1 unnamed task
[18:36:11] <discomfitor> and in rust there's only a couple in libextra

[19:17:49] <larsberg> kmc: are you using the Intel driver? It worked without warnings on Nouveau for me.
[19:18:23] <pcwalton> the one thing I can think of is that the authentication cookie is wrong

[19:18:42] <kmc> yes, intel
[19:19:05] <pcwalton> if it's saying "OK" it means that there aren't any error codes
[19:19:13] <pcwalton> so, I suspect it's something stupid
[19:19:42] <pcwalton> kmc: can you do one thing real quick? can you install xtrace then run drm-server through xtrace?

[21:21:20] <jack> doesn't work because LayoutElement is a local and can't have lifetime 'a
[21:21:36] <jack> but we use that 'a lifetime in constructs like this: https://github.com/mozilla/servo/blob/master/src/components/style/selector_matching.rs#L606-L613
[21:21:52] <pcwalton> jack: f: <'a>|&'a LayoutElement<'a>|
[21:21:54] <pcwalton> use that
[21:21:58] <jack> i am working around it by refactoring the style code to use double nested with_element()
[21:22:10] <jack> pcwalton: that won't work. it's fundamentally unsafe.
[21:22:18] <pcwalton> it already has a transmute in it :)
[21:22:21] <jack> i can't make a local have a lifetime greater than the function's lifetime
[21:22:39] <pcwalton> this should be refactored to not use the with pattern anyway
[21:22:48] <jack> i assume that was a "we know what we're doing" transmute
[21:23:00] <jack> this would be a "we are doing it anyway!" transmute, which seems bad.
[21:23:07] <pcwalton> we shouldn't use the with pattern
[21:23:16] <jack> fi tha'ts the case then the work around is fine for now
[21:23:32] <pcwalton> yeah

[21:34:26] <jack> ok. rebase done. crashes on trying to read from closed ports
[21:34:35] <jack> which is probably a bug i introduced replacing peek()
[21:35:08] <jack> of course, there is basically no way to debug this, which is why i was working on the linux upgrade
[21:37:57] <larsberg> if you get really lucky, using RUST_LOG=servo::* will sometimes give you enough of a printf-style trace to know where it was when it blew up
