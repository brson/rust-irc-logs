[08:59:44] <ponce> hi, is there a 3D math library in Rust out there?
[09:00:18] <bjz> ponce: I'm working on one, it's currently broken though
[09:00:41] <bjz> ponce: I have a lot of things to keep up to date :P
[09:00:57] <bjz> ponce: https://github.com/bjz/lmath-rs
[09:01:42] <bjz> ponce: really needs to be re-organised too
[09:02:03] <bjz> ponce: there's also nalgebra: https://github.com/sebcrozet/nalgebra
[09:02:31] <ponce> I'm just curious about how to a struct Vector[T] with templated size
[09:02:37] <ponce> thanks
[09:02:55] <bjz> ponce: you can't, at least not yet :(
[09:03:19] <ponce> ok so no generics based on values?
[09:03:25] <bjz> no
[09:03:28] <bjz> :(
[09:03:47] <bjz> it's something I think we should have
[09:03:52] <ponce> strange since generics looks like monomorphized C++ templates
[09:03:59] <bjz> yes
[09:04:21] <bjz> there is only so much the devs can work on at once though
[09:04:35] <bjz> btw, I'd reccomend heading over to the official channell
[09:04:44] <bjz> this one should really be ##rust
[09:04:56] <bjz> irc.mozilla.org
[09:05:01] <bjz> loads more folks there
[09:05:02] <ponce> I won't come in and shoot "implement it, else"
[09:05:10] <bjz> it's what the devs use
[09:05:13] <bjz> no worries!
[09:05:21] <bjz> it wasn't what I was implying
[09:05:37] <ponce> I'm pretty sure it will be sorted out given time
[09:05:45] <bjz> yep
[09:05:50] <bjz> like a lot of things
[09:06:11] <bjz> you planning on playing with 3d graphics?
[09:06:34] <ponce> just evaluating what the best way to try rust
[09:06:38] <ponce> +is
[09:07:47] <ponce> no operator overloading either?
[09:07:51] <ponce> https://github.com/bjz/lmath-rs/blob/master/src/math/vec.rs
[09:08:09] <bjz> there is, but it needs to be improved
[09:08:18] <bjz> you can't do multiple overlods
[09:08:35] <bjz> it will be though, nmatsakis has said
[09:08:49] <bjz> btw, I'll show you something I've been working on
[09:08:58] <ponce> please do
[09:09:48] <bjz> https://gist.github.com/bjz/f185d9e604dd8c9ac00d
[09:10:58] <bjz> currently broken, and incomplete, but it's a different way of doing things
[09:11:05] <bjz> than what I currently have
[09:11:59] <ponce> reminds me of Algebra being implemented in C++ templates at last-job[-1]
[09:12:03] <bjz> unfortunately macros are the best we have atm for mata programming. that will hopefully be improved though
[09:12:19] <ponce> I'm not sure I understand what Rust macros allow
[09:12:34] <bjz> basically just AST transformations
[09:12:56] <ponce> I guess that should alleviate the lack of generics-base-on-values?
[09:12:57] <bjz> they're AST based, not textual like in the C preprocessor
[09:13:11] <bjz> eh, not really
[09:13:41] <bjz> I tried going crazy with them and turned lmath into an unmaintanable mess
[09:13:59] <bjz> they also run before the type checker
[09:14:31] <bjz> so basically
[09:14:38] <ponce> well at least the order is defined :)
[09:14:51] <bjz> do you know the concepts proposal in C++?
[09:15:07] <ponce> it looks very similar to your gist
[09:15:12] <ponce> amirite?
[09:15:14] <bjz> which?
[09:15:30] <ponce> the one with traits everywhere
[09:15:34] <bjz> concepts?
[09:15:54] <ponce> looks like Rust can make traits sum
[09:16:02] <ponce> looks like C++ concepts
[09:16:07] <bjz> yes yes
[09:16:27] <bjz> so Rust is sort of starting with Concepts
[09:16:33] <ponce>  pub fn i<'a>(&'a self, i: uint) -> &'a T;
[09:16:41] <ponce> what does 'a means?
[09:16:48] <bjz> 'a is a lifetime
[09:17:07] <ponce> ok it means: mut or &mut or @ or @mut... ?
[09:17:25] <bjz> so it ensures that the reference returned is valid for the lifetime of self
[09:17:37] <bjz> Rust will typecheck that
[09:18:05] <bjz> and tell you if your lifetimes are wrong, thereby ensuring your references don't become invalid
[09:18:22] <bjz> remember, it's static - no runtime overhead
[09:18:31] <ponce> so what can 'a be? if that means anything?
[09:18:45] <bjz> I could make it 'bananas
[09:18:53] <bjz> 'a is just a convention
[09:18:56] <bjz> like T, U
[09:20:17] <bjz> lifetimes are good, because they give the compiler extra information to help it ensure your being safe. In the future it *might* allow us to do more optimisation than C or C++
[09:20:18] *** Quits: maxter (~maxter@gaffeless.chaperon.volia.net) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)

[09:21:15] *** Joins: maxter_ (~maxter@gaffeless.chaperon.volia.net)
[09:21:16] <bjz> &mut is a mutable reference
[09:21:38] <bjz> in rust, const is the default, you have to declare mutability
[09:22:02] <ponce> is Rust memory safe?
[09:22:06] <bjz> yes
[09:22:13] <ponce> if you don't use unsafe blocks or features, that is
[09:22:18] <bjz> ofc
[09:22:25] <bjz> (was about to say that)
[09:22:42] <ponce> what is the pointer aliasing policy
[09:22:49] <bjz> the opinion of the devs is `unsafe` is greppable
[09:23:07] <bjz> that would be a question for the official channel
[09:23:21] <bjz> I don't know enough about the soecifics
[09:23:25] <bjz> *specifics
[09:23:29] <ponce> ok
[09:23:54] <ponce> thanks for the explanations :)
[09:24:32] <bjz> the channel is rather active all through the day - we have knowlegable folks in all time zones, thankfully
[09:24:46] <bjz> but the devs are on during PST
[09:25:10] *** Quits: maxter (~maxter@sundownness.lullaby.volia.net) (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
[09:25:15] <bjz> ponce: how did you hear about rust?
[09:25:39] <ponce> I am following closely the battle for the next system language :)
[09:25:55] <bjz> hah
[09:25:58] <bjz> between?
[09:25:59] <ponce> being involved way too much with C++
[09:26:11] <ponce> D, Rust, Nimrod (Go doesn't count;)
[09:26:23] <bjz> ATS?
[09:26:26] <bjz> x)
[09:27:37] <bjz> so what attracts you about Rust?
[09:27:59] <ponce> for the time being, I'll keep being a D fanboy, but
[09:28:00] <bjz> do you think it stands much of a chance?
[09:28:05] <ponce> lack of GC is a big one
[09:28:07] <bjz> np
[09:28:19] <bjz> well, optional GC
[09:28:20] <ponce> bjz: hard to say without being involved a bit more
[09:28:27] <ponce> what I know is
[09:28:38] <ponce> C++ is wasting our time a LOT
[09:29:08] <ponce> it's best feature are only optimizing backend
[09:29:09] <bjz> GC is going to be libified (it is currently built into the runtime) with language hooks to make it pluggable and nice to use
[09:29:14] <bjz> mm
[09:29:55] <bjz> what wastes your time?
[09:29:56] <ponce> what is nice with Rust is that you acknoledge that the GC is actually not needed
[09:30:39] <bjz> yeah, if you actually study the innovations in type theory, you can understand that
[09:30:42] <bjz> :)
[09:30:43] <ponce> C++ woes: compilation-time, focus on performance where it doesn't even matter, hard maintainability and diversity of styles
[09:31:30] <ponce> it gets a lot of things right also
[09:31:41] <bjz> C++?
[09:31:47] <ponce> yes
[09:31:50] <bjz> agreed
[09:32:13] <bjz> there's a reason why it's still used so much
[09:33:20] <bjz> ponce: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substructural_type_system#Linear_type_systems
[09:36:46] <bjz> ponce: do you know we don't have null?
[09:37:03] <bjz> (well, apart from for unsafe ptrs)
[09:37:50] <ponce> honestly I don't find lack of null or memory safety that compelling features, might be invaluable in teams though
[09:38:32] <bjz> mm, np
[09:39:17] <bjz> Option types are damn cool though
[09:40:11] <ponce> yes, it's the #1 thing that would make the C++ maintenance programmer life better (forced exhaustive match)

[09:42:17] <bjz> are you interested in concurrency?
[09:44:48] <ponce> I think that once you get around 100% CPU usage, the specific concurrency construct you used do not matter that much, except
[09:45:15] <ponce> that the OS scheduler is a bit too clueless about what need to be done first
[09:46:10] <ponce> that can be a real problem given a non trivial concurrent workload
