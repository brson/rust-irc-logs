[01:52:52] <Layl> dpc, depends, what do you want to render fonts into
[01:53:14] <Layl> tjscanlon, in piston you still need to use glutin
[01:53:19] <Layl> though not directly
[01:53:29] <Layl> you almost never have to use the unsafe parts of glutin
[01:54:19] <dpc> gfx-rs
[01:54:44] <dpc> I'm using gfx-rs and glutin it seems.
[01:54:55] <Layl> there's a nice crate, gfx_text
[01:54:59] <Layl> it makes text rendering pretty easy
[01:55:09] <Layl> though it has some bugs and graphical glitches
[01:55:22] <Layl> (it's very early in development)
[01:55:58] <niconii> aww, libcaca support in glutin doesn't work yet :(

[01:56:36] <dpc> Layl, Oh, wow. It really looks nice.
[01:58:31] <Layl> I really really think piston should just get rid of all the uses of glfw or sdl2 in the examples

[01:58:43] <Layl> because really there's no good reason for generic use to not use glutin
[01:59:02] <dpc> I am so confused with all this toolkits. :D
[01:59:25] <dpc> Piston, running on top of gfx, which runs on top of sdl / glfw / glutin or something like this.
[01:59:42] <jpernst> on the plus side, having all these choices means the ecosystem is very healthy
[01:59:50] <Layl> piston doesn't run on top of gfx, it runs on top of any backend you give it
[01:59:54] <jpernst> i'd be concerned if there were only one option
[02:00:07] <WindowsBunny> Please use glutin
[02:00:14] <WindowsBunny> Because it depends on winapi on windows :D
[02:00:31] <dpc> Is glutin Vulcan-ready?
[02:00:40] <Layl> what does that mean
[02:01:11] <Layl> Glutin's an opengl context creation library
[02:01:15] <Layl> it creates opengl contexts
[02:01:42] <WindowsBunny> But I'm pretty sure tomaka will provide a way to create vulkan contexts in glutin
[02:02:10] <Layl> That's really going to depend on the way the APIs are going to work out isn't it?
[02:02:13] <jpernst> as far as i know there's no public spec for vulkan yet, so there's not a lot anyone can do
[02:02:38] <dpc> Vulcan is based on Mantle, AFAIK
[02:03:19] <Layl> tjscanlon, btw with unsafe, if what you're referring to is the gl bits, you can use glium for that
[02:03:24] <Layl> which is a safe opengl wrapper
[02:03:34] <dpc> I have a GlutinWindow, I need to get a "factory"...
[02:03:38] <Layl> dpc, based on != is
[02:03:54] <Layl> I think what you're looking for is the WindowBuilder
[02:04:07] <Layl> just do glutin::WindowBuilder::new()
[02:04:21] <Layl> this is a common pattern in rust to create things
[02:04:23] <dpc> https://github.com/PistonDevelopers/gfx_text/blob/master/examples/styles.rs#L21
[02:04:34] <dpc> Do I need to use gfxw, and what that is?
[02:04:56] <Layl> this here is gfx_window_glutin
[02:05:07] <Layl> there's a use up top that's renaming it
[02:05:13] <Layl> which is rather confusing for an example
[02:05:18] <Layl> "use gfx_window_glutin as gfxw;"
[02:05:39] <Layl> gfx_window_glutin is what you need to use to set up the glutin backend for gfx
[02:05:59] <dpc> What's the difference between gfx_window_glutin and GlutinWindow that I already have? :D
[02:06:18] <Layl> well, gfx_window_glutin is a crate
[02:06:22] <Layl> and GlutinWindow is a struct
[02:07:13] <Layl> just to explain, you need gfx_window_glutin to create the gfx objects you need to actually use gfx
[02:07:15] <dpc> glutin_window is a create too, it seems.
[02:07:36] <Layl> glutin_window is unrelated to this
[02:07:40] <Layl> it's a backend for piston
[02:07:52] <dpc> It seems I just create GlGraphics::new(OpenGL::_3_2) and render on that ....
[02:08:13] <Layl> GlGraphics is entirely unrelated to anything here
[02:08:16] <dpc> Every time I play with this I'm so confused. :D
[02:09:24] <Layl> so, basically what you need to do is create a glutin window, doesn't matter if it's with WindowBuilder::new() or not
[02:09:43] <Layl> then pass that window into gfx_window_glutin::init()
[02:09:54] <Layl> that will create the gfx objects you need to work with gfx
[02:10:03] <Layl> stream, device and factory

[02:15:55] <Layl> glutin_window again is something entirely different
[02:15:56] <dpc> I guess the reason is I'm using Piston.
[02:16:03] <Layl> ah I see
[02:16:14] <dpc> So there are wrapper traits etc.
[02:16:21] <Layl> well doing that and wanting to use gfx_text is a bit more complex

[02:16:39] <Layl> you can't just directly do that
[02:16:50] <Layl> since piston itself takes ownership of gfx' stuff

[02:17:20] <Layl> which gives you those gfx objects again while rendering in piston
[02:17:35] <Layl> https://github.com/PistonDevelopers/piston_window
[02:20:39] <dpc> Hmmm... But in my functions I pass only GlGraphics objects all over.

[02:28:06] <Layl> amstrad, what's up with them?
[02:28:27] <amstrad> Lay1: the Add trait takes ownership of the thing being added
[02:28:34] <amstrad> Lay1: so for example..
[02:28:41] <amstrad> let a = Vector2::new();
[02:28:47] <amstrad> let b = Vector2::new();
[02:29:07] <amstrad> let c = a + b; // ownership of b sent to Add trait
[02:29:22] <Layl> yes, it should also send ownership of a
[02:29:35] <amstrad> right, but that isn't really desirable is it?
[02:29:40] <Layl> why not
[02:29:55] <amstrad> Layl: what would i do in this scenario ?
[02:30:07] <amstrad> let c = a.clone() + b.clone(); ?
[02:30:22] <amstrad> or
[02:30:25] <Layl> well, yes I would assume
[02:30:33] <amstrad> let c = &a + &b;
[02:30:51] <jpernst> if the thing you're adding implements Copy, you don't need to worry about the ownership
[02:30:53] <amstrad> Layl: what do the existing rust math libraries do in this regard?
[02:31:20] <amstrad> jpernst: oh, ok, so if i implement the Copy trait, everything should just work out?
[02:31:32] <jpernst> yes, provided your type is able to do so
[02:31:40] <jpernst> like a simple math vector is an ideal candidate for copy
[02:31:42] <Layl> it makes the copy implicit right?
[02:31:47] <jpernst> yes
[02:31:58] <Layl> it still happens, you just don't have to write .clone()

[02:32:15] <jpernst> clone is for types that require a deep copy
[02:32:55] <jpernst> so in those cases you need to explicitly ask for it
[02:33:30] <jpernst> copy is for when the type is "POD" in c++ terms
[02:35:21] <eddyb> jpernst: not "deep"
[02:35:27] <eddyb> we had a DeepClone trait a long time ago
[02:35:47] <jpernst> ah, right, yeah

[02:35:58] <eddyb> it's the least amount of effort to duplicate ownership

[02:36:20] <jpernst> yeah
[02:36:25] <eddyb> for types that are Copy, that's a copy. for Rc<T>, that's a refcount bump

[09:34:44] *** Quits: mithsv (mithsv@moz-gahb71.dynamic.caiway.nl) (Connection closed)
[09:35:10] <tomaka> it says "Certain events can result in a reset of the GL context. After such an event, it is referred to as a lost context and is unusable for almost all purposes"
[09:35:16] <tomaka> it says that you must then recreate a new context
[09:36:09] <tomaka> but the next page, it says that if some function returns an error, then calling it again doesn't return an error, then a context reset was encountered and completed
[09:36:16] <tomaka> what does it mean for it to be "completed"
[09:36:18] <squiggy> tomaka, i want project to join it
[09:36:50] <tomaka> and why would it stop returning an error if a lost context needs to be recreated
[09:37:15] <tomaka> page 40 of the 4.5 specs
[09:37:31] <tomaka> Amaranth: OneSadCookie: summoning the experts ^ if you have an idea :o)
[09:37:45] <OneSadCookie> tomaka: the extension says "Recovery from such events requires recreation of all objects in the affected context"
[09:37:49] <OneSadCookie> not recreation of the context
[09:38:05] <tomaka> the core specs say "requires creating a new context"
[09:38:10] <OneSadCookie> hmm
[09:38:38] <OneSadCookie> (we never dealt with this at apple, it happened post-4.1, but I remember reading the spec at some point)
[09:39:27] <tomaka> Okay that's going to be fun
[09:39:36] <tomaka> the core specs and KHR_robustness say that you must recreate the context
[09:39:38] <OneSadCookie> looks like this is a mis-edit
[09:39:45] <tomaka> but ARB_robustness and EXT_robustness only say that you must recreate the objects
[09:39:58] <OneSadCookie> as in, the original extension worked one way, then they changed their mind but didn't fix the wording
[09:40:30] <OneSadCookie> I agree, the core profile wording implies it's entirely unrecoverable, and once you see that error you should discard the whole context
[09:40:41] <tomaka> ok
[09:40:44] <tomaka> that seems logical
[09:41:48] <tomaka> I also prefer to require recreating the context altogether

[09:43:14] <OneSadCookie> my guess is they realized that certain driver architectures couldn't guarantee non-corruption of non-object context state
[09:43:19] <OneSadCookie> and so made the provisions stricter

[11:00:29] <Layl> it's really odd because it seems to be inconsistent accross GPU but not accross drivers, since it's the same driver
[11:00:38] <tomaka> well, it's not really an issue

[11:00:46] <fkaa> if it is a different gpu it's a different driver

[11:01:24] <tomaka> so that the behavior is consistent

[14:48:18] <Amaranth> I can't help but think of IE6
[14:49:47] <Tiffany> we have a lot of IE6s, amaranth
[14:49:50] <Tiffany> vendor lock-in abound
[14:51:08] <Tiffany> is this in reference to applications which only support nvidia graphics and nothing else?
[14:51:17] <cmr> no
[14:51:28] <cmr> it's intel and amd copying nvidia driver behavior

[14:51:52] <Amaranth> I wonder if Intel has piglit running on Windows
[14:52:57] <cmr> Piglit claims to run on Windows.
[14:53:10] <cmr> I think that is what waffle was for.
[14:53:21] <cmr> Although I'm not sure if piglit actually switched to waffle...
[14:55:23] <Amaranth> Hmm, glium/gluting pushing sRGB by default everywhere might be a bad idea
[14:55:54] <Tiffany> oh
[14:56:01] <Amaranth> Oh right tomaka mentioned that too
[14:56:02] <Tiffany> that explains why my experience with srgb has been so screwy
[14:56:04] <Amaranth> "With Windows 7, all the default framebuffers are sRGB capable however there is no way to explicitly request a linear or sRGB color encoding. Additionally, maybe the default framebuffer is effectively sRGB however Windows compositor interprets sRGB values as linear RGB values anyway hence producing the result in figure 3 and 5. This would mean that Windows effectively doesn't support sRGB framebuffer natively which would be shocking but
[14:56:04] <Amaranth>  not impossible."
[14:56:07] <Tiffany> I haven't been able to actually get it to work
[14:56:47] <tomaka> Well, that's exactly why glium exists
[14:56:51] <tomaka> so that it can bypass driver bugs
[14:56:55] <tomaka> and enforce good behavior
[14:57:15] <tomaka> I say "driver bugs", I mean driver bugs, inconsistencies, etc.
[14:57:45] <Amaranth> tomaka: Sounds like in this case part of the bug is in the compositor and the workaround given is to disable sRGB framebuffer
[14:58:09] <tomaka> but only for the default framebuffer, right?
[14:58:21] <Amaranth> Right
[14:59:45] <Amaranth> nvidia has it off by default but accepts sRGB attachments as if it were on or this were GLES
[15:00:02] <Amaranth> Intel and AMD followed that behavior but don't lie and report it is on by default, more or less
[15:01:17] <Amaranth> And either way it apparently all ends in tears unless you force it off *shrug*

[15:04:34] <Tiffany> how is srgb supposed to work in the first place?
[15:04:57] <Tiffany> I'm guessing the default mechanism is to assume the default framebuffer is linearly encoded, and then srgb convert that before sending it off to the monitor?
[15:05:05] <Tiffany> but then that results in precision loss
[15:05:28] <Tiffany> so application developers request an srgb-encoded framebuffer and use a much higher precision linear intermediary buffer (like 16F)

[17:34:21] <jpernst> the only way i've found to get srgb to work reliable is to use an srgb FBO then blit it to the default framebuffer with color conversion disabled so the srgb contents go directly to scanout

[17:39:44] <cmr> WindowsBunny: where do they not?
[17:40:01] * cmr has the various framebuffer_sRGB and texture_sRGB extensions
[17:40:11] <jpernst> they're currently broken in the intel mesa driver
[17:40:25] <WindowsBunny> cmr: I'm just glad it all works fine on windows
[17:40:27] <cmr> this is why we can't have nice things :(
[17:40:37] <jpernst> but only for the default framebuffer
[17:40:40] <jpernst> for an FBO it works fine
[17:40:44] <cmr> oh
[17:40:50] <cmr> they're broken everywhere for the default framebuffer
[17:40:59] <cmr> nobody knows what it means to not be broken
[17:41:05] <tomaka> the problem is that OpenGL ES has sRGB enabled by default
[17:41:09] <WindowsBunny> You have to create the default framebuffer in sRGB mode
[17:41:13] <jpernst> yeah, which is why my new policy is to just never trust the default and always use an FBO
[17:41:15] <tomaka> so if I want glium's behavior to be consistent between GLES and GL, I have no choice
[17:41:16] <WindowsBunny> which on windows works fine
[17:41:31] <WindowsBunny> I know because I used glfw to make my window have an sRGB framebuffer on windows
[17:41:32] <WindowsBunny> and it worked
[17:41:39] <cmr> WindowsBunny: http://www.g-truc.net/post-0720.html disagrees.
[17:42:13] <jpernst> pay a little for the overhead of the FBO blit, but it's not that bad, and much more reliable

[21:42:48] <XMPPwocky> it's actually one line of code for physics- you just add an extra contact normal, which is the direction to the thing you're grappling with, if you're past a certain distance
[21:49:18] <WindowsBunny> XMPPwocky: Of course it gets a bit complicated if you account for the rope bending around objects, or having its own weight, or the slight elasticity of the rope
[21:49:28] <XMPPwocky> right
[21:50:31] <WindowsBunny> XMPPwocky: And the rate at which your grappling gun can pull the rope back in depends on the force being exerted
[21:50:46] <WindowsBunny> pulling in slack is easy, lifting your body up a cliff, not so much
[21:51:07] <WindowsBunny> even worse if the hook gets caught on something that moves!
[21:51:18] <neikos> If it has it's own motor it's just your own strength of being able to lift yourself.
[21:51:27] <neikos> + the speed at which it moves initially
[21:52:05] <WindowsBunny> don't forget to adjust your own weight depending upon how much rope is inside the grappling gun!
[21:52:39] <neikos> Haha
[21:52:42] <neikos> Magic Rope!
[21:52:47] <niconii> that talk of bending around objects and elasticity reminds me of umihara kawase
[21:52:54] <RC9> so this is why valve made a game with portals
[21:52:58] <RC9> grappling hooks too hurd
[21:53:26] <niconii> which had a grappling hook like that
[21:54:39] <WindowsBunny> RC9: Portals are a bit tricky but simpler than good grappling hooks for sure
[21:54:43] <neikos> If you have a rope without elasticity, the algorithm simplifies a lot, otherwise gooooood luck!

[21:54:59] <RC9> i forget
[21:55:19] <WindowsBunny> starbound's grappling hook is pretty bad in my opinion

[22:57:49] <neikos> cmr: Sorry! Totally missed your reply! I would love to get some hints on how to get a solid client. What I envision is nothing too 'special' imo, MainMenu with SinglePlayer/Multiplayer/Quit. I know that you could abstract that with 'Scenes' but it feels a bit overkill to me. And the way I imagine it it makes pausing during play seem weird.
[22:58:28] <cmr> neikos: the usual way to do a lot of client stuff is to have a huge spaghetti state machine.

[23:00:40] <neikos> Haha, that's what it looks like in my head.
[23:01:00] <cmr> :)
[23:01:33] <cmr> That's not necessarily a bad thing; and menus are usually pretty hard to get wrong even with a ton of spaghetti.
[23:02:08] <cmr> I'm not sure what the details of your project are, but the gameplay logic and rendering is usually the most code (somewhat obviously)
[23:03:13] <neikos> Mhm, I don't want to get into rendering the gameworld right away, although since it's a voxel thing I don't think it will be all too difficult to prototype.

[23:03:42] <neikos> Well, time to check out Piston again.
[23:04:02] <cmr> I wouldn't worry too much about gettings things perfect or pretty, and instead focus on getting *anything* working. Can always rewrite once you have a better idea of what you need.
[23:04:08] <cmr> (I struggle with that a lot)
[23:05:50] <neikos> Well, I got the server working, and the tests I wrote pass. It is just 'handling' clients right now tho. But that is a start I suppose, so now I need a client to start connecting to that server ^^
[23:06:20] <neikos> Although I feel I use too many channels
[23:06:29] <neikos> on the other hand, they make things soo smooth
[23:06:37] <cmr> channels are nice.
[23:07:28] <neikos> I got two so far, and several threads that get the sender of one of these channels.
[23:10:51] <neikos> The way I set it up is that you have three 'threads' working. One `World` Thread that is just occupied of consolidating all the world updates into the current state. One `server` thread which is the important one and receives messages from all over, so stuff like clients interacting, connecting, disconnecting. It then sends a world update to the world thread and that then reacts. Then
[23:10:53] <neikos> there is the socket thread that pretty much just `accepts` all the time and spawns a new thread for a client, handling it's messages over TCP. It works so far, that is, a client can connect and gets added to the players hashmap, once it has 'authed' (for now just sends a name) it gets a connected status, and I plan to do stuff from that moment on.

[23:11:39] <neikos> I have no idea if I am overkilling stuff or not, but I like the way it works, and it seems to work. (And yay for rust! As I am sure it's threadsafe.)
[23:11:51] <neikos> At least in terms of ownership and access.
