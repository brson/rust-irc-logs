[12:38:32] <Tiffany> what's a "SAML-fueled nightmare"? (https://moderncrypto.org/mail-archive/noise/2015/000114.html)
[12:39:07] <Tiffany> Security Assertion Markup Language
[12:39:08] <Tiffany> oh dear
[12:47:03] <Tiffany> I don't really understand the terminology being used in describing noise 2
[12:47:12] <Tiffany> well, notation, not terminology
[12:47:17] <Tiffany> what does "e, dhee, s, dhse" mean?
[12:54:26] <Tiffany> oh
[12:54:42] <Tiffany> ephemeral key, DH of ephemeral keys, static key, DH of static and ephemeral key
[13:01:03] <Tiffany> for all of the configurations of boxes and handshakes the protocol supports, it's strange that it doesn't formally support asynchronous messages
[13:12:54] <Tiffany> oh
[13:13:02] <Tiffany> that's why noise does that rekeying every single message
[13:13:16] <Tiffany> it's because if your keys get leaked, you don't leak previous messages in the session
[13:14:56] <Tiffany> and with what I'm intending sessions could potentially last indefinitely
[13:48:40] <Tiffany> does anyone here have an opinion on sandstorm.io?
[13:48:55] <Tiffany> I've been looking at it, and it's kind of what I want to build, but it's more web based than I'd prefer
[13:49:11] <Tiffany> I could technically write a non-web client for an app I build on sandstorm, but it would have to communicate through http still
[13:49:20] <Tiffany> I think
[13:50:03] <Tiffany> oh
[13:50:14] <Tiffany> I guess it could authenticate and authorize over http, and then use anything I like
[13:50:39] <Tiffany> it's still not quite what I had in mind
[13:51:13] <Tiffany> like, if I were to build a chat application on this, it would be more like the web version of running weechat in tmux, than like running a bouncer with an upgraded client-bouncer protocol
[14:54:33] <eternaleye> Tiffany: I'd actually argue the point there...
[14:54:58] <eternaleye> Tiffany: Just because your communication is over HTTP doesn't mean your interface is, by any stretch.
[14:55:32] <eternaleye> Tiffany: Having a real client whose protocol happens to be based on REST is... not uncommon

[15:07:32] <eternaleye> Ilari: I think that using lowercase 'L' may have been suboptimal - when I got to "with order l" I had to copy/paste that into a cursive font to be sure it was an L, and not a 1 (though yes, that would have been nonsensical)
[16:22:55] <bascule> Tiffany: Cap'n Proto has its own RPC protocol which is != HTTP
[16:23:18] <bascule> Tiffany: in fact, the way Sandstorm tunnels HTTP traffic is by going from HTTP -> Cap'n Proto RPC -> HTTP again
[16:23:24] <bascule> we do something similar at Square o_O
[16:23:59] <Tiffany> yeah
[16:24:02] <Tiffany> oh
[16:24:07] <Tiffany> is that RPC exposed to the internet?
[16:24:18] <Tiffany> I'm having trouble finding docs on sandstorm
[16:24:28] <bascule> yes, it's designed to be used on hostile networks
[16:24:28] <Tiffany> they're all app-oriented and not about the actual architecture
[16:24:38] <cmr> the actual architecture is all capn proto
[16:24:41] <Tiffany> is it encrypted?
[16:24:43] <bascule> this is all documented on the front page of capnproto.org, FYI
[16:24:49] <bascule> I don't think it is for now
[16:24:55] <bascule> there are hooks so you can use e.g. TLS
[16:25:07] <bascule> I got Kenton pointed at the Noise mailing list
[16:25:50] <Tiffany> I really want a udp-based encrypted transport layer which isn't prone to head of line blocking
[16:26:18] <cmr> DTLS?
[16:26:24] <bascule> #trololol
[16:26:28] <cmr> :P
[16:26:29] <Tiffany> I keep getting suggested DTLS but really
[16:26:38] <Tiffany> that sounds like TLS but even more horrifying
[16:27:21] <bascule> Tiffany: I did ask Trevor about it
[16:27:31] <Tiffany> do the mainline TLS libraries even support DTLS?
[16:27:33] <cmr> I'm procrastinating implementing ICE in Rust because it needs encryption.
[16:27:38] <cmr> Tiffany: yes.
[16:27:45] <bascule> Tiffany: yes but they have horrible security vulnerabilities, heh
[16:27:49] <cmr> yeah
[16:27:50] <Tiffany> wonderful
[16:27:56] <cmr> Is DTLS even sound?
[16:28:02] <bascule> I... don't know
[16:28:03] <bascule> "I think the prologue can be used there, whether that's ideal I'm not
[16:28:04] <bascule> sure - you should post to list and we'll try to work it out."
[16:28:12] <Tiffany> I doubt it
[16:28:21] <cmr> I don't think it is but I haven't put a ton of thought into it yet.
[16:28:27] <bascule> ^^^ that's what Trevor said when I asked him about using the new "chain-of-DH" stuff for message-oriented use cases
[16:29:16] <Tiffany> prologue?
[16:29:45] <bascule> I'm... not entirely sure what he means myself ;)
[16:30:08] <Tiffany> I wonder if DTLS actually manages to protect against replay attacks and selective message dropping
[16:30:27] <bascule> I have no idea... I'm not sure how you could?
[16:31:26] <Tiffany> I see a bit of a way around it with this window sending thing, but I'm not entirely sure it works
[16:31:39] <Tiffany> if a packet is lost (due to selective drop or otherwise) it just gets packaged into the next window
[16:32:01] <Tiffany> and only windows with a sequence number more recent than the previous one will actually get accepted
[16:32:41] <Tiffany> which I suppose means I can do rekeying
[16:32:55] <Tiffany> and thus use noise unaltered
[16:33:17] <Tiffany> however, it would be prefereable for the rekey stream to allow arbitrarily large skips
[16:33:34] <Tiffany> because a malicious node could simply increment the sequence number by a million and send another window for a nice DoS
[16:34:26] <Tiffany> I suppose I should write up an RFC and post it to the mailing list
[16:36:42] <Tiffany> ah
[16:36:49] <Tiffany> the proper name for this appears to be a sliding window protocol?
[16:43:21] <bascule> sounds about right
[16:44:16] <Tiffany> hm
[16:44:30] <Tiffany> the ordering guarantees get a bit hairy when the windows start getting big enough that they have to be fragmented
[16:46:23] <Tiffany> no, that's fine
[16:48:02] <Tiffany> but it kind of destroys the ordering guarantee of only accepting the most recent window

[19:00:58] <eternaleye> Ilari: Since most distros unbundle firefox aggressively
[19:01:27] <Ilari> Yeah, The desktop one is actually Debian Iceweasel.
[19:02:09] <Ilari> It even maps /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libnss3.so ...
[19:04:32] <Ilari> Lol, proposal from Dan Brown...
[19:06:08] <Ilari> Fun... Notations. Some use ECDSA notations, some use EdDSA notations, and some apparently use a mix of two.
[19:10:53] <Ilari> Does that proposal from Dan Brown contain inversions mod order? Seems like it does, but I can't parse it properly.
[19:18:32] <eternaleye> Ilari: Er, I think you misunderstand my question re: nss
[19:18:39] <eternaleye> Ilari: Check the _version of NSS_
[19:18:54] <eternaleye> Ilari: Since that's where the logjam issue would exist/be fixed
[19:19:14] <eternaleye> Ilari: Or, heck, Debian might just plain compile NSS without FFDH
[19:19:24] <eternaleye> Or at least without EXPORT
[19:29:05] <Ilari> The EXPORT is not on client side, it is on server side.

[20:55:16] <Ilari> About what?
[20:55:21] <bascule> call me a zealot but we make hardware and I think PKCS#11 needs to die in a fire
[20:55:26] <bascule> about the future of hardware devices
[20:55:28] <Ilari> Well, Kenny is probably quite busy.
[20:55:47] <bascule> I wish I could get Square to give a statement on this
[20:56:19] <bascule> IUF fulfills the concerns of obsolete hardware devices with a large installed base, but even then
[20:56:29] <bascule> 1) it's unclear if these devices can fulfill any kind of security guarantees
[20:56:41] <bascule> 2) it's unclear if these devices can implement a CFRG-proposed scheme
[20:57:04] <Ilari> Also, IUF makes it all too easy to DoS the receiver.
[20:57:15] <Ilari> (Or something even worse)
[21:18:56] <Ilari> I think IUF is mainly useful for "smartcards" (even if IoT devices are quite limited, those should never need to deal with any sort of larger message).
[21:19:39] <Tiffany> I get an A+ on ssl labs now
[21:21:02] <Tiffany> I seem to be unable to set a content security policy though, because lighttpd is being weird
[21:26:08] <Ilari> Is it compatible with obsolete clients?
[21:29:22] <Tiffany> no
[21:29:36] <Tiffany> android 2.3, windows XP, and java 6 can all suck it
[21:31:17] <Tiffany> android 2.3 lacks SNI (this is on a virtual host), windows XP doesn't support any of the ciphersuites (no ECDHE/DHE, I guess?), and java 6 doesn't support DH parameters over 1024 bits
[21:31:25] <Ilari> For non-obsolete stuff, one can require ECDHE and TLS 1.2
[21:32:07] <Tiffany> I don't know if I can even disable TLS 1.0
[21:32:55] <Tiffany> I could probably support some more cipher suites
[21:33:15] <Tiffany> it's all AES128/256 CBC/GCM + SHA1/256/384
[21:33:36] <Tiffany> I wonder how long it'll take openssl to support chacha20 + poly1305
[21:36:54] <Ilari> Probably waiting for codepoint assignments.
[21:38:30] <Tiffany> oh
[21:38:39] <Tiffany> there were some codepoints mentioned in the RFC, but I guess they're not official?
[21:39:12] <Ilari> There's no RFC about Chacha20 in TLS yet.
[21:39:32] <Ilari> There's only WG draft (which is in shape where I think it could go to WGLC).
[21:40:38] <Tiffany> oh
[21:53:57] <Ilari> Then there's also WG draft about Curve25519 (which is in bit worse shape, but not much).

[23:08:26] <Tiffany> does anyone actually use the term "perfect forward secrecy" over just "forward secrecy"?
[23:08:44] <Tiffany> it seems like a waste
[23:11:52] * bascule has been actively campaigning against the former
[23:12:05] <bascule> http://tonyarcieri.com/imperfect-forward-secrecy-the-coming-cryptocalypse
[23:12:12] <bascule> I also renamed the Wikipedia article :o
[23:12:27] <Tiffany> nice
[23:12:54] <Tiffany> I would hold the term "perfect forward secrecy" off for something like quantum crypto where you literally cannot decrypt the contents without modifying the ciphertext
[23:13:02] <Tiffany> I think that's a thing
[23:13:12] <Tiffany> I don't know anything about quantum crypto other than that it's even less practical than one-time pads
[23:13:59] <bascule> perfect forward secrecy just means the key material can't be deterministically derived from some other secret
[23:14:43] <eternaleye> I'm a fan of "key erasure" as a term.
[23:14:43] <eternaleye> "Forward secrecy" is a *goal*
[23:14:44] <eternaleye> But even at that, it's ill-defined
[23:14:49] <eternaleye> "Key erasure" makes clear that the essential question is *when*
[23:14:51] <bascule> yeah me too
[23:14:52] <eternaleye> "When is the key that would enable decryption of this erased"
[23:15:07] <bascule> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Forward_secrecy#Forward_secrecy_vs_key_erasure
[23:15:27] <bascule> seems some dudebro on #crypto (intgr) doesn't like that
[23:15:56] <Tiffany> those linked phrases do as much work as bold
[23:16:07] <Tiffany> it makes this reply read so pretentiously in my mind though it probably shouldn't
[23:16:11] <Tiffany> it's making it incredibly amusing to read
[23:17:05] <bascule> fringe position that djb and matt green agree with
[23:17:05] <Tiffany> I'm kind of indifferent towards key erasure vs forward secrecy, as long as it's clear what is being done
[23:17:17] <bascule> "perfect forward secrecy" needs to die in a fire
[23:17:25] <Tiffany> but no crypto term should have 'perfect' in it unless it really is 'perfect'
[23:17:32] <bascule> yep
[23:17:43] <eternaleye> After each message? (Noise) After the session? (ECDHE in TLS)? After a few minutes? (Google's short-lived cert strategy)
[23:17:52] <eternaleye> The problem IMO is that all of those are being described as "forward secrecy" when they have meaningful differences, and "key erasure" as a term leads one to the question of "when", which is exactly the difference.
[23:17:53] <eternaleye> bascule: Yeah, but just because lots of people do it doesn't make it right :P
[23:17:54] <eternaleye> bascule: Although Wikipedia rules do enforce treating them as the same
[23:18:04] <Tiffany> if I delete my repeating-key XOR keys after each message, it doesn't make my messages any less decryptable
[23:18:09] <Tiffany> but it's perfect forward secrecy!
[23:18:59] <Tiffany> I guess it depends on your goals whether it matters too much to ask 'when'
[23:19:30] <Tiffany> the thought I had earlier is that if you can force the key erasure period to be larger, then you could have that happen, have the SWAT bust down your door, and come in and freeze your RAM and extract your keys
[23:19:33] <bascule> it's something I think needs changed. various wikipedia zealots prefer enforcing wikipedia policy
[23:19:38] <bascule> I don't like wikipedia policy
[23:19:46] <bascule> what people read in wikipedia affects what people think
[23:19:57] <Tiffany> well
[23:20:02] <Tiffany> it would be okay if wikipedia was being unbiased
[23:20:08] <Tiffany> but this terminology is fundamentally biased

[23:58:50] <Tiffany> this blog post is a lot more scary than my xor comparison
