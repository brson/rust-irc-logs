[00:35:03] <Gankro> Alright so: I thought that trains running meant that RFCs could be drastically cut down: pure API additions could be merged using the normal PR process and it would be fine because it's in nightly, which most people shouldn't be using. If desirable it could be promoted to stable beta, and if no issues arise it can be released. No?
[00:35:10] <Gankro> cc aturon acrichto huon 
[00:36:47] <steveklabnik> well
[00:36:54] <steveklabnik> the only downside of that approach is that first API to land wins
[00:37:04] <steveklabnik> in a certain sense
[00:37:14] <steveklabnik> people prefer already-written code to new suggestions :)
[00:37:16] <steveklabnik> but that's a small thing
[00:37:29] <steveklabnik> i'm in favor of whatever wrks, as far as process goes
[00:37:47] <bluss> as long as we know what rules there are
[00:38:07] <bluss> please make sure the rfc guidelines update with whatever you decide are the new rules
[00:39:00] <Gankro> Anyone familiar with what other languages do? iirc Python has a similar RFC-style process
[00:39:37] <acrichto> Gankro: controversial API additions should likely go through the RFC process, but minor APIs do not need an associated RFC
[00:39:52] <acrichto> Gankro: the libs subteam will convene for the ungating of a feature, which will require consensus
[00:40:21] <bluss> how do you know if the addition is controversial without having a discussion?
[00:40:22] <Gankro> acrichto: What do you picture: always submit a PR, if too much arguing occurs punt it to an RFC?
[00:40:50] <acrichto> Gankro: ideally it's determined ahead of time whether to send a PR or not
[00:40:59] <acrichto> most controversial topics will be fairly obvious ahead of time
[00:41:11] <acrichto> e.g. I believe it was appropriate for set_{read,write}_timeout to go through an RFC
[00:41:14] <Gankro> acrichto: Maybe for a core team member :)
[00:41:23] <acrichto> sure, but asking for an RFC is always fine
[00:43:08] <Gankro> acrichto: I'd argue the top two RFCs could be closed as "just send a PR"
[00:43:27] <acrichto> which two?
[00:44:36] <Gankro> Oh sorry, I was filtered on T-libs
[00:44:58] <Gankro> Result::expect and str::split_at(mid)
[00:45:27] <Gankro> There's nothing controversial about these, as far as I know. They're pretty straightforward.
[00:45:33] <acrichto> Result::expect is a change to a pretty core type, so it's somewaht borderline
[00:45:39] <acrichto> str::split_at I'd be fine without an RFC
[00:45:54] <bluss> I think writing rfcs for these is fine
[00:46:05] <acrichto> if you're willing to write an RFC that's always fine for sure :)
[00:46:34] <Gankro> bluss: I disagree; it makes the system more noisy, and adds burden to those who have to maintain it
[00:47:25] <bluss> acrichto: nah I intend to police changes and ask for rfcs.. That's what I thought was the rule for the project. And if we maintain that I'll try to have it followe
[00:48:03] <Gankro> bluss: I think that was largely a pre 1.0/teams policy
[00:48:52] <bluss> changing policy is certainly possible
[00:49:13] <acrichto> bluss: the library subteam is the one setting the policy for what requires an RFC or not
[00:49:27] <acrichto> and it has not been explicitly written down right now, but requiring an RFC for all changes is infeasible (as we've come to realize)
[00:49:33] <bluss> here's something acrichto said not long ago “We do plan to grow the standard library but we intend to do so purposefully and carefully to make sure it doesn't grow too fast.”
[00:50:12] <acrichto> right, we won't auto-accept everything but we also don't want to require 2 pages of rationale for all APIs
[00:50:20] <acrichto> some are pretty obvious that they should be added
[00:50:21] <bluss> fine
[00:50:55] <bluss> just make it relatively transparent and don't forget those not on the teams want to feel like they are part the project stewardship too
[00:51:08] <acrichto> this is definitely something under development though, and this decision will be made as a team soon (it's not just my own personal opinion)
[00:51:33] <acrichto> one route we may take for example is requiring an RFC to stabilize anything
[00:51:42] <aatch> I have a habit of implementing features that fall on the border. Small enough that an RFC is more work than the implementation, big enough that they require an RFC.
[00:51:46] <acrichto> or rather require at least one RFC (either to enter or stabilize)
[00:52:37] <bluss> an rfc isn't much work
[00:52:56] <aatch> Oh, on that topic: while I'm not sure if this is the library team's responsibility, would an `expect` intrinsic require an RFC?
[00:53:01] <acrichto> bluss: perhaps for the author, but a well written RFC is quite a good deal of work, and it significantly slows down the process as it requires much discussion and consensus
[00:53:24] <acrichto> aatch: libstd implementation details in the past have not required RFCs, but exposing a public API like that would likely require an RFC
[00:53:43] <aatch> bluss, no, but when the feature required about 20 mins of work and the RFC took closer to an hour...
[00:54:01] <bluss> aatch: that sounds ok to me
[00:54:22] <aatch> bluss, I also didn't expect to have to write it.
[00:55:07] <sfackler> an RFC is an hour of work and ~2 months of delay
[00:55:16] <bluss> well, I just thought that we required RFCs for additions to libstd
[00:55:17] <aatch> It's not that I disagree with doing it, I'm just unlucky.
[00:55:46] <Gankro> bluss a significant problem we have today is that people aren't reading rfcs because there are too many
[00:57:06] <Gankro> I think lib stabilization can be handled by the trains and weekly team digests
[00:57:34] <bluss> where is the community input in that?
[00:57:54] <aatch> Hopefully I can fast-track an expect intrinsic, given that we already have `assume`.
[00:58:21] <bluss> assume is quite a beast in comparison I think
[00:58:25] <Gankro> You can input on PRs and announcements if you have issues
[00:58:29] <bluss> much more complicated
[00:59:14] <Gankro> But RFCs are like concensus heavy artillery. 
[00:59:37] <bluss> not sure if it has to be so complicated
[00:59:38] <aatch> bluss, exactly my point. `expect` doesn't actually change semantics, it only hints to the compiler.
[01:00:13] <bluss> I managed to file an uncontroversial RFC, acrichto commented basically yay and you could just leave it be for a week and then it's done?
[01:00:40] <bluss> ok maybe that's noise if everyone files rfcs
[01:01:02] <aatch> My motivation is that I have some code with a branch that, given random input, will be taken 0.0000000000000000108% of the time.

[05:52:58] <o11c> ChrisMorgan: I think we already live in a post-API world. Not Rust I mean, but the whole "everybody vendors their dependencies because they're not stable"
[05:53:28] <ChrisMorgan> … and a fat lot of good that does one.
[05:54:35] <ChrisMorgan> You end up with a Node.js project having five different versions of a library, one of which is strongly incompatible with the rest and another of which has severe issues, and they can mingle easily and badly.
[05:55:54] <ChrisMorgan> And in a point release behaviour changes three levels of dependencies deep so that a g flag on a regular expression that was harmless (though pointless, I don’t know why the original author wrote it) suddenly breaks the app on every second action.
[05:57:00] <ChrisMorgan> And so what you end up with from that last item is a mortal dread of any form of upgrading.

[06:16:38] <eternaleye> o11c: As someone who does distro packaging, not really, no
[06:16:48] <eternaleye> o11c: Exherbo works pretty hard at that
[06:17:51] <eternaleye> o11c: As an example, Exherbo supports parallel-installing multiple versions of ICU, libpng, etc. via the "slots" mechanism, with dependencies locking in to "best installed version matching dependency" at install time of the dependent.
[06:19:29] <eternaleye> o11c: Now, there *is* the fact that C is nowhere near as capable as Rust at handling that, because it doesn't version symbols - but those dependencies combined with blocker specifications between, say, versions of ICU, are sufficient to rebuild stuff that uses the older lib against the newer lib to handle ABI breaks.
[06:19:48] <eternaleye> o11c: (er, doesn't version symbols _automatically_)
[06:21:12] <eternaleye> o11c: One of my pet peeves is, in fact, that language-specific package managers tend to range between "ignorant of" and "hostile to" the distro package manager, and awareness of *how good* distro package managers can be is near-zero.
[06:21:33] <eternaleye> o11c: And bundled libs from upstream are not happiness-inducing either.
[06:23:04] <eternaleye> o11c: Heck, Exherbo's haskell support puts each version in a separate slot, because haskell (unlike C) handles that sanely - much as Rust does, though Rust does it better IMO.
[06:24:06] <eternaleye> o11c: And Exherbo can even handle conditional build options, and dependencies on certain options being enabled.
[06:28:22] <o11c> billions of slots is a *bad* thing
[06:28:52] <o11c> ICU should have never been socially allowed to break API/ABI in the first place
[06:29:08] <eternaleye> o11c: Billions of slots is bad in C, I agree.
[06:29:18] <o11c> it's always bad
[06:29:26] <eternaleye> o11c: Disagree strongly.
[06:29:36] <o11c> it's hard to handle in C, but it's bad even if it's easy to handle
[06:30:09] <eternaleye> o11c: When the PM can cleanly offer to purge unused versions, version skew is handled via the language itself (haskell, rust), and parallel install is safe and efficient?
[06:30:45] <eternaleye> o11c: It works out to a system-wide version of *exactly what Cargo does*
[06:30:55] <o11c> yeah, except that's not praiseworthy
[06:31:03] <o11c> if your APIs are that broken, you're doing something wrong

[06:31:42] <eternaleye> o11c: ICU rarely-to-never breaks API.
[06:31:47] <eternaleye> o11c: ABI is a different story.
[06:31:58] <o11c> then it is especially unforgivable that they break ABI so often
[06:32:07] <eternaleye> o11c: *shrug*
[06:32:23] <eternaleye> o11c: Rust versions every symbol, so it's a bit hard to claim ABI breaks are evil badwrong there...
[06:32:40] <o11c> valid cases for keeping API but not ABI are e.g. the Qt3 -> Qt4 compatibility upgrades
[06:32:45] <o11c> it shouldn't happen for every rebuild
[06:33:07] <eternaleye> o11c: Considering that's exactly counter to Rust's entire linking story...
[06:33:16] <o11c> well, rust's linking story is wrong
[06:33:37] <o11c> I can practically guarantee that distros will never ship rust packages
[06:33:40] <eternaleye> o11c: I think we disagree irreconcilably on that then
[06:34:06] <eternaleye> o11c: And I can practically guarantee that if cargo grows a mode to build without doing dependency building, Exherbo *will*
[06:35:04] <o11c> really missing the point
[06:35:05] <huon> distros ship go packages, and that has no concept of ABI compatibility at all
[06:35:22] <eternaleye> huon: Incorrect
[06:35:36] <o11c> even if some particular installation wants to use a nix/exherbo-style multiversion system
[06:35:40] <huon> eternaleye: in what sense; the default language is completely statically linked?
[06:35:48] <o11c> having stable APIs and ABIs is best for *everyone*
[06:35:53] <eternaleye> o11c: Exherbo and Nix address the issue completely differently
[06:36:37] <eternaleye> huon: No; Exherbo has support for packages explicitly denoting multiversion capability, and uses that to handle ABI/API breaks
[06:37:02] <huon> eternaleye: I'm missing something because I don't see how that's relevant to what I said
[06:37:11] <o11c> (it's basically just like libfoo1 and libfoo2 in Debian)

[06:37:58] <eternaleye> o11c: No, it's not.
[06:39:05] <eternaleye> o11c: Since they're the same package, dependencies on foo:=[<3] will match foo-1:1, foo-2:2, but not foo-3:3 - and at install time, will lock-on to whichever of foo-1 or foo-2 is installed, and if both will latch onto the "best" (foo-2)

[18:27:03] <Gankro> bluss: You left last night before I posted it, so in cased you missed it: https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/the-life-and-death-of-an-api/2087/
[18:29:03] <Eridius> Gankro: I think there's a bit of a middle ground too, which is submit an RFC issue (as opposed to an RFC PR). An RFC issue can be used to gain some consensus before actually implementing something without actually going through the full RFC process
[18:29:18] <bluss> Gankro: ah thanks for linking!
[18:30:33] <Gankro> Eridius: RFC issues are kinda weird... and still clog up the feeds of people who subscribe to /rfcs
[18:33:00] <Eridius> they do, though in my case I've set up my email filtering to send issues and PRs to separate folders

[18:46:42] <aturon> Gankro: btw thanks for putting something together on this, that's one of the first policy questions i wanted to resolve. i'm really buried right now, though, so it may be a bit longer before i can read carefully and respond
[18:49:05] <Gankro> aturon: no worries
