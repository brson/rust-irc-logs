[18:24:05] <jeaye> kzzch: YCM isn't rust-specific, but it should be used with everything.
[18:25:04] <kzzch> can i use both?
[18:25:07] <jeaye> yes
[18:25:19] <jeaye> They compliment each other

[18:38:27] <jeaye> I use tmux every day and love it.

[18:38:32] <jeaye> Depends on your use case.

[18:39:34] <cmr> I don't think tmux has really helped me with productivity, really.
[18:39:38] <cmr> it's useful for remoting
[18:39:55] <kzzch> first time i even really noticed needing tabs was working through a ruby on rails tutorial
[18:40:33] <kzzch> i kept opening and closing the same files over and over again and it got a little annoying to started reopening them in tabs in vim and it was way less of a hassle
[18:41:00] <kzzch> er, so i reopened them in tabs
[18:41:33] <kzzch> I'm just wondering if theres a better way to compile something in the terminal after editing it than switching a tab
[18:41:44] <kzzch> something like opening a terminal window in kate
[18:41:45] <cmr> ctrl-z
[18:42:21] <kzzch> that could work
[18:43:17] <jeaye> I use tmux because I ssh into my remote box every day and want to access multiple shells
[18:43:23] <cmr> yup
[18:43:28] <jeaye> I guess that falls under productivity
[18:43:32] <cmr> well

[18:46:58] <jeaye> If I need to compile in vim, I either use my tiling WM at home to switch to a terminal and compile, or, if I'm remote, I just use :make in vim (or my own variant, :Make, which plays a bit more nicely), or I simply use :sh and use whatever build commands are necessary.
[18:47:29] <jeaye> vim is pretty accommodating
[18:47:36] <cmr> I use a separate tmux buffer and ctrl-b n/p

[20:52:52] <zol> canhtak: Haven't had a chance yet, but the example looks really nice! I would like to see a little more advanced example if possible, like a breakout clone/tetris or something.
[20:53:01] <zol> However*
[20:53:13] <cmr> canhtak: are you JeremeyLetang?
[20:53:16] <canhtak> yes
[20:53:19] <cmr> cool!
[20:53:32] <canhtak> i've seen an emulator with rust-sfml recently
[20:53:52] <zol> canhtak: Haha, I just saw the pong example. I'll shut up. Wonderful!
[20:54:12] <canhtak> and i've build a little wolfenstein 3d with it. Not really beautyfull but i work.
[20:54:24] <zol> samx: https://github.com/JeremyLetang/rust-sfml/blob/master/src/examples/pong/main.rs -- this is how rust-sfml looks like.
[20:55:11] <zol> samx: look at line 69 for how to do simple 2D. :)
[20:55:21] <canhtak> https://github.com/dguenther/rustchip
[20:55:32] <canhtak> it use sfml too.
[20:56:16] <zol> Urgh.. I shouldn't be here..! Exams! *runs away*
[20:57:29] <samx> not knowing anything about sfml (nor sdl2 for that matter).. but why choose the prior than the latter?
[20:59:01] <zol> samx: As I said, the prior is a bit more OOP, and has built-in support for sound/text as well. 
[20:59:21] <zol> IIRC, SDL1/2 needs extra libs for sound/text
[21:00:08] <canhtak> sdl1 doesn't support graphics acceleration, but sdl2 does
[21:00:38] <samx> i guess i'll just need to give them all a try and see how i like them :)

[21:17:14] <bjz> canhtak: you should post it on the wiki page in the chennel description
[21:17:36] <canhtak> what?
[21:17:50] <samx> do I need to set the library lookup path to something else than RUST_PATH?
[21:18:14] <bjz> canhtak: rust sfml and your demo
[21:18:26] <bjz> on the game resources wiki page
[21:21:12] <canhtak> i think rust-sfml is already on the wiki page.

[21:30:32] <h3r3tic> Jarrett: no u
[21:32:17] <Jarrett> :P
[21:32:27] <Jarrett> h3r3tic: have you had issues with glfw-rs not... working properly
[21:32:29] <Jarrett> on windows
[21:33:42] <Jarrett> like the basic example works, but the more complex ones that do more than just set up a window spit out a bunch of "GLFW is not initialized" errors
[21:33:45] <h3r3tic> I had issues with GL itself not working
[21:33:51] <Jarrett> but they still create the window which is weird
[21:33:51] <h3r3tic> huh
[21:33:56] <samx> ok, things seem to work if i copy the csfml libraries to the same directory as where the executable is, but not without doing it.. painful
[21:34:18] <h3r3tic> Jarrett I'm not on latest, and I'm using a modified version of the GL library, but haven't had issues with GLFW itself ;o
[21:34:48] <bjz> h3r3tic: did you get a chance to review that PR I had for gl-rs?
[21:35:03] <Jarrett> hmm
[21:35:07] <bjz> h3r3tic: changing "C" to "system"?
[21:35:09] <h3r3tic> bjz: sadly nope. I'd have to update to .8 and all that
[21:35:21] <Jarrett> someone's way behind ;o
[21:35:25] <bjz> .8? :/
[21:35:28] <h3r3tic> but maybe I'll do that tonight. don't know what else to do, and might help out the jarret
[21:35:29] <h3r3tic> rust .8
[21:35:33] <h3r3tic> er
[21:35:36] <bjz> we are on .9-pre
[21:35:37] <h3r3tic> or rather, latest :P
[21:35:40] <h3r3tic> yeah sry
[21:35:42] <Jarrett> ah
[21:35:51] <h3r3tic> I think I'm on .8-pre or something olde like that
[21:36:04] <bjz> Jarrett: hmm
[21:36:17] <bjz> Jarrett: could you copy the exact error?
[21:36:39] <Jarrett> GLFW Error: The GLFW library is not initialized
[21:36:41] <Jarrett> several times
[21:36:53] <bjz> hm
[21:36:57] <bjz> which example?
[21:37:28] <Jarrett> I've tried callbacks and clipboard and they both do it
[21:37:40] <Jarrett> lemme reduce
[21:38:52] <bjz> That message is coming from the error callback
[21:38:58] <Jarrett> yeah
[21:39:05] <bjz> :/
[21:39:13] <Jarrett> yeah, just trying to do "window.set_pos_callback" makes it error
[21:39:24] <Jarrett> it's so weird because the window is definitely there
[21:39:28] <bjz> odd
[21:39:29] <Jarrett> and responds to the close event
[21:40:05] <bjz> Jarrett: I'm a little busy atm, but I can try later
[21:40:10] <Jarrett> ok
[21:40:16] <bjz> sorry for all this
[21:40:24] <Jarrett> you SHOULD BE I'm VERY DISAPPOINTED
[21:40:26] <Jarrett> ;D
[21:40:44] <bjz> oh, another thing with gl-rs
[21:41:07] <bjz> it won't work on windows because of ABI problems
[21:41:16] <Jarrett> oh.
[21:41:21] <cmr> bjz: wait what problems are those?
[21:41:24] <bjz> you'll have to change "C" to "system"
[21:41:27] <Jarrett> ah
[21:41:28] <cmr> oh ok
[21:41:30] <Jarrett> well that's not too bad
[21:41:42] <cmr> do you want to fix that?
[21:41:45] <bjz> I have a PR open, but was waiting for people to check it
[21:41:49] <cmr> oh ok
[21:41:52] * cmr looks
[21:41:58] <bjz> but they haven't replied :(
[21:42:13] * bjz glares at h3r3tic 
[21:42:15] <Jarrett> haha
[21:42:30] <cmr> ah you want testing
[21:42:33] <cmr> yeah not me
[21:43:11] <Jarrett> I'd test it but.. |D
