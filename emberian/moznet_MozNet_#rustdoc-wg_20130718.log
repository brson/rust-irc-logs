[00:32:26] <cmr> k
[00:32:29] <cmr> oops
[06:57:59] <Seldaek> cmr: thanks, I'll for sure try and work on it during holidays but I have no idea how the internet situation will be so I probably won't be around much if at all, but feel free to send updated gists if you have substantial progress, it's low traffic enough here that I'll see it when I stop by
[08:00:33] <Seldaek> cmr: in the latest json you linked, there are a bunch of resolved types with id 7928
[08:00:37] <Seldaek> that id is not defined anywhere 
[10:47:17] <cmr> Seldaek: https://gist.github.com/cmr/426b50e77fd3b1a69ced
[10:47:27] <cmr> And that is issue https://github.com/cmr/rustdoc_ng/issues/12 I think
[12:01:07] <Seldaek> cheers
[12:06:18] <Seldaek> ok now I get Unknown type: unique, could not parse
[12:06:21] <Seldaek> which I assume is my fault
[12:06:32] <Seldaek> well, new thing I'm not handling yet
[12:06:51] <cmr> I'll have yet-again-updated json for you in a sec
[12:06:54] <cmr> I fixed #12
[12:06:59] <cmr> introduced new kinds of types
[12:10:37] <cmr> https://gist.github.com/cmr/29d584c87cd7a24c3531
[12:10:43] <cmr> Uses numbers instead of strings for ids
[12:11:18] <cmr> Introduces a "generic" type for types which refer to the type parameters
[12:11:27] <cmr> Also, "unique" is just ~T
[12:29:29] *** cmr changes topic to 'rustdoc working group - https://github.com/cmr/rustdoc_ng - https://github.com/Seldaek/rustdoc_web'
[13:12:09] *** Joins: ChrisMorgan (chris@moz-6AC741CA.static.tpgi.com.au)
[13:12:14] * ChrisMorgan saunters in
[13:12:28] <cmr> Hi!
[13:12:44] <ChrisMorgan> Greetings, salutations and whatnots!
[13:12:45] <cmr> So right now rustdoc doesn't care what you write your doc comments with
[13:12:51] <cmr> (rustdoc_ng, that is)
[13:13:11] <cmr> Markdown is basically the least-effort lowest common denominator
[13:14:32] <ChrisMorgan> It clearly does some interpretation of it, though, as it doesn't appear in the output as plain text.
[13:14:33] <cmr> Can you outline 1. The benefits of reST for inline comments, 2. The work it'd take to make a Rust domain, 3. How it'd look in actual source code
[13:14:52] <cmr> rustdoc_ng spits out json containing the raw text of the doc comments
[13:15:10] <Seldaek> I think reST can be great for full "book" style docs, like the tutorial and other full fledged pages
[13:15:24] *** Joins: engla (engla@moz-DBD1D96E.cust.bredbandsbolaget.se)
[13:15:30] <Seldaek> but reST inline is insanity IMO, you can't get everyone to learn this syntax
[13:15:38] <cmr> Yes, I have no doubts about that, sphinx is great for narrative documentation
[13:15:53] <cmr> I've never found a really nice API documentation using it though
[13:16:16] <Seldaek> for inline IMO markdown is great, it's simple, everyone knows it and it's lightweight/readable in text format (which I'd argue reST isn't, but that's maybe just me:)
[13:16:53] <ChrisMorgan> Cross-referencing is one great benefit of reStructuredText; Markdown has no way to do it, while with Sphinx you could have stuff like :trait:`std::io::Reader`.
[13:17:22] <ChrisMorgan> Even then, that sort of thing is optional—if someone does ``Reader``, the only effect is that it won't be a proper reference.
[13:17:26] <engla> I prefer reST because it's actually looks much better than Markdown in the source text form
[13:17:37] <ChrisMorgan> That tends to be my feeling with it too.
[13:18:31] <Seldaek> .. :: wut
[13:18:36] <Seldaek> that's my feeling :p
[13:18:36] <cmr> ChrisMorgan: see recent ML thread; the current thought was javadoc-style `@see std::io::Reader` stuff
[13:19:09] <ChrisMorgan> I'd be quite willing to write a Rust domain for Sphinx, though getting autodoc working with it would be a little more complex (but well worth while! You won't have a hope of achieving that with Markdown). This is another spot where I've actually got a little experience; for the PortableApps.com Launcher I wrote an INI domains for Sphinx.
[13:19:36] <ChrisMorgan> cmr: that could end up thus:        :see: std::io::Reader
[13:19:50] <Seldaek> well to be fair, we could in the frontend post-process all `Foo` to create links automatically if we can match the name against some known symbol
[13:20:55] <cmr> ChrisMorgan: I admit I only have scant familiarity with Sphinx, I've only really used reST lightly and in not-sphinx contexts
[13:21:24] <Seldaek> i mean if cross-linking is the only advantage sphinx brings, I don't see the point because it's not hard to replicate I'd say
[13:22:23] <Seldaek> for me markdown wins for familiarity (due to github & others using it), but there may be stuff in reST that I'm not aware of
[13:23:03] <Seldaek> I saw it used to do great custom things, but I don't think much of that applies to inline docs
[13:23:32] <cmr> (for example, rust for rubyists is written with reST)
[13:23:59] <ChrisMorgan> Its inline documentation is but a start. External documentation is really where it shines—and it can pull that internal documentation in with ease through autodoc.
[13:24:29] <Seldaek> but how would that help exactly? I mean the autodoc stuff
[13:24:39] <Seldaek> not sure what you mean by "pull that internal doc"
[13:25:00] <Seldaek> well, pulling it ok, but then what? 
[13:25:02] <ChrisMorgan> Take as a very simple example https://django-plans.readthedocs.org/en/latest/taxation.html and compare it with https://django-plans.readthedocs.org/en/latest/_sources/taxation.txt
[13:25:15] <ChrisMorgan> And https://django-plans.readthedocs.org/en/latest/_modules/plans/taxation.html
[13:25:40] <ChrisMorgan> It makes it easy to produce something that is greater than simple API documentation, while still handling that case well.
[13:25:42] <Seldaek> ok so the .. autoclass stuff for example
[13:25:55] <ChrisMorgan> The docs of Django itself are superb, and an example of what Sphinx can enable.
[13:27:02] <cmr> The problem with it is that isn't inline documentatino. It's listing things outside of the source, and referencing the source with autodoc, which is duplication and extra work.
[13:27:03] <ChrisMorgan> Note in that example especially the get_tax_rate; it uses in its docstring some things very close to the javadoc form, as ":key: value" instead of "@key value"
[13:27:27] <Seldaek> that said, I don't necessarily see how you *need* reST on the methods to enable extracting a list of methods
[13:27:52] <Seldaek> fair enough extracting the arg details or return value stuff might be easier if the docblock is reST
[13:29:35] <Seldaek> ChrisMorgan: would you mind as an exercise and demo reformat https://github.com/mozilla/rust/blob/master/src/libextra/net/tcp.rs#L447 to a hypothetical reST format?
[13:30:02] <cmr> Although
[13:30:07] <ChrisMorgan> Seldaek: you don't *need* RST for those things, but it provides a lot that Markdown simply doesn't provide. Markdown itself is very limited and no two implementations are even interoperable... *cough* no spec
[13:30:18] <Seldaek> I think it'd be better to see it instead of everyone imagining things :)
[13:30:20] <cmr> I think we could *generate* sphinx source files
[13:30:33] <Seldaek> heh
[13:30:58] <Seldaek> well yes if we have those arg lists and return etc specced out so we can extract them, then we can reformat them programmatically
[13:31:01] <cmr> Using the module doc comments and generating autodoc stuff
[13:31:02] <Seldaek> but as they are now, it's a mess
[13:31:21] <ChrisMorgan> Stack Overflow uses two different Markdown engines, which handle backslash-escapes differently. So getting something like __foo__ without monospace takes _\_foo__ in a question or answer, and appears to be impossible in a comment.
[13:32:01] <cmr> If we use markdown we will continue to use pandoc
[13:32:16] <cmr> it's the best (imo), lots of (incompatible!) extensions
[13:32:32] <Seldaek> ChrisMorgan: I won't argue about reST's superiority as a spec - I fully agree it's technically better, but that doesn't necessarily make it better for humans
[13:33:05] <cmr> Seldaek: hell, we can use pandoc to suck in markdown and spit out reST
[13:34:33] <Seldaek> yes, but the other way around as well,  I mean ultimately we just have to decide what's best for the source files, then the rest is just about writing some code to build it
[13:34:43] <cmr> yes
[13:35:33] <Seldaek> and that's why I'm kinda against reST because I think it's easier to mess up than markdown and less people are familiar with it, but whether that's a valid concern or not as per whoever-is-in-charge's rules that's another question :)
[13:36:11] <Seldaek> that said, I think the current format is also kinda bad.. and markdown or at least *plain* markdown is probably not good enough if we want to extract detailed information
[13:36:30] <cmr> We need more structure than what markdown offers yes
[13:39:42] <cmr> this is all A-frontend stuff, in the end I don't really care :P
[13:40:43] <Seldaek> yeah well I don't care so much either, but it needs to be decided
[13:40:48] *** Joins: dbaupp (Thunderbir@moz-712A1135.lns20.syd6.internode.on.net)
[13:41:02] <ChrisMorgan> Seldaek: there, done a simple conversion: http://sprunge.us/CUTR
[13:41:30] <cmr> Ok my first reservation
[13:41:32] <cmr> :func:`accept`
[13:41:39] <cmr> for that to work properly you'd need to reimplement resolve
[13:41:54] <Seldaek> ChrisMorgan: thanks
[13:41:56] <ChrisMorgan> Where that's the name of the function itself, you might well do ``accept``
[13:42:01] *** Joins: ssbr (ssbr@moz-141F89C6.block0.gvtc.com)
[13:42:08] <ChrisMorgan> cmr: why would resolve need to be reimplemented?
[13:42:32] <ssbr> ChrisMorgan: I've probably missed a boatload of conversation, but, a downside that reST has is that there's only one parser, and it isn't easy to write a new one.
[13:42:32] <cmr> Ok bad example
[13:42:45] <cmr> :struct:`TcpSocket`
[13:42:45] <ssbr> Sphinx is great though, so there's that.
[13:42:53] <Seldaek> One thing that I don't see the point of is the :type: prefix, because AFAIK not two symbols of diff types can use the same name in rust, so there is no need to disambiguate?
[13:42:54] <cmr> What exactly does that refer to?
[13:42:57] <ChrisMorgan> Whoops, left a "net::tcp::" in near the end there...
[13:43:09] <ChrisMorgan> cmr: whatever the struct TcpSocket is in that scope
[13:43:31] <cmr> ChrisMorgan: Ok, and to figure that out you need to walk all the imports (including glob imports) as well as the current module
[13:43:37] <cmr> which is reimplementing resolve
[13:44:34] <dbaupp> Seldaek: they can, e.g. `fn foo() {} enum foo {}` compiles fine.
[13:44:37] <ChrisMorgan> OK, I see. The alternative is putting the full name each time, which I don't think would be nice. sphinx+autodoc+python handles it in much the same way I demonstrate there, that if it's in scope it can be omitted.
[13:44:51] <Seldaek> dbaupp: alright then, crap ;)
[13:45:04] <cmr> Right, using the full name is awful, and doing this would be fine, but it's just something to consider
[13:45:12] <cmr> to properly hyperlink you need to do name resolution
[13:45:34] <cmr> Seldaek: it's because values and types are in different namespaces
[13:45:47] <ChrisMorgan> Sure. Yep. Note that the way Sphinx works normally if it ends up with an unresolved class it'll just have it code highlighted but not a hyperlink.
[13:45:55] <cmr> you can hve `let foo: foo = foo(foo)`
[13:46:10] <ChrisMorgan> *shudder*
[13:46:23] * ChrisMorgan has seen one or two bits of code unpleasantly similar to that
[13:46:30] <Seldaek> anyway, markdown could do [func:listen] or similar, if we wanted :)
[13:46:45] <cmr> I really want to support Sphinx
[13:46:59] <Seldaek> the linking I'm not too worried of, but the :param & :returns: stuff would be nice to have, in that form or another
[13:47:01] <dbaupp> fwiw, more than one person has expressed a desire for tables
[13:47:02] <cmr> But I don't want to be Sphinx-exclusive
[13:47:13] <ChrisMorgan> Seldaek: still more extension work for that, and people won't be familiar with it, which is part of the idea of Markdown: people are familiar with it, even if it's nasty.
[13:47:26] <dbaupp> cmr: make it "pluggable".
[13:47:54] <Seldaek> ChrisMorgan: sure, but one wouldn't be familiar with :func:`foo` either tbh, either way it's not a hard rule to learn..
[13:47:56] <ChrisMorgan> dbaupp: yay! Markdown has your back on tables! Well... there are variants of it supporting tables. Maybe they do it different ways. I dunno. reStructuredText does tables well.
[13:48:14] <Seldaek> github markdown has fairly sane tables yeah
[13:48:16] <ChrisMorgan> Seldaek: my conclusion there being that there's not much to choose between them on that point.
[13:48:21] <dbaupp> ChrisMorgan: right, we're currently using pandoc, which supports everything.
[13:48:40] <cmr> dbaupp: Well it is, but there needs to be a consistent doc-comment form I'd think
[13:49:04] <dbaupp> cmr: it'd be nice, yes.
[13:49:28] <ChrisMorgan> Python has no specific format for docstrings; reStructuredText is generally recommended, and if you do it you get lots of bonuses, but you're not required to.
[13:49:46] <Seldaek> ChrisMorgan: I don't know sphinx at all but can you easily send it a blob of text and get html out?
[13:50:00] <cmr> Python doesn't have a built-in documentation generator.
[13:50:00] <ChrisMorgan> Seldaek: yep
[13:50:12] <cmr> Rustdoc will have a default frontend bundled with it
[13:50:17] <Seldaek> because that's pretty much all I need for the frontend, something that I can throw docblocks at 
[13:50:19] <ChrisMorgan> cmr: but Python's docs are done with Sphinx.
[13:52:11] <ChrisMorgan> Seldaek: you should realise that the solution that I'm advocating involves using Sphinx, not just reStructuredText. It supports the things like autodoc, having ":param x: y" work well, cross-references and such
[13:52:31] * ChrisMorgan wishes pidgin would be a little more discerning about where it turns :p into a smiley
[13:52:38] * dbaupp gets that too
[13:52:56] <dbaupp> how does haddock handle cross references etc?
[13:53:34] <Seldaek> ChrisMorgan: but would that mean using sphinx exclusively to build the whole docs? because I'd rather stop now if I'm working for nothing :)
[13:54:47] <Seldaek> I'm not sure how sphinx/autodoc work, but I can't imagine they could parse rust source and output full docs to the level of a custom built solution?
[13:55:49] <ChrisMorgan> Seldaek: Sphinx would manage the process, but for plain API documentation like Go's, you'd still need to generate a little (a very little) bit of reStructuredText to start with, and you'd probably want some fancy JavaScript to improve the experience.
[13:56:20] <Seldaek> but I'd hope we can do better than go's docs
[13:56:30] <cmr> I'm hesitant to use sphinx as the default frontend
[13:56:33] <Seldaek> and I think we're well on track 
[13:56:56] <cmr> it's not like pandoc is a small dependency, but it could still be replaced with a pure-rust solutoin
[13:57:29] <ChrisMorgan> I sure hope we'd do better than Go's. They're good to a point, but only to a point...
[13:57:36] <Seldaek> cmr: what is it used for though (in hypothetical rustdoc_ng + the node frontend)?
[13:57:43] <cmr> Seldaek: pandoc?
[13:57:45] <Seldaek> yup
[13:57:51] <cmr> dunno
[13:57:55] <Seldaek> :)
[13:57:56] <cmr> right now it's used for markdown -> html
[13:58:00] <Seldaek> yeah ok
[13:58:13] <Seldaek> but for that I can use any of the certainly 10 diff node markdown renderers
[13:58:19] <ChrisMorgan> And that's the role that Sphinx would fill, isn't it?
[13:58:31] <cmr> ChrisMorgan: no
[13:58:38] <cmr> it's only the markdown->html for the doc comments
[13:58:42] <cmr> not for the whole documentation
[13:58:43] <Seldaek> ChrisMorgan: the way you sell it with autodoc it sounds like it would do a lot more
[13:59:14] <cmr> The old rustdoc works by spitting out massive globs of markdown
[13:59:20] <Seldaek> I wouldn't be opposed to using sphinx (or whatever reST parser) to convert the docblocks to html, but I don't think relying on a tool like that for the whole doc structure is nice, it limits you
[13:59:22] <cmr> Which is an unworkable solution
[13:59:37] <cmr> Too much information lost, impossible to do detailed layout or anything fancy.
[13:59:53] <ChrisMorgan> cmr: information lost?
[14:00:23] <cmr> ChrisMorgan: it loses the structure of the original AST to a plain-text format
[14:00:43] <cmr> that would need to be reparsed, and it wouldn't be able to be turned back into an AST
[14:01:00] <dbaupp> ChrisMorgan: (there were a whole pile of subtle bugs about extraneous/not-enough whitespace, for exampe.)
[14:01:13] <ChrisMorgan> Hang on... what is the alternative?
[14:01:28] <ChrisMorgan> I'm clearly missing something here, or haven't explained the role Sphinx would play well enough.
[14:01:30] <cmr> rustdoc_ng outputs JSON representing the AST tree
[14:01:34] <cmr> https://gist.github.com/cmr/29d584c87cd7a24c3531
[14:01:38] <cmr> AST tree, eh
[14:01:40] <cmr> *heh
[14:02:01] <cmr> Anything a frontend for generating user-visible documentation is going to use that JSON
[14:03:45] <ChrisMorgan> That is exactly what the autodoc extension would need to work from. Generate that JSON and load it in the autodoc way with a Sphinx extension.
[14:03:57] *** Joins: jedestep (jedestep@34641662.FB4DE631.66C78B76.IP)
[14:05:32] <ChrisMorgan> Then you would get to decide how to write it. For pure API docs, you would automatically generate a simple structure of files, e.g. net/tcp.txt containing possibly as little as ".. automod:: net::tcp"
[14:07:59] <ChrisMorgan> For superior documentation like Python's or Django's you could meld the internal (doc comments) and external (write your own reStructuredText files), so that you might use some autodoc things, which would be gathered from that JSON, and some things where you write your own reStructuredText code, replacing or augmenting the automatically gathered docs.
[14:08:41] <cmr> ChrisMorgan: So you agree that having Sphinx be one of many alternative front-ends is tenable?
[14:09:28] <ChrisMorgan> Indeed; quite reasonable.
[14:09:59] <Seldaek> which doesn't really resolve our question of what to use for docblocks:)
[14:10:04] <ChrisMorgan> Naturally, if anyone wrote in the :func:`foo` style, any other tool would need to figure out how to cope with it.
[14:10:26] <Seldaek> indeed, that's not so hard to parse though
[14:10:45] <cmr> Seldaek: I don't think we should do anything special for docblocks
[14:10:47] <ChrisMorgan> Seldaek: my recommendation, in line with using Sphinx, would be: don't impose a style—just recommend reStructuredText with the Sphinx extensions.
[14:10:51] <cmr> people will use whatever they use
[14:11:01] <ChrisMorgan> That's exactly how Python does it.
[14:11:15] <dbaupp> ChrisMorgan: shouldn't the cross references be parsed and represented in the JSON by rustdoc_ng?
[14:11:35] <Seldaek> cmr: well, that's fair enough for "in the wild", but what about std/extra? I think rust itself should be consistent
[14:11:39] <cmr> dbaupp: core rustdoc_ng doesn't touch doc comments
[14:11:47] <ChrisMorgan> dbaupp: I'm not convinced. You could tie into Sphinx to achieve that if you wanted to.
[14:11:52] <dbaupp> cmr: oh.
[14:12:01] <dbaupp> cmr: so you gave up on running resolve, etc?
[14:12:03] <cmr> Seldaek: Pandoc markdown is what it is now, and should probably continue to be
[14:12:07] <cmr> dbaupp: I did not
[14:12:11] <cmr> dbaupp: but I don't parse doc comments at all
[14:12:24] <cmr> I resolve usage of types in eg structs or function signatures to their definition
[14:12:37] <dbaupp> aha
[14:12:37] <cmr> https://gist.github.com/cmr/29d584c87cd7a24c3531#file-gistfile1-txt-L15
[14:13:30] <cmr> Seldaek: A lot of the unresolve id's are going to be reference to external crates
[14:13:39] <cmr> Seldaek: haven't figured out how to handle that quite yet
[14:13:45] <Seldaek> cmr: if it's ok I'd use https://npmjs.org/package/marked which supports github flavoured markdown extensions
[14:14:11] <Seldaek> which supports tables too
[14:14:19] <cmr> Seldaek: we already use pandoc-markdown with syntax highlighting
[14:14:33] <dbaupp> (I assume you've already discussed collapsing doc attributes & stripping /// etc?)
[14:14:46] <Seldaek> cmr: pandoc can do it as well, but I'd rather not depend on pandoc if possible, just for ease of use
[14:14:53] <cmr> dbaupp: https://github.com/cmr/rustdoc_ng/issues/4
[14:15:03] <Seldaek> cmr: if you can just npm install & build docs it's pretty easy
[14:15:31] <cmr> Seldaek: sure, just be aware that you need to do either support pandoc-style syntax highlighting or change all the doc comments that use it in the rust source :p
[14:15:51] <Seldaek> what style is that?
[14:15:52] <dbaupp> cmr: it sort-of seems like rustdoc_ng is more like 'convert items to json'?
[14:16:06] <cmr> dbaupp: yup
[14:16:18] <cmr> Seldaek: ~~~ {.rust}
[14:16:41] <cmr> https://github.com/mozilla/rust/blob/master/src/libextra/net/tcp.rs#L471
[14:17:01] <Seldaek> cmr: I see, gfm would be ```rust - easy enough to replace 
[14:17:18] <ChrisMorgan> What then do you think of reStructuredText + Sphinx for Rust docs overall?
[14:17:36] <cmr> ChrisMorgan: I want to support sphinx but I don't want to be exclusive to it
[14:17:41] <cmr> dbaupp: basically yeah
[14:17:58] <cmr> dbaupp: there will be auxillary filters (pluggable) that transform the pre-JSON AST
[14:18:04] <cmr> (this is the A-aux tag)
[14:18:15] <dbaupp> cmr: if it's meant to be a documentation generator, https://github.com/cmr/rustdoc_ng/issues/11 should be on by default, but if it's summarise-the-items then yeah that's reasonable (this is mostly bikeshedding...)
[14:18:30] <ChrisMorgan> Nor do I. It would comes down to being a suggestion only; Sphinx fits into your current model very well.
[14:18:35] <dbaupp> cmr: the Rust ast?
[14:18:45] <cmr> dbaupp: no, a custom, more minimal, less-@ AST
[14:19:00] <cmr> https://github.com/cmr/rustdoc_ng/blob/master/doctree.rs is extracted from the rust AST
[14:19:05] <cmr> and cleaned up with https://github.com/cmr/rustdoc_ng/blob/master/clean.rs
[14:19:28] <cmr> I consider the output after cleaning to be the rustdoc_ng AST
[14:20:04] <dbaupp> (why are unit, tuple and newtype different? ... should just be represented by the length of of `fields`, right?)
[14:20:36] <dbaupp> but, yeah, that looks nicer.
[14:20:48] <cmr> https://github.com/cmr/rustdoc_ng/blob/master/doctree.rs#L85 :p
[14:21:00] <cmr> It's to ease documentation tools that would format them differently
[14:21:37] <dbaupp> well, they have to match on something, so they might as well match on fields.len() or fields itself.
[14:22:07] <ChrisMorgan> Sounds to me like I should make a domain and autodoc reader for that JSON data for Sphinx, as a proof of concept.
[14:22:14] <cmr> ChrisMorgan: go for it!
[14:22:17] <ChrisMorgan> :-)
[14:22:30] <cmr> If we do anything in rustdoc_ng that precludes usage of sphinx, we're going it wrong
[14:26:07] <cmr> dbaupp: so basically the rustdoc_ng core spits out everything that would possibly be relevant, and pluggable filters refine the final JSON output
[14:26:38] <cmr> only 2/3 of that is implemented right now, and even those aren't complete :p
[14:26:46] <dbaupp> cmr: yeah, that sounds reasonable, although I hope that it ships with a built-in output filter. :)
[14:26:52] <cmr> yes, of course
[14:27:42] <ChrisMorgan> cmr: for https://gist.github.com/cmr/29d584c87cd7a24c3531, what's the source?
[14:27:50] <cmr> ChrisMorgan: rustdoc_ng itself
[14:31:25] * cmr gets back to work
[14:40:06] <ChrisMorgan> Actually, I told a lie when I said I had written an INI domain for Sphinx... I looked at the code and it's plain reStructuredText cross-reference types. Sphinx hadn't developed the concept of domains when I wrote that.
[14:40:57] <jedestep> cmr: are you still pushing to the wip branch? it doesn't build
[14:46:34] <cmr> jedestep: no I am not
[14:46:45] <cmr> jedestep: all work is based on master no
[14:46:48] <cmr> w
[14:46:56] <jedestep> ok
[14:46:59] <cmr> wip is/was intended for "why the hell won't this work" code :P
[14:47:07] <jedestep> lol
[14:47:26] <jedestep> well now rustc can't find the std::local_data modulel so time to have fun with that
[14:47:42] <cmr> are you on the latest master?
[14:48:07] <jedestep> i'm on the same build i've been using, guess it's time to get another rust installation :(
[14:48:16] <cmr> sorry :(
