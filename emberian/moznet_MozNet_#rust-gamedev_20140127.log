[06:48:07] <ecl3ctic> ^ I would also like to know this
[06:49:43] <csherratt> I'm creating simple bindings since I could not find any done for rust yet.
[06:50:13] <cmr> you know about rust-bindgen right?
[06:50:28] <csherratt> cmr does it work for c++?
[06:50:30] <cmr> no
[06:50:36] <csherratt> :(
[06:50:43] <cmr> you can't bind C++, only C.
[06:50:44] <dbaupp> csherratt: does it expose an extern "C" { .. } interface?
[06:51:19] <csherratt> dbaupp: It does not yet.
[06:51:44] <dbaupp> (I'm talking about libOVR itself, just to be clear)
[06:52:22] <ecl3ctic> Oculus really didn't need to go with C++ at all
[06:52:28] <csherratt> dbaupp: I understood, libOVR does not have a extern "C" interface that I could find.
[06:52:31] <ecl3ctic> their software is just tracking and warping
[06:52:33] <dbaupp> ah, ok
[06:52:39] <ecl3ctic> making it C++ just makes it a nightmare for everyone else
[06:53:04] <dbaupp> I'd guess you're gonna have trouble getting Rust to interface directly with it reliably. Are you writing a C shim?

[07:50:45] <knardi> actually, only if I have both glfw and gl
[07:51:25] <knardi> oh snap
[07:51:49] <knardi> it's because libglfw is an rlib and libgl is a dylib
[07:52:30] <cmr> knardi: oh, yikes.
[07:52:43] <cmr> we need to improve our error message for that case
[07:54:23] <knardi> you mean in rust?
[07:54:36] <cmr> yeah
[07:54:49] <cmr> the reason is you can only have all-static or all-dynamic deps.
[07:54:54] <knardi> yeah
[07:54:57] <knardi> I was just reading that somewhere
[07:55:42] <cmr> but if a static/dynamic is needed and it finds a lib that would match except that it's not the static/dynamic it's looking for, say it found it but wasn't static/dynamic, not just "not found"
[07:56:06] <skrylar> is that a bug or psychosis?
[07:56:17] <skrylar> (C has static and non-statics)
[07:57:21] <cmr> it's so we don't have to deal with what happens if one of your deps statically links to the same thing you link to etc.
[07:57:30] <skrylar> so psychosis
[07:57:43] <cmr> not really
[07:57:53] <cmr> laziness perhaps?
[07:58:00] <cmr> it's not an easy problem
[07:58:05] <skrylar> compiler disobedience :)
[07:58:06] <cmr> it's not just paranoia though.
[07:58:17] <cmr> not really? you can always use --link-args
[07:59:55] <knardi> yeah, not super easy to fix with the current code
[08:01:23] <knardi> since CStore.get_used_crates just returns None, and add_upstream_rust_crates doesn't have the information it needs to know whether the library was found but wasn't the right type
[08:02:05] <skrylar> sometimes i wonder if someone doesn't need to take a sledgehammer to rustc's internals ><

[08:05:52] <cmr> well..
[08:05:55] <cmr> for the most part.
[08:06:02] <cmr> not really nvm
[08:06:12] <cmr> it indicates what is wrong but unless you already know how it works it doesn't help.
[08:06:56] <knardi> has it already tried to find a static version of the library by that point? so just changing the message will work?
[08:07:09] <cmr> in the None cases in back/link.rs you can do another get_used_crates but the opposite of whichever it's looking for, and if it found one, print it.

[08:12:26] <cmr> feedback on that?
[08:12:50] <cmr> the problem is that when it's looking for dynamic deps, it doesn't give you a helpful error if it found static deps instead.
[08:13:15] <acrichto> I would believe that
[08:13:32] <cmr> (ideally it'd use the diagnostic registry when that's a thing)
[08:13:38] <cmr> believe that my suggested fix would work/
[08:14:01] <acrichto> yeah makes sense
[08:14:17] <cmr> cool
[08:14:28] <knardi> well, you'd have to get the whole list of libs from get_used_crates(RequireStatic) and then search through it for one with the same name, right?
[08:14:37] <cmr> yeah..
[08:14:48] <acrichto> you may also be able to just assume it's static
[08:15:00] <acrichto> if you've gotten to back::link you're guaranteed that all libs were found *somewhere*
[08:15:14] <acrichto> and if you got to dynamic linking then either -Z prefer-dynamic was specified or not all deps were static
[08:15:26] <acrichto> I suppose -Z prefer-dynamic throws a bit of a wrench into this
[08:16:12] <knardi> or if you're creating a dynamic library? (according to the comment in this code)
[08:16:51] <acrichto> oh true
[08:16:56] <acrichto> lol don't even remember what I was doing
[08:17:18] <acrichto> so sounds like you don't at all have concrete knowledge about the situation
[08:18:45] <bjz> cmr knardi : back!
[08:18:46] <knardi> could just make the message more verbose "We were looking for dynamic libraries, but were unable to find a dynamic version of {}"

[08:19:19] <bjz> what's happened now :(

[08:21:10] <bjz> cmr: so any idea of the solution?

[08:48:34] <bjz> the OR is so popular because lots of the indie devs are playing with it

[08:48:56] <bjz> yep
[08:49:09] <skrylar> meh.. the VR promise

[08:49:41] <cmr> the valve presentations on VR were super interesting.
[08:49:43] <cmr> from dev days
[08:49:47] <skrylar> knardi: i haven't seen much in the way of progress for the controllers
[08:50:01] <skrylar> and understanding of the brain is pretty poor still, for doing neural uplinks
[08:50:06] <cmr> yup
[08:50:16] <knardi> skrylar: agreed that free-motion VR is a long way off
[08:50:36] <skrylar> non-free motion VR is doomed
[08:50:42] <skrylar> its just too disassociative 
[08:51:05] <knardi> not for things where you're sitting, e.g. in a cockpit
[08:51:05] <csherratt> it is surprisingly hard to find the keyboard with VR goggles on.
[08:51:17] <skrylar> well imagine the Steel Battalion controllers with the occulus rift
[08:51:24] <skrylar> you look down and expect your hands to be there
[08:51:32] <skrylar> yet they're just kerbal-hands on fixed sticks
[08:51:37] <cmr> heh
[08:51:42] <knardi> I can imagine solutions for seeing your hands, actually
[08:51:45] <skrylar> okay so maybe you cheat and use a tri-kinect setup 
[08:52:01] <skrylar> you wave your hand through the air and on screen it appears like you hit stuff but there's no tactile feedback
[08:52:28] <knardi> if your hands aren't primary to the experience, it could work well
[08:52:38] <skrylar> now you're up to a custom control rig, 3 kinects to trace your hand movements on the controller in the cockpit and an occulus
[08:52:44] <skrylar> thats like, 900$ worth of hardware
[08:53:00] <skrylar> atthat price point your only remaining market is milsim guys
[08:53:18] <bjz> It remains to be seen whether that kind of thing is as much of an issue
[08:53:30] <cmr> considering how sucked into *text adventures* I can get, I'm not sure that's entirely true.
[08:53:43] <cmr> although that's more imagination than presenting visuals
[08:53:45] <knardi> bjz: agreed. from my experience, it won't be much of an issue.

[09:39:23] <JesseH> If you're not getting paid, gotta enjoy what you do, of course.
[09:39:46] <skrylar> i've been working on one for rust, but it just takes time
[09:39:51] * JesseH enjoys MUDs
[09:39:56] <JesseH> Might make one in rust
[09:40:03] <skrylar> i was going to do something akin to Morphic in rust
[09:40:23] <JesseH> Interesting
[09:40:27] <JesseH> Anyone know any good rust muds?
[09:40:31] <JesseH> That are in-dev
[09:40:41] <cmr> none exist to my knowledge.
[09:40:47] <skrylar> i don't know if anyone is making those; the TCP support is incapable of send/recv
[09:40:57] <cmr> skrylar: that's been fixed now
[09:41:01] <skrylar> orly
[09:41:10] <cmr> you can clone a TCPStream, and send one side to another task
[09:41:14] <cmr> ugly, but workable.
[09:41:17] <skrylar> but no nonblocking?

[09:41:30] <JesseH> I'm trying to find an in-dev project to contribute to. I don't feel like starting my own. :P
[09:41:30] <cmr> the non-blocking is using tasks
[09:41:38] <skrylar> that is the sad bag
[09:41:42] <cmr> JesseH: rustc is in-dev :)
[09:41:47] <skrylar> bsd sockets support nonblocking modes
[09:41:55] <JesseH> cmr, Ill look at a couple issues

[09:42:42] <skrylar> i forget how node.js handles it
[09:42:46] <cmr> skrylar: the idea is that you don't need non-blocking sockets if you have tasks and select.
[09:42:50] <cmr> node.js uses callback soup.
[09:42:58] <skrylar> IIRC node.js uses the nonblocking mode but then dispatches on reception
[09:43:12] <skrylar> so it doesn't "block" but it doesn't potentially spawn two OS threads for a single socket

[09:44:25] <skrylar> i haven't particularly used tasks yet
[09:45:59] <cmr> I don't think we can select on tcpstream either so it's still a non-starter
[09:46:07] <cmr> unless you happen to like thread-per-connetion
[09:46:13] <skrylar> yeah no
[09:46:15] <knardi> tasks are actually the whole reason I am interested in Rust
[09:46:34] <skrylar> thread per connection is assinine; the c10k servers show that :|
[09:46:52] <cmr> yes I know
[09:47:08] <skrylar> non-block sockets and microthreading is the 'correct' way to do that, esp. on FreeBSD where you get kpoll goodness
[09:47:08] <cmr> c10k is a bit ridiculous IMO
[09:47:15] <cmr> 10k connections is a very low number ;p
[09:48:05] <cmr> well, with libgreen you don't actually have threads, and you do have non-blocking sockets
[09:48:07] <cmr> (it's just libuv)
[09:48:22] <cmr> it's basically the only case libgreen is super useful, servers.
[09:48:33] <skrylar> games too
[09:48:38] <skrylar> microthreading is great for agent code
[09:48:47] <knardi> yep. that's what I want.
[09:49:06] <knardi> I want to write everything as an agent.
[09:49:53] <knardi> there aren't many options for doing that in games.
[09:50:03] <knardi> the only other one I know of is Stackless Python, a la EVE.
[09:50:35] <knardi> which seems to have worked out for them
[09:51:32] <skrylar> you do need a good pickle/unpickle strategy though
[09:51:54] <skrylar> i remember one guy talking about throwing out his microthreads because gamestate was wrapped up in closures everywhere
[09:52:17] <knardi> or possibly concurrent data structures 
[09:52:34] <skrylar> well a good means of attaching a POD to your agents solves that
[09:53:14] <skrylar> i've done that with lua before
[09:53:38] <skrylar> one specific table attached to the object which is marked as the "this data is pickled"
[09:53:45] <skrylar> which lets you walk by and save those objects
[09:53:58] <skrylar> as long as they are scripted so they can wake back up from the POD data
[09:54:05] <knardi> yeah, that's not bad...though you still need references to other agents
[09:54:42] <skrylar> well a networked game will need clean integer IDs anyway
[09:54:56] <skrylar> clockwork empires references agents by their object IDs
[09:55:06] <skrylar> torque references by instance numbers
[09:55:29] <skrylar> though i've almost never seen anyone mention their strategy for what to do should you hit the overflow condition on the ID field
[09:56:17] <knardi> use a 64-bit integer I suppose, heh
[09:56:28] <knardi> and don't overflow it :)
[09:56:28] <skrylar> not an answer
[09:56:31] <skrylar> that just defers the problem :P
[09:57:15] <skrylar> i think i thought up of a system once that involved recycling IDs but the ID had timestamps attached
[09:57:41] <skrylar> e.g. it wouldn't recycle an ID that was still active in the last sync frames
[09:57:51] <skrylar> *last X
[09:58:12] <knardi> 2^64 is a pretty fantastically large number
[09:58:35] <cmr> it's perfectly feasible to hit it though
[09:58:40] <cmr> especially in something long-running.
[09:58:51] <skrylar> i prefer not to rely on not running out of magic numbers
[09:59:05] <knardi> it would take 584 years to hit it if you generated a billion objects per second

[09:59:30] <cmr> what, your games don't run for 584 years?
[09:59:33] <knardi> :)
[10:00:23] <cmr> a billion billion objects per frame.
[10:00:24] <skrylar> well its easy to deal with if you don't mind taking the system down (e.g. a game0
[10:00:38] <skrylar> you can remap agent IDs when loading the save file
[10:00:54] *** Quits: dmac (Adium@moz-94F55C3.hfc.comcastbusiness.net) (Ping timeout)
[10:01:02] <skrylar> though there is a value in compacting IDs at runtime too
[10:01:21] <skrylar> variable length encoders can use less space if you keep your IDs shifted towards smaller word sizes

[10:02:23] <skrylar> for multiplayer games that can mean quite a bit
[10:14:03] <skrylar> huh neat.
[10:14:53] <skrylar> i just thought about using something like x.chars().take(30).join(<elipsis>.chars()) as a means to automatically shove in an elipsis if a string is too long
[10:15:16] <skrylar> yay iterators that aren't suck \o/
[10:15:19] <cmr> \o/
[10:17:02] <knardi> so...how do I allocate a C-array in Rust? This cannot be Googled.
[10:17:17] <cmr> An actual C array or just a vector or just a hunk of memory?
[10:17:19] <skrylar> allocate as in..
[10:17:26] <knardi> hunk of memory is fine
[10:17:34] <knardi> I think
[10:17:38] <skrylar> [u8, ..1024] // i am a buffer of 1kb
[10:17:41] <cmr> what are you using it for?
[10:17:52] <knardi> passing it to OpenGL
[10:17:56] <knardi> as a GLfloat*
[10:18:10] <skrylar> yeah, thats just.. a vector of glfloat :P
[10:18:13] <knardi> really?
[10:18:16] <skrylar> [GLfloat]
[10:18:16] <knardi> it's that easy?
[10:18:30] <skrylar> there's a function to ask a vector for its raw bytes for that purpose
[10:18:36] <cmr> .as_ptr()
[10:18:41] <cmr> but yeah.
[10:18:56] <skrylar> in the case of GL, it doesn't want "a buffer" so much as thats just the C way of passing in a vector
[10:19:05] <knardi> too obvious
[10:19:14] <ecl3ctic> on the topic of vectors, what syntax should I be using to initialize a fixed-size, 16 element vector with vectors of strings
[10:19:26] <ecl3ctic> I'm getting confused with too many ~'s and ['s :)
[10:19:40] <ecl3ctic> vector of vector of strings *
[10:19:42] <skrylar> [~"", ..16]?
[10:20:00] *** Joins: ricepuddin (graham@moz-787C066C.wlan.ic.ac.uk)
[10:20:09] <ecl3ctic> that's 16 strings
[10:20:17] <ecl3ctic> I need 16 variable length vectors
[10:20:33] <ecl3ctic> also I think something goes wrong with using ~ in the initialization
[10:20:40] <ecl3ctic> because it can't copy it
[10:20:41] <skrylar> [~[type], ..16]? though i haven't tested it
[10:21:26] <ecl3ctic> I get: error: copying a value of non-copyable type `~[~str]`
[10:21:30] <cmr> ecl3ctic: [~"", ~"", ~"", ~"", ~"", ...]
[10:21:45] <cmr> you can only use ..16 in initialization for types which can actually be copied.
[10:21:51] <cmr> (ie, Pod)
[10:22:04] <ecl3ctic> cmr: ah, that confirms what I thought
[10:22:12] <ecl3ctic> though that's quit inconvenient
[10:22:13] <kimundi> rusti: ::std::vec::from_fn(|_| ~[~""], 16)

[10:22:38] <skrylar> heh, sounds like i need to write more tips 
[10:22:45] <skrylar> ... well, and actually upload the new tips website
[10:23:01] <kimundi> (well, I guess that would create a ~[~[~s]] rather than a [~[~s], ..16])
[10:23:02] <cmr> ecl3ctic: if you can use a real vector instead of a fixed-length array, it's less unusably verbose.
[10:23:36] <ecl3ctic> cmr: I suppose I could
[10:24:23] <ecl3ctic> but there should be a better way to initialize fixed-length vectors
[10:26:37] <cmr> well
[10:26:59] <cmr> Clone could become a language item, and it could know how to initialize fixed-length vectors of types that are Clone
[10:27:05] <cmr> but that adds yet more surface area to the language.
[10:28:21] <skrylar> kimundi mentioned using with_fn earlier

[10:28:38] <skrylar> from_fn
[10:28:39] <skrylar> brains
[10:29:04] <skrylar> though initializing 16 boxes of empty strings is horrible
[10:29:09] <ecl3ctic> that's for creating owned vectors though
[10:29:15] <skrylar> that would normally be what nils are for
[10:29:25] <kimundi> For fixed length vectors, it would be better to have associated constants and write a generic from_fn::<N>(|i| ...) constructor function for fixed sized vectors that uses unsafe code internally
[10:30:01] <skrylar> Huh
[10:30:10] <skrylar> I bet it would work if you had Option<~[]>
[10:30:14] <skrylar> since you can initialize the None
[10:30:59] <ecl3ctic> I wish I had [null, ..16]
[10:31:00] <ecl3ctic> :D
[10:31:23] <cmr> std::unstable::intrinsics::uninit
[10:32:42] <ecl3ctic> oh there's nasty stuff under the hood like that?
[10:32:51] <cmr> of course.
[10:33:05] <cmr> we wouldn't be a very usable systems language without ways to work around the things that provide safety :)
[10:34:17] <ecl3ctic> I think I'll stick to from_fn and a unique vector for now :P
[10:34:44] <cmr> the accepted terminology is just "vector"
[10:34:55] <cmr> https://github.com/mozilla/rust/wiki/The-Rusticon
[10:38:03] <dbaupp> std::unstable::intrinsics::init is mildly safer
[10:38:30] <dbaupp> (vs uninit)
[10:39:36] <cmr> oh hey now that we have Pod we could actually make init safe.
[10:39:47] <knardi> so as_ptr is supposed to give me a pointer to the raw contiguous memory?
[10:40:03] <skrylar> yep
[10:40:23] <skrylar> the part you can send to C, though if C writes past the area it should bad things happen as per normal

[14:16:04] <rsaarelm> I had the notion that you could try to just straight up rewrite stb_image and stb_truetype in native Rust. Wonder how much work that'd be.
[14:16:34] <rsaarelm> Would probably be idea if at least reading and writing image files would be included in a standard extended library, like it is with Go.
[14:16:49] <cmr> mm
[14:17:11] <cmr> a good image lib could be part of the stnadard distribution.
[14:17:39] <rsaarelm> The ttf part is trickier, since the STB thing is explicitly for rendering the truetype glyphs into bitmaps, and a general purpose TTF library would probably want to be a lot more spliney and bloaty than that.
[14:18:05] <cmr> I don't think a font rasterizer belongs at all in the standard distributoin.
[14:18:48] <rsaarelm> Well it's needed for the use case of writing browsers and for the use case of writing computer games...
[14:19:04] <rsaarelm> But yeah, it's getting a bit too complex to be standard library stuff.
[14:19:09] <cmr> it's a huge amount of code
[14:19:24] <cmr> also need something like harfbuzz to do proper shaping.
[14:21:35] <rsaarelm> Yeah, that's the part where things get too hairy if you want to have things be general-purpose...

[18:39:06] <rsaarelm> Eh. Why do cgmath aabbs have center instead of top corner as their inner position representation? Can't use them as a nice rectangle type now...
[18:40:26] <bjz> rsaarelm: could you make an issue regarding that?
[18:41:15] <bjz> there are multiple ways to represent axis-aligned bounding boxes - with different pros and cons
[18:42:35] <bjz> I can see why you'd want the top corner representation, I'd like to hear what others have to say though
[18:45:08] <rsaarelm> Sure.

[20:26:02] <rsaarelm> Hmh. Guess it might be a good idea to remember to spec output pointer params in C FFI apis as mut pointers instead of immut ones...
[20:27:45] <bjz> rsaarelm: yeah, that's what I do in glfwrs
[20:28:03] <bjz> rsaarelm: also gl-rs
[20:28:22] <Amaranth> So I've been thinking about how rust idioms would map to SDL and the more I think about it the more I think the answer is they don't
[20:29:08] <bjz> Amaranth: yeah? :(
[20:29:40] <bjz> Amaranth: the event handling kind of maps to rust's iterators
[20:29:41] <Amaranth> I mean, other than events are an enum and adding Drop to things to clean them up automatically
[20:30:04] <Amaranth> Does exhausting an iterator then having it have more stuff later make sense though?
[20:30:11] <bjz> yes

[20:30:40] <Amaranth> I suppose it would have to be to iterate queues

[20:30:43] <bjz> and distinguish between iterators that can refill

[20:31:35] <rsaarelm> I'm trying to debug mystery crashes from my homebrew STB truetype integration...
[20:31:45] <Amaranth> I think I should go study some SDL C++ bindings for inspiration, perhaps I'm just missing things
[20:31:50] <rsaarelm> Looks like it wasn't just the compiler doing clever stuff when I neglected to mark things mutable though...

[20:33:20] <bjz> rsaarelm: marking things as mutable just makes sure rustc knows as much about the semantics of your program as possible, so it can provide safety
[20:33:51] <bjz> not sure if it passes on anything to llvm

[20:41:31] <rsaarelm> ...Also I'm beginning to suspect not deallocating the data buffer the C side is obviously using to pull the data for the glyph functions before I call said glyph functions might be an idea worth considering.
