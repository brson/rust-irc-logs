[17:25:21] <brson> i may try to switch to windows again
[17:25:37] <brson> it shouldn't be that bad now
[17:25:51] <brson> maybe windows 10 will be great
[17:25:56] <brson> do we know if rust works on windows 10?
[17:26:01] <Elainemo> it does.
[17:26:09] <Elainemo> I tested it the day they released the dev preview :)
[17:26:14] <Elainemo> and people have been keeping it working
[17:26:31] <brson> Elainemo: are you running windows?
[17:26:36] <brson> and rust on windows
[17:26:38] <Elainemo> brson: on my desktop, yeah.
[17:27:04] <brson> wow, that's great. i hope it's tolerable. are you using msys2 and mingw-w64?
[17:27:08] <Elainemo> the game I never find time to work on is pure rust and fully cross-platform
[17:27:13] <Elainemo> yeah, that's what I use.
[17:27:14] <brson> Elainemo: do you use visual studio?
[17:27:29] <brson> what's the state of the plugin?
[17:27:33] <Elainemo> brson: yup, with visual rust.
[17:27:45] <Elainemo> It's still not great, but it has basic syntax highlighting and project management.
[17:27:49] <brson> also, what do you think a multirust-equivalent on windows would be like?
[17:27:52] <Elainemo> And now debugging support :)
[17:28:10] <Elainemo> since vosen took it over from me he's been doing a super great job on it.
[17:28:19] <brson> it would be great if the vs plugin would just manage the toolchains
[17:28:37] <brson> the onboarding flow might be -> install vs -> install plugin -> everything works
[17:29:05] <brson> the windows story would be 'just use vs'
[17:29:20] <brson> maybe there's a dropdown to switch channel
[17:30:06] <brson> nrc: maybe this week we can catch up on what your tooling plans are?
[17:30:50] <Elainemo> brson: I think it would be straightforward to have that sort of integration in Visual Rust.
[17:31:41] <Elainemo> I'm not sure what it'd look like outside of VS though
[17:31:51] <Elainemo> since the VS plugin invokes everything, it can put things in not-system locations etc.
[17:32:30] <brson> yeah
[17:32:59] <Elainemo> I might poke at that a bit today.
[17:33:09] <Elainemo> if it turns out to be hard I can least open a detailed issue
[17:33:19] <brson> cool. let me know how it goes
[17:33:51] <brson> a multirust written in Rust could work on windows except that it doesn't make dynamic loading magically work
[17:34:16] <brson> A rewrite would be pretty trivial - it's much easier to write rust than bash
[17:34:27] <Elainemo> amen
[17:35:22] <nrc> brson: yes! Are you coming to SF this week?
[17:36:08] <brson> nrc: sometime, yes. not today, probably tomorrow.
[17:36:22] <nrc> cool
[17:36:49] <brson> Elainemo: is your game source available?
[17:36:55] <Elainemo> brson: not yet
[17:37:41] <brson> hm, last night i revived ctrs again and did a lot of daydreaming about sources to scrape for unique snippets of rust
[17:38:39] <brson> i'm going to update ctrs (a big test suite of standalone rust code) to be driven by cargo, like with rust-skeptic, so `cargo build` will generate a sprawling tree of test cases
[17:38:51] <brson> each test case will be run rustc ala rustdoc --test
[17:38:56] <brson> and ala rust-skeptic
[17:39:10] <Elainemo> neat.
[17:40:16] <brson> i was thinking maybe stackoverflow, the issue tracker and forums, just scrape everything between fences
[17:40:37] <brson> throw them at the compiler, record the results, and that becomes a test case
[17:41:01] <brson> this might even make sense for code that doesn't compile
[17:41:13] <brson> though naive scraping could end up with a lot of negative cases that are clearly garbage
[18:50:21] <acrichto> brson: trying to run a crater build but getting an error, is something I can do to debug it? or just retry?
[18:52:34] <brson> acrichto: what's the error?
[18:53:10] <acrichto> error: TypeError: Cannot read property 'url' of null
[18:53:16] <acrichto> brson: ^ (that's all it spits out)
[18:53:22] <acrichto> the command is `cargo run --bin crater-cli crate-build 4c371bb6de7a1c21b7403b86a66a8ce3318ff003`
[18:54:07] <brson> acrichto: do you have the inspector link for the cust-build that created that toolchain?
[18:54:13] <brson> acrichto: and does it say 'completed'?
[18:54:16] <acrichto> either https://tools.taskcluster.net/task-inspector/#cUxy1G6rS_SeqsXpTU-hvw/0
[18:54:18] <acrichto> or https://tools.taskcluster.net/task-inspector/#DbeOfk64Q-uagilTrm-2GA/0
[18:54:21] <acrichto> and yeah they both completed
[18:55:31] * brson trying to reproduce
[18:56:02] <brson> i bet the monitor process ran out of auto-restarts and is dead
[18:58:03] <brson> indeed that's what happened. crater hasn't been processing TC messages
[18:58:37] <brson> acrichto: should work now
[18:58:57] <brson> this time monitor.js will restart 10,000 times before giving up
[18:59:39] <brson> fwiw on the crater machine under user crater there are two screen sessions running, one running monitor.js, and one crater-web
[19:57:38] <acrichto> brson: thanks! 
[19:57:42] <acrichto> does look like it's working now
[22:25:33] <acrichto> nrc: r? https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/27260
