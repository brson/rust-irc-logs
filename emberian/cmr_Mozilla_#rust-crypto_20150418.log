[00:57:17] <eternaleye> ...So I'm reading the wiki page about ATM (the network protocol), and I see a perfect example of OH DEAR GOD WHY regarding compromises and the ITU:
[00:57:19] <eternaleye> >> The choice of 48 bytes was political rather than technical.[6] When the CCITT (now ITU-T) was standardizing ATM, parties from the United States wanted a 64-byte payload because this was felt to be a good compromise in larger payloads optimized for data transmission and shorter payloads optimized for real-time applications like voice; parties from Europe wanted 32-byte payloads because the small size (and therefore short transmission 
[00:57:21] <eternaleye> times) simplify voice applications with respect to echo cancellation. Most of the European parties eventually came around to the arguments made by the Americans, but France and a few others held out for a shorter cell length. With 32 bytes, France would have been able to implement an ATM-based voice network with calls from one end of France to the other requiring no echo cancellation. 48 bytes (plus 5 header bytes = 53) was chosen as a 
[00:57:22] <eternaleye> compromise between the two sides.
[00:58:28] <eternaleye> And that's how you get a protocol where everything happens in 53-byte chunks.

[02:57:57] <bascule> eternaleye: lol
[02:58:01] <bascule> that sounds like DES!
[02:58:15] <bascule> IBM wanted a 64-bit key for DES (although Lucifer supported up to 128-bits)
[02:58:23] <bascule> the NSA wanted a 48-bit key
[02:58:33] <bascule> so they split the difference and settled on 56-bits
[02:58:51] <bascule> and IBM attributed the missing bits to "umm parity checksum error correction bits to prevent typos or something, I guess"
[03:01:24] <Ilari> Also, how IPv6 ended up at 128 bits. Originally it was meant to have 64, but they threw 64 more in order to support SLAAC, giving the current 64+64 structure.
[03:01:55] <bascule> yeah wtf
[03:01:59] <bascule> I don't get it
[03:04:15] <Ilari> Also, SLAAC has rather bad reputation.

[03:13:57] <Ilari> 1) Ties addresses with MACs. 2) Didn't suport even DNS, and that still isn't implemented.
[03:22:19] <eternaleye> Eh, SLAAC is a pain, but it's not the only way to allocate host addresses in a /64 by far.
[03:26:35] <Ilari> Yeah, it is not the only one. Doesn't mean the others are much better...

[14:32:51] <tiffany> was it this channel that linked the thing about /bin/true?
[14:33:27] <tiffany> stuff like this is probably a big reason the shell exists in the first place
[14:33:37] <tiffany> C files have more boilerplate to write a 1-line program than sh
[14:34:27] <tiffany> the 0-byte file trick to implement /bin/true is pretty interesting
