[12:47:44] <Seldaek> acrichto: so I'll try to do some last fixes/improvements to rustdoc_web tonight, and if I have enough time send a PR to add it in mozilla/rust
[12:48:04] <dbaupp> Seldaek: have you got the new search working?
[12:48:21] <Seldaek> acrichto: then you can probably take it from there regarding makefile stuff if needed ;)
[12:48:30] <Seldaek> dbaupp: no I also still have to do that :/
[12:48:38] <Seldaek> been kinda occupied with other things lately
[12:48:52] * dbaupp has too
[14:13:45] <acrichto> Seldaek: sweet!
[14:13:53] <acrichto> i will happily review/ferry it in
[19:01:14] <Seldaek> cmr: you did update the json now right?
[19:01:27] <cmr> Seldaek: Let me do that right now
[19:01:32] <Seldaek> alright
[19:01:33] <cmr> No use waiting until all the bugs are gone
[19:01:43] <Seldaek> no, we like bugs
[19:01:47] <cmr> :p
[19:27:05] <cmr> Seldaek: they're in the usual place

[19:54:38] <Seldaek> cmr: Impl is for a Generic variant but the id could not be resolved in: {"fields":[84439],"variant":"Generic"}
[19:54:44] <Seldaek> oh how I missed these nice error messages :p
[20:20:16] <Seldaek> cmr: just to be sure, does this include your change to External paths?
[20:27:48] <Seldaek> cmr: ah yes I see i tnow
[20:39:18] <Seldaek> cmr: yay, finally builds again.. now I can start making changes :|

[21:46:58] <cmr> Seldaek: I thank and praise you for the rustdoc_web stuff
[21:47:48] <Seldaek> stop it I'm just doing a mess :p
[21:48:03] <Seldaek> I can barely understand what I wrote last month
[21:48:16] <Seldaek> I feel bad about this :)
[21:48:16] <cmr> That's comforting, because neither could I :P
[21:48:41] <Seldaek> trying to list impls on primitives
[21:48:46] <Seldaek> I am in a bit of a pickle
[21:49:04] <Seldaek> I have all these http://pastie.org/8334294
[21:49:22] <Seldaek> as you see extra does implement a bunch of stuff on std things & primitives
[21:49:29] <cmr> Yes
[21:49:52] <Seldaek> not sure how to handle this nicely
[21:50:27] <cmr> Well, for real types, just show the trait as implemented on the type page (like std::hashmap::HashMap)
[21:50:41] <cmr> For the primitives, create a pseudo-type page in std
[21:51:00] <cmr> Like, in the std module, list the primtives types and have a page listing the trait impls
[21:51:28] <Seldaek> well for vec I guess it should be on the vec module
[21:51:36] <Seldaek> and str
[21:51:49] <cmr> Or maybe
[21:51:52] <cmr> Don't even keep it under std
[21:51:54] <Seldaek> and all others actually
[21:51:58] <cmr> Have an extra "crate" for "primitives"
[21:52:10] <cmr> Well std::int and such are slowly going away as we haev proper numerics in std::num
[21:52:35] <Seldaek> Oh fuck "pub use undefined::*;" 
[21:52:43] <Seldaek> regression :/
[21:53:07] <Seldaek> but anyway
[21:53:26] <Seldaek> I think on the str/index.html & equivalent makes more sense than a primitive crate no?
[21:53:33] <cmr> Not sure.
[21:53:42] <cmr> They aren't really types in std though
[21:53:45] <Seldaek> I don't know, both have merits
[21:54:14] <cmr> I don't particularly have a leaning one way or the other
[21:54:34] <Seldaek> problem is then it'd list them as primitive::int and all which would be even weirder
[21:54:39] <Seldaek> unless I hack even deeper :p
[21:54:51] <Seldaek> I'll try to get it into the std ones for now
[21:54:54] <Seldaek> that'd already be great
[22:03:00] <Seldaek> cmr: any idea if <std-macros>: can ever appear again in the "source" field?
[22:03:14] <cmr> Seldaek: Do you see it now?
[22:03:22] <cmr> What is the context of that question?
[22:04:17] <Seldaek> cmr: I have this uncommited workaround for it  here
[22:04:21] <Seldaek> because it happened a while back
[22:04:25] <Seldaek> seems gone now though
[22:04:40] <cmr> It shouldn't ever happen
[22:04:53] <Seldaek> ok cool
[22:37:29] <cmr> Seldaek: acrichto: need anything else from me for rustdoc_ng atm?
[22:37:48] <cmr> There are a handful of nice-to-haves but I think it's solidish now
[22:39:08] <acrichto> Seldaek said he'd put a pull up tonight with rustdoc_web stuff, so there's nothing pressing that I know of
[22:39:21] <Seldaek> acrichto: make that tomorrow :(
[22:40:14] <acrichto> good enough for me :)
[22:46:00] <Seldaek> acrichto: I actually can't promise I'll make it tomorrow either unfortunately
[22:46:18] <Seldaek> but yeah.. tonight I got caught up in things and didn't get far enough
[22:48:57] <acrichto> Seldaek: how much is left to do?
[22:49:01] <acrichto> I could start taking over it

[22:50:41] <Seldaek> acrichto: I'm trying to intergate the new search
[22:51:05] <acrichto> hmm, I may start working on it as-is to get it integrated into the tree
[22:51:44] <Seldaek> acrichto: well, after search I just need to add pandoc support (should be easy enough)
[22:51:51] <Seldaek> then I think I can PR it
[22:52:03] <Seldaek> it won't be 100% where I want it, but at least usable
[22:52:43] <acrichto> hm ok
[22:52:47] <acrichto> I'll be patient then :)
[23:07:15] <Seldaek> ok ok awesome
[23:07:34] <Seldaek> had to tweak a couple things
[23:07:42] <Seldaek> but now I'm quite happy with the new search :)
[23:08:31] <dbaupp> it's all integrated? \o/
[23:14:52] <Seldaek> yup
[23:15:00] <Seldaek> new search algo deployed
[23:15:26] <Seldaek> ToStr/tostr return the proper trait, and to_str the right thing too
[23:15:28] <Seldaek> happy
[23:16:33] <Seldaek> I think it's a lot faster to initialize too
[23:23:08] <Seldaek> cmr: oh scratch what I said before, I see <std-macros>:325:12 a bunch of times actually
[23:23:11] <acrichto> how do you pass --cfg stageN to rustdoc_ng over std.rs?
