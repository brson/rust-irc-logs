[16:59:50] <aturon> samth: hi Sam! i have an intern starting (meet Gankro) who was wondering about empirical research on the effect of things like type systems on bug reduction. know of any good work in that vicinity?
[17:01:46] <samth> aturon: Gankro: yes, the person to look at is stefan hanenberg: https://sites.google.com/site/stefanhanenberg/
[17:02:11] <samth> i will confess to some skepticism about what that work really tells us
[17:03:33] <samth> there's also this recent work: http://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~filkov/papers/lang_github.pdf
[17:04:20] <aturon> samth: thanks!
[17:05:26] <Gankro> samth: can you elaborate on what you're skeptical of?
[17:06:40] <samth> Gankro: because of the constraints of doing human experiments, and because when doing research you want to focus on only one difference, it's very hard to answer the questions you really want to know
[17:06:59] <samth> for example, experiments are mostly done on college students learning to program, rather than experts
[17:07:19] <samth> and are done on small code bases, rather than large, and for short times, rather than maintained for years
[17:08:05] <samth> also the languages are often simple variations of each other, rather than being the best representative of some language feature being studied
[17:09:48] <sbauman> :tn
[17:09:54] <sbauman> :tn
[17:11:02] <samth> sbauman: fancy meeting you here
[17:11:24] <sbauman> samth: How weird.
[17:11:32] <sbauman> Bit of a keyboard malfunction.
[17:13:01] <Gankro> samth: Fair enough. Not sure how to proceed, then. Would you say we have any understanding of if there are practical advantages/disadvantages to these approaches?
[17:13:21] <samth> Gankro: i'm not saying that it isn't useful work
[17:13:30] <samth> and it isn't at all my area
[17:14:07] <samth> but there are a variety of approaches -- for example, mining github tells you about real software, but is very un-controlled
[17:14:32] <samth> whereas a controlled experiment really tests what you ask for, but has a hard time translating to other settings
[17:15:05] <samth> Gankro: if you read the papers about this stuff, the researchers are usually quite good about describing these limitations themselves
[17:15:42] <Gankro> samth: Are there any papers from hanenberg you'd particularly recommend?
[17:17:18] <samth> Gankro: http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2661136.2661156 is an interesting (if polemical) introduction to these questions
[17:18:12] <Gankro> samth: In particular I'm interested in an extreme scenario: if pushing hard enough on encoding properties in types and/or static verification reaches a breaking point where understanding and maintainability breaks down and perhaps even bugs increase.
[17:29:20] <larsberg> Gankro: empirically, that definitely happens. The Spec# compiler came out of my team a few jobs ago, and we used both its static assertions and its theorem-prover (Boogie). The assertions that had to be written to satisfy the theorem prover were so onerous (both to write and for the theorem prover to run on) that people ended up writing the equivalent of
[17:29:21] <larsberg> Coq's "admit". I ultimately abandoned the use of the any of the stuff that required the theorem prover.
[17:29:21] <cmr> I pretty much agree with samth, I don't think those emperical studies have been particularly useful. Every time I see one it doesn't seem much better than "anecdote by deliberate survey"
[17:30:10] <cmr> Particular case studies can be excellent though, in measuring the expected overhead of an approach, or how people "feel" using it.
[17:31:23] <larsberg> Gankro: there are a few goofy bits you see inside unsafe Rust blocks in Servo, too. e.g., we're all so used to lifetime-related memory issues being checked that the fact that it *isn't* there in unsafe blocks has resulted in us returning memory that was freed more than once (typically where we forgot to use a 'ref' in a match expression and ended up moving
[17:31:24] <larsberg> something we shouldn't have)
[17:35:25] <Gankro> larsberg: Interesting! I'd really love to pick your brain on how Servo uses `unsafe`, benefits/issues, and possibly any comparison to how it compares to Firefox.
[17:36:31] *** Joins: oldskirt (oldskirt@moz-tpvdkd.dip0.t-ipconnect.de)

[17:37:42] <Gankro> cmr: No links, but the sounds familiar
[17:38:08] <aturon> Gankro: I can email it to you
[17:38:46] <Manishearth> Gankro: you're doing human experiments for Mozilla?
[17:38:48] <Manishearth> good good
[17:38:49] <Gankro> cmr: You can work on research even in your undergrad! At least in Canada we have NSERC DSRI for that. Dunno about the states.
[17:38:53] <Manishearth> raise the army of the undead
[17:39:34] <aturon> Gankro: sent. it's a proposal from my postdoc supervisor
[17:40:24] <Manishearth> Gankro: Firefox is an application that's wrapped in one big `unsafe`-ball :p
[17:40:39] <Manishearth> unsafe mod firefox {/* yolo */}
[17:40:59] <cmr> Gankro: yeah I'm doing research this summer and next year, but it's not, you know, super fascinating ;)
[17:41:36] <Gankro> cmr: Why not work with those guys?
[17:43:14] <cmr> Gankro: they haven't started yet!
[17:43:40] <Gankro> bah, excuses!
[17:44:03] <cmr> I got a position on a group doing theorem proving though, so I'm inching close to it
[17:45:37] <Manishearth> larsberg: fwiw the ref-move-things (In the DOM at any rate) aren't inside unsafe blocks -- our spidermonkey bindings let you do technically unsafe things in safe code. They're disallowed by a lint
[17:45:42] <Manishearth> an imperfect lint, but a lint
[17:46:45] <larsberg> Manishearth: Definitely! The ones I'm thinking of were all in FFI boundaries where we were munging some Rust enum into or out of a C-friendly format.
[17:46:58] <Manishearth> ah okay
[17:47:35] <Manishearth> larsberg: so, a stack based value that C lets us borrow and we obligingly move it?
[17:47:54] <Manishearth> perhaps we should use Tenacious or something in those areas too
[17:49:31] <larsberg> Manishearth: I don't recall the details, but could dig up the code changes that fixed them. I do remember being irritated enough about it that I talked to people (including Derek <grin>) about it a lot at ICFP '14 in the context of "we really need something stronger for unsafe code" :-)
[17:50:25] <Manishearth> we should fork rustc, and call it the "servo compiler"
[17:50:33] <Manishearth> thereby coming full circle
[17:51:36] <Manishearth> I do know how to make tenacious perfect (I think), since it uses internal move-tracking stuff anyway, but it needs some yak shaving in rustc to reduce false positives
[17:54:55] <Manishearth> larsberg: Derek who?
[17:56:09] <Manishearth> Dreyer? I've heard that name...
