[02:39:18] <Havvy> [It is humorous though]
[02:42:14] <XMPPwocky> Havvy: funnily enough, that actually does work in certain IRCds
[02:42:46] <XMPPwocky> ones that are integrated w/ their services will often block nickserv passwords being sent out, so if you typo /msg NickServ IDENTIFY foo
[02:42:53] <XMPPwocky> then NikServ doesn't get your password
[02:43:16] <whipsch> most services deny nicks like *serv usually
[02:43:43] <XMPPwocky> oh, huh, mozilla IRC does it
[02:43:51] <Havvy> Mibbit network blocks *serv nicknames.

[02:44:51] <Havvy> Should we file a bug?

[02:45:27] <XMPPwocky> yeah it does that in channel too
[02:45:55] <niconii> XMPPwocky: oh, the password thing?

[02:46:11] <Havvy> My (insecure) password is hmagic.
[02:46:16] <BunnyServ> buttpony
[02:46:23] <BunnyServ> hmm, didn't seem to censor it
[02:46:30] <Havvy> Now, did you see "hmagic", or something else?
[02:46:41] <BunnyServ> Havvy: I saw hmagic
[02:46:56] <Havvy> So this network has no password protections.
[02:47:00] <BunnyServ> Havvy: What did you see from me
[02:47:07] <Havvy> "buttpony"
[02:47:11] <BunnyServ> cool
[02:47:20] <niconii> now i'm wondering if XMPPwocky just claimed it scrubbed them to get you guys to paste your passwords in here ;)
[02:47:26] <BunnyServ> so my own personal password protection is working
[02:47:35] <Havvy> niconii:  I changed my password before testing. ;)
[02:48:03] <Havvy> "hmagic" was my original password when I was 12.
[02:48:10] <BunnyServ> don't worry, I haz plugins that replace my password with buttpony

[04:59:44] <blue_deref> phew. the basic structure of my chat program is finished. users can connect with a name and send messages which are displayed in the servers output. Now I just need to broadcast messages to users, and verify that their usernames aren't taken when they connect, and I will have satisfied the humble specification of my first Rust project.
[04:59:59] <blue_deref> but the question is, do I press forward and finish these features, or clean the code?
[05:00:17] <blue_deref> cleaning the code either comes now or later, and we got some sections that are 5 indents deep D:
[05:01:33] <blue_deref> oh God. I have 4 lines that are 7 indents deep
[05:01:44] <cmr> that's not really unusual in rust.
[05:02:03] <blue_deref> It pushes you in that direction, it seems.

[10:00:59] <eddyb> aji: if you use the *correct* name for it, it's almost obvious
[10:01:04] <eddyb> anonimized return types
[10:01:12] <GBGamer> eddyb: that's the word
[10:01:13] <eddyb> the caller doesn't see the real type
[10:01:27] <eddyb> you may not be able to write the real type
[10:01:38] <aji> i think i see.
[10:01:50] <aji> how is it different than  fn does_something<T: Trait>() -> T
[10:01:54] <eddyb> but it still works (at the lowest level) as if the real type was in the signature. at the type level, you're restricted to the exposed trait interface
[10:01:59] <eddyb> aji: sheesh
[10:02:05] <eddyb> aji: that should be in a FAQ
[10:02:10] <aji> lol
[10:02:19] <eddyb> aji: that function is instantiable for *every possible T ever* that implements Trait
[10:03:02] <aji> ah, determined by the caller, not the callee?
[10:03:02] <eddyb> it's "forall"
[10:03:04] <eddyb> yes
[10:03:11] <eddyb> while -> impl Trait is a funky existential
[10:03:12] <aji> makes sense.
[10:03:17] <eddyb> the entire function is existential
[10:03:33] <eddyb> exists T: Trait.fn() -> T
[10:03:55] <aji> same as those "expected type parameter, found concrete type" errors i was getting
[10:04:10] <aji> which is a confusing way to word that imo but i can't think of a better way
[10:04:21] <eddyb> aji: it's not a specific error
[10:04:46] <eddyb> one of the things is a type parameter, the other one is some specific type
[10:04:53] <aji> "expected &K, got &String" or something was the specific error
[10:05:00] <eddyb> you'll get similar errors for any type mismatches
[10:05:58] <aji> i'm kind of going on a tangent but the conceptual leap i made to understad that is the same as i made to understand why these anonymized return types are different from generic constraints
[10:06:04] <aji> understand*
[10:06:18] <eddyb> crap I wrote anonimized
[10:06:26] <eddyb> that y still gives me trouble
[10:06:57] <GBGamer> eddyb: I wouldn't worry about it, it made sense
[10:07:08] <aji> so here's a question,
[10:07:15] <GBGamer> (although I do take a very cavalier approach to spelling)
[10:07:23] <eddyb> GBGamer: yeah, but I have to remmeber to use the right form in all the comments
[10:07:24] <aji> could you do something like "trait Foo { fn does_thing() -> impl Bar; }
[10:07:32] <eddyb> aji: that's the second stage
[10:07:44] <eddyb> aji: it actually means something different from free functions and impls
[10:07:51] <GBGamer> eddyb: ah yeah, right. I think vim has a spellchecker?
[10:08:03] <eddyb> that's an unnamed associated type
[10:08:21] <aji> hm, you're right
[10:08:23] <eddyb> GBGamer: so does my editor. it's going to make half the comments and strings red
[10:08:44] <eddyb> aji: so you could impl that with a concrete type *or* an anonymized one
[10:08:45] <aji> so with type inference this isn't actually new functionality, just ergonomics?
[10:08:49] <GBGamer> what editor do you use, and why don't you just have the spell checker on?
[10:09:00] <eddyb> aji: it is new functionality, this doesn't involve type inference
[10:09:22] <Manishearth> GBGamer: ah I see
[10:09:35] <eddyb> GBGamer: kate and I told you why
[10:09:44] <aji> how is anonymized return types from named types, though
[10:09:47] <eddyb> GBGamer: a lot of stuff just doesn't make sense in English
[10:09:48] <aji> different*
[10:09:55] <aji> actually
[10:10:00] <eddyb> the types being type-checked are tied to the location they were written in
[10:10:00] <aji> at this point i should probably just peek at the rfc
[10:10:07] <eddyb> the RFC is not clear on this
[10:10:14] <eddyb> I mean, the RFC uses the wrong terminology :P
[10:10:28] <Mutabah> eddyb: 105, or a new one?
[10:10:31] <GBGamer> eddyb: ah, yeah, I get kinda what you're saying
[10:10:47] <eddyb> if you have fn foo() -> impl Trait {...} fn bar() -> impl Trait {...} then typeof(foo()) != typeof(bar())
[10:10:58] <eddyb> they have the exact same capabilities, but they're distinct types
[10:11:21] <eddyb> if you add type params, typeof(foo::<T>()) != typeof(foo::<U>()) iff T != U
[10:11:36] <eddyb> even if the concrete return type doesn't include the type param
[10:12:07] <eddyb> during monomorphization (before codegen), you can replace them with the real types collected during type-checking
[10:12:24] <eddyb> but until then, you don't need the real types
[10:12:27] <aji> foo() is only allowed to return one kind of T: Trait, though, right?
[10:12:35] <eddyb> yes
[10:12:51] <aji> so it's sort of like the return type is inferred?
[10:12:59] <eddyb> no, it's not
[10:13:15] <Mutabah> aji: Not really inferred, just deduced
[10:13:21] <eddyb> again, there is no inference at play here. it's non-dynamic existential erasure
[10:14:02] <eddyb> the caller sees that it's "some type" while the callee has to provide a specific type. they never meet during typeck
[10:15:16] <aji> the caller needs to be able to resolve the calls statically, though, so at some point the caller needs to be aware of the concrete type, right?
[10:15:24] <eddyb> aji: that's codegen
[10:15:36] <eddyb> *post* monomorphization. it's pretty late
[10:16:06] <aji> right so from a feature-wise functional standpoint, it's similar to asking the compiler to put a concrete type in the function signature based on the body of the function, right?
[10:16:16] <eddyb> nope
[10:17:00] <aji> hm
[10:17:08] <aji> i guess i'll have to play with it when it's finished
[10:17:11] <Mutabah> aji: You can't do that, because there's no way of ensuring that that signature is valid when it's used
[10:17:33] <Mutabah> aji: So, the trick is to not care about the concrete type until all functions have been typechecked
[10:17:45] <Mutabah> (which is when that type is known)
[10:18:01] <aji> well like, imagine fn foo() -> impl Eq { 3 }
[10:18:13] <eddyb> you can write foo() == foo()
[10:18:18] <eddyb> you can't write foo() == 3
[10:18:53] <aji> ok now i'm confused
[10:19:01] <eddyb> it's *anonimized*
[10:19:07] <eddyb> you don't know what type it returned
[10:19:13] <aji> ah
[10:19:19] <eddyb> unless you do something hacky like use the type_name intrinsic
[10:19:36] <eddyb> (which is evaluated during codegen)
[10:19:41] <Mutabah> only that it conforms to the provided trait, and that it is concrete
[10:19:52] <eddyb> Mutabah: well, +?Sized would be a thing
[10:20:02] <eddyb> even if slighly pointless

[10:20:19] <Mutabah> Oh, yeah :)
[10:20:23] <Mutabah> Actually, that'd be interesting
[10:20:45] <eddyb> the hard part of anonimized types is matching concrete types to the `impl Trait` nodes
[10:20:46] <Mutabah> That would mean that the return value could not be saved, only directly used
[10:20:50] <Mutabah> Yeah
[10:20:54] <eddyb> and then normalized
[10:20:57] <eddyb> Mutabah: oh, not raw
[10:21:03] <eddyb> -> Box<impl Trait+?Sized>
[10:21:06] <Mutabah> Ah
[10:21:11] <eddyb> -> impl ?Sized wouldn't be allowed
[10:21:33] <eddyb> one issue is that you can have an arbitrary number of these damn things per function
[10:21:57] <eddyb> I know how to match them, just substitute all ty_anon for inference variables and then resolve the inference variables during writeback
[10:22:11] <eddyb> restricting them to return types of free fns and non-trait impls is... well, harder :D
[10:22:31] <eddyb> I might have to abuse the "region scope"
[10:22:44] <eddyb> since it's the only thing special to return types
[10:23:23] <eddyb> (it's the mechanism allowing lifetimes to be elided)
[10:27:17] <aji> is there a bootstrapping rust compiler/interpreter somewhere, or is the only option to use pre-built rust compilers?
[10:28:32] <Mutabah> aji: At the moment, rustc uses a snapshot to bootstrap

[10:30:43] <aji> for a second i thought about building an interpreter

[10:32:09] <Mutabah> Well, I lost my sanity ages ago
[10:32:09] <GBGamer> Mutabah: what are you writing it in?
[10:32:16] <aji> if i actually did this i'd do it in python, and leave off the fancy stuff like borrow checking and type inference
[10:32:16] <Mutabah> (And yes, I've checked behind the couch)
[10:32:24] <aji> then i'd use it to run only rustc
[10:32:26] <eddyb> I wouldn't be surprised to see something written in Haskell

[10:32:38] <eddyb> aji: no, you can't leave anything like that off
[10:32:54] <Mutabah> borrowck can be ignored, thankfully
[10:32:55] <aji> well if you do it all with dynamic typing you aren't really "inferring" types at that point

[10:33:00] <Mutabah> but type inferrence... can't be

[10:33:48] <Mutabah> eddyb: Wonder how that would work with stuff like collect?
[10:33:49] <aji> i just want an interpreter capable enough to run rustc
[10:33:57] <aji> so it can compile itself
[10:34:00] <eddyb> Mutabah: what would?
[10:34:17] <eddyb> aji: can Python even have a heap larger than 4GB?
[10:34:17] <Mutabah> eddyb: Dynamic typing in place of type inferrence
[10:34:20] <eddyb> ah
[10:34:33] <eddyb> I'm not sure I want to find out :D
[10:34:37] <aji> i don't think it would work, though.
[10:34:40] <eddyb> oh, you know what
[10:34:46] <eddyb> aji: trait selection is going to mess you up
[10:34:47] <aji> let x = something_generic();
[10:34:54] <aji> x.something_not_generic()
[10:35:02] <eddyb> that one is actually pretty easy
[10:35:08] <eddyb> well, no
[10:35:19] <Mutabah> Yeah, I'm up to type checking/inferrence now (well, once I get Self translation done)
[10:35:24] <Mutabah> and it's going to be a challenge
[10:35:32] <aji> ok so type inference would have to be there, but we did that in my compilers class
[10:35:37] <Mutabah> (Self translation = Replacing 'Self' in places where it's concretely known)
[10:35:38] <aji> we did not do borrow checking, though ;3
[10:35:41] <eddyb> if you don't have side effects, you could do it the lazy FP way
[10:35:49] <eddyb> aji: borrow checking is easier than type checking
[10:36:05] <eddyb> well, if you remove lifetime inference from type checking...
[10:36:19] <eddyb> still not easy
[10:36:31] <eddyb> aji: and not everything you did your compiler class is applicable
[10:36:39] <eddyb> a lot of things in Rust are ad-hoc
[10:36:48] <aji> i'd leave off type checking and make type errors a runtime error
[10:37:07] <eddyb> type "checking" is an inference mismatch
[10:37:28] <eddyb> the "checking" part is more of a side-effect of computing types
[10:37:42] <eddyb> there is no sanity pass, though nmatsakis wants to add something like that
[10:37:49] <aji> i suppose that's true
[10:38:04] <eddyb> there are minor checks here and there, but nothing significant
[10:38:17] <eddyb> Mutabah: what would "Self translation" mean?
[10:38:34] <eddyb> it feels like you're trying to approximate the type-system, instead of replicating it
[10:38:46] <aji> Self is just a type parameter
[10:39:26] <eddyb> if Rust didn't have trait selection or trait objects, sure :P
[10:39:59] <eddyb> well, I suppose it's "impl selection"
[10:40:04] <aji> so then it's more correctly an associated type?
[10:40:22] <aji> i could have sworn it was the rust reference that said Self is an implicit type parameter
[10:40:28] <eddyb> it is a type parameter, but not "just" a type parameter

[10:45:09] <aji> lifetimes determine when destructors are called, right?
[10:45:23] <eddyb> another common misconception - no, it's the other way around
[10:45:50] <eddyb> the lifetime of an object ends when its scope ends (which is when the destructor runs)
[10:46:22] <aji> so it's not necessarily that one determines the other, just that they're two names for the same problem
[10:46:29] <eddyb> no
[10:46:49] <eddyb> well, ugh
[10:47:01] <eddyb> the scope for which an object lives is syntactic
[10:47:15] <Mutabah> eddyb: I said it just below, It's just replacing "Self" when it's concretely known (making later sections easier)
[10:47:16] <eddyb> it can become somewhat dynamic with shared ownership and friends
[10:47:27] <eddyb> Mutabah: oops
[10:47:28] <aji> what about move semantics, stuff like drop()
[10:47:38] <eddyb> drop isn't special
[10:47:42] <eddyb> if you mean the free function
[10:47:46] <Mutabah> eddyb: Also involves annotating other instances of Self with the bounds
[10:47:49] <aji> it's not, but it's not syntactic, it's semantic
[10:47:50] <eddyb> drop(x); is equivalent to {x};
[10:48:16] <aji> i see what you're saying.
[10:48:27] <eddyb> aji: borrow checking ensures you don't take a reference to a variable that was moved
[10:48:46] <eddyb> Mutabah: that's scary
[10:48:56] <eddyb> Mutabah: which Self are you even talking about?
[10:49:42] <eddyb> aji: but the scope still ends in the same place
[10:49:48] <Mutabah> eddyb: Any place Self (the type name) is used
[10:49:56] <eddyb> Mutabah: syntactical Self?
[10:49:58] <Mutabah> Maybe I shoudl try to figure out how rustc does it
[10:50:02] <Mutabah> Yes
[10:50:19] <eddyb> in a trait, it's a specific kind of type parameter
[10:50:27] <aji> i see, so, functions that consume values are also an end of a scope
[10:50:32] <eddyb> aji: nope
[10:50:49] <eddyb> aji: the scope doesn't change, it's still a syntactical block
[10:50:59] <eddyb> aji: the value gets pulled out of the scope though
[10:51:17] <eddyb> and right now it gets dynamically marked as "don't run dtor"
[10:51:56] <eddyb> in the future straight code won't have any checks, and conditial control-flow will have stack/SSA flags
[10:52:03] <eddyb> *conditional
[10:52:07] <aji> man i'm confused. this was not the best conversation to embark on at 4am, lol
[10:52:17] <eddyb> a scope is {...}
[10:52:22] <aji> well i get that
[10:52:31] <eddyb> the dtor *always* gets called at the end of the scope
[10:52:34] <eddyb> even if the value was moved
[10:52:40] <aji> lifetimes are tied to scopes, destructors are called when a value goes out of scope, UNLESS the value has been moved
[10:52:42] <eddyb> (at least that's the case right now)
[10:52:45] <aji> oh, really?
[10:52:48] <aji> so a destructor can be called twice?
[10:52:55] <eddyb> not a Drop impl
[10:53:12] <aji> genned destructor code checks that Drop impl is only called once?
[10:53:13] <eddyb> there's automatic checks inserted to avoid executing anything twice
[10:53:17] <eddyb> yes
[10:53:18] <aji> cool
[10:53:32] <eddyb> it's going to be more static in the future, but somewhat of a pain to implement
[10:53:33] <aji> so moves are just part of the borrow checker then
[10:53:43] <eddyb> rustc itself is not very clean everywhere
[10:53:50] <aji> compilers seldom are
[10:54:02] <eddyb> I mean, some of it is old enough to be messy
[10:54:15] <eddyb> the newer parts are pretty
[10:54:50] <aji> well the good news is, once a compiler emits code, it's done. it's not like a server which needs to stay up forever
[10:54:51] <eddyb> you can implement moves dynamically quite trivially
[10:55:08] <eddyb> using the strategy to be used by rustc in the future
[10:55:21] <eddyb> each stack variable that has a destructor gets a flag
[10:55:30] <eddyb> you move it, you set the flag
[10:56:03] <eddyb> you can even remove the variable from a map of variables, if you're that dynamic

[11:01:57] <niconii> aji: yeah, it's kinda funny to see a function like drop() that somehow has practical use, yet is completely empty
[11:02:07] <eddyb> niconii: meh
[11:02:08] <eddyb> {x};
[11:02:11] <aji> i'm just not sure if i'm ready to put in the effort of a working rust impl lol, even if it's incredibly gimped
[11:02:15] <eddyb> too bad it's cryptic
[11:02:34] <eddyb> aji: I made a tiny VM and then got bored
[11:03:07] <Layl> I should re-make my old brainfuck implementation in rust
[11:03:11] <Layl> from C#
[11:03:23] <Layl> you never know when you need threaded brainfuck
[11:03:45] <eddyb> Layl: have you seen huon's brainfuck compiler :P?
[11:03:50] <Layl> I have not
[11:03:59] <niconii> i wrote brainfuck in rust once
[11:04:09] <niconii> then i wrote 99 bottles in brainfuck from scratch
[11:04:11] <aji> brainfuck is a popular one, lol
[11:04:18] <niconii> then all happiness and joy faded from this earth
[11:04:21] <aji> niconii: full english sentences and all?
[11:04:24] <aji> wtf is wrong with you, lol
[11:04:46] <niconii> aji: yep
[11:05:06] <aji> for a while i was going to write an irc bot in brainfuck
[11:05:18] <aji> as part of an effort to write basic irc bots in as many languages as possible
[11:05:34] <eddyb> https://github.com/eddyb/rs0/blob/master/src/rs-3/x64-linux/vm.s I should get around to adding load an store
[11:05:37] <aji> then i had a moment of lucidity and sought redemption
[11:06:37] * eddyb wonders whether it's possible to have that same memory layout in 32-bit x86. and also keep everything in registers
[11:06:57] <niconii> i've gotta say, writing a brainfuck interpreter is about 10,000 times more fun than actually writing brainfuck
[11:07:17] <Layl> well, duh
[11:07:41] <Layl> I wonder how hard it would be to write a llvm backend to make it output brainfuck
[11:07:45] <niconii> even slamming your hand in a door is more fun than actually writing brainfuck...
[11:08:09] <Layl> so I can compile rustc into brainfuck
[11:08:12] <Layl> for no good reason whatsoever
[11:08:37] <aji> i think llvm has too many assumptions about its backend for that, lol
[11:09:11] <aji> though theoretically it's possible.
[11:09:48] <Layl> I'm gonna guess it's not worth the effort
[11:10:49] <aji> there's probably some dumb least-effort way of doing it
[11:11:34] <niconii> the real question is "just how fucking big would it end up being in brainfuck"
[11:12:39] <Layl> I'm gonna take a guess and say it's not going to fit on my SSD
[11:12:50] <aji> say "more symbols than there are atoms in the universe" in an authoritative blog post and watch it go unquestioned for days
[11:14:21] <Layl> time for a wildly inaccurate and incorrectly done fermi estimation
[11:14:54] <Layl> how big is rustc's SLOC
[11:16:41] <eddyb> 300k
[11:16:48] <eddyb> or something around there
[11:17:14] <eddyb> fun fact: Servo has more code now than Rust's src/lib*
[11:17:27] <Layl> alright let's see
[11:17:38] <Layl> C++ 99 bottles is 19 lines here
[11:17:55] <Layl> brainfuck is 250
[11:18:15] <eddyb> you should measure chars in brainfuck
[11:18:45] <Layl> 7720  characters
[11:19:02] <Layl> just about 400 characters brainfuck per C++ line
[11:19:15] <Layl> rough rounding because estimation
[11:19:42] <Layl> 400 * 300,000 lines of rust, I know rust will give different SLOC than C++ but got no other statistics right now
[11:19:56] <Layl> 120,000,000 characters
[11:20:04] <eddyb> huh
[11:20:09] <eddyb> you sure that's right?
[11:20:17] <GBGamer> that's only like, 120 megs, right?
[11:20:20] <Layl> that would be very odd
[11:20:20] <niconii> you know, i'm starting to see the issue with measuring it like this
[11:20:31] <aji> bf size increases with code complexity
[11:20:39] <aji> faster than C++ or rust size increases

[11:20:42] *** Joins: adu (ajr@moz-0foa9t.md.comcast.net)
[11:20:43] <Layl> fair point
[11:20:46] <huon> everything has to be inlined
[11:20:50] <niconii> the thing is, even if brainfuck isn't significantly larger character-wise
[11:20:55] <huon> it'd run so fast.
[11:21:25] <Layl> not to mention llvm itself would have to be compiled to bf as well
[11:21:26] <niconii> there is a vast amount of pain and anguish imbued in every single character
[11:21:27] <eddyb> measure binary sizes
[11:21:45] <eddyb> or number of opcodes
[11:21:53] <Layl> who wants to implement a vtable in bf
[11:21:59] <GBGamer> night y'all
[11:22:13] <eddyb> not GBGamer, I guess
[11:22:15] <huon> seems like a BF backend for LLVM would be the easiest way to get this to work

[11:22:56] <eddyb> huon: how do you call functions or recurse?
[11:23:05] <eddyb> seems you need to write a VM :P
[11:23:33] <huon> eddyb: easy, it's all just implementation details
[11:23:36] <huon> :P
[11:23:39] <niconii> write the vm in brainfuck
[11:23:46] <eddyb> niconii: that's what I mean
[11:23:57] <Layl> the backend itself as well
[11:24:04] <Layl> is there objective-brainfuck yet
[11:24:14] <niconii> can we write the brainfuck interpreter in brainfuck too
[11:24:23] <niconii> it needs to be self-hosting to compete with rust
[11:24:26] <eddyb> niconii: I think huon's demo is just that
[11:24:40] <niconii> disturbing
[11:24:44] <huon> http://www.parkscomputing.com/2014/04/pbrain/
[11:24:45] <aji> easiest way imo would be some kind of ir
[11:24:56] <huon> eddyb: I didn't write the BF interpreter in BF
[11:25:06] <huon> just copied it of the vastness of the internet
[11:25:12] <eddyb> of course
[11:25:43] <Layl> it would have to be multithreaded for speed of course
[11:25:51] <aji> like implement some kind of stack machine
[11:26:33] <eddyb> aji: have you seen https://github.com/eddyb/rs0/blob/master/src/rs-3/x64-linux/vm.s#L34?
[11:26:35] <aji> like, find a way to compile llvm code to stack machine code, then compile that into bf
[11:27:30] <aji> eddyb: if you could implement that in bf then it would be a workable LLVM backend no?
[11:27:30] <eddyb> it's easier to run a stack machine bytecode in a bf VM rather than translating it to bf
[11:27:32] <huon> eddyb: is '.' an identifier character or a namespace character?
[11:27:44] <eddyb> huon: both and neither :D
[11:27:58] <eddyb> huon: method access and namespace, I guess
[11:28:06] <aji> running it in a bf vm and translating to bf are just two sides of the same coin
[11:28:10] <aji> aren't they?
[11:28:15] <eddyb> huon: "S" is an "object" in the pseudocode
[11:28:50] <eddyb> huon: but in the assembler, . is just another character allowed in identifiers
[11:29:21] <eddyb> aji: well, I do plan to have some kind of way to create that from LLVM
[11:29:45] <eddyb> most likely emulate LLVM's C API while producing RS-3 bytecode
[11:30:31] <eddyb> I linked this in here before, but in case you didn't see it, macro assembler abuse https://github.com/eddyb/rs0/blob/master/src/rs-2/examples/fib.rs-2

[15:28:40] <eddyb> Tiffany: you can manipulate Lua bytecode from within Lua code? I didn't know this
[15:29:16] <Tiffany> eddyb: lua has both string.dump() and loadstring(), which serialize and deserialize to/from bytecode respectively
[15:29:36] <Tiffany> if you're sandboxing lua, you'll probably want to remove string.dump() entirely, and nerf loadstring to not allow bytecode loading
[15:29:37] <Astrum|Lap> well that sounds safe
[15:30:14] <eddyb> I am not aware of any JS engine that does this
[15:30:46] <eddyb> on the web, it would be suicidal
[15:30:55] <Quxxy> window.loadRawX86Code("...")
[15:31:10] <eddyb> while Lua was developed for quite a different purpose
[15:31:28] <Tiffany> lua is often cited as a good language for running sandboxed code
[15:31:41] <Tiffany> but you have to butcher the language in order to make it safe
[15:31:46] <Tiffany> and that's not counting implementation flaws
[15:33:31] <eddyb> [citation needed]
[15:33:41] <Tiffany> of the top of my head, all of these need to be removed or nerfed: os.*, most of io.* depending on whether you want arbitrary filesystem access, debug.*, newproxy, loadstring, getmetatable, setmetatable, getfenv, setfenv, string.dump, probably some bits of package.*
[15:33:56] <Tiffany> package.* lets you load arbitrary C DLLs, although you can only use them if they implement this special lua ABI
[15:34:14] <Tiffany> but both windows and linux have these sort of shared library constructors
[15:34:23] <Tiffany> so you just need to load it, not call any code in it
[15:34:30] <Tiffany> so yeah
[15:34:37] <Tiffany> you can use io.* to create a shared library
[15:34:41] <Tiffany> write your shell code to it
[15:34:52] <Tiffany> and then require() it

[15:35:10] <eddyb> even if execve is disabled with a syscall filter?
[15:35:20] <Tiffany> it doesn't use execve
[15:35:22] <Tiffany> it uses dlopen()
[15:35:39] <eddyb> right, what I mean is, there's no way to block it at the system level
[15:35:52] <Tiffany> maybe?
[15:35:57] <eddyb> like you could creating a process
[15:36:00] <Tiffany> it has to call out to the dynamic linker
[15:36:10] <eddyb> yeah, but that's in the same process
[15:36:16] <eddyb> AFAIK
[15:36:37] <Tiffany> yeah
[15:36:42] <eddyb> Tiffany: sorry, I skipped a few steps there
[15:36:50] <Tiffany> if you have a sufficiently fancy syscall filter
[15:36:53] <eddyb> I'm assuming you're allowed to use /tmp
[15:36:58] <Tiffany> you can block mmap with MAP_EXEC
[15:37:05] <Tiffany> as long as you're okay not using luajit
[15:37:09] <eddyb> but you can't just start a process
[15:37:12] <eddyb> Tiffany: oh that's smart
[15:37:23] <eddyb> and block mprotect
[15:37:39] <Tiffany> lua actually has a wrapper for mktemp()

[17:13:10] <dfockler> I was looking at that yesterday
[17:13:16] <Astrum|Lap> actually I was thinking about implementing the cassowary constraint solver in rust
[17:13:55] <Astrum|Lap> ccss and gss used/use it
[17:14:03] <Astrum|Lap> not quite in the same vein as markdown
[17:14:10] <Astrum|Lap> but.... similar'ish
[17:14:10] <duncan> Astrum|Lap: ha, i have a half-done implementation of it, but never got around to finishing
[17:14:16] <Quxxy> I wish something like that was integrated into CSS
[17:14:27] <Quxxy> The formatting on the iterator cheat sheet is *so* brittle
[17:14:35] <duncan> Astrum|Lap: I would love to see a completed one
[17:14:36] <Astrum|Lap> Quxxy: well you can use the (probably performance plagued) gss library
[17:14:44] <Quxxy> I could make it look so nice if I could just say "vertically align thing A with thing B"
[17:14:58] <Astrum|Lap> duncan: if I have some free time I may just do that
[17:15:08] <Quxxy> Astrum|Lap: I went out of my way to *get rid* of JS running in the page :P
[17:15:21] <Astrum|Lap> Quxxy: I understand
[17:15:26] <duncan> Astrum|Lap: yea, free time was the problem I ran into too :(
[17:15:36] <dfockler> you can use that to generate css
[17:15:41] <Astrum|Lap> seems to be a problem with standards
[17:15:53] <Astrum|Lap> yay, stuck with JS and CSS and HTML
[17:17:04] <Astrum|Lap> duncan: it definitely sucks having a job
[17:17:16] <Astrum|Lap> even when you do have free time... programming isn't something you want to do
[17:17:19] <Astrum|Lap> or at least I don't
[17:17:43] <duncan> yea, i go through phases
[17:17:45] <Astrum|Lap> which is a shame, because I have a bunch of project ideas I'd really love to work on
[17:18:13] <duncan> sometimes I'm so burnt out at the end of the day that I ignore the computer until the next day
[17:18:22] <Quxxy> Anyway, bed for me
[17:18:25] <Astrum|Lap> yeah, I've done that
[17:18:26] * Quxxy waves
[17:18:30] <Astrum|Lap> night
[17:18:31] <duncan> and sometimes I get home and need to scratch an itch, and end up staynig up all night coding
[17:18:35] <duncan> Quxxy: \o
[17:18:53] <duncan> but I have a couple kids now, so those nights are few and far between lol
[17:19:14] <Astrum|Lap> well for me I usually get hom home at 6'ish, work out, eat dinner, do mandatory adult stuff, then it's 9 and at that point I don't feel like doing any more
[17:19:24] <Astrum|Lap> -hom

[18:00:43] <cow_2001> reading this http://rustbyexample.com/macros.html
[18:01:37] <dfockler> macro_rules!!!!!
[18:02:55] <Astrum|Lap> I still think macros are messy in rust
[18:04:03] <Tobba> considering they're still not properly hygenic, I'd call them a bit of a hack
[18:04:35] <dfockler> what does hygenic mean?
[18:04:43] <dfockler> in the context of macros
[18:06:24] <Astrum|Lap> wait, they're not?
[18:06:53] <eddyb> Astrum|Lap: they are for variables
[18:07:02] <eddyb> items are not hygienic
[18:07:07] <eddyb> which includes all types
[18:07:11] <Tobba> Astrum|Lap: the stupid $crate hack
[18:07:15] <Astrum|Lap> ah
[18:07:16] <eddyb> lol, that too
[18:07:23] <eddyb> that's resolution hygiene though
[18:07:34] <eddyb> scope hygiene?
[18:07:38] <eddyb> it's all very crazy
[18:07:45] <Tobba> you'd think you could translate the paths when using the macro
[18:07:46] <Tobba> but nooooope
[18:07:47] <eddyb> the variable hygiene is expensive and it barely works
[18:08:03] <eddyb> and it only works because variables have to be defined before they're used
[18:08:09] <eddyb> good luck making that work with items
[18:08:49] <eddyb> and it's state of the art AFAIK
[18:09:01] <Astrum|Lap> this is going to lead to 'proper' programming by convention later on isn't it? heh
[18:09:15] <eddyb> so if you make it work with items, you'll be doing a world's first
[18:09:21] <eddyb> academic research fun
[18:09:36] <eddyb> it's so much easier when everything is define-before-use or dynamically scoped
[18:09:37] <Astrum|Lap> well let me go back to uni for my doctorate and I'll get right on it =D

[18:23:20] <fkaa> how do you accelerate a physics library with gpu stuff?
[18:26:01] <dfockler> well physics libraries are generally heavy with all the books and such, so you'll need a lot of gpus

[19:37:32] <Tiffany> does anyone have some references for building a database?
[19:42:11] <Astrum|Lap> like... schema design or making an actual database
[19:42:14] <Tiffany> actual database
[19:42:23] <Tiffany> I'm trying to build a capn-proto-based database
[19:42:51] <Tiffany> I guess I'll start with implementing B-trees
[19:42:56] <Sho> read the metakit source code and don't do what it does
[19:43:24] <Tiffany> my main reference is sqlite
[19:43:33] * Astrum|Lap looks up capn proto
[19:43:36] <dfockler> http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~maier/TheoryBook/TRD.html
[19:43:53] <Astrum|Lap> the page is jsut ridiculous, I'll give them that much
[19:43:58] <Tiffany> from what I've seen, the only complain anyone has against sqlite is that its sql implementation is very loosely typed
[19:44:02] <Astrum|Lap> cerealization protocol
[19:44:02] <Astrum|Lap> hehehe
[19:44:48] <Tiffany> astrum: are you aware of protobuf?
[19:45:04] <Astrum|Lap> yeah
[19:45:15] <Tiffany> the author of protobuf realized that protobuf was awful and build capn proto
[19:45:33] <Astrum|Lap> I mean I don't know much about protobuf, but I am aware of it
[19:45:34] <Tiffany> since protobuf does a heap allocation for every object, and has deserialization overhead
[19:45:44] <Tiffany> and serialization overhead
[19:46:05] <Tiffany> capn proto, on the other hand, has a native format which is very close to the native layout used by systems
[19:46:07] *** Quits: dfockler (dfockler@moz-etoj16.hfc.comcastbusiness.net) (Connection closed)
[19:46:13] <Tiffany> so it can be easily be read directly (through wrappers, of course)
[19:46:32] <Tiffany> like, reading data from capn proto records doesn't incur deserialization overhead because you can just pluck the values right out of the byte stream
[19:46:40] <Tiffany> everything is aligned
[19:46:44] <Tiffany> and in little endian
[19:47:17] <Tiffany> you can't go and build a database purely in capn proto though
[19:47:43] <Tiffany> since you can never free structs or lists you've allocated without rewriting the file
[19:47:57] <Tiffany> so what you want to do is represent each row as a capn proto message root
[19:48:28] <Astrum|Lap> hmm
[19:48:31] <Astrum|Lap> I'll have to look into this more
[19:48:44] <Tiffany> there's a rust implementation, which I'm using
[19:48:50] <Tiffany> the reference/primary implementation is in C++

[21:17:31] <dfockler> not sure, I've only been there recently, past few months

[21:44:50] <Tiffany> where do you live that bunnies appear so casually, astrum?
[21:45:27] <Astrum|Lap> Tiffany: rabbits and gophers are EVERYWHERE here
[21:45:35] <eddyb> > gophers
[21:45:37] <eddyb> teach them Rust
[21:45:40] <Tiffany> they're here too, but they don't tend to encroach
[21:45:42] *** bvssvni is now known as bvssvni_
[21:45:44] <Tiffany> gopher turtles though
[21:45:53] <Tiffany> they're an endangered species and it's easy to see why
[21:46:07] <Astrum|Lap> well at my apartment building there are two rabbits that hang out in front of my place all the time
[21:46:12] <Tiffany> they walk right into the death circle of dogs on leashes
[21:46:18] <Sho> Tiffany: Pandas
[21:46:20] <c74d> 2014-09-24 14:51:35 <Astrum|Lap> I'm pretty sure there's a war going on in the field behind my office <Astrum|Lap> between gophers and rabbits <Astrum|Lap> they appear to be amassing armies
[21:46:22] <Tiffany> totally oblivious
[21:46:26] <Sho> Kept alive only by humans finding them cute
[21:46:30] <WindowsBunny> I see rabbits outside my house on a regular basis
[21:46:32] <Astrum|Lap> c74d: yup
[21:47:01] <eddyb> Astrum|Lap: you could get rich by getting into showbiz
[21:47:01] <Astrum|Lap> every day going to work I see 5-10 scurry across the road
[21:47:10] <Astrum|Lap> and there are always a few dead ones
[21:47:14] <eddyb> even better!
[21:47:15] <Tiffany> they scurry across the road here too
[21:47:27] <eddyb> more drama, more money to be made
[21:47:39] <Astrum|Lap> I nearly hit a baby three times yesterday
[21:48:20] <Tiffany> it's actually illegal to construct a building within 50 feet of a gopher turtle den
[21:48:21] <Astrum|Lap> he'd keep going back and forth between the median and shoulder at the stop sign
[21:48:27] <Tiffany> you have to relocate the turtle before you can continue with construction
[21:48:31] <WindowsBunny> hmmm
[21:48:38] <WindowsBunny> I'm not sure which I see outside my house
[21:48:44] <Astrum|Lap> yeah, my father worked at a place not too far from here
[21:48:48] <WindowsBunny> the eastern cottontail or the new england cottontail

[21:49:11] <c74d> Sho: Hm… I tend to be fairly serious, especially in regard to community moderation, such that it's offputting for me that there have been jokes (particularly, though not at present, in-jokes) in the Rules sidebar for as long I remember. Reddit forum moderation tends to come off to me as simultaneously lax and harsh, as well as overly inclined to in-joking and in-grouping, even for
[21:49:12] <c74d> communities that I approve(d) of elsewhere (not talking about Rust specifically).
[21:49:13] <eddyb> Sho: lol
[21:49:13] <Tiffany> my own bunny is white
[21:49:14] <Astrum|Lap> when they built a new building they had to do weird stuff like pump lubricated water into the holes and collect all the ones that popped out
[21:49:17] <Astrum|Lap> and relocate
[21:49:18] <Astrum|Lap> or something

[21:50:14] <Tiffany> it's been a while since I've seen one
[21:50:18] <Tiffany> I guess they're mostly active at night
[21:50:51] <WindowsBunny> I see them sitting in my backyard eating the grass
[21:50:57] <Sho> eddyb: It's a running gag that when there's a new major Qt version, kio_gopher is one of the first things that get ported
[21:51:15] <Astrum|Lap> also, as far as reddit goes
[21:51:17] <Astrum|Lap> very tribalistic
[21:51:25] <Astrum|Lap> very strange
[21:51:33] <Astrum|Lap> I do love the accusations though
[21:52:10] <Tiffany> sho: it's probably quite easy to port it
[21:52:14] <Astrum|Lap> in the form of "this subreddit is evil because everyone there is X"
[21:52:36] <c74d> Tiffany: I personally filed “I'm a weirdo who likes any excuse to troll people with the subreddit css” in my noteslog with the comment “Reddit moderation. -.-”.
[21:52:43] <Astrum|Lap> I've yet to run across a proper study backing up such claims =(
[21:52:59] <Sho> Tiffany: It's ~350 sloc

[21:54:32] <eddyb> ~900 newlines in the RFC text
[21:54:54] <bstrie> c74d: what about the css?
[21:55:10] <Sho> eddyb: I just looked at the source code and thought "this is really bad, I should fi... wait, it's gopher"
[21:55:31] <eddyb> hahaha
[21:55:53] <bstrie> c74d: we use css to perma-sticky the code of conduct link up there so that assholes have ample opportunity to self-select themselves out of the forum before ever posting

[21:58:27] <Astrum|Lap> aboose!
[21:58:33] <bstrie> CABOOOOOOOSE
[21:58:46] <bstrie> et tu, WindowsBunny?
[21:58:49] <c74d> I like the current code-of-conduct; I don't have a problem with that, but rather the notion of moderators trolling people.
[21:58:53] * WindowsBunny burps
[21:59:22] <WindowsBunny> c74d: I prefer having people specifically for trolling distinct from the moderators
[21:59:35] <Astrum|Lap> I'm surprised reddit has gotten as big as it has, from my understanding the tools available to moderators aren't even that good
[21:59:54] <bstrie> Astrum|Lap: the tools are actually pretty fantastic
[22:00:04] <WindowsBunny> the tools for github moderation though....
[22:00:08] <c74d> WindowsBunny: I prefer reprimanding trolls and banning them if they keep at it.
[22:00:13] <bstrie> github doesn't have tools for moderation
[22:00:18] <Astrum|Lap> bstrie: what can you do?
[22:00:20] <Sho> Astrum|Lap: https://www.reddit.com/r/toolbox is insanely useful
[22:00:20] <WindowsBunny> bstrie: exactly :P
[22:00:21] <bstrie> it's a complete shambles
[22:00:34] <Sho> Astrum|Lap: I moderate a 35k subscriber sub and Toolbox makes it easy
[22:00:53] <bstrie> Astrum|Lap: for one, this is built in to reddit: https://www.reddit.com/wiki/automoderator

[22:02:24] <bstrie> I'll try this out then
[22:02:24] <c74d> What's the next level up from -.- ? maybe v.v ?
[22:02:57] <Astrum|Lap> I have no idea how you sort emoticons, c74d =P
[22:03:30] <c74d> Here, by strength of emotion.
[22:03:52] <Sho> bstrie: Toolbox is also fantastic for a multi-mod team, because it stores some state persistently in hidden wiki pages - e.g. Toolbox lets you set up removal reason templates (when you press "Remove" on a queue item, a dialog pops up allowing you to pick one and fill in any parameters) and they're automatically available to all mods using Toolbox that way
[22:04:02] <Sho> bstrie: It also generally just makes the mod queue interface better
[22:04:37] <bstrie> c74d: wrt moderators trolling people, I think you and I have a different notion of "trolling"
[22:04:43] <Astrum|Lap> oh well, doesn't really matter to me in either case
[22:04:57] <Astrum|Lap> I don't have the patience to moderate anyone anymore

[22:05:34] <bstrie> Sho: wanna be a moderator of /r/rust? :)
[22:06:35] <c74d> bstrie: I didn't accuse you of trolling anyone myself, I was only referring to your referring to yourself trolling people.
[22:07:09] <Sho> bstrie: Sure :) I'd say use /u/sho_kde, that's my recently active FOSS-y alt

[22:09:52] <Tiffany> I only have one reddit account
[22:10:04] <Astrum|Lap> I've been using the same name for years and years
[22:10:20] <Tiffany> does it show which subreddits you're subscribed to sho?
[22:10:26] <Astrum|Lap> though a few people also use it, so I can obfuscate myself behind them =P
[22:10:27] <bstrie> c74d: I use the term "trolling" loosely to refer to that time when terry pratchett died and so I made the entire sub into smallcaps for a day, or that time when I put unicode bees at the end of everyone's posts
[22:10:32] <Tiffany> oh
[22:10:58] <cmr> BEES?
[22:11:03] <Tiffany> yeah I don't know

[22:13:25] <WindowsBunny> If people googled me, they'd know everything about me
[22:13:38] <Sho> /r/rust is the second-largest one now, though

[22:22:22] <Astrum|Lap> all these new fangled ideas
[22:22:25] <Tiffany> but it's not friendship, it's merely a statement that this person is who they say they are
