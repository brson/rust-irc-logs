[14:48:20] <Lurkin> Hello all.  I had an idea where you would utilize a quad core and delegate seperate tasks to the core.
[14:48:45] <Lurkin> Some ARM chips have a trust center and the core itself is split into two parts, trusted and untrusted.
[14:51:38] <Lurkin> Is it possible to have your private key programmed into the trusted, and I mean either eeprom or burned(although burning is hard to verify from an end user standpoint), then use that key to sign an environment that is unique to you on the OS side?  Use one core to calculate a hash that you can share across clusters to verify that it is you who started the instance (Or at least that they were all started at the same time)
[14:52:46] <Elaine> Lurkin: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_Computing#Remote_attestation
[14:53:52] <Lurkin> So ideally one core is the trusted core that has the key and decides if it is allowed to sign more instances(cores), another core calculates the constant that the environement uses to interact with the data in any buffer.
[14:53:54] <Lurkin> Oh
[14:53:56] <Lurkin> This is not a new idea.
[14:53:58] <Lurkin> :(
[14:54:55] <Elaine> No.

[15:17:03] <eternaleye> Not necessarily; it's a tool like any other.
[15:17:46] <eternaleye> In particular, there's a specific construction that actually acts as a secure attestation of the entire instruction stream actually executed
[15:18:14] <eternaleye> Which might be very good for things like digital voting, if the server only admits votes from clients that verify
[15:18:28] <Elaine> eternaleye: do you refer to zero-knowledge compilation?

[15:37:40] <eternaleye> >> This paper describes Buffet, a built system that solves these problems by providing inexpensive “a la carte” RAM and  dynamic  control  flow.  Buffet  composes  an  elegant prior approach to RAM with a novel adaptation of tech- niques from the compilers literature. Buffet allows the pro- grammer to express programs in an expansive subset of C (disallowing only “goto” and function pointers), can han- dle essentially any example 
[15:37:41] <eternaleye> in the verifiable computation literature, and achieves the best performance in the area by multiple orders of magnitude.

[20:02:07] <Ilari> There isn't much difference if some combination of existing things exists itself or not.
