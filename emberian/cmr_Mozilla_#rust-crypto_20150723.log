[01:49:16] <Ilari> eternaleye: And sadly the transition period for PCI DSS only ends in mid-2016. Many E-Commerce sites breaking would likely push a lot of users.
[01:53:31] <Ilari> And then there are various embedded devices that only support TLS 1.0, and are not going to be replaced in years and years.
[02:02:48] <eternaleye> bascule: Though, I will note that on Unix, I view setuid as a fundamentally broken model anyway.
[02:03:08] <eternaleye> bascule: Privileges should monotonically decrease
[02:03:30] <eternaleye> bascule: If you want to do something with higher privileges (including process spawning), you ask a daemon to do it for you.
[02:11:10] <bascule> haha oh god
[02:11:37] <bascule> I have an awesome diagram of how setuid works
[02:11:42] <bascule> it's pretty shittacular
[02:12:05] <bascule> if you think you know how setuid works (on Linux) you probably don't
[02:15:32] <bascule> https://i.imgur.com/LrYsDkG.png
[02:15:35] <bascule> there it is, lol
[02:16:45] <Tiffany> what is this a state machine of?
[02:16:51] <Tiffany> I thought setuid was just a single syscall
[02:17:11] <Tiffany> oh god, are these the rules for valid transitions?
[02:17:19] <Tiffany> what are ruid, euid, and suid?
[02:17:22] <bascule> yes, but it describes how it differs depending on ruid, euid, and suid
[02:17:25] <bascule> haha, indeed
[02:17:43] <Ilari> bascule: Doesn't Linux have fsuid too?
[02:17:53] <bascule> don't forget gid and egid!
[02:18:07] <bascule> what even is going on
[02:18:26] <Ilari> And then for groups there's four values corresponding to the four uid values, plus supplementary groups.

[02:29:14] *** Quits: brson (brson@moz-qjbkeh.mtv2.mozilla.com) (Connection closed)
[02:32:20] <Ilari> And also Linux has a flag that disables all setuid/setgid execution for processes with it set. Inherits across forks, clones and execves and can't be cleared.
[02:36:00] <Ilari> Wonder how difficult would it be to make init set that flag and then provode daemon helpers to deal with all of the privileged operations...
[02:36:32] <Ilari> su and sudo could be "somewhat" problematical tho...
[02:46:08] <c74d> Ilari: dalias in #musl on freenode has talked about making a setuid-less Linux system
[02:46:35] <eternaleye> c74d: Isn't OpenWall setuid-less?

[03:16:41] <Ilari> Allegedly SHA-3 draft was signed.
[03:19:15] <mayski> so what's this algebraic eraser thing
[03:21:44] <Ilari> mayski: Some DH-like system based on dubious class of problems and with serious backdoor potential, but allegedly much faster than ECDH.
[03:22:18] <Ilari> The backdoor problem is even worse than even the infamous DUAL_EC_DRBG.
[03:22:33] <mayski> yeah I was just looking at the nist workshop slides, I was wondering why nobody talks about it
[03:22:42] <mayski> says 10 years in the public domain and hella fast
[03:24:09] <mayski> something like that was to be expected I suppose :)
[03:25:56] <Ilari> Basically, there is master private key associated with parameters that breaks everything. And there is no known method to generate parameters without generating the master key at some point.
[03:27:08] <Ilari> With DUAL_EC_DRBG, one could generate the two points pseudorandomly, which makes determining the backdoor key very hard.
[03:29:50] <mayski> well well well
[03:35:08] <Ilari> It would be even nastier than new ECC innovation allowing keyed backdooring of curves (NSA would _really_ love such thing).
[03:46:13] <Ilari> In increasing order of nastyness: 0) No known way to introduce master key. 1) Master key can be introduced, but one can perform NUMS parameter generation. 2) Master key needs to be generated for parameters. 3) Master key needed for instance key generation.
[03:47:03] <Ilari> ECDH is in case #0, DUAL_EC_DRBG is #1, Arithmetic Eraser is #2, and various "identity based encryption" schemes are #3.

[05:50:32] <mcpherrin> yeah, very true!
[05:53:26] <eternaleye> Hm, compiling a quick test library to an rlib, the only differences between the two are four timestamps. Wonder how hard it'd be to add an --avoid-nondeterminism flag to rustc, that as a first pass just prevents adding those.
[05:54:00] <eternaleye> Rust having a good deterministic-build story would be very nice indeed
[06:07:15] <mcpherrin> eternaleye: I have seen some build envs that make the gettimeofday() call return consistent values to get around this sort of thing
[06:08:06] <eternaleye> mcpherrin: Yeah, but that does annoying things in other ways
[06:08:20] <eternaleye> mcpherrin: Better for the build tools themselves to be able to elide the info

[18:16:37] <Tiffany> I don't think any of the companies using FoundationDB are liable to be burning through cash stockpiles to rewrite their core software?
[18:16:46] <Tiffany> it seems more likely they will just continue using the unsupported software

[18:17:32] <dcb> Tiffany: if they were smart and got rights to the source, but otherwise it's a huge liability
[18:17:45] <Tiffany> I guess source is a pretty important factor
[18:20:07] <Tiffany> wouldn't the companies using the database have support contracts that FDB can't just back out of?
[18:45:29] <Tiffany> is there anything that ACLs do which capabilities do not?
[18:45:57] <Tiffany> I'm currently looking at this nice chart showing how ACLs are infinitely terrible http://erights.org/talks/captp4omg/captp4omg/sld008.htm
[18:46:14] <bascule> hahahaha
[18:46:36] <Tiffany> I love how object capabilities just have "yes" across the board
[18:47:24] <Tiffany> I suppose that ambient authority might be convenient to program in when you don't care about error conditions, you don't need to pass around capabilities all the time
[18:48:04] <Tiffany> but maybe you can make capabilities that convenient too?
[18:48:13] <Tiffany> like have a global variable cap that just  grants everything
[18:48:39] <Tiffany> not that the convenience is worth the inevitable security issues when writing daemons
[18:50:02] <eternaleye> Tiffany: The idea that explicitly passing caps is "harder" is bogus, IMO
[18:50:32] <Tiffany> I wouldn't know, I haven't gotten to deal with capability systems
[18:50:56] <eternaleye> Tiffany: You call linker.compile(source, output, debugfile) - congrats, you just passed three caps in a message to a cap.
[18:51:11] <eternaleye> or whatever
[18:51:20] <Tiffany> yeah
[18:51:42] <eternaleye> Tiffany: In an object-capability system, "passing an object as an argument in a method" and "asserting a cap in a message to a service" are identical
[18:52:16] <eternaleye> Tiffany: It's far more about _how one designs APIs_ than about _how one uses them_
[18:52:39] <Tiffany> the case I had in mind was an application which reads a config file starting with open() and just dies if it can't
[18:53:10] <eternaleye> Tiffany: It should be passed its config info on STDIN, to use Unix'isms
[18:53:15] <Tiffany> but I suppose in a capability system, the program would either be compiled already owning the cap to its config file, or request access to it at runtime (at which point you can just ignore errors)
[18:53:22] <eternaleye> Tiffany: Then it never needs to call open() at all
[18:53:36] <Tiffany> what if you need stdin to handle data?
[18:53:39] <eternaleye> Tiffany: If its caller could read the config file, then the application can read the config file
[18:53:52] <Tiffany> oh
[18:53:58] <eternaleye> Tiffany: Then open it on FD 3 non-cloexec and pass an env var describing it :P
[18:54:06] <eternaleye> Tiffany: No, that comment was for the stdin thing
[18:54:21] <Tiffany> this is kind of departing from something you can integrate into existing systems
[18:54:25] <eternaleye> Tiffany: Basically, if the caller has an FD, posix_spawn allows you to make the child also have it
[18:54:37] <eternaleye> Tiffany: And then it's just about telling the child that it should _use_ it
[18:54:48] <eternaleye> Tiffany: Which can be done with env vars, commandline params, etc
[18:55:22] <Tiffany> it does line up very nicely with actor systems though
[18:55:37] <eternaleye> I'm actually looking at just how well I can restrict a program to be capable of only mmap(), munmap(), sendmsg(), recvmsg(), socketpair(), and shutdown()
[18:55:44] <eternaleye> With specific sets of parameters
[18:55:52] <eternaleye> Tiffany: Capability, you mean? Yeah.
[18:56:05] <eternaleye> Tiffany: Any shared-nothing architecture, in fact.
[18:56:41] <Tiffany> why did the original systems use ACLs instead of capabilities?
[18:56:51] <Tiffany> it's because permissions were tacked on afterwards, isn't it
[18:57:05] <eternaleye> Basically, my idea is that if you even just want to _malloc_, you ask a peer for a sealed(GROW|SHRINK) memfd and mmap it
[18:57:23] <bascule> Tiffany: heh, that's probably one reason
[18:57:45] <eternaleye> Also because capabilities hadn't been formulated when the original Unix came about
[18:58:00] <bascule> Tiffany: probably more familiar to real-world processes
[18:58:05] <Tiffany> yeah I was about to say
[18:58:20] <Tiffany> ACLs are probably more natural if your inspiration is things like corporate hierarchy
[18:58:27] <Tiffany> and so the developers map that to the permissions system..
[18:59:56] <Tiffany> and then we get stuck with it for 45 years, heh
[19:00:06] <Tiffany> for the past 45 years, still ongoing
[19:24:24] <Tiffany> so, that dyld vulnerability
[19:24:30] <Tiffany> why does dyld need to run as root in the first place?
[19:29:35] <bascule> it doesn't
[19:29:45] <bascule> but normally you're not allowed to do linker monkeybusiness with SUID binaries

[19:34:45] <Tiffany> does CapTP specify a wire format?
[19:35:15] <Tiffany> oh
[19:35:28] <Tiffany> apparently it used to use Java serialization, and now it's switching to some XML stuff
[19:37:12] <Tiffany> this website is not terribly helpful
[19:41:35] <Ilari> Classified 322 TLS ciphersuites (includes proposed Chacha ciphersuites): 3 not valid, 289 obsolete, 12 vanity, 9 IoT and 9 main.
[19:43:37] <Tiffany> I don't get why the documentation for CapTP goes on and on about capabilities when it's supposed to be a transport protocol for capabilities as expressed in the E language
[19:43:45] <Tiffany> shouldn't E document the capabilities, and CapTP the wire format?

[19:45:23] <Tiffany> there's something or other about Capn Proto RPC, but it doesn't appear to be implemented
[19:54:24] <Ilari> Okay, after adding some proposed ones: notvalid: 3, obsolete: 291, vanity: 12, iot: 14, main: 9 (total: 329).
[19:54:57] <Tiffany> what do the notvalid, vanity, and iot categories entail?
[19:56:46] <Ilari> notvalid is the ciphersuites that don't actually correspond to valid set of cryptographic algorithms. Vanity is ciphersuites that don't fall in obsolete but contain at least one "vanity" algorithm. Iot is ciphersuites that don't fall into obsoete and have clear iot focus.
[19:57:45] <Ilari> The 3 notvalid algorithms are the special 0000 ciphersuite id, Empty renego signal and fallback signal.
[19:59:54] <Tiffany> would vanity be stuff like camellia?
[20:00:26] <Tiffany> not sure what would fall under iot
[20:00:37] <Ilari> Tiffany: Yeah, Camellia and ARIA. There's also SEED, but all ciphersuites for it fall under obsolete.
[20:01:16] <Tiffany> do you consider non-ECDH as obsolete, then?
[20:01:17] <Ilari> Tiffany: AES-CCM or PFS PSK.
[20:01:22] <Tiffany> or SHA-1?
[20:02:45] <Ilari> Tiffany: Everything that doesn't have kex of either ECDHE or pure-PSK, everything that isn't AEAD.
[20:03:05] <Tiffany> oh
[20:04:23] <Ilari> Those 9 main suites include {ECDHE_RSA,ECDHE_ECDSA,PSK}x{AES-128-GCM,AES-256-GCM,Chacha20-Poly1305}.
[20:05:36] <Ilari> The IoT set is not closed, 2 of the ciphersuites would have corresponding pure-PSK cipher (which is needed for resumption in TLS 1.3) in main.
[20:07:21] <Tiffany> oh huh, there's a capnp RPC implementation for rust
[20:13:18] <Tiffany> the RPC protocol is so complicated
[20:13:22] <Tiffany> does it need to be this complicated?

[21:22:08] <bascule> Tiffany: it has fancy features like promise pipelining
[21:22:19] <bascule> Tiffany: and yes the Rust implementation is by David Renshaw who works at Sandstorm
[21:22:44] <bascule> he's replumbing it on top of mio so it works more like kj now that libgreen is gone
[21:22:50] <Tiffany> the calculator example is really ugly, which puts me off
[21:22:58] <bascule> haha
[21:23:46] <Tiffany> is the reason libgreen died that you have to commit wholeheartedly to do it right, and rust just couldn't do that?
[21:24:10] <Tiffany> iirc it was not significantly faster than native threads
[21:24:26] <bascule> well, there was that
[21:24:32] <bascule> it also adds a lot of complexity
[21:24:44] <bascule> any time you can possibly do a blocking system call the scheduler needs to be aware of it
[21:24:59] <bascule> also they weren't pre-emptive, so one could be greedy and steal an entire scheduler
[21:25:20] <Tiffany> yeah I remember that
[21:25:34] <bascule> I think Rust is tending towards thin, zero-cost abstractions, which libnative vs libgreen was not, heh

[21:35:28] <Tiffany> this whole argument is absurd to me
[21:36:12] <Tiffany> I agree with this: "Are the functions in tweetnacl.c PKIX code or TLS code? The correct answer is neither: they are functions on 32 byte strings. I don't see how PKIX benefits from changing the definition of these functions to work on 32 byte strings in the opposite direction."

[21:36:44] <bascule> re: little endian

[21:39:12] <Tiffany> the main instigators seem to be Dan Harkins and Phillip Hallam-Baker, the latter of which calling the age card to back up his arguments
[21:42:24] <Tiffany> at least, in this thread
[21:42:44] <Tiffany> I don't really know how CFRG politics work though
[21:46:06] <bascule> oh, Dan Brown loves big endian

[21:47:47] <bascule> BIG ENDIAN WEIERSTRASS PLEASE!
[21:48:15] <bascule> also ECDSA, it's great
[22:42:30] <Ilari> Also, attacks involving choosing a curve? Really? Those would break things rather bad, and are the reason why curve is coupled with key.
[22:44:42] <Ilari> Even just signing with two isogenous curves has nasty consequences.
[22:57:01] <Ilari> ECDSA-compatible? Trying to be "compatible" with ECDSA with curves like Curve25519 or Curve448 leads to rather nasty surprises.
