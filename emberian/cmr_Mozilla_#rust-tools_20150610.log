[19:03:49] <brson> acrichto: sure, though i've been leaving mac3 off because i thought it was behaving weirdly. maybe it just needs to have buildslave restarted after a reboot though
[19:04:01] <acrichto> ah ok
[19:04:30] <brson> trying to get it started up though

[20:06:48] <brson> should we always fall back to clang if gcc doesn't exist? https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/26185#issuecomment-110893802
[20:08:07] *** Tuba is now known as Tobba
[20:08:07] * acrichto reads the pr
[20:10:26] <acrichto> brson: hm so tbh I have no idea what's going on here
[20:10:37] <acrichto> we have things like CFG_GCC but then later just use "gcc"
[20:10:48] <acrichto> and other times use $CFG_GCC
[20:10:57] <acrichto> and then we have crazy stuff with gcc/clang on osx
[20:11:25] <acrichto> brson: in general though I don't see why not, if we didn't find gcc and don't otherwise have a c compiler we may as well look for clang
[20:13:50] <brson> acrichto: i only see unconditional use of gcc in arm/linux. I can't tell where CC_$(1) gets set though...
[20:14:07] <brson> oh well whatever, i'm sure it all works somehow
[20:14:24] <acrichto> brson: I was looking here I guess: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/configure#L966
[20:14:40] <acrichto> when we probed for CFG_GCC earlier
[20:14:45] <acrichto> (which may have failed?!)
[20:15:08] <brson> yeah, probe can fail
[20:15:14] <brson> probe_need can't fail
[20:15:25] <brson> CC_$(1) is set per platform in mk/cfg/*
[20:15:41] <acrichto> wait then what in the world is configure doing
[20:15:50] <brson> and those mostly set it to $(CC)
[20:15:55] <acrichto> hm
[20:15:58] <brson> so surely we override that
[20:16:02] <acrichto> the way we set cross compilers never sat well with me
[20:16:03] <brson> surely?!
[20:16:38] <brson> even on apple we set CC_$(1) to $(CC)
[20:16:43] <brson> and we def don't use gcc there
[20:18:01] <acrichto> I don't even remember why we bother so much with this
[20:18:08] <acrichto> seems like we should use clang if it's there, and if not use gcc
[20:18:18] <acrichto> and not ahve all this weird detection one way or the other
[20:18:27] <acrichto> why agin do we care if gcc is actually clang?
[20:21:18] <brson> the compiler detection has gotten more complicated since last i looked at it
[20:21:29] <brson> there is *so much code* in configure dedicated to flipping the selected compiler
[20:21:41] <brson> if $random 
[20:21:43] <brson> der
[20:22:45] <brson> ok, I don't think we do anything with the C compiler detection but change which one builds llvm
[20:22:56] <acrichto> yeah :\
[20:22:57] <brson> i cannot find the code that connects the detection to invocation elsewhere
[20:23:01] <brson> so messed up
