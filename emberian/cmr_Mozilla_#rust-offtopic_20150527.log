[10:47:38] <Layl> but then why provide a list of all of this publicly VShell 
[10:47:43] <Layl> surely you would hide such a list
[10:50:00] <Layl> time for a fermi estimation of the size
[10:50:56] <VShell> Layl: not really? it's not something bad in and of itself. and by making it public you can make it look like a "legitimate" resource rather than something specifically for the malware. maybe.
[10:52:12] <Layl> surely you would make an attempt then to make it in some way look logical though
[10:52:53] <Layl> .com alone is in my rough flawed estimate, about 300Mb
[10:53:40] <Layl> I feel hurt, they don't have a list of the .nl domains
[10:53:44] <Layl> but they do of a lot of other country codes

[21:13:06] <Astrum|Lap> Sho: it is pretty weird tbh
[21:13:28] <Sho> i actually kind of like localization engineering
[21:13:37] <Sho> there's some fun problems there
[21:13:40] <Tiffany> well you don't have to use github, unless you listen to people whine that you should put your project on github
[21:13:52] <Astrum|Lap> problems that exist because humans are silly, silly animals
[21:13:56] <Tiffany> I certainly don't use github for all my projects
[21:14:01] <Tiffany> and when I do, I only use it for git hosting
[21:14:06] <Tiffany> not for issues or anything
[21:14:30] <Astrum|Lap> Tiffany: well GH has sort of become a social coding platform
[21:14:31] <Sho> for example: plenty of software has search fields that will only start the search when typing in a pattern longer than three-ish characters
[21:14:34] <Astrum|Lap> which is weird as hell to think about
[21:14:57] <Sho> but "three characters" is a very poor metric for "holds useful information" across different writing systems
[21:14:58] <Tiffany> also yeah, localisation is important
[21:15:15] <eddyb> Sho: kate's autocompletion also has a minimum number of characters that you can configure
[21:15:23] <eddyb> sometimes I want it to kick in after 1 character
[21:15:32] <eddyb> other times I wish it would have waited for 6
[21:15:35] <Astrum|Lap> important, yes, still it's a problem that doesn't need to exist if we all use one language =P
[21:15:44] <eddyb> so the problem is not restricted to writing systems
[21:15:58] *** Joins: whipsch (whipsch@moz-bl4i0b.from.irc.camp)
[21:16:08] <Sho> eddyb: Kate also asks plugins after every input whether they want to auto-invoke completion, I still have to make the Rust plugin's idea of when that's useful much tighter
[21:16:13] <Astrum|Lap> I'm jury rigging a system right now
[21:16:14] <Havvy> Astrum|Lap:  Okay, that language will be JavaScript.
[21:16:19] <leftylink> I wouldn't know about it firsthand since I never used sourceforge, but I think I read that lock-in was kind of a problem, whereas I guess in general that is much less of a problem when using distributed version control
[21:16:38] <Astrum|Lap> just so I can fax things
[21:16:38] <Sho> eddyb: but kate also lets you override by manually invoking, while search fields often don't
[21:16:40] <Astrum|Lap> ick
[21:16:49] <Sho> eddyb: so e.g. you get email clients where korean people can't search for a last name
[21:16:51] <Astrum|Lap> Havvy: one natural language
[21:16:57] <eddyb> Sho: LOL
[21:17:11] <Sho> eddyb: this is almost every western email client at some point
[21:17:17] <Sho> it's fun
[21:17:35] <eddyb> also, heard someone praising Swift for UTF-16

[21:18:18] <Astrum|Lap> I'll definitely use swift
[21:18:23] <eddyb> Sho: no no, if Qt wasn't misdesigned and used UTF-8 like everything should
[21:18:29] <Astrum|Lap> and I'll definitely make a program to convert all of my source code into emoticons
[21:18:32] <Havvy> So Swift is the same character encoding as JavaScript...

[21:19:05] <Sho> Tiffany: yep
[21:19:09] <Tiffany> it's kind of hard to blame them
[21:19:16] <eddyb> blame windows
[21:19:19] <eddyb> blame everyone
[21:19:27] <Tiffany> UCS is very tempting, since it's all fixed width
[21:19:28] <eddyb> Plan9 is sacred
[21:19:34] <Tiffany> but UCS-4 is too costly to bother most of the time
[21:19:35] <eddyb> Tiffany: nothing is fixed width
[21:19:48] <Havvy> How much stuff would break if Windows used UTF-8 as its default encoding?
[21:19:50] <eddyb> everything is broken width
[21:19:50] <Sho> this might be a good time to tell my favorite unicode anecdote
[21:19:58] <Sho> our IRC client basically got a bug report by xkcd strip once
[21:20:04] <eddyb> Konversation?
[21:20:18] <Sho> there's this xkcd strip on u+fdd0, eye of basilisk: https://xkcd.com/380/
[21:20:40] <eddyb> I need to check if the ridiculous bugs I found are still in it
[21:20:51] <Sho> u+fdd0 is in a char range marked as 'not for interchange' and thus not valid utf-8, but qstring's utf8 stream encoder had a bug and let it through
[21:21:08] <Sho> the client would send text payloads over d-bus to hand to a notification frontend
[21:21:18] <Sho> d-bus didn't like the utf-8 and would close the connection, crashing the client
[21:21:28] <eddyb> oh dear
[21:21:32] <Sho> also, qtextdocument internally uses u+fdd0 and u+fdd1 as text frame delimiters
[21:21:38] <Astrum|Lap> so what you're saying is, humans screw everything up, we get rid of them and computers will work perfectly =P
[21:21:46] <bluss> everyone accepts their own restriction of utf-8, fun
[21:21:46] <Sho> so counters would run haywire and it'd eventually crash there, too

[21:40:12] <eddyb> > The reference to colorful fabric may also be indicative of the popular and mistaken view that all ancient statues (particularly ancient Roman and Greek sculpture) were white. Instead, many of the statues were painted (sometimes rather gaudily due to the low availability of various dyes) and the paint has merely worn off, leading to the present belief that ancient Athens was a city of shining white marble porticoes, colonnades and statues.

[21:52:17] <Astrum|Lap> nothing can go wrong

[21:52:57] <Sho> the self-hosting options are getting better, though
[21:52:59] <Astrum|Lap> it is kind of weird that the web has sort of... consolidated
[21:53:04] <Sho> phabricator is starting to get a lot of big community wins
[21:53:08] <dfockler> although distribution is the real issue
[21:53:31] <Sho> Astrum|Lap: i'm sometimes surprised when i notice the *opposite*
[21:53:48] <Astrum|Lap> you'll have to give me an example
[21:53:53] <Sho> Astrum|Lap: e.g. there are some countries that do quite a bit of web but where google has <10% market share in the product categories it's good at
[21:54:03] <Astrum|Lap> ah
[21:54:29] <Sho> when mentally, i just go "it's the same everywhere now"
[21:54:35] <Sho> but it's not quite
[21:54:53] <Astrum|Lap> granted my views are obviously colored by bias
[21:54:58] <dfockler> china uses different stuff, and they are slowly getting onto github
[21:55:27] <Sho> Korea is ruled by Daum and Naver
[21:55:42] <Astrum|Lap> like reddit is sort of a community of communities
[21:56:09] <Astrum|Lap> millions consolidated under one company
[21:57:25] <dfockler> same with facebook
[21:57:31] <Sho> At the risk of dating myself (and I only really caught the tail end of it, too, tbh), reddit is sort of usenet 2.0 for me, and I'm kinda glad it's back
[21:57:36] <dfockler> that's the goal of those companies
[21:57:54] <Astrum|Lap> I never used usenet, so... I have no idea! hehe
[21:58:14] <dfockler> usenet without all the filesharing
[21:58:29] <Sho> Astrum|Lap: it was really very similar in feel
[21:58:44] <Sho> and mode of use
[21:58:50] <Astrum|Lap> but was there one central power that could basically shut it off?
[21:59:13] <Sho> no, you connected to your server, which mirrored use groups from other servers
[21:59:16] <Sho> so it was federated
[21:59:24] <Sho> *news groups
[21:59:43] <dfockler> something like diaspora had that feel but they couldn't get 'facebook' people to adopt it
[22:00:37] <Sho> I never really god big into Facebook and the pressure to use it seems to be almost gone now

[22:01:25] <Tiffany> federated networks are a dying breed, it seems
