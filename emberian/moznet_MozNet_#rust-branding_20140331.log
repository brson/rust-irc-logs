[05:41:02] <bjz_> I like the install button
[05:41:32] <bjz_> but it's weird how the install button and the 'other downloads' bit is separate
[05:41:57] <bjz_> let me do a mockup of another idea
[05:43:35] <bjz_> I also think the main paragraph reads a like molasses. could you make it more to the point?
[05:47:33] <bjz_> have you thought of just having a single 'download' button in place of the two install/other downloads buttons, then set the link to go to the more downloads page? Then on that page have the reccomended download automatically pop up in big at the top, with a clear copy/pastable command that you can use with your package manager
[05:48:03] <bjz_> brew/apt-get/nuget etc
[05:49:21] <bjz_> can you use the svg for the rust logo? looks terrible on highdpi displays :(
[05:50:38] <brson> the installation scheme is based on nodejs.org
[05:51:29] <bjz_> I would try to steer away from subjective adjectives in the feature list thing. like "robust concurrency" might be better off being "safe concurrency" or something
[05:52:33] <bjz_> "powerful FFI" doesn't really mean anything to me
[05:52:44] <bjz_> "minimal runtime" is fine
[05:53:18] <bjz_> "type inference" might be better off as "local type inference"
[05:54:25] <bjz_> It will probably look better with a code example
[05:56:17] <bjz_> brson: another idea for a simple site: http://elm-lang.org/
[05:56:42] <bjz_> I'm wondering if the 'community' bit could go on a separate page
[05:57:32] <bjz_> we have a really rich community - especially on IRC - would be a shame only to display one of them
[05:58:01] <bjz_> showing we have dedicated #rust-gamedev and #rust-osdev rooms is a bonus
[05:58:24] <bjz_> could pique interest from those communities
[05:59:13] <bjz_> I'm also wondering if the logo needs to be re-thought :/ it's super hard to work with
[05:59:35] <bjz_> as in, positioning it with the 'Rust' name
[06:00:07] <bjz_> I have a few ideas
[06:02:15] <brson> we are primarily trying to make room for the new installers, not doing a redesign
[06:02:20] <bjz_> ahh ok
[06:02:23] <brson> it has to get done now
[06:02:28] <bjz_> sorry
[06:02:34] <bjz_> it is looking better though
[06:03:53] <brson> i'll try using two bullet lists
[06:04:17] <brson> i wanted to imply that we have a diverse concurrency story
[06:04:33] <brson> what is a better way to say that rust has a good ffi?
[06:05:03] <brson> 'safe concurrency' is the same as 'no data races' i think
[06:05:07] <brson> and 'no data races' is clearer
[06:06:05] <brson> 'built for concurrency'
[06:06:10] <brson> 'designed for'
[06:06:21] <brson> 'concurrent to the bone'
[06:11:51] <bjz_> brson: I was thinking of something like: http://imgur.com/YpSfV4S
[06:12:23] <bjz_> "message passing concurrency" "data race free"
[06:12:43] <bjz_> oh well I guess we have more than message passing
[06:13:12] <bjz_> "safe concurrency primitives"
[06:13:17] <bjz_> maybe
[06:13:28] <bjz_> but that implies they are compiler magic :/
[06:14:34] <bjz_> in that image "More downloads" could be "Other versions" - maybe
[06:15:40] <brson> bjz_: here's a bullet list http://brson.github.io/rust-www/
[06:15:59] <bjz_> I think that is nicer
[06:16:25] <bjz_> would it make more accurate to say "closures" as opposed to "lambdas"?
[06:17:37] <brson> yeah closures is better
[06:17:49] <bjz_> with http://brson.github.io/rust-www/install.html it would be kind of cool if the nightly version could have a higher contrast than the point release section
[06:18:40] <bjz_> either make the text on the point release stuff greyer, or maybe put the nightly version on a light grey background
[06:19:10] <brson> now with three columns http://brson.github.io/rust-www/
[06:20:02] <brson> i think i prefer 2
[06:20:24] <bjz_> with the grid of various download versions it's hard to associate the 'Linux binaries (.tar.gz)' with the buttons

[06:20:48] <bjz_> a more table-like thing might be nicer
[06:20:59] <bjz_> as in, make the rows more prominent
[06:22:27] <bjz_> "The latest release. These are made roughly every three months and tend to become out of date quickly. "  remove "tend to"
[06:24:54] <bjz_> "The current dev branch. This is the most up to date version with the latest bug fixes and features." - combined with some use of colour to increase the focus on those downloads, the implication that this is the recommended version would be clear
[06:34:13] <brson> ok pushed the latest changes
[06:34:16] <brson> thanks for the constructive feedback
[06:34:26] <brson> i need to take a break and maybe call it a night
[06:35:19] <cmr> brson: the update looks nice
[06:35:23] <cmr> a good improvement
[06:36:52] <brson> cmr: thanks
[06:38:33] <bjz_> np!
[06:38:37] <bjz_> hope it helped
[06:39:17] <bjz_> brson: might be a little sigilly for the front page, but maybe something like: https://gist.github.com/bjz/9886521 ?
[06:39:31] <cmr> yuck
[06:39:32] <bjz_> brson: forked from aatch's example
[06:39:38] <cmr> that's long, and has &~"foo"
[06:39:44] <bjz_> yeah
[06:39:54] <cmr> I revulse every time I see &~
[06:39:58] <bjz_> indeed
[06:40:10] <bjz_> I was more thinking of the 'gist' of it :P
[06:40:18] <bjz_> something that uses lifetimes
[06:40:27] <bjz_> and ADTs
[06:40:53] <bjz_> and shows off println! maybe
[06:41:15] <bjz_> not saying that is the greatest thing, it *is* pretty ugly
[06:41:43] <bjz_> aatch originally used find_quiv, but that method seems to have gone :/
[06:42:00] <bjz_> (which meant we needed the &~
[06:42:02] <bjz_> )
[06:42:19] <bjz_> cmr: do you sort of see what I'm saying?
[06:42:45] <bjz_> not necessarily that thing, but something that shows off similar ideas
[06:42:49] <cmr> perhaps
[06:43:01] <bjz_> maybe
[06:43:04] <bjz_> :P
[06:43:09] <cmr> find_equiv was from HashMap
[06:43:14] <cmr> json uses TreeMap now
[06:43:18] <bjz_> ah
[06:43:28] <cmr> find_equiv ought to be removed for methods on the map traits that take closures
[06:43:31] <cmr> instead of using the Equiv trait
