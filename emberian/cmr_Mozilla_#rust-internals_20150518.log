[00:00:02] <blaenk> my guess would be, if running via cargo test, then enable the test and collections feature
[00:00:04] <cmr> or any other time --cfg test is passed.
[00:00:06] <ChrisMorgan> feature(test) is needed by the test crate.
[00:00:48] <blaenk> what for? I haven't had to do that when I do cargo test
[00:01:05] <cmr> for `extern crate test`
[00:01:10] <Rym> blaenk: benchmarks mainly
[00:01:12] <ChrisMorgan> Which is needed for #[bench]
[00:01:15] <blaenk> ohh okay
[00:01:24] <blaenk> what confused me was that
[00:01:28] <blaenk> this code has this line first
[00:01:28] <blaenk> #![feature(core, tcp, collections)]
[00:01:31] <ChrisMorgan> test::black_box and test::Bencher are the two things that matter there.
[00:01:32] <blaenk> and then it has the line I asked about earlier
[00:01:48] <blaenk> so it seems to me that collections is already enabled no matter what, so it's pointless to have included it in the cfg_attr line?
[00:01:56] <ChrisMorgan> Quite.
[00:02:00] <blaenk> ok thanks :D

[00:09:24] <Manishearth> it's a form of exception handling that should e used in exceptional cases only

[01:18:33] <bstrie> so hey, proposal
[01:18:59] <bstrie> I kind of hate that it's really roundabout to give working examples with `try!` because you can't do it in main
[01:19:08] <bstrie> would it be better for pedagogy if this were the case
[01:19:27] <bstrie> I imagine we'd have to take it from a macro to a syntax extension, where it would just panic if you return from a try in main
[01:19:42] <XMPPwocky> main returning, like, Result<(), libc::c_int> would be sorta interesting as well
[01:20:35] <bstrie> possibly, though I don't know if that's particularly useful
[01:20:51] <bstrie> it actually used to be the case that we supported alternate signatures for main, so it wouldn't be a new concept
[01:21:03] <bstrie> you use to be able to optionally pass in `args` to main
[01:21:05] <XMPPwocky> huh, neat

[01:55:03] <bstrie> reem: the goal is to demonstrate idiomatic usage though, and ideally we could come up with semantics for try in main that were useful enough to encourage in all code
[01:55:15] <bstrie> if we just made try unwrap in main, it literally wouldn't be a regression from today
[01:55:37] <cmr> How do you propose "just making" that happen?
[01:55:39] <reem> bstrie: true, but I would be personally expect try! to not panic, especially if no actual error conversion is occurring
[01:55:41] <bstrie> though there is a risk of obscuring what try *actually* does
[01:55:51] <bstrie> cmr: syntax extension magic
[01:55:54] <cmr> Oh, with a syntax extension.
[01:56:00] <cmr> That's not how that actually works you know.
[01:56:04] <bstrie> yes, it would need to no longer be a macro
[01:57:29] <aatch> I'd rather not add features and/or complexity simply to make writing examples easier.
[01:57:38] <bstrie> alternatively, XMPPwocky's idea of making main return a result where err is your usual C-style error return int, and obviously with sugar to let you elide the return type
[01:58:15] <cmr> It's not so obvious to me.
[01:58:23] <bstrie> I don't see the harm in it
[01:58:30] <cmr> This is a lot of complexity for the rarest actual use of Rust.

[02:00:13] <cmr> I know there is, but the solution is to change how try! is introduced, not how try! works.

[04:56:36] <Manishearth> I also want usability; so even if it's slow, someone who doesn't care about speed for a subset of their program should be able to use it

[05:02:35] <Manishearth> I think stack scanning doesn't need lang support. But I'm not clear on how stack scanning works in depth 
[05:02:57] <Manishearth> I guess boehm just treats every word as a ptr and checks if it has it?
[05:04:49] <huon> that's the bread-and-butter of a conservative GC like Boehm, yeah
[05:05:20] <huon> i.e. assume things that could be a pointer to GC memory are in fact one
[05:06:28] <huon> (fwiw, by default boehm scans all memory allocations in that way too, not just the stack)

[05:10:24] <huon> (at least if they aren't GC memory regions they won't be registered with the GC)
[05:10:35] <Manishearth> huon: We'd need to allocate a GC arena then, right?
[05:10:46] <Manishearth> Because the malloc() heap is ... the entire heap?
[05:11:01] <Manishearth> and then hashtable the pointers or something
[05:11:04] <aatch> huon, sure, but presumably a check for "is this a pointer I care about" is much more expensive than "is this a number greater than <some threshold>".
[05:11:34] <Manishearth> huon: I think in C++ we have the problem that pointers generally masquerade as other things
[05:11:38] <Manishearth> eg voidptrs
[05:11:58] <Manishearth> since the Rust style doesn't have the problem, we *might* be able to avoid it

[05:12:40] <Manishearth> that would be nice though

[05:13:06] <huon> Manishearth: I don't know what you mean by "allocate a GC arena"
[05:13:26] <Manishearth> huon: don't use malloc() for allocating memory for GC'd stuff.
[05:13:28] <huon> at least, I'm not sure why "then": GC's always have to request memory from the operating system

[05:14:06] <huon> I didn't say that

[05:14:08] <Manishearth> oh
[05:14:13] <huon> I said the latter
[05:14:23] <Manishearth> yeah that's what I mean
[05:14:39] <Manishearth> by size I meant that, misuse of terminology
[05:14:41] <huon> a conservative GC needs to know the regions of memory it controls, so it can check when pointers fall into it
[05:14:53] <Manishearth> huon: so does it just allocate tot he malloc() heap?
[05:15:01] <Manishearth> or does it choose a subset (which can be grown)
[05:15:12] <huon> using `malloc` is a valid strategy
[05:15:23] <Manishearth> yeah, it is, but it's inefficient
[05:15:26] <huon> not necessarily
[05:15:33] <Manishearth> all your regular heap pointers are going to trip this
[05:15:39] <huon> err, no
[05:15:49] <huon> you know the bounds of the memory you request from `malloc`
[05:15:57] <Manishearth> as in?
[05:16:16] <huon> when you malloc memory you get a pointer and you know it's value
[05:16:26] <huon> malloc isn't going to return pointers into that block of memory in future
[05:16:31] <huon> (unless you free it, of course)
[05:16:32] <Manishearth> agreed
[05:16:53] *** Joins: swgillespie (swgillespie@moz-rn1.vmq.232.104.IP)
[05:17:08] <huon> so suppose the GCs knows that it's managing addresses from, say, 100 to 120
[05:17:22] <Manishearth> won't it eventually span the entire memory then?
[05:17:23] <huon> maybe more mallocs return pointers with address 99 and 121
[05:17:34] <Manishearth> so it will just stretch the bounds
[05:17:37] <huon> but the GC knows that these don't lie in the bounds
[05:17:52] <huon> the only way it can span the entire memory is if it keeps requesting more memory from the operating system
[05:18:07] <Manishearth> oh so it reuses the memory?
[05:18:10] <huon> e.g. keeps `malloc`ing more and more memory
[05:18:16] <huon> not necessarily
[05:18:35] <huon> if it doesn't reuse memory it just needs to register that it is no longer tracking a given region
[05:18:42] <Manishearth> Even if you have balanced free()s and mallocs() eventually your pointers will span the malloc heap
[05:18:45] <Manishearth> ah okay
[05:19:11] <Manishearth> A bloom filter sounds better here but that's probably going to be slower too
[05:19:11] <huon> reusing memory will be more efficient, but there's no reason that GC_malloc and GC_free can't manage register/unregistering regions properly
[05:19:24] <Manishearth> okay
[05:20:18] <Manishearth> My thoughts were to allocate a block of memory for the GC, and within that block act as a mini allocator
[05:20:30] <Manishearth> if we need more space, allocate more blocks
[05:20:41] <aatch> Manishearth, that's fine, but it's not required.
[05:20:45] <huon> yes, that's basically the approach of most GCs
[05:20:49] <Manishearth> We could also have multiple regions to segregate types of various sizes
[05:20:57] <Manishearth> for packing to work well
[05:21:08] <huon> yep, a sensible technique
[05:21:11] <huon> (e.g. jemalloc does that)
[05:21:14] <aatch> Manishearth, so like an allocator.
[05:21:17] <Manishearth> yes
[05:21:24] <Manishearth> an allocator within an allocator
[05:21:42] <huon> for a conservative GC you still need to keep track of extends of the larger blocks
[05:21:46] <Manishearth> and then maintain a bloomfilterish thing or some other set with the list of gc ptrs. But the broad ranges will act as a faster filter

[05:44:59] <Manishearth> though in the threadsafe version rooting-tracing should follow a r-w lock pattern
[05:45:09] <Manishearth> if a trace is going on you can't root
[05:45:10] <Manishearth> hmm
[05:45:21] <huon> e.g. you'll need to be careful that you can't have pointers invalidated, e.g., while tracing
[05:45:22] <Manishearth> I wonder how Go does it
[05:45:29] <huon> often this is done by stopping the world
[05:45:33] <Manishearth> Go even GCs objects that you've send in unreceivable senders
[05:45:44] <huon> which is less than nice in Rust
[05:45:53] <Manishearth> huon: So I was wondering if we could just stop all GC ops, not the world
[05:45:59] <huon> of course it does, that's how GC works: collects unreachable memory :P
[05:46:20] <Manishearth> huon: like I said, we have root/unroot. Let's allow those in parallel. But only one trace at a time
[05:46:34] <Manishearth> stick a global rwlock and have root/unroot/trace hit it
[05:46:35] <Manishearth> done
[05:46:41] <Manishearth> hah true
[05:46:52] <Manishearth> the Go one is pretty robust though, you don't worry about anything
[05:47:05] <huon> most managed languages have pretty robust GCs
[05:47:06] <Manishearth> unlike Java where you still need to invoke the synchronized and volatile gods
[05:47:22] <Manishearth> true
[05:47:31] <Manishearth> but it's threadsafe! :P
[05:47:44] <Manishearth> okay you still should use locks
[05:47:51] <Manishearth> and go locks are horrible
[05:48:05] *** Joins: Tobba (Tobba@moz-o13d22.bredband.telia.com)
[05:48:13] <Manishearth> go works well with raii (the defer keyword is nice here), but somehow their mutexes are just a lock
[05:48:45] <Manishearth> then again, without generics it would have to be Mutex<Any> instead of Mutex<T> and that's no fun either
[05:48:57] <huon> I don't really think a Rust/C++ style lock-guard makes that much sense with pervasive sharing
[05:49:08] <huon> also, without "real" destructors
[05:49:37] <Manishearth> I guess
[05:49:41] <huon> I guess it'd help, but wouldn't provide any guarantees
[05:49:44] <Manishearth> I hated using those at any rate
[05:49:57] <Manishearth> Oh right it's easy to forget defer
[05:50:06] <Manishearth> defer mutex.close()
[05:50:11] <Manishearth> if you forget that, deadlock
[05:50:18] <Manishearth> though Go has beautiful deadlock reporting
[05:51:06] <huon> if you are interested in GC/concurrent GC, I encourage you to read up on it, there's lots of interesting stuff out there
[05:51:14] <Manishearth> I will, thanks

[09:56:46] <bluss> we know rust isn't bug free
[09:58:32] <Manishearth> I've always been uncomfortable ablt drop beeing &mut self

[09:59:01] <Manishearth> I bet there's at least one api in the stdlib on which calling drop() twice would make things go boom
[09:59:27] <bluss> absolutely, double free is a bad bug
[09:59:59] <bluss> not sure why we never managed to transition to passing self to drop
[10:00:06] <Manishearth> uh, Rc is a problem here
[10:00:21] <Manishearth> bluss: because then you can do wacky things in Drop
[10:00:23] <Manishearth> the ideal fix
[10:00:24] <Manishearth> is
[10:00:34] <Manishearth> fn drop(self) -> Frozen<Self>
[10:00:36] <bluss> that said, some Drop::drop are called multiple times (unsafe_no_drop_flag)
[10:01:10] <Manishearth> where Frozen is a type that is frozen from a coding POV but obviously open for drop glue to mess up
[10:01:23] <bluss> hm ok
[10:01:39] <rkruppe> So is this an implementation bug or a fundamental issue with DST smart pointers?
[10:01:54] <bluss> rkruppe: it's not related to dst smart pointers
[10:02:07] <bluss> well related, but the bug was already present with just trait objects
[10:02:14] <rkruppe> Oh, right. Fundamental issue with trait I meant
[10:02:19] <rkruppe> *trait objects
[10:02:29] <Manishearth> <anon>:7:7: 7:13 error: explicit use of destructor method [E0040]

[10:15:54] <Manishearth> but you can't
[10:15:57] <Manishearth> which is good
[10:15:58] <Manishearth> +1 rust
[10:16:04] <Manishearth> you're not so broken after all
[10:16:08] <bluss> of course
[10:16:23] <Manishearth> That would be the *third* recent Drop bug

[12:12:30] <ChrisMorgan> I build with -j8, so it’s possible dependency management isn’t being done properly and something happened to produce said JSON file before it should have been and librustc tried to use two sources?
[12:13:59] <ChrisMorgan> Killing of tmp/ causes a different error, trying to touch a file in the non-existent directory. A missing dependency or `mkdir -p tmp/` there.
[12:14:10] <ChrisMorgan> But create a blank tmp/ and it looks to be back on track.

[18:36:44] <cmr> Nah it won't work.
[18:37:05] <cmr> you'll need to have someone from #it give someone +F in the chanserv access, you're right, it wasn't set up like I thought it was.

[18:37:24] <Manishearth> +q isn't enough?

[19:50:01] *** Quits: filsmick (filsmick@moz-15h0td.abo.wanadoo.fr) (Quit: )
[19:50:07] <Murarth> LLVM seems to define a function morestack_addr for internal use, but that function isn't being made available to code linked in the ExecutionEngine. There's a flag UsesMorestackAddr on the MachineModuleInfo class that seems to control whether this symbol is created artificially.
[19:50:29] <Diggsey> cmr: I've only ever seen bots post on #llvm...
[19:50:37] <Murarth> I'm not sure whether consumers of the ExecutionEngine API are meant to set that flag when needed (and how do I know when it's needed?) or if it's meant to be set by LLVM internal code.
[19:53:34] <Murarth> The bug is only experienced (as far as I know) on OSX systems, which is why it seems to me that LLVM is meant to be managing this functionality.

[19:57:17] * brson trying to figure out how to op the mod team
[19:57:24] <Murarth> Diggsey: Not exactly. That appears to be the place where __morestack_addr is defined. The problem is that it isn't being defined on OS X systems, which is causing the bug.
[19:57:26] <geofft> cmr: but speaking of Mach and signals, #14232 is lol 
[19:57:53] <geofft> as far as I can tell, OS X's fork() creates a BSD process and returns before creating a Mach task, so you can send it signals and they'll just get completely lost 
[19:58:07] <Diggsey> Murarth: It does call "setUsesMorestackAddr" though, which implies it's supposed to be set by LLVM itself?

[20:21:39] <Murarth> The problem is that the JIT doesn't find __morestack_addr at all. Defining that function and feeding it directly to the ExecutionEngine (as is done with morestack) should suffice.
[20:22:38] <Murarth> I guess I'll just add that to the rustllvm code.
[20:24:02] <Diggsey> but if it found it, but it was too far away to generate a relative jump, mightn't that give the same error?

[21:31:41] <spastorino> hey guys, I was commenting steveklabnik and wycats that I find weird the errors that this http://is.gd/4tXWuS and this http://is.gd/lIxalb display
[21:32:03] <spastorino> first the partially vs collaterally moved
[21:32:09] <spastorino> both seems to be the same case
[21:32:23] <spastorino> both seems collaterally moved and partially at the same time
[21:32:36] <spastorino> unless you're not understanding correct the meaning of partially and collaterally
[21:32:47] <spastorino> which is possible because my english is no bueno :)
[21:33:13] <spastorino> and then the rest of the error message is not very useful

[21:33:57] <brson> i have never even heard the term 'collaterally moved value'
[21:34:53] <spastorino> brson: :)
[21:35:15] <spastorino> yeah neither sure if it worth the distinction
[21:35:31] <spastorino> first I'd say just use of moved value
[21:36:48] <steveklabnik> yeah
[21:36:50] <steveklabnik> nmatsakis: ^^^
[21:37:14] <spastorino> maybe is trying to differentiate with http://is.gd/KoHzAN
[21:38:21] <spastorino> in that case a.b would be "completely" moved if an expression like that exist
[21:39:11] *** Joins: casey (casey@moz-v0ns05.tpgi.com.au)
[21:41:06] <nmatsakis> I recall the PR that landed those descriptions; I'm not sure that the distinctions are worth drawing
[21:41:41] <nmatsakis> I think the idea was that something was "collaterally" moved if it was moved as part of moving some container
[21:41:49] <nmatsakis> so when you move a.b, you also move its subparts a.b.c
[21:41:56] <nmatsakis> partial move means that you moved the subpart
[21:42:09] <nmatsakis> (so moving a.b.c winds up meaning you can't move a.b)
[21:42:11] <mitsuhiko> steveklabnik: not sure if you care much about documentation feedback, but object safety really needs to be explained early
[21:42:17] <mitsuhiko> (and Self: Sized)
[21:42:27] <steveklabnik> mitsuhiko: i do care, and object safety is totally a weak point
[21:42:38] <steveklabnik> i will say that everyone thinks various things need to be explained early though :)

[21:45:47] <steveklabnik> yeah, it also might just get straight-up imported, like one of huon's other posts :D
[21:48:19] <spastorino> nmatsakis: so in this case http://is.gd/4tXWuS a.b is partially moved not collaterally
[21:48:29] <spastorino> or well depending on how you see that
[21:48:37] <spastorino> a.b is partially moved because you moved a.b.c
[21:48:51] <nmatsakis> yeah, perhaps my recollection is wrong

[21:48:57] <nmatsakis> I think there is no clear set of adjectives here

[23:33:05] <bluss> WindowsBunny: I noticed that too, seems to be just type aliases
[23:35:07] <bluss> WindowsBunny: css says  .type { margin-left: 20px; }
[23:35:23] <frewsxcv> bluss: check out the link in the issue i pasted
[23:38:15] <Gankro> WindowsBunny: rustdoc sucks is *our* word. Only people who have contributed to the carnage get to say that.

[23:39:13] <frewsxcv> joining a channel on irc only to tell us that our software sucks is not exactly helpful in any way

[23:55:47] <acrichto> sfackler: wow that makes no sense
[23:55:59] <acrichto> the only instance of "decoder error" in the codebase is JSON serialization

[23:58:51] <bluss> I want to fix a more difficult type alias-assoc type mixup in rustdoc
[23:59:21] <bluss> when it cross-crate includes docs, it dumps assoc types from traits as plain type aliases into the search index
[23:59:31] <bluss> and I'm not very good at finding out why
