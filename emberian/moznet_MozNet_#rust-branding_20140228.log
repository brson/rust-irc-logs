[03:34:58] <TheHydroImpulse> bjz cmr http://thehydroimpulse.github.io/rust-www/
[03:35:21] <bjz> ooh
[03:35:27] <bjz> feels top heavy
[03:35:44] <bjz> have you tried the intro above the code?
[03:35:52] <cmr> the text of the introduction is below the fold on my display
[03:36:01] <cmr> (1366x768+0+0
[03:36:14] <TheHydroImpulse> yeah, it does.
[03:36:24] <TheHydroImpulse> I haven't tried switching them yet
[03:37:04] <bjz> I like the colors. I'm sure the rust logo was hard to place anywhere :(
[03:37:40] <TheHydroImpulse> hehe, yeah. I was thinking of placing it right next to the "Rust" text. That might fit.
[03:38:13] <bjz> Have you thought of going with a 'sidebar style'?
[03:38:26] <bjz> nice brown sidebar
[03:38:32] <bjz> logo
[03:38:45] <bjz> intro with code in the body section
[03:39:08] <bjz> and an alternate layout for small screens
[03:39:23] <bjz> just an idea
[03:39:39] <TheHydroImpulse> bjz I haven't thought about it. I try to stay away from sidebars on front facing sites. It makes the site feel squished or something. That might just be me. But definitely an option
[03:39:56] <bjz> yeah I dunno
[03:40:06] <TheHydroImpulse> I'm gonna try having the white come first, with the intro, then the brown section with code
[03:41:37] <bjz> We'll definitely need to think of what content is best
[03:42:51] <TheHydroImpulse> Definitely. 
[03:45:43] <bjz> TheHydroImpulse: we're sort of trying to think of how best to 'position' Rust
[03:47:01] <bjz> the current marketing stuff might have drifted slightly off target as we have begun to zero in on how the language 'fits together'
[03:48:31] <TheHydroImpulse> bjz Gotcha.
[03:48:31] <bjz> but then, there also needs to be a weighing up of whether we want to talk about the the core design concepts/semantics of the language, or promote the consequences of those choices
[03:48:41] <bjz> I'm thinking maybe the latter
[03:48:56] <bjz> but maybe have a 'design' page somewhere
[03:49:29] <bjz> which outlines core semantics, the derived semantics, and what things we value, and our priorities
[03:49:37] <bjz> what do you think brson?
[03:50:42] <bjz> I think we definitely need to combat the mythology that the design of Rust is ad-hoc, and slapped together
[03:51:14] <TheHydroImpulse> Yeah, definitely a lot to consider. I think a solid set of resources explaining everything clearly will fix that.
[03:51:36] <bjz> I think that mythology might have some grounding in truth, but as we move to 1.0, the picture is becoming a great deal more clear
[03:52:23] <TheHydroImpulse> Although, you could argue that the "ad-hoc" changes were made out of being ultimately better. I guess the process of getting to a solid ground takes iteration. It's hard to get there on day one
[03:52:38] <bjz> oh yeah definitely
[03:53:06] <bjz> the creation process can be chaotic and messy, but the final product does not have to be
[03:53:51] <bjz> hence why I say that mythology has grounding in truth
[03:53:58] <TheHydroImpulse> Exactly
[03:55:09] <bjz> So I think the core of Rust to me is: High level abstractions, Low level control, Compile time safety
[03:57:14] <TheHydroImpulse> I like the sound of that.
[03:59:14] <bjz> Core semantics are: linear types, regions, destructors, restricted unsafe blocks. Higher level features are: type classes, parametric polymorphism, pattern matching and ADTs. From that things like custom allocation strategies (Uniq, Arc, Gc), safe concurrency (std::comm, libgreen, libnative), etc. can be derived.
[04:01:43] <bjz> so safe concurrency is a consequence, not fundamental
[04:01:59] <bjz> the current site makes it seem like the converse is true
[04:02:54] <bjz> not that concurrency shouldn't be prominently marketed
[04:04:25] <bjz> but yeah, if you have something like "High level abstractions, Low level control, Compile time safety", then perhaps that could drive the choice of what example to most prominently display 
[04:04:36] <TheHydroImpulse> Sounds good. Just curious, is there any plans on introducing more functional constructs? Like Monads, Monoids, higher-kinded types? Or is it simply a matter of implementation or use?
[04:05:03] <bjz> HKT allows for the former two things
[04:05:16] <bjz> and HKTs are planned, but probably not for 1.0
[04:05:39] <bjz> we also need better closures to make functional stuff easier
[04:05:47] <TheHydroImpulse> ahh ok. Well that makes me pretty stoked. 
[04:05:51] <bjz> like unboxed closures, and once fns
[04:06:00] <TheHydroImpulse> Are closures still being worked on? i.e., the syntax?
[04:06:49] <bjz> not sure. I have made rumblings to pcwalton about how `|x| -> T` is beginning to look increasingly 'weird'
[04:07:15] <bjz> (since the removal of `do` and the old-style `for`)
[04:07:34] <bjz> and the addition of proc(X) -> T
[04:08:23] <bjz> I don't want to bikeshed here though
[04:08:37] <TheHydroImpulse> Sounds good
[04:09:39] <bjz> have you watched this video? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfCtbGiHcg0
[04:09:46] *** Quits: brson (brson@moz-BBE3ABD.mv.mozilla.com) (Ping timeout)
[04:09:57] <TheHydroImpulse> I did
[04:10:02] <bjz> oh good
[04:10:15] <TheHydroImpulse> One of the first I saw
[04:10:25] <bjz> yeah, nikko is sort of hinting in that where the semantics are heading
[04:11:19] <bjz> The current "Its design is oriented toward concerns of “programming in the large”, that is, of creating and maintaining boundaries – both abstract and operational – that preserve large-system integrity, availability and concurrency. " doesn't seem to fit with the language that is emerging
[04:11:41] <bjz> I mean, those domains will benefit from Rust's semantics
[04:11:55] <bjz> but the language is more general than that, at least imo
[04:12:41] <cmr> it's also a very BS description
[04:12:47] <bjz> yep XD
[04:12:49] <cmr> "let's describe the language while saying nothing at all
[04:12:52] <cmr> "
[04:12:55] <TheHydroImpulse> Gotcha.
[04:13:23] <bjz> It's like it was pulled out of somebody's ass
[04:13:26] <bjz> xD
[04:13:44] * bjz apologises for his crudeness
[04:13:53] <TheHydroImpulse> lol. Also, how much text should be on the home page? A paragraph, a couple? 
[04:14:09] <TheHydroImpulse> Might be hard to explain anything in detail there
[04:14:15] <bjz> cmr: I think it was probably written several years ago, and evolved iteratively
[04:14:19] <cmr> yeah
[04:15:17] <bjz> TheHydroImpulse: I do think more information below the fold might be nice, addressing the core stuff, but if it was it should be very broken up and easy to scan
[04:16:23] <bjz> cmr: I don't think they really knew what kind of lang they had on their hands several years ago
[04:16:30] <TheHydroImpulse> Sounds good.
[04:16:45] <bjz> cmr: the fact they thought GC was going to be the main form of allocation is telling
[04:17:26] <bjz> TheHydroImpulse: but yeah, feel free to disagree
[04:17:35] <bjz> TheHydroImpulse: or have a go at other stuff
[04:17:53] <bjz> TheHydroImpulse: other ways of doing it
[04:18:29] <TheHydroImpulse> bjz I'm still pretty new to Rust, so I try and listen to the community first. It's their project anyways.
[04:19:22] <bjz> TheHydroImpulse: I think this kind of project is going to be really important for the feedback loop of polishing that needs to happen over the next year
[04:19:48] <bjz> TheHydroImpulse: if we can begin to be more articulate about the language's identity
[04:20:13] <bjz> so yeah, very exciting
[04:20:53] <bjz> glad to see you have stuck with it (despite all the other things I'm sure you have to do)
[04:20:55] <TheHydroImpulse> Definitely. I think it's taking shape quite nicely. It's pretty shocking how many people are apart of it and how many PR there is.
[04:21:22] <bjz> :)
[04:21:40] <bjz> the hype machine is a fickle beast
[04:21:46] <TheHydroImpulse> lol
[04:22:05] <TheHydroImpulse> Yeah, I almost *have* to get some side projects, otherwise I'd go crazy. 
[04:22:48] <bjz> I'm sure there will be some back-lash eventually, and people will hate rust for various reasons, and write blog posts about it, but I definitely think at least some of the hype is warrented.
[04:24:29] <TheHydroImpulse> Yeah, I'm sure HN is gonna get busier for Rust topics, once 1.0 hits. From all the new languages that have gotten attention, I think Rust is the more serious one.
