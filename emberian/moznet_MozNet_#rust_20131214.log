[01:11:40] <arrrrrrrrr> I'm saying it's implementation dependent.
[01:12:36] <Earnestly> arrrrrrrrr: Except the standard does define a minimum range
[01:12:48] <arrrrrrrrr> yes, 16 bits.
[01:12:49] <o11c> C and I think POSIX say sizeof(int) is implementation-defined
[01:12:53] <Earnestly> Yeah
[01:12:57] <Earnestly> At least 16 bits
[01:13:17] <arrrrrrrrr> and, fun fact, sizeof(char)==1 :)

[02:31:00] <Jarrett> cool.
[02:31:20] <tjc> so, assuming no dynamically sized types (and I don't think those are implemented yet anyway), you should be able to use your own assumptions and not rely on an offsetof()

[03:16:11] <SiegeLord> escalant3: It looks good
[03:16:49] <derek_c> does Rust have something similar to Go's select?
[03:16:58] <derek_c> i.e. blocking on multiple channels?

[03:17:23] <SiegeLord> escalant3: In principle you should handle that option manually though... that's what the docs mean. You shouldn't fail for common conditions generally
[03:19:17] <escalant3> my first implementation was using two matches instead of the unwrap. Seemed to verbose

[03:19:29] <vadimcn> acrichto: how would that work exactly?   Can I give rustc a bitcode file?
[03:20:13] <acrichto> vadimcn: no you'd have to generate an object file with llc and then use ar to put that into libfoo.a
[03:20:33] <dbaupp> acrichto: could we cheat with LTO?
[03:20:49] <dbaupp> i.e. put the bc file into the .a, or whatever?
[03:20:50] <acrichto> maybe? that feels really sketchy though
[03:21:02] <dbaupp> heh
[03:21:04] <acrichto> we don't do any LTO with native libraries right now
[03:21:16] <acrichto> in theory we could search them for *.bc and hope that it's llvm bytecode
[03:21:49] <vadimcn> acrichto: so basically I could put my .ll file into the 'rt' project and then add some make rules to have it compiled to native .o, correct ?

[05:41:53] <Jarrett> cause wow that is ugly
[05:43:37] <strcat> no, rust currently doesn't do type inference for statics

[05:47:10] <strcat> it doesn't infer function/static type definitions under the belief that drawing a line at top-level definitions for type inference makes the code easier to reason about and read

[05:52:15] <ssbr> Have I mentioned that this is pretty much the only big thing I don't like about Rust?
[05:52:22] <Jarrett> okay how the heck do I pass the address of a local variable to a C function, cause std::ptr::to_mut_unsafe_ptr(&var) is whining about "cannot borrow immutable dereference of & pointer as mutable"
[05:52:27] <ssbr> you guys should just push 1.0 right afterwards. problem solved. rust is complete.
[05:52:41] <Jarrett> lol
[05:52:52] <dbaupp> ssbr: unfortunately the relevant parts of the compiler are really poorly designed for getting that working. :(
[05:52:52] <ssbr> Jarrett: use &mut var instead of &var
[05:53:02] <dbaupp> Jarrett: you don't acutally need that function call
[05:53:07] <Jarrett> .. oh?
[05:53:10] <diverse> ssbr: not if I can help it, wait for DSTs to be implemented!
[05:53:20] <dbaupp> &mut T and &T will automatically coerce to *mut T and *T

[05:53:36] <Jarrett> neat

[05:53:47] <diverse> >:D
[05:53:48] <ssbr> dbaupp: what's the difference in how I should treat *T vs *mut T?
[05:53:49] <dbaupp> and if the automatic coercion isn't working then `&mut x as *mut T` works too
[05:53:50] <Jarrett> DSTs?
[05:53:57] <ssbr> Jarrett: dynamically sized types
[05:53:59] <Jarrett> it's working dbaupp  :)
[05:54:02] <Jarrett> ahhhh right
[05:54:17] <dbaupp> ssbr: *mut T if the C code takes T*, *T if the C code takes const T*
[05:55:01] <ssbr> dbaupp: What does this do? It strikes me as an odd distinction because raw pointers aren't safe anyway, so it doesn't matter if someone does weird stuff to it through a &mut pointer.
[05:55:07] <ssbr> unsafe is unsafe
[05:55:25] <dbaupp> ssbr: because the compiler automatically coerces &T to *T
[05:55:35] <dbaupp> so you can accidentally have an "immutable piece of data that changes

[06:17:57] <Jarrett> does rust have a default segfault handler, or do they just make programs mysteriously quit?
[06:19:18] <strcat> Jarrett: rust code outside of unsafe blocks can't cause a segfault
[06:19:27] <strcat> and I wouldn't really cause a segfault a mysterious quit
[06:19:32] <Jarrett> how about rust code IN unsafe blocks ;)
[06:19:50] <strcat> the OS reports it as segfaulting and dumps core if core dumps are enabled
[06:19:53] * strcat shrugs
[06:19:57] <Jarrett> yeah
[06:20:02] <Jarrett> hm
[06:20:05] <strcat> Jarrett: so what do you expect rust to do?
[06:20:26] <Jarrett> didn't know if it had a above-top-level exception/signal handler that would say "aaaa segfault" and abort
[06:20:44] <strcat> that's already what a segfault does without a handler
[06:20:47] <Jarrett> okay
[06:20:58] <strcat> and most memory corruption won't cause a segfault
[06:21:13] <Jarrett> well then I'm not sure why my program is just mysteriously quitting whenever I try to use an OpenGL function haha
[06:21:35] <strcat> segfaults only commonly happen from violating memory protection
[06:21:58] <strcat> and the most common way to do that is trying to read a low address since that page is usually PROT_NONE
[06:22:05] <Jarrett> yes, I am aware haha
[06:22:07] <strcat> so a null ptr deref *usually* causes a segfault
[06:22:09] * strcat shrugs

[07:48:59] <derek_c> say I have a function called f that returns ~[u8]. Can someone tell me what's wrong with the code `println(str::from_utf8(f()));`?
[07:49:15] <derek_c> says borrowed pointer does not live long enough
[07:49:37] <dbaupp> let tmp = f(); println(str::from_utf8(tmp);`
[07:49:54] <derek_c> dbaupp: yeah I know that works, but I don't know what's wrong with the original one
[07:50:04] <jtbandes> I'm getting "error: unresolved import: there is no `timer` in `std::io`" when trying to use std::io::timer;... but the docs seem to indicate this should work. where is timer stuff?
[07:50:06] <dbaupp> it's just that the result of the `f()` call doesn't last long enough for from_utf8 (which is &'a [u8] -> &'a str)
[07:50:25] <derek_c> dbaupp: I don't understand. why doesn't it last long enough?

[08:30:16] <eddyb> I'm probably a penguin
[08:30:40] <ssbr> The discussion of proof systems is definitely proof theory. The rewrite rules that form e.g. hindley-milner type inference, are a proof system, and can be discussed in that framework. I think that's why it uses the notation of proof theory too.

[08:35:33] <ssbr> is he a huge math guy as in he likes pi, or as in he has recently taken up learning topology for fun?
[08:35:43] <geomyidae> Plus I just don't really understand it enough myself. Like I kinda understand what you're saying about proofs and am googling the names mentioned, but now I'm curious what abstract algebra is more directly useful for
[08:35:57] <geomyidae> the latter. ironically, it's what he pointed me to and I'm like "uh, dude,....."
[08:36:26] <geomyidae> It was some sort of graph vertices edge probability n dimensional matrices crap. My eyes glossed over.
[08:36:53] <ssbr> geomyidae: As I understand it, abstract algebra is nice because it gives you simple rules and general results.
[08:37:30] <ssbr> e.g. the socks-shoes theorem applies to any group, which means numbers under addition and multiplication, linear transformations, matrices, permutations, etc.
[08:37:56] <ssbr> (socks shoes theorem: you put your socks on before you put on your shoes, so to undo that, you can take your shoes off and then your socks.)

[08:39:51] <ssbr> the proof is basically just doing it.
[08:40:37] <Ms2ger> And a bit of associativity
[08:41:07] <ssbr> e = a inv(a) = b inv(b) = a (b inv(b)) inv(a) = (a b) (inv(b) inv(a)), therefore inv(a b) = (inv(b) inv(a))

[09:28:06] <jtbandes> yeah
[09:28:20] <ChrisMorgan> And it was buggy also. So it's gone for the present. Something like it is expected to come back eventually, but such a thing needs a champion.

[09:36:42] <jtbandes> I haven't seen "once" before, what is it?
[09:37:01] <dbaupp> it means that closure can only be called once
[09:37:10] <dbaupp> (statically verified)
[09:37:14] <jtbandes> neat
[09:37:18] <jtbandes> sort of like move semantics
[09:37:25] <dbaupp> it allows one to move out of captured variables
[09:37:31] <dbaupp> exactly like move sematnics
[09:37:47] <dbaupp> it's effectively a trait object with a method of the form `fn call(self, ...) -> result`
[09:38:06] <dbaupp> so the proc is moved when you call it.

[10:21:07] <eddyb> jtbandes: what's the function?
[10:21:22] <dbaupp> jtbandes: procs can take agruments, `proc(foo, bar) { ... }
[10:21:23] <dbaupp> `
[10:21:26] <dbaupp> (iirc)
[10:21:33] <eddyb> jtbandes: if it's something task-related like spawn, you'll switch to a proc. if it's not, you should not be using do anymore
[10:21:47] <dbaupp> strcat: probably the latter :P
[10:21:51] <strcat> well `do` is likely going to be removed completely
[10:22:05] <eddyb> jtbandes: the difference is that proc's can be returned from functions, moved between tasks, etc. closures can't
[10:22:07] <strcat> on a different note....
[10:22:32] <eddyb> jtbandes: and because of that, proc's can only be called once - pretty much the old ~once fn
[10:22:35] <strcat> why does linux have the ability to change the clock used by condition variable timed waits, but not mutex timed locks?
[10:22:37] * strcat sighs
[10:22:42] <strcat> and it looks similar for other OSes
[10:23:17] <strcat> well, timed locks aren't as useful
[10:23:27] <strcat> since the lock scopes should be tiny so you should never have that much contention
[10:23:49] <strcat> it's a more reliable way of doing trylock though...
[10:23:58] <eddyb> dbaupp: oooh, inflating looks really easy now. and btw, Fn with call(self, ..args) is enough, since you can implement it for ~Bar and it's once, or &Bar and it's callable multiple times
[10:24:15] <eddyb> proc becomes ~Fn and closures &Fn
[10:24:35] <dbaupp> eddyb: ignoring the bit where `self` methods aren't callable through trait objects :P
[10:24:42] <eddyb> dammit!
[10:24:44] <dbaupp> (and will likely never be callable through &Fn ones)
[10:24:49] <eddyb> hmpf
[10:25:05] <eddyb> dbaupp: well... it works when you're not using trait pointers
[10:25:09] <dbaupp> yes
[10:25:31] <eddyb> impl Fn for &Fn and impl Fn for ~Fn :P
[10:25:49] <dbaupp> that doesn't get around &Fn not actually working :P
[10:25:53] <eddyb> dbaupp: we need a trait-object-self
[10:26:19] <dbaupp> still can't move out of a &Trait object, which is what allowing calling (self) methods on them would do
[10:26:21] <eddyb> or something crazy
[10:26:34] <dbaupp> (since the type is erased, so in general the compiler can't tell if the real inner type moves or not)

[11:02:32] <eddyb> but then it may not be obvious what &mut T means, or it could be different from &(mut T) :P
[11:02:59] <diverse> i picture it as &(mut T)
[11:03:33] <bodi> If I have a uniqe pointer to T, how can I create an Rc from it?
[11:03:42] <eddyb> bodi: it's easier by value
[11:04:00] <eddyb> bodi: but I guess you can always do Rc::new(*owned), it's just an extra copy

[11:04:30] <eddyb> DynMut is shorter than RefCell, btw :P
[11:04:37] <dbaupp> any &mut is guaranteed to be the only usable pointer to that piece of data
[11:05:03] <dbaupp> (and any unsafe code must be written such that it maintains this guarantee)
[11:05:08] <eddyb> dbaupp: &mut T would stay the same, &(mut T) would be Mut/DynMut/RefCell/RefBox/MutBox *in that dream*
[11:05:16] <eddyb> (and there you go, 3 new names for it)
[11:05:37] <dbaupp> eddyb: I was addressing diverse's point that they picture &mut T as &(mut T)
[11:06:03] <eddyb> uhm, no, you can't move &mut T in the library, there would have to be a distinction
[11:06:27] <eddyb> dbaupp: I thought diverse said &(mut T) could be the dynamic one
[11:07:28] <dbaupp> eddyb: the point that you can't move &mut into the library is exactly what I was saying.
[11:07:49] <dbaupp> well, I dunno; I guess diverse is the authority on what they said...

[11:16:44] <dbaupp> (and you can mutate the data through that pointer)
[11:17:29] <eddyb> well, yeah. but I'm afk most of the time and I didn't get to write my proper response :(
[11:17:51] <dbaupp> where as &T is a borrowed reference to data anywhere, with no restrictions on the number that you can have, but it means that the data is guaranteed to frozen, i.e. the data will never change (i.e. there's no other pointers or anything that allow for modifications of that data).
[11:19:06] <eddyb> and RefCell<T> doesn't require a mutable slot (though it's not Freeze, because it can do magical mutation) and allows borrowing &T or &mut T, imposing the same restrictions, but dynamically

[11:50:45] <dbaupp> diverse: I guess eddyb is away for bit
[11:51:31] <dbaupp> I think what he means is RefCell allows you to get around the type system a little bit by allowing you to get an &mut out of an object stored in an immutable location
[11:51:54] <dbaupp> however, this means that it has to dynamically (i.e. at runtime) ensure that the &mut's are valid
[11:52:28] <dbaupp> so it records whether there is a &mut borrowed from it, or how many &s there are
[11:52:56] <dbaupp> and fail!()'s if you try to borrow a new &mut when there is an &mut or & already borrowed from it.

[13:05:10] <dbaupp> but, I'd personally use `let x: MyType<bool> = MyType::new();` less than `let x = MyType::<bool>::new();` since the former requires writing `MyType` twice
[13:05:50] <dbaupp> (and the full declaration with let is even more annoying for more complicated types.)
[13:05:55] <lastdev> the thing is, I'm wrapping a dynamic vector in my own struct, so at some point I need a specific type here
[13:06:08] <lastdev> I agree the latter looks nicer
[13:06:11] <dbaupp> is the struct dynamic?

[15:54:52] <eddyb> Rc is reference-counted, so you can share it (the "advanced" versions also work across tasks/threads). Gc is garbage collected, as in higher-level languages
[15:56:07] <eddyb> though we don't have overrideable borrowing/dereferencing *yet*, so they're a bit nasty to use atm
[15:56:28] <adridu59> what's the difference between those two? I know about Gc from other languages but I don't see what's different with Rc
[15:56:46] <cmr> Rc is reference counted, Gc is (ostensibly) traced
[15:56:57] <cmr> Rc has deterministic collection, Gc doesn't
[15:57:16] <cmr> Rc doesn't allow cycles, Gc can.
[15:57:28] <adridu59> Gc works at runtime while Rc doesn't?

[17:13:03] <eddyb> I've seen a couple of recent naive attempts with returning closures
[17:13:57] <eddyb> JavaScript is one of the nicest languages to write this in. and with ES6, it's just n => i => n += i
[17:14:01] <wwendell> No, no course, just interested... I actually posted this to reddit back in the day: http://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/18dmux/the_accumulator_generator_can_it_be_done/

[17:14:29] <eddyb> yay for ES6 :P
[17:15:35] <wwendell> yeah, that is neat
[17:15:55] <eddyb> I want someone to fix that page, since that is the most idiomatic way ever to implement it :D
[17:16:10] <wwendell> I was just wondering how one would do that with managed memory like Rust
[17:16:51] <wwendell> in rust, you can't have a (non-method) function return a closure it created, right?

[17:28:03] <celeron55> bah... i have code that doesn't work, but when i try to make a smaller example of the part that doesn't work, it works
[17:28:15] <eddyb> well, I'm missing "as ~Fn<uint, uint>" and it should be ~Foo
[17:28:40] <eddyb> wwendell: and it won't work until we have variadic generics in the language (Fn<..Args, Ret> is not a thing, yet)
[17:28:45] <celeron55> has someone dealt with errors like this?: error: instantiating a type parameter with an incompatible type `~<whatever>`, which does not fulfill `Freeze`
[17:29:02] <eddyb> wwendell: wait, I did it wrong, haha
[17:29:16] <wwendell> eddyb: ok, take your time...
[17:30:10] <wwendell> OK, that makes sense.
[17:31:18] <wwendell> eddyb: why can't a closure enclose/move an owned value? I guess I just haven't understood what that issue is
[17:31:39] <eddyb> because then it's a proc, not a closure
[17:31:50] <eddyb> and you can call it only once
[17:32:12] <wwendell> So could you do this with a proc (where it can only be called once)?
[17:32:20] <eddyb> well, yes
[17:32:23] <eddyb> but it's kinda useless
[17:32:29] <wwendell> well, yes
[17:33:01] <eddyb> fn foo(n: uint) -> Rc<Fn<uint, uint>> {struct Foo(uint); impl Fn<uint, uint> for RefCell<Foo> {fn call(&self, i: uint) -> uint {self.with_mut(|n| {*n = Foo(**n + i); **n})}} Rc::with_mut(RefCell::new(Foo(n))) as Rc<Fn<uint, uint>>}
[17:33:13] <eddyb> so this has less problems. it needs DST and variadic generics

[17:33:26] <wwendell> I guess the reason I'm asking all these questions is that I don't entirely understand the difference between procs and closures, and this problem really drove that home
[17:34:32] <eddyb> procs can only close over owned data, they are owned and you can call them once (calling a proc moves it, as if it had a call(self) method, compared to call(&self) for closures)
[17:34:44] *** Quits: dwrensha (chatzilla@moz-DE44EA45.hsd1.pa.comcast.net) (Ping timeout)
[17:35:32] <wwendell> and there is no equivalent for call(~self)
[17:36:23] <eddyb> well, self with Self = ~OpaqueContentsForThatProc and ~self with Self = OpaqueContentsForThatProc are the same
[17:36:29] <eddyb> if you write a trait specially for this (or, like, reuse iterators), you can get away with only DST or maybe no future features at all
[17:36:50] <eddyb> though I don't think you can feed things to iterators, like you can with python/ES6 generators
[17:37:18] <eddyb> wwendell: that (possible) future Fn trait is basically operator() from the C++ example
[17:37:30] <wwendell> and why can't you do something of signature "fn accgen<'a>(n: &'a mut T) -> &'a |uint| -> uint"?
[17:37:42] <eddyb> oh, hmm
[17:37:52] <wwendell> Yes, that Fn trait would make this much simpler
[17:38:15] <wwendell> Or at least, I couldn't
[17:38:41] <eddyb> not simpler, but doable and flexible. some syntax sugar, like Rc::new(|i| {n += i; n}) might make this trivial, in the future
[17:38:51] <eddyb> though that's fuzzier than even DST/variadic generics

[17:41:54] <eddyb> wwendell: it's actually capturing an opaque structure on the stack, with a reference to n, in this example
[17:41:56] <wwendell> Yes, I got (basically) that same error trace, but I don't understand
[17:43:46] <celeron55> okay so here is my problem now: http://paste.ubuntu.com/6573589/
[17:43:57] <eddyb> so struct Captures<'a> {priv n: & &'a mut uint} let captures = Captures {n: &n}; let closure = (|&self, _| **self.n, &captures);
[17:44:25] <eddyb> wwendell: the closure is that last tuple, basically a fat pointer. you'd have to return also the "captures" structure alongside
[17:44:52] <celeron55> the problem is that... well, it just won't build, and the theme of it not building is that error (i get even more of it when trying to do other things)
[17:45:25] <eddyb> celeron55: it's simple... FoobarHolder is not Freeze
[17:45:35] <celeron55> but what does that mean? how do i fix it?
[17:45:48] <eddyb> celeron55: it means it's mutable-by-immutable-reference
[17:46:03] <eddyb> celeron55: either Foobar or FoobarCallbacks is not Freeze, find which one
[17:46:22] <eddyb> it's probably ~Any that's not Freeze
[17:46:27] <celeron55> but i don't want to make them Freeze
[17:46:37] <wwendell> I see, that makes sense; even though it isn't using any data from the "environment", even capturing a reference from that environment to something not in that environment means it can't outlive that environment
[17:46:37] <celeron55> i want them to be shared mutable state
[17:47:22] <celeron55> if course i could just make that whole thing mutable and then it would build, but it wouldn't do what i want it to do

[17:47:26] <celeron55> i mean, immutable

[17:47:55] <hoverbear> :3
[17:48:06] <jmgrosen> I'm kind of stumped here: I'm getting "cannot borrow immutable field as mutable" when I'm trying to access a field on a struct I created with "let mut = ...", and the field is actually owned by that struct (not just a reference)
[17:48:09] <eddyb> celeron55: RWArc needs to make sure you can't mutate from an immutable borrow, because that would break things
[17:48:23] <eddyb> celeron55: ~Any:Freeze might work, just remembered that is a thing
[17:48:36] <wwendell> eddyb: thanks, that was interesting

[17:49:16] <jmgrosen> okay
[17:49:24] <celeron55> eddyb: hmm, looks like it builds using ~Any:Freeze+Send
[17:49:41] <celeron55> i wonder what kind of implications that has in practice

[17:50:30] <eddyb> (your FoobarCallbacks looks kinda unusable IMO, btw)
[17:50:54] <celeron55> it's kind of a silly thing for an odd purpose; don't mind that
[17:51:02] <celeron55> "Types are sendable unless they contain managed boxes, managed closures, or borrowed pointers"
[17:51:19] <eddyb> you can ignore managed stuff, it's going away
[17:51:39] <eddyb> Rc is not Send, Arc/RWArc should be Send
[17:51:45] <celeron55> okay so yes, this obviously makes sense; having borrowed pointers there would be insane
[17:51:48] <eddyb> RcMut is not Freeze
[17:51:57] <eddyb> err, RefCell

[17:54:31] <celeron55> eddyb: what in particular looks unusable in FoobarCallbacks?
[17:54:39] <celeron55> just wondering if it might be something i'm not aware of

[17:55:01] <eddyb> you're better off with an owned trait pointer

[19:19:09] <celeron55> http://paste.ubuntu.com/6574068/
[19:19:17] <eddyb> it's generic over a type which can be &'a T. I think .as_mut returns Option<&'a T>
[19:19:33] <celeron55> that should be tidy enough; now what!
[19:19:56] <eddyb> celeron55: hahaha
[19:20:06] <eddyb> you're casting ~Any to &mut Any
[19:20:20] <eddyb> that actually wraps the ~Any into another Any
[19:20:35] <eddyb> so what you can do is .as_mut::<~Any>

[19:34:23] <celeron55> this is all kind of weird as rust usually handles dereferencing automatically
[19:35:45] <eddyb> hmm
[19:35:59] <eddyb> celeron55: AAAH silly me. there's auxiliary traits
[19:36:28] <eddyb> since you want as_mut, you need to inherit (and/or maybe implement?) the trait which has that one

[19:45:40] <lastdev> if I'm right, std::vec::OwnedVector::remove() borrows list as mutable, but std::vec::OwnedVector::iter() borrows it as immutable... what should I do in order to combine code that makes use of both?

[22:28:22] <jmgrosen> I'm doing `while port.peek() { ... }` but it doesn't seem to always get everything in the queue
[22:28:48] <jmgrosen> well, maybe it's not the peeking
[22:29:26] <jmgrosen> what's the recommended way of sending out things to N tasks and then waiting to get a response from each?
[22:30:15] <jmgrosen> I don't care about which task each response comes from
[22:30:24] <strcat> do you just want to spawn N tasks, and they produce a value when they finish? or they're persistent
[22:30:42] <jmgrosen> strcat: how expensive is creating a task?
[22:30:45] <celeron55> this gives two options for non-persistent tasks: http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/master/tutorial-tasks.html#communication
[22:30:55] <celeron55> jmgrosen: practically zero
[22:30:59] <strcat> celeron55: no
[22:31:40] <strcat> a little more expensive than making a large allocation
[22:31:53] <strcat> so pretty much as expensive as spawning a thread on linux
[22:32:12] <jmgrosen> I'm using this for a game thing where I send out a physics object to each task and have it simulate what happens to that one object in one tick
[22:32:22] <lastdev> is there any efficient way to get code like this to compile: http://pastebin.com/x9aSpS4e?
[22:32:29] <jmgrosen> so I might have thousands of tasks
[22:32:41] <strcat> jmgrosen: thousands of tasks are fine
[22:32:44] <dbaupp> jmgrosen: are you spawning the tasks on each tick?
[22:33:08] <jmgrosen> dbaupp: I wasn't planning to, but I can't figure out how to get this working nicely without it
[22:33:41] <jmgrosen> right now I'm hackily just sleeping and then checking one port (which they all send to from sharedchans) until .peek() tells me there's no more
[22:34:49] <dbaupp> and then?
[22:34:54] <celeron55> jmgrosen: you could just count how many things you sent out to the tasks, and wait until yuu receive that many things from them (or something effectively equivalent but more complicated)
[22:35:12] <celeron55> i'm sure peek() isn't supposed to be reliable when used that way
[22:35:12] <dbaupp> does the task just end when .peek() returns false?
[22:35:29] <jmgrosen> celeron55: the problem is that they can send more than one thing (I guess I suppose I could have a ~[] that it sends, but that's one more allocation per task)
[22:35:49] <jmgrosen> dbaupp: no, it stays alive and then waits for another message
[22:36:01] <celeron55> jmgrosen: then make them first tell how many things they are going to send
[22:36:10] <celeron55> jmgrosen: think of it like a network protocol, because that's kind of what it is
[22:36:19] <dbaupp> jmgrosen: can't you just block while waiting for a message?
[22:37:48] <celeron55> jmgrosen: or actually, make them send a "finished" notice after each is ready, and count those
[22:37:51] <jmgrosen> dbaupp: the problem is that I don't know how many messages are coming in, so I don't know when to stop calling recv()
[22:38:10] <jmgrosen> celeron55: that could work
[22:39:28] <dbaupp> jmgrosen: .try_recv() will return None if the channel is closed
[22:40:11] <jmgrosen> dbaupp: but the channel isn't being closed -- the task is staying alive

[23:20:56] <jmgrosen> right now I'm spawning 2000 tasks and none of them are moving to different threads
[23:21:16] <strcat> there are scheduler threads
[23:21:23] <dbaupp> how many cores do you have?

[23:23:04] <jmgrosen> dbaupp, 4 (or 8 if you count hyperthreads)
[23:23:25] <jmgrosen> strcat, do chans/ports count as I/O ops?
[23:23:57] <jmgrosen> (also, my weird stack overflow was fixed by using --opt-level=3)
[23:26:02] <strcat> opt-level=3 just increases the inlining threshold and promotes by-ref parameters to by-value and does scalar vectorization
[23:26:13] <strcat> if it stopped a stack overflow, you're probably still precariously close to it
[23:26:58] <strcat> are you using recursion somewhere without clear bounds? maybe a tree without a clearly bounded depth?
[23:26:59] <brson> jmgrosen: ports and chans are not i/o. i would expect 2000 tasks to trivially saturate your cores
[23:30:13] <dbaupp> jmgrosen: is the --opt-level=3 comparing against no optimisations, or -O?
[23:31:13] <jmgrosen> strcat, no recursion

[23:42:20] <dbaupp> etc.
[23:42:41] <dbaupp> jtbandes: you need the input objects to have the same type as the one you are adding to the vector
[23:43:02] <jtbandes> dbaupp: will the type parameter T not suffice for this? if the type is effectively "pointer to thing which has a Select implementation"?
[23:43:19] <dbaupp> jtbandes: yes, but tport is always PortOne<()>
[23:43:22] <brson> jmgrosen: the 'non-scalar' cast error is because 'as' only works for scalars and trait types and T is just an arbitrary type. perhaps you want to cast to &Select or something
[23:43:23] <dbaupp> you can never make it a T

[23:47:06] <jtbandes> my goal is to be able to sleep for a specified amount of time, but still handle messages that come in
[23:47:16] <strcat> it's kind of funny because I just wrote myself something to deal with this issue
[23:47:25] <strcat> https://github.com/thestinger/rust-core/commit/6ad77ab83dbe246e3f34fcad12c6d2b02a2155d8 at least, I think that's probably what you're doing too ;p

[23:48:36] <dbaupp> jtbandes: that would probably work, although actually getting the message out might be tricky
[23:48:38] <jtbandes> strcat: maybe sort of. if select() had a timeout option, that would help me
[23:48:42] <jmgrosen> strcat: I'm pretty sure it's not an unbounded queue because memory is pretty much staying constant, even without optimizations
[23:48:52] <jtbandes> dbaupp: well, select() doesn't give you the message, you still have to call recv(), so I don't think that's a problem
[23:49:00] <dbaupp> jtbandes: you may need to also wrap the timer channel, so that both channels are sending Option<MessageType>
[23:49:09] <dbaupp> jtbandes: oh
[23:49:13] <strcat> jmgrosen: it's an unbounded queue, you just may be bounding it externally (as you have to)
[23:49:23] <strcat> anyway if you're not creating a really massive queue I don't know why it'd be doing that
[23:49:30] <strcat> runtime bug I guess

[23:49:44] <dbaupp> jtbandes: (well, maybe Option<uint>, where uint is the index of the input vector from the inner select, i.e. the wrapped timer channel sends None.)
[23:49:46] <strcat> but I strongly suspect it's from recursion if optimizations fix it
[23:49:56] <strcat> probably the tailcallelim pass

[23:52:42] <jtbandes> if I spawn a task to call select(), how can I kill it if the timer fires?
[23:52:43] <strcat> if you create a very large one, that's a lot of recursion
[23:52:52] <strcat> jtbandes: can't kill a task
[23:52:57] <strcat> it'd be unsafe to just kill a task
[23:53:02] <jtbandes> er, is there any way to cancel a select?

[23:53:27] <jtbandes> strcat: yes, but if none ever does :)
[23:53:37] <strcat> if there isn't select_timed, you need select(foo, bar, timer_task)
[23:53:48] <jtbandes> that's what I'm creating
