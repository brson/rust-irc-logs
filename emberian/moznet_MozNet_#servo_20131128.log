[00:05:06] <pcwalton> jack: larsberg: that's with 4 cores
[00:05:07] <pcwalton> I posted to the ML
[00:05:29] <pcwalton> adding 2 more threads to use hyper threading increases perf to 86% faster
[00:06:09] <pcwalton> btw profiler says a ton of time spent in Cell junk
[00:06:17] <pcwalton> so maybe this will be even faster with a rust upgrade
[00:06:21] <pcwalton> although I'm not sure how much to trust that
[00:08:35] <larsberg> great work! And yeah, I'm always skeptical about little functions that show up like that, especially if I'm using an instrumenting profiler.
[00:09:10] <strcat> does callgrind still have incomprehensible output now that segmented stacks are gone?
[00:09:18] <strcat> I haven't tried for a while
[00:09:19] <pcwalton> strcat: I use Instruments.app :)
[00:09:22] <pcwalton> and it works just fine
[00:09:26] <pcwalton> instruction level too
[00:09:37] <pcwalton> cell::Cell stuff keeps showing up high
[00:09:39] <pcwalton> so I dunno
[00:09:52] <pcwalton> also drop glue is like 40%?!
[00:09:56] <pcwalton> I think that's probably lie
[00:10:13] <pcwalton> well, the drop glue is calling Cell stuff
[00:10:14] <pcwalton> I dunno
[00:10:28] <pcwalton> I hope it's true because once I find it I can make it 40% faster :P
[00:10:29] <pcwalton> but I think it's lies
[00:10:34] <strcat> it's not a sampling profiler?
[00:10:40] <pcwalton> it is
[00:10:53] <pcwalton> it's just that due to superscalar whatevers instruction level profiling is always questionable
[00:11:02] <pcwalton> at least in my experience
[00:11:34] <strcat> well the hyperthreading gain somewhat proves that ;p
[00:11:44] <pcwalton> 6 improves over 4
[00:11:47] <pcwalton> 8 regresses over 6
[00:11:50] <pcwalton> in terms of worker threads
[00:11:52] <strcat> but callgrind/cachegrind does simulate stuff like branch prediction
[00:12:17] <pcwalton> once I can land this I'd like to try assign-widths
[00:12:20] <pcwalton> assign-widths may just fly
[00:12:24] <pcwalton> because it's a top-down traversal
[00:12:29] <pcwalton> which is much happier than bottom-up traversals
[00:12:40] <pcwalton> bottom-up traversals suck because you have to wait on your siblings before you can enqueue your parent
[00:13:07] <pcwalton> and you also have to start with the leaves which costs 6% of your performance right there
[00:13:33] <pcwalton> sadly CSS is mostly bottom-up traversals :(
[00:13:37] <pcwalton> but oh well
[00:15:24] <pcwalton> does anyone have more than 4 real cores?
[00:15:30] <pcwalton> I would love to try this on 8 or 16 or more

[00:16:14] <jack> we need to order a 64-way machine or something and put it under a desk
[00:16:33] <jack> lars mentioned intel having some kind of compute farm we could get research access to that had such machines?
[00:16:42] <jack> larsberg: or was it someone else?
[00:17:00] <pcwalton> maybe if gal sees these kinds of numbers :)
[00:17:35] <larsberg> jack: yes
[00:18:07] <larsberg> though I have a 48-way AMD, native dual-8 core Intel and a native dual-12 core (before hyperthreading for the 8/12) boxes I could test on
[00:18:13] <larsberg> Only downside is they're linux and remote
[00:18:28] <jack> i don't suppose we can get shell accounts can we?
[00:18:42] <jack> i wonder if xiph has one of those too
[00:19:00] <larsberg> Unfortunately, these are all NSF-funded machines from my previous life sitting in academic server farms :-)
[00:19:15] <pcwalton> can we get the NSF interested in browsers
[00:19:21] * pcwalton only half kidding
[00:19:38] <larsberg> we need academic collaborators to act as PIs, but sure
[00:19:53] <jack> i can ask around UNM and see if there is a many-core machine in teh HPC lab i can get an account on
[00:19:57] <larsberg> grant proposals take a long time to go through, though (my advisor was at the NSF doing grant approval my last two years)
[00:20:07] <jack> i used to have accounts on a beowulf cluster there, but i assuem they probably have some many-core machiens too
[00:20:50] <jack> sweetie. i have rustc writing .d files now
[00:20:58] <larsberg> in all seriousness, we could probably establish a "collaboration" thing with a university lab with lots of big machines
[00:21:22] <larsberg> e.g., at the UofC they have a campus "resource computing center" that has even bigger machines and are available for faculty projects
[00:21:26] <pcwalton> hmm
[00:21:35] <jack> larsberg: can you ping dherman about that and see if he has ideas who to ask?
[00:21:43] <larsberg> could probably get accounts for people on those if we apply and find a relevant faculty member
[00:21:55] <pcwalton> is there some way to calculate what the theoretical ideal speedup is?
[00:22:06] <pcwalton> for any given document
[00:22:10] <pcwalton> we have a bottom up parallel traversal on a tree with a known shape
[00:22:15] <pcwalton> so I don't think the ideal speedup will be linear
[00:22:32] <pcwalton> because you have to compute your siblings before your parent
[00:22:57] <pcwalton> but it would be nice if we could calculate "speedup over sequential was X out of an ideal Y"
[00:23:05] <jack> that's an excellent question. we should find an answer or create such a thing.
[00:23:50] <pcwalton> it's too late in the day for me to think seriously about such things :)
[00:23:51] <larsberg> most of the stuff I've seen people do in papers is either 1) instrument the program to record the times of each task and the dependencies and then report the "ideal" time
[00:24:02] <larsberg> 2) measure the parallel-only portion separately and report their speedup on that
[00:24:03] <pcwalton> larsberg: but this should be computable mathematically
[00:24:13] <larsberg> depends on the shape of the tree
[00:24:19] <larsberg> full tree, leaves are half of the nodes
[00:24:21] <pcwalton> because we have a bottom up traversal on a tree and we know the shape of the tree exactly
[00:24:28] <pcwalton> for any given document
[00:24:39] <larsberg> assuming identical work at each node?
[00:24:46] <larsberg> (this is mainly for benchmarks where you can't assume that)
[00:24:50] <pcwalton> yeah
[00:24:56] <pcwalton> pretend we have identical work at each node
[00:25:06] <pcwalton> this is basically true for my test case anyway
[00:26:16] <larsberg> you're right - this should be computable for a given tree, and hopefully without doing something dumb. But my brain isn't working after eating dinner and working on getting glx 1.2 working with XMing all day :-)
[00:26:22] <pcwalton> yeah
[00:26:36] <larsberg> I'll think about it tonight as well
[00:26:46] <pcwalton> heh, we ruin the google search results for "parallel tree traversal bottom up"
[00:26:56] <pcwalton> and Leo
[00:27:20] <pcwalton> I guess this isn't as common a problem as I thought

[02:59:26] <larsberg> cmr: pcwalton (and the rest) are trying to get rid of the madness we have with managed boxes being used by multiple tasks concurrently
[02:59:56] <jack> cmr: the idea was that whiel layout was runnign script couldn't mess with the readable dat.
[03:00:08] <jaeman> Now I am on business trip on Nanjing and am explain to them regarding to copy on write dom by using your material you used in suwon.
[03:00:09] <larsberg> we have a few places (e.g., layout/script) where we've been shared managed boxes because there was some phase-y stuff we could exploit
[03:00:33] <jack> jaeman: COW DOM works because the writes happen to a different non-overlapping part of the box
[03:01:05] <jack> the clean pointers are never written to by script while layout is running.
[03:02:09] <larsberg> jaeman: I thought you were just going to be teaching them an introduction to rust! The stuff we covered in Suwon was pretty advanced and only when you know a lot about how your data structures will be used across tasks and concurrently.

[03:05:02] <jaeman> larsberg: I agree with your opinion. :) However, they request for me to do seminar of servo architecture though I also don't know in detail and in depth. :)
[03:05:23] <larsberg> jaeman: More seriously, it comes back to what I mentioned during my short talk. If you're using unsafe pointers to shared data in Rust, you need to have some other reason (based on your program) to believe that the data is safe to access through those unsafe pointers.
[03:06:10] <larsberg> But fundamentally, unsafe pointers are unsafe. And as you may have noticed from brson and pcwalton's reactions during my talk, they would prefer that unsafe pointers only be used when there is no other option in Rust's type system. 
[03:06:51] <larsberg> (for cmr, the talk was on the backwards pointer in a doubly-linked list and on the casts in existential types)
[03:12:13] <jaeman> OK. If I summarize you comments, COW DOM is implemented as unsafe pointer Box<> which is actually not original factor of rust and is used only on servo, right? :)
[03:14:48] <jack> yes. COW DOM uses low-level unsafe primitives of rust to build a safe abstraction for the DOM

[08:32:26] <jdm> it's not pretty, but I think I have a better replacement for AbstractNode and friends
[08:32:38] <jdm> and it allows us to use JSManaged<Element> when we had to use AbstractNode before
[08:33:03] <jdm> and the type system protects us from casting things to other managed types that don't make sense
