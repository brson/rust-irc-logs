[05:12:19] <bstrie> fortunately my dad has my initials, so if he ever came in here he'd just think you were protecting his secrets
[05:12:32] <cmr> Havvy: you know, that's a good question. Given which the way pipes work in unix, I'd say we're protecting them.
[05:13:48] <c74d> bstrie: oh, I was confusing two warning signs I saw in a grocery store — a lead warning sign on a shelf of balsamic vinegar and a cancer-from-acrylamide sign on a shelf of coffee beans.

[05:15:27] <bstrie> caffeine is known to the state of california to cause cancer

[06:25:38] <XMPPwocky> so i want to install Steam, so i go and get the .deb they provide
[06:25:46] <XMPPwocky> it wants to install some 32-bit packages, I say OK
[06:25:50] <XMPPwocky> this completely borks X
[06:26:59] <c74d> XMPPwocky: wouldn't have happened were you… using NixOS. ;)
[06:27:00] <XMPPwocky> 30 minutes later, after reinstalling everything and deleting random dotfiles because i could (after re-doing Xorg.conf and uninstalling the 32-bit packages) only log in as a guest

[06:28:12] <XMPPwocky> on windows, if you screw up the windowing system, you're basically going to have to reinstall

[06:28:50] <Quxxy> I don't recall *ever* screwing it up *that* badly

[06:30:01] <Quxxy> It borked something *somewhere* and I *did* have to do a complete reinstall because I couldn't work out how to un-bork it
[06:30:07] * c74d has no intentions of using X11 in future systems.
[06:30:23] <Quxxy> So no, I *don't* accept that Windows is less resilient to misconfiguration than Linux
[06:30:32] <Quxxy> :D
[06:30:53] <XMPPwocky> i'm making the opposite argument
[06:31:08] <XMPPwocky> like, it's at least theoretically possible to unbork X in most cases
[06:31:29] <Quxxy> It's theoretically possible to fly by breathing at the ground *really hard*
[06:31:29] <XMPPwocky> now, i reinstalled those 32-bit packages without a PPA
[06:31:35] <XMPPwocky> may god have mercy on my soul
[06:31:39] <Quxxy> But I don't consider it a practical option
[06:32:54] <XMPPwocky> anyways, this sort of spooky action-at-a-distance is the worst
[06:33:21] <c74d> → NixOS ;p
[06:33:25] <XMPPwocky> have a PPA installed without multiarch? then steam will cause xorg to sigabrt

[08:43:20] <Quxxy> It's my name, and I'll say how I want to, say how I want to
[08:43:24] <Manishearth> my name as an English transliteration is Muhneesh (ish), but I don't write it that way, I write the Marathi transliteration
[08:44:32] <Quxxy> Oh, I thought your handle was just "man is hearth", a commentary on our patriarchal society
[08:44:36] <Manishearth> nah
[08:44:42] <Manishearth> everyone thinks it is, but it isn't

[08:46:10] <Quxxy> Oh yes
[08:46:15] <Manishearth> hah

[08:48:02] <Manishearth> yum
[08:48:26] <Quxxy> Though my parents *now* avoid the problem by having a pizza oven
[08:49:06] <Manishearth> I hope that you didn't just buy the oven because you were frustrated with the anachronism that is ordering pizza over the phone
[08:49:14] <Manishearth> (don't y'all have online ordering?)
[08:49:37] <Manishearth> then again, since when did one need a reason to get a pizza oven?

[10:34:41] <bluss> umm what do you mean by the tensor product?
[10:35:06] <Quxxy> That's supposed to be "arbitrary operation"
[10:35:17] <bluss> Quxxy: anything iterator related is welcome in itertools I think, that said I think your macros are significant that they can be a crate of their own if you want

[10:38:10] <Quxxy> Hmm... you have interleave, I have round_robin and round_robin_longest; it seems like interleave is equivalent to the second one
[10:38:29] <Quxxy> They're a little big, but *not* complicated
[10:39:15] <bluss> Quxxy: I think you can keep the trait summaries. I've used more pedestrian explanations though
[10:39:31] <bluss> Quxxy: everything will fit into the Itertools trait I guess
[10:39:37] <Quxxy> Mmm
[10:39:39] <Quxxy> I'm kinda torn on them
[10:39:50] <bluss> What I have done is to have the main doc on the method and have the struct link to the method's doc

[10:45:48] <Quxxy> I was just confused; at first, I thought we'd both done *exactly* the same thing, then I started wondering if I'd nicked yours
[10:45:55] <Quxxy> No, just opened the wrong file :P
[10:45:59] <bluss> hehe
[10:46:34] <Quxxy> We *did* do them differently... a little, anyway
[10:46:59] <Quxxy> Yours is simpler :P
[10:47:19] <bluss> I was hoping it couldn't be simpler
[10:47:58] <bluss> Quxxy: by the way, don't fuss over brace and where style
[10:48:16] <Quxxy> I shall conform as best I can to whatever style you're using :)
[10:48:27] <bluss> I mean I'm not totally sure in my style either
[10:48:35] <bluss> you have to experiment to find out what works best
[10:50:15] <Quxxy> How do you feel about collect! for initialising containers?
[10:50:30] <Quxxy> Which is not really about iterators... :P
[10:50:31] <bluss> I'm sceptical
[10:50:52] <bluss> I'm really in favour of small crates
[10:50:57] <bluss> and itertools is not anymore :)
[10:51:07] <Quxxy> *Focused*; in favour of *focused* crates :)
[10:51:11] <bluss> ok
[10:51:24] <bluss> you could just rename grabbag to iterators
[10:51:29] <bluss> and it would be focused
[10:51:37] <Quxxy> Ah, but it has collect! :P
[10:52:37] <bluss> Quxxy: I think it's too special case, it's not for itertools
[10:52:55] <Quxxy> A bit of a pity; I was rather pleased with how that one works, but I agree
[10:53:47] <Quxxy> sequence! can *probably* be implemented using icompr!
[10:54:37] <Quxxy> Which leaves recurrence!... which is probably going to be broken soon, anyway
[10:55:01] <Quxxy> *removes macro section of TODO*
[10:55:05] <bluss> right but that can be fixed some way or another
[10:55:25] <bluss> since the icompr work we did shows we can split on any token :)
[10:56:11] <Quxxy> So that leaves: accumulate -> fold_iter, group_by -> group_by_lazy, keep_some, pacing_walk, pad_tail, round_robin -> interleave_shortest, skip_exactly, take_exactly and sorted
[10:56:35] <bluss> sounds good. I'll look at group by lazy
[10:57:02] <bluss> Quxxy: feel free to use separate files and adding private submodules

[10:58:42] <bluss> I don't prefer to write such complex machinery when simple does it almost all of the time
[10:58:45] <Quxxy> Yeah, but coming from D, having iterators allocate for elements just made my skin crawl
[10:59:40] <bluss> replace(&mut state.push_back, None)  // <-- this is Option::take :)
[11:00:03] <bluss> Quxxy: yeah but coming from Rust everything with RefCell makes my skin crawl

[11:00:41] <Quxxy> Well, I just noticed that I don't appear to defend against re-using a sub-iterator
[11:01:06] <bluss> tag it unstable if we want to fix it up later
[11:01:25] <Quxxy> First pass will likely just be porting sure ones
[11:01:41] <Quxxy> Things that need re-design or major fixes would probably be better on their own

[11:18:04] <Quxxy> *Interesting*
[11:18:18] <Quxxy> I do like the idea
[11:19:01] <Quxxy> A few days ago, I was wishing there was some iterator that was basically "here's a value and a function; use the function to iterate the value until it returns None"
[11:19:10] <Quxxy> So kinda like a simple, inline Iterator::next
[11:19:38] <bluss> std::iter::iterate exists
[11:19:44] <bluss> but it doesn't terminate
[11:19:56] <Quxxy> Ah!
[11:20:02] <Quxxy> iterate(...).keep_some()! :D
[11:20:34] <bluss> well that'd be a hell of an optimizer trick to make that finish in finite time
[11:20:54] <bluss> but scan, unfold etc may do what you want
[11:22:04] <Quxxy> Mmm
[11:22:22] <Quxxy> 66% of the battle is even knowing what the name of the thing you want is
[11:22:57] <bluss> see that's why we need less names
[11:23:30] <Quxxy> I actually thought it would be nice to have just a big document that summarised all the available iterator transforms, equation style
[11:23:50] <bluss> sure
[11:23:55] <Quxxy> So you can quickly see *what* they're doing, rather than what they're called, which may or may not be what you know to look for
[11:23:56] <bluss> I want to include more documentation anyway
[11:24:07] <bluss> a big table is the best?
[11:24:21] <Quxxy> That might actually be a good idea, if only so I know whether these adapters are even needed :P
[11:24:41] <bluss> fusing behavior needs more docs, probably in a separate more in depth doc
[11:24:59] <Quxxy> Wasn't the decision made ages ago to just have every iterator fuse?
[11:26:45] <bluss> don't think so
[11:26:57] <bluss> there is an adaptor called .fuse()
[11:27:16] <bluss> some adaptors in itertools behave fusingly, others simply preserve input to output
[11:27:38] <bluss> i.e fused iterator, fused iterator out
[11:27:42] <bluss> *in

[11:27:54] <Quxxy> *scratches chin* I could have *sworn* I saw something about this, on the basis that an unfused iterator never made sense anyway
[11:28:10] <bluss> it's optional for performance reasons I guess
[11:28:25] <bluss> “The Iterator protocol does not define behavior after None is returned”
[11:28:47] <bluss> I have some tests for this as quickchecks too
[11:28:56] <bluss> so I found some bugs
[11:29:20] *** Joins: johnsoft (johnsoft@moz-69mrig.res.rr.com)
[11:29:20] <bluss> i.e. .coalesce() is an adaptor that acts fusingly. Any iterator in, output iterator returns None indefinitely after first None from input
[11:29:36] <Quxxy> Huhn... well, every iterator I've ever written was fused :P
[11:31:57] <bluss> there might be bugs
[11:32:11] <bluss> if you assumed every iterator you got as input was fused :)
[11:34:28] <Quxxy> Quite *possibly* :D

[16:26:03] <fmtq> haha fuck they overengineered the FUCK out of htat counter
[16:26:36] <fmtq> the website runs "inappropriately slowly" for a counter
[16:27:13] <Astrum|Lap> I dunno about overengineered, fmtq 
[16:27:21] <Astrum|Lap> for instance 73 is just... underscore
[16:27:44] <Astrum|Lap> they just included a bunch of packages rather than rolling their own stuff it seems
[16:28:01] <eddyb> build a dependency tree
[16:28:05] <eddyb> if you're bored enough
[16:28:11] <eddyb> dot syntax is not *that* hard
[16:28:13] <Astrum|Lap> it wouldn't be difficult tbh
[16:28:34] <eddyb> foo -> bar
[16:28:37] <eddyb> should be enough
[16:28:39] <fmtq> Astrum|Lap: no I am not talking about the code
[16:28:45] <fmtq> I am talking about _what it fucking does_
[16:28:45] <fmtq> lol
[16:28:53] <fmtq> at this point it would have been easier to just use <canvas>
[16:29:01] <fmtq> because the sheer level of fucked they're doing requires a modern browser for it to work anyway
[16:29:06] <eddyb> fmtq: it dynamically generates SVG for the black semicircle thing

[16:30:56] <Astrum|Lap> was about to say, you're too young to know of that place
[16:31:01] <fmtq> I fucking loved New Vegas.
[16:31:05] <fmtq> I fucking did not love Fallout 3
[16:31:10] <fmtq> all the fun was nuking a random town 
[16:31:12] <fmtq> then it was game over
[16:31:14] <fmtq> walk in a line
[16:31:26] <Mutabah> 3 was more about the environment
[16:31:29] <eddyb> fmtq: satisfiability modulo theories?
[16:31:31] <Astrum|Lap> I didn't think FO3 was that great story wise
[16:31:38] <fmtq> Mutabah: then _why did it have a game ending_ 
[16:31:39] <Astrum|Lap> or... sticking to canon
[16:31:41] <fmtq> you couldn't continue walking 
[16:31:41] <fmtq> lol
[16:31:45] <Astrum|Lap> then again I dumped 800 hours into it
[16:31:52] <Mutabah> Yeah, the storyline was lackluster, but the environment was nice
[16:32:00] <Mutabah> fmtq: With broken steel, that ending was removed
[16:32:04] <Astrum|Lap> well the environment wasn't *that* nice
[16:32:06] <fmtq> you people are literally justifying paying for a digital environment
[16:32:10] <fmtq> you have parks outside
[16:32:12] <Astrum|Lap> it was mostly just rubble
[16:32:17] <fmtq> I pay for games to do useful and interesting shit 
[16:32:17] <eddyb> fmtq: the parks are NICE
[16:32:21] <fmtq> this requires env + gameplay
[16:32:24] <Astrum|Lap> with food literring the street (somehow...)
[16:32:32] <Mutabah> Environment = The random encounters, the litle side stories, the vaults
[16:32:33] <eddyb> they are not postapocaliptic
[16:32:39] <fmtq> Mutabah: so I have to pay for a DLC to have... a game
[16:32:44] <fmtq> I see how it is
[16:32:56] <Astrum|Lap> then again FO3 did have awesome stuff like the Dunwich building
[16:32:58] <fmtq> when I get back to Australia... and replace my motherboard on my gaming PC 
[16:32:59] <Mutabah> fmtq: I never played FO3 without it
[16:33:03] <fmtq> I will get Witcher 3
[16:33:12] <fmtq> Astrum|Lap: too sparce
[16:33:13] <fmtq> like
[16:33:16] <fmtq> there was great shit
[16:33:19] <fmtq> but the world was so sparse
[16:33:25] <WindowsBunny> Because its a wasteland?
[16:33:27] <fmtq> no
[16:33:28] <Astrum|Lap> NV was pretty sparse as well tbh
[16:33:31] <fmtq> not a wasteland sparse.
[16:33:34] <WindowsBunny> NV was actually sparser
[16:33:37] <fmtq> sparse with shit you could actually _do_ 
[16:33:41] <fmtq> sparse with content
[16:33:45] <Mutabah> Yeah, NV feels sparser than 3, even if it had more places
[16:33:46] <WindowsBunny> NV had less shit per unit area
[16:33:47] <Mutabah> and more people
[16:33:49] <fmtq> NV was sparser but the environment was waaaay more engaging 
[16:33:51] <fmtq> and more shit to do 
[16:33:53] <WindowsBunny> NV just had a larger area
[16:34:00] <Astrum|Lap> I still prefer the old isometric FO2 game (FO1 was great too, but FO2 is stillt he best)
[16:34:06] <fmtq> SHUT UP EVERYONE
[16:34:09] <fmtq> FUN STORY
[16:34:14] <WindowsBunny> fmtq: OOOO
[16:34:14] <fmtq> my girlfriend blew up my computer
[16:34:15] <dfockler> At least it wasn't Oblivion boring
[16:34:15] <WindowsBunny> TELL ME A STORY
[16:34:18] <eddyb> is this bash.org again?
[16:34:21] <fmtq> and it's the best way ever
[16:34:27] <WindowsBunny> fmtq: with a dildo?
[16:34:33] <fmtq> WindowsBunny: almost
[16:34:35] <fmtq> seriously almost.
[16:34:45] <fmtq> basically her macbook charger was like "this dangling USB charging cable looks delicious!"
[16:34:47] <fmtq> and latched onto it
[16:34:48] <Astrum|Lap> I really miss the isometric RPGs from the late 90s actually =(

[16:35:12] <dfockler> hahahaahaha
[16:35:26] <fmtq> best part
[16:35:33] <fmtq> I just bought a new motherboard to replace the last one before I left for Sweden
[16:35:35] <fmtq> ... because I fried it.
[16:35:48] <Astrum|Lap> I'm rebuilding a computer slowly right now
[16:35:50] <Astrum|Lap> mini-itx
[16:35:52] <Astrum|Lap> super fun
[16:35:52] <fmtq> MINI?
[16:35:53] <fmtq> HAHA
[16:35:54] <fmtq> HAHAHA
[16:35:57] <fmtq> you wasted your money son
[16:36:05] <Astrum|Lap> I wanted a smaller computer tbh
[16:36:07] <fmtq> mini-itx is the worst of all the itxs
[16:36:09] <fmtq> yeah
[16:36:18] <fmtq> micro is where it's at unfortunately
[16:36:25] <fmtq> weirdly mini being smaller
[16:36:26] <fmtq> than micro 
[16:36:26] <Astrum|Lap> no, mini-dtx is where it's at
[16:36:29] <Astrum|Lap> but nobody makes it
[16:36:30] <fmtq> mini DTX?
[16:36:33] <fmtq> _DTX_
[16:36:37] <fmtq> i think you have an obscurity fetish bud
[16:36:38] <Astrum|Lap> it has another PCIe slot
[16:37:10] <Astrum|Lap> micro is too big, mini is too small
[16:37:15] <eddyb> good luck fitting a PSU capable of doing SLI :P
[16:37:25] <Astrum|Lap> erm...
[16:37:31] <Astrum|Lap> silverstone makes a 600w SFX PSU
[16:37:39] <fmtq> 600W is never enough
[16:37:39] * eddyb squints eyes
[16:37:47] <fmtq> mostly because PSUs don't stay at their rated wattage for long
[16:37:51] <fmtq> which is why I fried my last mobo
[16:37:54] <fmtq> when I was like HAHAHA OCTOCORE
[16:37:58] <fmtq> AHAHAHAHA NEW AMD GRAPHICS CARD
[16:38:01] <fmtq> HAHAH 500W DO IT
[16:38:12] <fmtq> and then this smell of burning
[16:38:16] <fmtq> and then nothing is working
[16:38:29] <eddyb> Astrum|Lap: shessh, that thing
[16:38:41] <Astrum|Lap> well my mini-itx case actuall has a regular PSU bracket
[16:38:50] <Astrum|Lap> so I can go up to the full crazy 1200W or whatever
[16:38:59] <Astrum|Lap> but it blocks off other things
[16:39:14] <eddyb> fkaa_: no touchy
[16:39:20] <Astrum|Lap> eddyb: since I'm going mini-itx I obviously can only do one GPU, so... 600W will be plenty
[16:39:27] <fmtq> but why 
[16:39:28] <Astrum|Lap> although I'll also be putting my xonar essence stx in there
[16:39:33] <fmtq> I mean literally
[16:39:34] <Astrum|Lap> connected to the mini-PCIe slot
[16:39:35] <fmtq> beyond form factor
[16:39:38] <fmtq> is there a reason for the form factor
[16:39:54] <Astrum|Lap> the reason is because I wanted a small, portable gaming PC
[16:39:55] <fmtq> I would have got an ATX one but I wanted to stop myself from adding too much shit to the motherboard
[16:39:58] <Astrum|Lap> that's all
[16:39:59] <WindowsBunny> eddyb: pls, find out how to get to announcement api
[16:40:06] <fmtq> Astrum|Lap: why portable
[16:40:08] <fmtq> lan parties and shit?
[16:40:21] <fmtq> portability wasn't a requirement for me so :DDD
[16:40:23] <fmtq> silence was
[16:40:27] <fmtq> so Antec P500 
[16:40:34] <Astrum|Lap> well, not lan parties per say
[16:40:36] <eddyb> WindowsBunny: I think it's just not there
[16:40:42] <Astrum|Lap> more like gatherings of friends at his house
[16:40:44] <fmtq> per se 
[16:40:48] <fmtq> you mean per se
[16:40:57] <Astrum|Lap> also I tend to move at least once per year

[16:41:49] <Astrum|Lap> the case I got (yeah, expensive)
[16:41:55] <Astrum|Lap> but, I still think it'll be a fun build
[16:41:58] <eddyb> "The original crowdfunded computer case"
[16:42:09] <fmtq> ooh you could put a baby in there
[16:42:10] <fmtq> baby cage
[16:42:28] <Astrum|Lap> eddyb: it was two guys from the [H] forums basically
[16:42:33] <Astrum|Lap> I guess Lian-Li helped out with construction
[16:42:42] <Astrum|Lap> and prototyping
[16:42:46] <fmtq> 185 USD isn't too expensive
[16:42:48] <fmtq> if the build isn't shit
[16:42:54] <fmtq> yes, most people won't pay shit for the case.
[16:43:05] <fmtq> one of my friends found out that a good case stops your shit from shorting out every time you open it
[16:43:18] <Astrum|Lap> well, a normal ATX tower made fo aluminium can go for around that
[16:43:37] <fmtq> yes
[16:43:38] <fmtq> normal.
[16:43:40] <fmtq> mass produced.
[16:43:45] <Astrum|Lap> yaeh
[16:43:50] <fmtq> this is a bit more niche
[16:43:50] <Astrum|Lap> in either case, the case is pretty awesome
[16:43:52] <fmtq> it is
[16:43:55] <fmtq> I agree with your choice.
[16:43:57] <fmtq> when I was into mini-itx
[16:43:59] <fmtq> I had nothing
[16:44:04] <fmtq> it lived in a cardboard box
[16:44:08] <Astrum|Lap> lol
[16:44:12] <fmtq> the box DID go on fire

[16:45:08] <Astrum|Lap> oh, and the clips on that things are brilliant
[16:45:14] <Astrum|Lap> so much better than thumb screws
[16:45:30] <fmtq> why isnt' USB isolated from the rest of the motherboard
[16:45:36] <fmtq> just, in general 
[16:45:44] <fmtq> why is it possible for my girlfriend to fuck up the entire computer by frying my usb
[16:46:01] <dfockler> ELECTRICITY!!!
[16:46:02] <fmtq> anything with external entry points should be GUARDED FROM OVERVOLTAGE
[16:46:03] <Astrum|Lap> could be worse

[16:46:18] <fmtq> how is that worse?!
[16:46:23] <fmtq> I COULD JUST CHANGE THE FUSE

[16:54:51] <Tobba> how the fuck do you kill a board through undervolting
[16:54:55] <fmtq> it has never blown up ANYTHING other than the motherboard.
[16:55:22] <Tobba> and where do you live where thunder to the power lines is still a problem
[16:55:25] <fmtq> Tobba: oh, I was playing around there 
[16:55:34] <Tobba> or to the phone lines for that matter
[16:55:36] <fmtq> I mean that there was a surge
[16:55:39] <fmtq> there was a lot of volts.
[16:55:41] <fmtq> then no volts.
[16:55:43] <Tobba> (boards fried through the ethernet port tend to be fixable)

[20:54:55] <Tiffany> I suppose a lot of personal computers in the 80s had text-mode displays with strictly 80-character-wide screens

[20:58:01] <Tiffany> quite large ones
[20:58:17] <Astrum|Lap> erm...
[20:58:19] <Astrum|Lap> well that doesn't help
[20:58:24] <Tiffany> I'm not sure if the patents on mp3 have expired yet
[20:58:30] <Tiffany> it's so pervasive it seems as if they did
[20:58:43] <Astrum|Lap> the actual purpose is just a notification alert (a little ding)
[20:58:48] <Astrum|Lap> so... no?
[20:58:51] <Astrum|Lap> I'm going with no
[20:58:55] <Tiffany> astrum: this is also why not that many games have gameplay recording built in
[20:58:59] <Tiffany> because H.264 is patented to hell
[20:59:07] <Astrum|Lap> I don't understand patents
[20:59:30] <Astrum|Lap> lawyers: the gatekeeps of technology =P
[20:59:36] <Tiffany> a patent is a grant from the government which gives you exclusive use of an implementation of a machine for 20 years
[20:59:46] <Astrum|Lap> I understand that much about patents

[21:00:06] <Tiffany> their application to software is dubious, iirc has been phased out in europe, and leads to much heartache
[21:00:33] <Tiffany> for example, shadow volumes are patented by creative labs
[21:00:44] <Tiffany> creative labs is an audio hardware company, not related in any way to computer graphics
[21:00:50] <Tiffany> they only hold the patent so they can sue anyone who uses it
[21:00:59] <Tiffany> and get lots of money
[21:01:04] <Tiffany> which actually worked out well for them
[21:01:05] <Astrum|Lap> ugh, creative labs is such a horrible company
[21:01:06] <Sho> patents are almost always much more specific than "shadow volumes"
[21:01:12] <Sho> (and it is in this case, too)
[21:01:24] <Tiffany> because john carmack independently developed the technique, and used it in doom 3
[21:01:26] <Astrum|Lap> A3D died because of them =(
[21:01:28] <Tiffany> id got sued and lost
[21:01:35] <Tiffany> well yeah sho
[21:01:42] <Tiffany> I should have been more specific
[21:01:46] <Tiffany> shadow volumes themselves are not patented
[21:01:48] <Astrum|Lap> err... Aureal
[21:01:50] <Tiffany> only depth-fail shadow volumes
[21:01:58] <Tiffany> of course, shadow volumes are utterly worthless without using depth-fail
[21:02:03] <Tiffany> all of the other methods have ridiculous artifacts
[21:02:15] <Tiffany> like inverting shaded/unshaded when you are inside of a shadowed area
[21:02:21] <dfockler> so is .NET a language or a framework, I don't know!
[21:02:23] <Tiffany> which you have to correct using special cases which hurt performance
[21:02:35] <cmr> dfockler: It's a "platform."
[21:02:39] <cmr> It has lots of pieces.
[21:02:49] <Astrum|Lap> ^
[21:02:51] <cmr> Speaking of .NET as a whole is almost meaningless.
[21:02:59] <cmr> in terms of how wide the scope is.
[21:03:24] <dfockler> Dang I'm glad I work on Linux

[21:05:37] <Tiffany> .NET is not a language
[21:05:41] <Tiffany> C# is a language
[21:05:58] <dfockler> C# runs on CLR right?
[21:05:59] <fkaa> net.net
[21:06:00] <Tiffany> C# compiles to CIL, a bytecode which runs on the CLR
[21:06:05] <Tiffany> all of which are components of .NET
[21:06:07] <dfockler> ah like Java
[21:06:12] <Tiffany> the .NET framework is also part of .NET
[21:06:20] <cmr> dfockler: ah like Python
[21:06:21] <cmr> :P
[21:06:21] <Tiffany> the .NET framework is the huge standard library
[21:06:48] <Tiffany> all of these things have been ratified as ECMA standards
[21:06:54] <Tiffany> however, not all of them
[21:07:05] <Tiffany> some parts are specific to windows, and mono doesn't implement them very well as a result
[21:07:16] <cmr> Tiffany: nah that's the BCL (Base Class Library) among other stuff.
[21:07:20] <Tiffany> oh
[21:07:25] <cmr> The .NET Framework is All The Things.
[21:07:41] * dfockler throws hands in the air, like I just don't care
[21:07:54] <fkaa> isn't ECMA javascript`
[21:07:55] <fkaa> ?
[21:08:01] <cmr> no
[21:08:04] <cmr> ECMA is a standards bodie
[21:08:07] <cmr> body*
[21:08:09] <Tiffany> ECMA is a standards organization which happens to be responsible for the ECMAscript standard
[21:08:11] <Tiffany> also known as javascript
[21:08:17] <fkaa> ah
[21:08:38] <fkaa> anyone seen the new js? looks messy
[21:08:40] <Tiffany> the reason they have the ECMAscript name is because JavaScript is a trademark
[21:08:43] <Astrum|Lap> come on, aren't these strange letter combinations self-apparent?! =P
[21:09:15] <Tiffany> apparently the trademark is owned by Oracle

[21:09:39] <dfockler> and have it run on windows?
[21:09:44] <Tiffany> and on mono
[21:09:47] <cmr> Yes, and everywhere else there is a CLR implementation
[21:09:53] <cmr> which is just about everywhere pretty soon, with CoreCLR.
[21:09:56] <Sho> dfockler: There are implementations of Python, Ruby and many other languages for that runtime

[21:22:58] <eddyb> and it behaved weirdly after xkill
[21:23:02] <Tiffany> I don't suggest having more than 5 tabs open at a time in chrome
[21:23:04] <eddyb> usually I can just xkill and start it again
[21:23:08] <eddyb> Tiffany: why?
[21:23:15] <Tiffany> its memory usage goes up very quickly
[21:23:17] <eddyb> it can handle hundreds
[21:23:30] <Tiffany> you must have 16GB of memory
[21:23:30] <eddyb> Tiffany: that's why they're in separate processes
[21:23:44] <Tiffany> they're in separate processes for sandboxing reasons
[21:23:46] <eddyb> so you can kill them
[21:23:56] <Tiffany> using separate processes means you have almost strictly worse memory usage characteristics
[21:24:13] <eddyb> you think I'd keep hundreds of *live* tabs? :P
