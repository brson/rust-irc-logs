[02:34:39] *** Quits: swgillespie (swgillespie@moz-ndaueh.ip.windstream.net) (Quit: My MacBook Pro has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[02:35:02] <kristof> aatch: For instance, you don't need to represent your entire program as nested lists just to have macro power. Look at rust! Typed macros, who would have thought?
[02:35:19] <kristof> In fact macros are about my 7th favorite thing about Lisp
[02:35:51] <aatch> kristof, we did steal the idea from Scheme though.
[02:36:05] <Elaine> Well, we stole the algorithm from scheme
[02:36:07] <kristof> the hygienic stuff, yeah, but it gets better in rust
[02:36:16] <kristof> for instance, you cannot match a type signature in Scheme.
[02:36:49] <kristof> If Lisp macros are the hammer of metaprogramming, Scheme's macros are just a really clean hammer
[02:36:50] <aatch> kristof, I'd say that's the lack of syntax in Lisp + dialects.
[02:37:49] <kristof> aatch: I disagree! Even with a lack of concrete syntax, any lisp compiler will still expect certain kinds of lists in certain places.
[02:38:06] <kristof> But all those lists are just "lists", and carry no type information with them
[02:38:34] <kristof> aatch: Anyway, I think if people knew about Common Lisp even as late as the 90s, it could have taken over the world wide web as the dominant web engineering technology.
[02:38:50] <kristof> And it rightfully should have over Ruby, Python, and Javascript, but that is just my zealotry speaking
[02:40:13] <aatch> kristof, my personal pet-peeve regarding Lisp is people saying it's a functional programming language. I mean, sure you can use it as such, and dialects like Scheme go much further in supporting that style, but Common Lisp itself isn't inherently functional.
[02:41:01] <kristof> I absolutely agree. I think there are a lot of people who point to any language with function pointers, closures, and maybe a map function and then go "Look! Functional language!"
[02:41:24] <kristof> That is about as far as Lisp ever got when it came to functional programming
[02:42:14] <kristof> Clojure goes much further by explicitly stating its goal to be a functional language. And then it made its base datatypes persistent. And then it added concurrency features out-of-the-box. And immutability a la carte, no hassle. That's functional.
[02:43:59] <kristof> I cannot even begin to explain why I like Common Lisp, though. Everything from exception handling that doesn't unwind the stack, to access to GOTOs, to multiple dispatch on object types, to the entire engineering effort that went into the language

[02:48:37] <kristof> zofrex: Are you familiar with dynamic scoping?
[02:48:47] <aatch> zofrex, "exception handling" might be the wrong description. It's a pretty cool general error-handling mechanism.
[02:49:05] *** Joins: sbeckeriv (becker@moz-brlqn9.tukw.qwest.net)
[02:49:20] <aatch> We actually used to have something similiar in Rust, but it didn't really fit very well.
[02:49:43] <zofrex> kristof: I think I might be.... not sure though
[02:49:49] <kristof> zofrex: Anywhere along the call stack, you can bind handlers for the rest of the computation. When an exception gets thrown, without unwinding the call stack, the runtime runs through all the established handlers from most recent onward until it finds a handler that can handle that kind of exception (or condition, which is more general)
[02:50:13] <zofrex> ah ok
[02:50:23] <aatch> Conditions! That's what they're called.
[02:50:59] <kristof> zofrex: When a handler is called that works, it can supply a value or jump somewhere or do something, but you certainly have the option of merely resuming the program
[02:52:02] <aatch> That's the cool part of it, higher parts of the program can make decisions in-place when errors occur lower-down.
[02:52:10] <kristof> and you get the benefit of being able to "restart" the computation anywhere from between the handler and the exceptional condition being thrown
[02:52:14] <zofrex> kristof: that sounds simultaneously great and dangerous
[02:52:30] <kristof> It's both! ++ to aatch as well
[02:52:38] <zofrex> I can imagine some seriously hard to trace code execution coming out of using that
[02:52:43] <aatch> zofrex, well, not so much dangerous as complex.
[02:53:02] <kristof> Dangerous? Don't you mean honest?

[02:54:06] <aatch> zofrex, I guess it could be dangerous to your health.
[02:54:40] <zofrex> the closest thing to dynamic scope I've used is "upvar" and "uplevel" which are confusing enough for me
[02:55:18] <kristof> That sounds like the reverse direction of where dynamic scope is usually supposed to go
[02:55:19] <aatch> zofrex, in reality, you tend to just pick from a limited set of options. The condition is raised, then the handler decides what the code should do next.
[02:56:05] <kristof> aatch: I have been using more functional languages so often that I've forgotten actual situations where I wouldn't just rather use a Result type or something similar
[02:56:06] <aatch> zofrex, so a file parser might raise a condition on a malformed block, and the handler can tell it to skip that block.

[03:02:00] *** ChanServ sets mode: +o brson
[03:02:22] <kristof> aatch: So the problem with monads is that the typically way to compose them is to make monad transformers, which are giant stacks of monads
[03:02:45] <kristof> so your computational realm might look something like [IO [Maybe [pure functions here ] ]
[03:03:35] <kristof> But that's really bad because it imposes an ordering on monads. When you want to access the outer one from the inside or the inner part from the outside, that's as many pointer dereferences as there are monads, per bind.
[03:03:56] <kristof> And the syntax gets ugly. You see people lifting their functions three times just to get things done
[03:04:35] <kristof> aatch: So the idea behind algebraic effects was that you could live in one giant monad which contained a set of all things that could possibly happen.
[03:04:53] <kristof> monadically speaking. Bam! No order, just a set.
[03:05:03] <FreeFull> But Rust's implementations of Option and Result, etc. don't involve pointeres
[03:05:06] <FreeFull> pointers*
[03:05:29] <kristof> FreeFull: They don't? Do they shift some bits somewhere?
[03:05:45] <Elaine> kristof: by-value embeddings, we don't have a uniform representation requirement.
[03:05:45] <aatch> kristof, depends on the contents of the types.
[03:05:59] <kristof> Weeeeird.
[03:06:22] <Elaine> Not weird at all, when you consider the space rust is in...
[03:06:28] <aatch> But yeah, no uniform representation requirement means we can avoid some indirection.
[03:06:37] <kristof> Someone should write a blog post about that. Besides actual books on compilers, I don't think enough people (myself included) know what exactly is represented in memory.
[03:06:44] <aatch> Well, most indirection, actually.
[03:06:55] <FreeFull> In Haskell everything is boxed by default, in Rust everything is unboxed unless explicitly boxed
[03:07:16] <Elaine> kristof: plenty of people know, they're called systems programmers ;)
[03:07:25] <Elaine> any book on C, C++, etc will have this...
[03:07:41] <aatch> I think you can opt-out of boxing for some types in Haskell though, that's what the `!` thing is, right?
[03:08:09] <kristof> Elaine: C data representation is about as simple as you can get
[03:08:53] <kristof> Substitute some fixed sizes in memory, add padding per the cpu, oh-and-there-are-pointers
[03:08:56] <FreeFull> aatch: Yes
[03:08:57] <Elaine> Rust's data representation is approximately the same as C's, it's a straightforward translation
[03:09:02] <kristof> Okay. That's good.
[03:09:17] <FreeFull> aatch: Which due to Haskell's laziness has some important semantic implications
[03:09:21] <Elaine> (for the most part, some optimizations pack bits where you might not expect naively, but the rules are simple)
[03:09:21] <kristof> Well, hold on, how does Option<f32> look?
[03:09:24] <eddyb> you have enums vs unions, but it's still flat
[03:09:28] <kristof> Is it secretly Option<f31>?
[03:09:32] <eddyb> kristof: (bool, f32)
[03:09:49] <FreeFull> It'll be padded out to be 8 bytes
[03:09:56] <aatch> kristof, however, `Option<Box<T>>` is *mut T
[03:10:09] <FreeFull> playbot: std::mem::size_of::<Option<f32>>()
[03:10:10] -playbot- 8
[03:10:11] <aatch> kristof, same with other non-nullable pointer types.
[03:10:18] <FreeFull> playbot: std::mem::size_of::<Option<Box<f32>>>()
[03:10:19] -playbot- 8
[03:10:27] <kristof> Oh, that makes a lot of sense
[03:10:33] <FreeFull> playbot: std::mem::size_of::<Box<f32>>()
[03:10:34] -playbot- 8
[03:10:35] <eddyb> should use f64 for comparison
[03:10:40] <eddyb> since playbot is x64
[03:10:46] <FreeFull> What's happening with Box<T> is that there is an optimisation
[03:11:17] <eddyb> Option<NonZero<u32>> is 4 bytes, too :D
[03:11:22] <FreeFull> Where the None case is represented by all 0s
[03:11:24] <aatch> What's actually cool is that optimisation does a recursive search for a non-zero value.
[03:11:39] <eddyb> (props to Luqman for doing that)
[03:11:50] <FreeFull> playbot: struct Foo { x: Box<f32> } std::mem::size_of::<Foo>()
[03:11:51] -playbot- 8
[03:12:04] <kristof> Ok. I was expecting fancier stuff.
[03:12:20] <kristof> Mostly because I've heard of interesting things like storing the type of an object in its address.
[03:12:56] <eddyb> kristof: some GC language do use bits in pointers to store data
[03:13:04] <aatch> And given that `Vec`'s pointer is marked as non-zero it's surprisingly common how frequently wrapping something in an Option incurs no memory-penalty.
[03:13:24] <kristof> aatch: Oh, that's clever.
[03:13:37] <eddyb> an empty Vec uses 0x1 for its pointer
[03:13:55] <FreeFull> I don't think Option<Option<Foo>> optimises even if there is a second NonZero thing, does it?
[03:13:57] <kristof> eddyb: See, that's what I mean. Show me a C program and I'll know what's going on in the stack and heap, sans allocation strategy. Show me a Haskell program, and I'll just shrug my shoulders.
[03:14:01] <eddyb> (technically, it could use any value other than 0)
[03:14:08] <aatch> FreeFull, nope.
[03:14:19] <kristof> Or any kind of persistent data structure
[03:14:27] <FreeFull> It's good that Rust is keeping the representation undefined
[03:14:32] <eddyb> kristof: Haskell has no stack (STM something something) and then some bits in pointers are used to specify some laziness thing

[04:16:23] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: Can you separate definitions by the file they were defined in, and maintain the order from the headers?
[04:17:10] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: Also, any struct tagBLAH, should really just be BLAH directly

[04:24:57] <Quxxy> Maintaining order... I suppose I can add an index counter to the output so it can be sorted
[04:25:26] <Quxxy> As for the tagBLAH things; that's because they're *defined* with that name, but then typedef'ed to their "proper" name
[04:26:27] <Quxxy> I suppose that in Rust, the distinction *is* kinda important :P

[04:41:27] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: The distinction between tagBLAH and BLAH really applies to C where you can define a struct but it won't be injected into the global namespace unless you typedef it
[04:41:37] *** Joins: yjv (yjv@moz-ll38tk.pa.comcast.net)
[04:41:44] <WindowsBunny> in Rust I'd rather not see those tag things :D
[04:41:55] <WindowsBunny> Especially since Microsoft doesn't document tagBLAH, only BLAH
[04:42:05] <Quxxy> WindowsBunny: Right; but I'm just pointing out that it's not like that arbitrary; that's literally what Clang is telling me :P
[04:42:20] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: And you need a heuristic to detect that :D
[04:42:22] <Quxxy> I don't know any way to go from tagBLAH to the BLAH typedef
[04:42:51] <Quxxy> So I can either add another pass that works all this out *or* I can just use some regexes and hack around it

[05:33:32] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: Make sure you use my RIDL! BITFIELD! and UNION! macros :D
[05:34:09] <Quxxy> Manual intervention is a bug in the process
[05:34:28] <Quxxy> Actually, since I have what amounts to a code generator, you might want to think about what you want it to do
[05:34:48] <Quxxy> I mean, I could just output the union code directly, rather than having an extra processing step
[05:35:38] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: I'd rather have it use UNION!
[05:35:44] <WindowsBunny> Because it's easier to read and check

[05:38:27] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: Unless you have some magically better way to handle unions than everyone else?
[05:39:03] <Quxxy> What I mean is just emitting what UNION would output directly, rather than having to go through a second expansion pass later on

[10:16:40] <aatch> XMPPwocky, see, I'm always really paranoid about stuff like buffer overflows and the like. I basically assume that all data I read from the outside world is potentially wrong.

[10:17:40] <XMPPwocky> look at studio.h... look at its methods...

[10:21:31] <Quxxy> If you connect a Microsoft account to Windows, they give you the option to sign in with a PIN instead of the actual account password
[10:21:49] <Quxxy> But you can't use a local *password*; you have to use numbers
[10:21:54] <XMPPwocky> Quxxy: ... but why
[10:22:12] <eddyb> math exam was pretty easy
[10:22:18] <Quxxy> Because it's easier to tap on a numpad on tiny, tiny screens
[10:22:20] <aatch> XMPPwocky, is that pointer casting `this` to a byte pointer and then to another struct pointer?
[10:22:24] <Quxxy> eddyb: Yay! :)
[10:22:40] <eddyb> I mean, I'm not terrible, but there's a lot of stuff I don't know very well
[10:22:45] <eddyb> and none of it ended up in the exam
[10:23:49] <XMPPwocky> aatch: yep!
[10:26:40] <aatch> XMPPwocky, ok, so as far as I can tell, rather than storing, you know, a pointer to the the hitbox set (this is just what I've zeroed in on), they decided to store it at as an offset in n*sizeof(studiohdr_t) from the beginning of the header?
[10:27:19] <XMPPwocky> aatch: you see, if they stored a pointer
[10:27:29] <XMPPwocky> they couldn't read the struct in directly from a file 
[10:27:33] <XMPPwocky> (like they do)
[10:29:23] <eddyb> aatch: mmmm mmap magic
[10:29:23] <aatch> XMPPwocky, but that implies that they don't do anything like check the data for any kind of sanity! It also means that the file format and the type definition are tightly coupled.
[10:29:36] <XMPPwocky> yep!
[10:29:46] <XMPPwocky> aaand this runs on totally untrusted data
[10:30:10] <eddyb> I need to start work on my zero-copy framework for reading arbitrary binary file layouts
[10:30:33] <eddyb> especially ones with relative and absolute positions embedded in otherwise linear streams
[10:30:41] <eddyb> like what you are describing :P
[10:31:01] <XMPPwocky> aatch: but don't worry, when they ran out of space (not sure how you run out of space in a struct, but...)
[10:31:11] <eddyb> (I just want it for executable file formats though)
[10:31:29] <XMPPwocky> aatch: they came up with a clever solution!
[10:31:29] <XMPPwocky> https://github.com/ValveSoftware/source-sdk-2013/blob/master/sp/src/public/studio.h#L2022
[10:31:53] <XMPPwocky> i guess it's supposed to be a fixed size header
[10:32:16] <XMPPwocky> why everything is stored as offsets into the rest of the file... is a mystery.
[10:33:38] <aatch> I mean, I get wanting to be able to quickly read data from a file. And reading data directly into a struct isn't inherently bad.
[10:33:58] <eddyb> well, reading data is bad
[10:34:01] <eddyb> mmap pls
[10:35:07] <XMPPwocky> aatch: except if they weren't using offsets, and raw pointers instead (after pre-processing at loadtime)
[10:35:23] <XMPPwocky> it'd be marginally faster (no addition on every lookup)
[10:35:37] <aatch> XMPPwocky, true.
[10:40:06] <mrmonday> WindowsBunny: I figured something like that was happening, makes sense :)
[10:41:16] <aatch> XMPPwocky, there's hacks to eke out performance, and then there's this.
[10:41:37] <aatch> XMPPwocky, and since it's file-reading code, performance already has a pretty low ceiling!
[10:43:32] <XMPPwocky> welllll
[10:43:44] <XMPPwocky> this is actually used at runtime and rendering

[10:44:09] <aatch> XMPPwocky, yeah, but I assume it isn't reading the file every frame.
[10:44:21] <XMPPwocky> that's why CStudioHdr exists, with a mutex and such
[10:44:32] *** Joins: johnsoft (johnsoft@moz-69mrig.res.rr.com)
[10:45:13] <XMPPwocky> aatch: no, but all accesses to bones go through it, iirc
[10:46:11] <aatch> XMPPwocky, I mean, the reason for this being the way it is is to make it easier to "parse", but 1) parsing only happens once and 2) as you said, there's actually faster ways to represent the data at runtim.
[10:46:25] <XMPPwocky> ah, i see, yeah
[10:51:46] <aatch> I think Rust has made me hyper-aware of things like this. One of the first things I thought when you mentioned that they read straight into the struct was "what about endianess?"
[10:52:58] <XMPPwocky> only Source 2 supports 64-bit platforms
[10:53:21] <XMPPwocky> probably because easily 80% of the numbers are stored as "int", including in file formats

[22:48:35] <ChrisMorgan> The HN “who is hiring” list at https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9812245 is up to one mention of Rust (https://accelerated.com/ saying Rust is a part of their tech stack).

[23:00:42] <FreeFull> Imgur is over capacity a lot nowadays
[23:00:50] <eddyb> does imgur let you link to individu- oh yeah

[23:04:14] <eddyb> I can't find whether it was posted to reddit though :/
[23:04:57] <eddyb> fmtq: this is an (alternate) group for my highschool https://www.facebook.com/groups/417635168259374/
[23:05:15] <fmtq> eddyb: I don't care, jesus
[23:05:23] <fmtq> why are you doing this
[23:05:24] <fmtq> lol
[23:05:29] <eddyb> look at it
[23:05:31] <eddyb> glorious rehttps://www.facebook.com/groups/417635168259374/d
[23:05:33] <eddyb> red
[23:05:35] <eddyb> ffs
[23:05:42] <fmtq> I don't Facebook links
[23:05:44] <eddyb> why does linux do this stupid middle click thing
[23:05:54] <eddyb> it's worse with a touchpad
[23:06:08] <eddyb> and it's not even Ctrl+V, it's whatever was last selected

[23:06:55] <eddyb> well, there's the selection and the actual clipboard

[23:18:39] <eddyb> found it! NSFW http://www.reddit.com/r/GWNerdy/comments/3bds8z/my_diy_underlit_skirt/
[23:20:12] <Tiffany> this sounds like a bad idea
[23:21:14] <Tiffany> I'm guessing the inspiration was how people will put lights under their cars?
[23:21:15] <eddyb> had to go through a forum called "theperfectboobs" to do that, not sure why that subreddit wasn't indexed anywhere (that I could find)
[23:21:17] <Tiffany> and that does look kind of cool
[23:21:22] <eddyb> Tiffany: idk
[23:21:38] <Tiffany> lights elsewhere might look cool
[23:21:43] <edunham> whatever the goal of that project was, it seems to be accomplishing it admirably
[23:21:58] <Tiffany> it would be really awesome to glow cherenkov radiation without dying
[23:22:08] <Tiffany> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherenkov_radiation
[23:22:18] <Tobba> it looks cool but that picture just reminds me of the time they put booth babes at blackhat
[23:23:15] <eddyb> Tiffany: oh wow you could do lich king style stuff with that
[23:23:24] <Tiffany> lich king style stuff?
[23:23:25] <Tobba> also the battery pack looks kinda stupid
[23:23:29] <Tiffany> I didn't know lich kings glowed blue
[23:23:48] <eddyb> ehm https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCr7y4SLhck
[23:23:52] <Tiffany> anyway, I'm thinking of foundation (book)
[23:23:54] * eddyb watches again
[23:24:06] <eddyb> Tiffany: not Asimov?
[23:24:19] <Tiffany> it is written by asimov
[23:24:33] <Tiffany> there are people with glowy auras in that
[23:24:38] <Tiffany> and in one case, deadly glowy auras
[23:25:17] <eddyb> did that get lost in translation?! or maybe I forgot it
[23:25:23] <Tiffany> you might have forgotten
[23:25:38] <Tiffany> in particular, the king of one of the four kingdoms had an aura
[23:25:42] <eddyb> but look at frostmourne activating
[23:25:47] <Tiffany> and if you got near it, you'd die immediately from radiation burns
[23:25:55] <Tiffany> glowy eyes
[23:26:39] <Tiffany> these world of warcraft trailers are kind of annoying
[23:26:44] <Tiffany> the actual game doesn't look like that
[23:27:05] <Tiffany> oh okay
[23:27:20] <Tiffany> so when he brings things from the dead they have glowy blue life force
[23:27:24] <eddyb> I can't wait for the movie. hopefully it's good
[23:27:28] <eddyb> Tiffany: yeah, that part
[23:28:38] <Tiffany> I wonder if there's any other phenomena like cherenkov radiation which has the same aura
[23:29:29] <eddyb> somewhat NSFW https://theperfectboobs.net/index.php?topic=29603.msg271860#msg271860
[23:31:27] <Tiffany> I think the domain name of that website made it pretty clear
[23:32:14] <fmtq> oh god 
[23:32:34] <fmtq> is this how low the conversation has become around here now?
[23:32:39] <fmtq> >_>
[23:33:10] <Tiffany> what fmtq?
[23:33:17] <eddyb> fmtq: I saw this, thought it was cool, and wanted to find the original http://9gag.com/gag/aojj5AX
[23:33:26] <eddyb> because, you know, 9gag
[23:43:55] <eddyb> Tiffany: hmm, nitrogen can emit "blue or red; blue if the atom regains an electron after it has been ionized, red if returning to ground state from an excited state"
[23:44:14] <eddyb> from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora
[23:45:50] <eddyb> also some blue here, but it's not even close to a halo https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioluminescence
[23:46:48] <Tiffany> it doesn't have to be blue exactly
[23:48:50] <eddyb> http://www.sciencealert.com/cuba-has-just-eliminated-hiv-transmission-between-mother-and-baby
[23:49:42] <eddyb> I guess there are advantages when you have quarantine-like control over your population
[23:59:06] <WindowsBunny> sup peeps
[23:59:11] <WindowsBunny> how is everyone pretending to do today?
[23:59:42] <eddyb> happy, joyful, excited
