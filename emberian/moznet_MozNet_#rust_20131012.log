[00:15:28] <earlz> yea, true... but I mean some languages like Java or C# have strived to ensure that if it compiles for 1.0 it'll compile for 2.0 of the language and so forth.. I personally don't see it as being good or bad, it can harm the advancement of a langauge though
[00:15:52] <Sorella> earlz: it's just that languages evolve slowly, but they keep evolving regardless. Unless people stop having an interest on them :)
[00:16:26] <tjc_> earlz: It's a complicated question with lots of trade-offs. For Rust, we've decided that if it compiles with the 1.0 version of the language and compiler, it will always compile with any newer versions.
[00:16:32] <earlz> Well, Rust is looking like my dream language so far, so I hope that never happens :) 
[00:16:38] <tjc_> That's a separate issue from library stability, by the way, I'm just talking about the language spec.
[00:16:53] <earlz> yea of course
[00:17:32] <tjc_> also, disclaimer: this doesn't apply to code that might be exploiting bugs in the compiler, only to code that has a well-defined meaning according to the language spec
[00:17:47] <earlz> undefined behavior will always be undefined of course

[00:18:17] <sfackler> do you have a module called std?
[00:18:27] <ercxx__> nope
[00:19:06] <tjc_> strcat: But, there might be undefined behavior in the safe subset that's due to a bug in either the language spec or the implementation
[00:19:20] <tjc_> since the language spec isn't complete (and without that, the implementation can't be formally verified against it)
[00:19:41] <tjc_> tl;dr is that we're not promising to maintain bug-for-bug compatbility between 1.0 and future releases :-)
[00:19:45] <strcat> tjc_: it's still not really UB in the C sense
[00:19:49] <nejucomo> Does rust 1.0 backwards compatibility apply to both compilation output as well as source/semantic compatability?
[00:19:50] <strcat> UB is explicitly specified
[00:20:01] <tjc_> strcat: Ah, ok. Sure, in that sense, then yes
[00:20:03] <nejucomo> Can I compile crate A with 1.0 and link it into crate B using 1.1?
[00:20:21] <earlz> yay there is a rust-git package in the Arch Linux AUR.. looks like quite a bit of support on Arch with some other rust libraries too :) 
[00:20:27] <tjc_> nejucomo: See https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/3392
[00:20:31] <strcat> "doing X is undefined behaviour" in the C sense means that they decided doing X doesn't count as valid C, but didn't provide a mechanism to prevent it at compile-time
[00:20:38] <nejucomo> tjc: Thanks.
[00:20:46] <tjc_> well, #3392 is about source-level versioning, but I think we have always intended to have binary-level versioning too
[00:20:56] <cmr> earlz: you want to use strcat's repo.
[00:20:57] <strcat> earlz: there's also an improved version of that package with nightly builds on arch's build server

[00:23:09] <tjc_> nejucomo: It's a big deal, I'm just not sure how much of a story we have for it yet
[00:23:09] <strcat> binary compatibility isn't really feasible
[00:23:11] <nejucomo> For example, imagine "stable debian" always has rust lib packages which were compiled with a compiler a few versions back...
[00:23:16] <nejucomo> Ok.
[00:23:22] <strcat> libstdc++ breaks binary compatibility now and then
[00:23:27] <strcat> as do most libraries
[00:23:29] <tjc_> strcat: What I have in mind is just version markers that result in a graceful error if you try to use something incompatible
[00:23:43] <strcat> that works but it's going to break between every version :)
[00:23:44] <tjc_> as opposed to some cryptic link error
[00:23:47] <tjc_> true :-)
[00:23:56] <strcat> adding a private field to a mostly private struct breaks binary compatibility

[00:27:36] <earlz> So, does Mozilla pay some of the developers on rust?

[01:54:39] <eholk> it says there's an unconstrained type
[01:55:01] <eholk> an older, working, version of this code had a mysterious third type parameter
[01:55:11] <eholk> i.e. Create::<T, Res, Res>
[01:55:22] <eholk> but now Rust is smart enough to know that Create only takes two type parameters
[01:55:43] <tjc> eholk: what's the error message?

[01:59:24] <eholk> tjc: it's git master, as of this afternoon sometime
[01:59:33] <tjc> eholk: pcwalton made a change pretty recently that would allow you to write Create<T, M>::create::<…>(…)
[01:59:40] <tjc> I don't know if that's the problem or not, it's a little bit mind-twisting
[01:59:55] <eholk> tjc: i tried that and then it complained about too many type parameters
[01:59:58] <tjc> one of the problems is the error message is giving you a bad span (something I've seen a lot)
[02:00:55] <lkuper> also is the ^~~~~~~ ... off-by-one, or is that just an artifact of how it looks pasted into IRC?
[02:01:08] <eholk> lkuper: in emacs it's off by one
[02:01:08] <tjc> lkuper: I'm guessing it really is off, because I've seen error messages like that before
[02:01:20] <tjc> eholk: and you've convinced yourself that this function can really be monomorphized? because I'm… not sure yet :-)
[02:01:34] <eholk> other than being off by one, the span seems okay, unless it's just in entirely the wrong place
[02:01:51] <eholk> tjc: haha, good point :)

[02:26:11] <nejucomo> strcat: Sure.  That's what I mean by "easy to reason about" because it's like passing around references to mutable objects everywhere.  The resulting code may be horribly confusing (mutating a map during iteration), but the semantics seem easy to reason about.

[02:32:25] <nejucomo> Yeah, immutable-everywhere is also quite easy to reason about.

[05:14:49] <adu> what is ~ again?
[05:15:02] <cmr> ~ is a so-called "owning pointer"
[05:15:19] <cmr> It is pointer-sized but otherwise has the same semantics as any other type.
[05:15:39] <adu> so ~ is unmanaged, i.e. you gotta keep track of it
[05:15:44] <cmr> It points to a box on the heap that stores the value the ~ points to, and has a destructor that free's the memory.

[05:22:26] <cmr> The ghc calling convention ensures it.
[05:22:36] <bollu> "mathematical reasons" ? I thought tail recursion was perfectly representable in lambda calculus
[05:22:58] <adu> look, GCC claims to support TCO, but in actuality, it only supports TCO if the arguments to the function are not function pointers, if any of the arguments are function pointers, then TCO is mathematically impossible

[05:23:56] <cmr> It works perfectly well.
[05:24:28] <cmr> Rust only does http://llvm.org/docs/CodeGenerator.html#sibling-call-optimization
[05:24:36] <adu> "No variable argument lists are used."
[05:24:38] <cmr> But it's easy to break. I think anything with destructors will break it.
[05:24:45] <adu> that would make #scheme ppl cringe

[05:25:34] <cmr> Not using varargs is a very reasonable restriction.
[05:25:45] <cmr> Just need to do it on the heap, not the stack
[05:26:12] <adu> anyways, I wrote a scheme implementation in Go, and I never implemented TCO, because Go may-or-may-not-support it, which was good enough for m
[05:26:14] <adu> me
[05:26:37] <cmr> then it's not scheme :P
[05:26:52] <adu> true, but CPS was too hard
[05:28:59] <cmr> I mean what it comes down to is that LLVM IR isn't meant to be a high level IR, the scheme compiler would need to do TCO itself.
[05:29:01] <adu> I got really close though, I implemented call/ec, and guard, and dynamic-wind, and raise-continuable, and custom i/o ports
[05:29:54] <adu> oh, TCO is probably super-easy when targeting LLVM
[05:30:08] <adu> I was targeting Go-source-code

[10:02:22] <GyrosOfWar> i guess yeah

[10:05:47] <bjz> GyrosOfWar: could you do rustpkg build examples/callbacks?

[17:43:52] <kimundi> glennsl: We tread liefetimes like any other generic type parameter: It's generic code, except its generic over the lifetime of a type, rather than the type itself. At public interfaces, Rust requires you to specify all types/type parameters a declaration uses, so you have to both explicitly write out lifetimes and types.

[18:31:51] <kimundi> kvark: But they count as two seperate moves, which means the first move, "name: self.name", will move out of self, and because a struct can not be left alone with partial moved out values, invalidate self completly, even though you only want to move action out of it afterwards

[19:06:10] <strcat> it disables the standard library (where the runtime is defined)
[19:06:11] <earlz> ah, so support must be explicit, right? I'm not sure how "portable" llvm is. I think it'd be cool to use Rust in an embedded environment heh

[19:12:00] <Ralith> so rust's RTS is not actually used for anything outside of primitives referenced by the stdlib?
[19:12:10] <strcat> Ralith: the runtime is defined in the stdlib
[19:12:19] <strcat> std::rt and std::unstable mostly
[19:12:32] <jix> does the compiler create implicit calls to runtime definitions?
[19:12:51] <strcat> there is some leftover C++ stuff that libstd calls into in a librustrt library but it is being reduced down to jemalloc/libuv and could be statically linked
[19:13:01] <strcat> jix: there are "lang items"
[19:13:11] <Ralith> strcat: so rust's RTS is not actually used if you do not explicitly call it or a part of the stdlib which uses it?
[19:13:13] <strcat> for example, exchange_malloc + exchange_free to define the allocator
[19:13:22] <strcat> Ralith: it is always used
[19:13:24] <strcat> there's a #[start] lang item
[19:13:33] <strcat> when you don't use libstd, you main function isn't the program's entry point
[19:13:52] <strcat> libstd defines #[start] and calls into your code after spinning itself up (your code doesn't run on the main thread)
[19:13:57] <Ralith> strcat: if it is always used, then it is used by #[no_std] programs?
[19:14:07] <strcat> no, it's not used by #[no_std] programs
[19:14:16] <Ralith> then it's not always used, is it?
[19:14:19] <strcat> 'the runtime (part of the standard library) is always used when you are using the standard library'
[19:14:34] <strcat> I was answering your question

[19:14:49] <strcat> 15:13:11     Ralith | strcat: so rust's RTS is not actually used if you do not explicitly call it or a part of the stdlib which uses it?
[19:15:29] <Ralith> a clearer answer might have been "almost, but the stdlib defines the entry point, so you have to supply that too"
[19:15:41] <strcat> http://ix.io/8qS
[19:15:47] <strcat> stdlib's definition of the start lang item
[19:16:25] <Ralith> strcat: so rust's RTS is not actually used if you do not explicitly call it or a part of the stdlib which uses it, and you either do not use or replace the entry point?
[19:16:42] <strcat> if you use #[no_std], you aren't using the runtime (which is part of the stdlib)
[19:17:23] <jix> Ralith: I guess if you grep the stdlib source for #[lang you can find all implicit uses of stdlib or rts code
[19:17:50] <Ralith> jix: I don't really care what the stdlib uses it for, I'm trying to work out what, if anything, else uses it
[19:18:00] <strcat> #[no_std] -> you aren't using it

[19:18:22] <strcat> as they are defined right now, the stdlib and the runtime are the same thing
[19:18:51] <Ralith> okay
[19:19:04] <strcat> it used to be that the blurry distinction was the runtime was written in C++ and contained in librustrt.so
[19:19:12] <strcat> and the stdlib depended on it
[19:19:24] <strcat> but since it was almost all rewritten in rust, that stuff is defined in the stdlib itself
[19:20:13] <strcat> lang items are things the language relies on the stdlib (or if you use #[no_std], the application/library) to define
[19:20:15] <Ralith> I ask because frequently RTSs are implicitly referenced by all code in a given lang for purposes such as memory management
[19:20:56] <strcat> the operator traits, the allocator for ~, what to do if div by 0 fails, what to do if a bounds check fails, string equality (for match) and some other things
[19:21:16] <Ralith> so how do you use those under #[no_rts]?
[19:21:32] <strcat> if you use #[no_std]; you define them as they are needed
[19:21:41] <strcat> it will tell you you've used a feature requiring a lang item and you have to define it
[19:21:48] <Ralith> neat
[19:22:21] <strcat> for example if you do '#[start] fn main(_: int, _: **u8) -> int { let x = ~5; *x }' it will make you define exchange_malloc/exchange_free
[19:22:42] <myname> so in theory you could use #no_std and write a tool that parses these errors and keeps adding stuff from libstd.rs until it stops complaining?
[19:23:04] <strcat> the libstd definitions won't really work if it's not using libstd, they make assumptions about the environment

[19:26:00] <FreeFull> So if you use #[no_std], you basically want to write your own small std?
[19:26:06] <strcat> FreeFull: yeah

[22:46:53] <lbergstrom> tikue_: yeah, though it's still annoying. e.g., in servo we now have the isolated task failure architecture for when an iframe goes *boom*, but we still get a ton of console debug spew when it happens, even though we handle it

[22:48:28] <tikue_> ok, i'm placing myself squarely in the camp that wishes for a less verbose mode for task failure :)

[22:49:30] <benh> I also think it's silly that every unsuccessful invocation of rustc prints two "task '<unnamed>' failed at 'explicit failure', /path/to/where/i/built/rust/blah.rs" lines :)
[22:49:38] <bjz_> lbergstrom: doesn't task failure in erlang allow you to pass on more than just a string?

[22:49:58] <benh> bjz_: iirc kimundi was working on something like that
[22:50:41] <bjz_> so for pkgconfig I'm guessing you'd need to do it in a custom pkg.rs?
[22:50:55] <kimundi> bjz: Yeah, I'm looking into that
[22:51:20] <kimundi> Still trying to understand the runtime enough to implement it
[22:51:42] <bjz_> awesome
[22:52:02] <bjz_> would make task failure much more useful

[22:52:46] <bjz_> at the moment it's hard to go with Erlang style of 'fail early'

[22:54:51] <kimundi> The printing arm just always happen if fail! gets caslled. It seems to log the fail message to some kind of task logger, which I guess just prints it per default
