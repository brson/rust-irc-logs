[09:08:26] <Tobba> as illegal as anywhere else, presumably
[09:08:40] <fmtq> uh, in the US you can go to prison for 20 years

[13:40:05] <Tiffany> eddyb: it's massively amenable to SIMD, and it's also exactly the kind of extremely pipelined code the mill is used to
[13:40:21] <Tiffany> the mill can dispatch multiple operations in one instruction over the course of one cycle..
[13:40:28] <Tiffany> I'd say you'd be able to easily get under 1 cycle per byte
[13:40:38] <Tiffany> you'd probably be limited mainly by how many vector units the mill gold has
[13:42:11] <Tiffany> although, to be fair
[13:42:16] <Tiffany> there is a rather strict dependency problem
[13:42:47] <Tiffany> you can do multiple blocks in parallel, sure, but it depends on what you're doing whether you actually need messages much longer than 64 bytes
[13:43:00] <Tiffany> you can't do multiple rounds in parallel
[13:43:24] <Tiffany> multiple rounds on the same block, that is
[13:43:43] <Tiffany> I'm not sure though
[13:45:56] <Sho> is the mill real yet

[14:04:06] <Tiffany> eddyb: the way they take advantage of AVX-2 and AVX-512 is to process multiple blocks simultaneously

[14:44:16] <Sho> "Estrogen-like activity of glabrene and other constituents isolated from licorice root"
[14:44:22] <Sho> Apparently it just acts *like* estrogen
[14:46:22] <fmtq> nonsense
[14:47:22] <Sho> "The isoflavene glabrene and the isoflavane glabridin, found in the roots of liquorice, are phytoestrogens." "Phytoestrogens [...] have the ability to cause estrogenic or/and antiestrogenic effects,[1] by sitting in and blocking receptor sites against estrogen."
[14:47:52] <Tobba> so it might actually be an estrogen blocker

[16:01:36] <FreeFull> Havvy: I'm not sure why you would want to wrap the whole thing in Ok, usually you don't want a Result in the end if you're using try!

[20:38:26] <eddyb> my laptop just drops the packets
[20:41:21] <eddyb> ok, so it was listening on :: by default instead of 0.0.0.0
[20:41:33] <eddyb> though something tells me :: is the same, just for IPv6
[20:42:33] <ytain> wouldn't that be :::?
[20:43:44] <eddyb> Example app listening at http://:::3000
[20:44:03] <eddyb> I don't know. 0.0.0.0 doesn't work either
[20:45:05] <eddyb> there's just no answer to the SYN
[20:46:36] <eddyb> > Begin accepting connections on the specified port and hostname. If the hostname is omitted, the server will accept connections directed to any IPv4 address (INADDR_ANY).
[20:46:38] <eddyb> grrr
[20:47:23] <eddyb> it should just work

[20:50:24] <eddyb> same issue on my phone :|
[20:50:32] <eddyb> so it's not the router at fault
[20:51:03] <eddyb> let's see if NixOS does some sort of firewalling by default
[20:52:17] <fmtq> ufw
[20:52:18] <eddyb> bwahahaha
[20:52:22] <eddyb> it's NixOS https://nixos.org/nixos/manual/ch-options.html#opt-networking.firewall.allowPing
[20:52:29] <fmtq> wot
[20:52:30] <eddyb> at least that's easy to configure
[20:53:04] <fmtq> this uses its own DSL doesn tit
[20:53:47] <eddyb> it's just Nix expressions
[20:53:53] <fmtq> so... yes 
[20:53:56] <fmtq> it has a DSL 
[20:54:17] <fmtq> looks like a superset of Lua 
[20:54:30] <eddyb> yeah, but it's not specific to configuration options, that's what I'm saying
[20:54:36] <eddyb> it's the same language used to describe packages
[20:55:27] <Tiffany> nix is definitely not a superset of lua, fmtq
[20:55:43] <fmtq> lies
[20:55:53] *** Quits: pcwalton (pcwalton@moz-l8ebtf.sfo1.mozilla.com) (Client exited)
[20:56:02] <VShell> fmtq: it's more like a weird programming language which takes the form of "JSON plus purely functional expressions".
[20:57:26] <eddyb> building path(s) ‘/nix/store/g2sfz3i95zvpa54gg1qr6va0ws8wkvr9-unit-firewall.service’
[20:57:50] <eddyb> this makes me think... a system like NixOS could compile bits of an application which hardcode the current configuration
[20:58:37] <eddyb> so a firewall wouldn't have to dynamically iterate rules and apply them
[20:59:01] <eddyb> though by now it's probably JITing them in the kernel or something
