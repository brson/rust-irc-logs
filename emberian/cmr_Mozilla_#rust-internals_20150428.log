[00:00:15] <Eridius> anyway, can you not do .as_track_type() and have TrackType use &'a VideoTrack<'a> instead of Box<VideoTrack<'a> + 'a>

[00:02:01] <Eridius> well, I should get back to work anyway
[00:02:14] <Eridius> I guess if you want to keep the current API, then I'd say just use repr(C) and transmute ;)
[00:02:30] <Eridius> although I'm actually not sure offhand if transmute works properly on boxed trait objects.

[03:07:47] <sfackler> make_unique and get_mut are already unstable! :)
[03:08:34] <sfackler> get_mut isn't even exposed in libstd
[03:08:59] <bluss> is it truly racy? These issues are quite subtle
[03:09:22] <bluss> and what if you check the weak count first, then then strong count (in get_mut)
[03:10:09] <bluss> ah that doesn't matter. anyway..
[03:10:14] <Amaranth> Can you get a weak reference to it while also having a &mut? That seems like it'd just be broken in general.
[03:10:54] <sfackler> yeah, get_mut should actually be safe
[03:11:10] <sfackler> since a &must statically asserts you can't be racing with any other threads with references
[03:11:21] <sfackler> er, wait
[03:11:26] <sfackler> no what doesn't make any sense
[03:11:44] <sfackler> since you clone the Arc
[03:11:54] <bluss> well it does make sense but the proposed race is another weak pointer being upgraded
[03:14:00] *** Quits: cdidd_ (cdidd@moz-qa5fqk.broadband.corbina.ru) (Quit: Leaving)
[03:15:14] <Eridius> the race says that a weak pointer being upgraded and dropped will increment strong and decrement weak, and this can happen in between the loads of the strong and weak values
[03:15:25] <Eridius> and flipping those loads in the other order doesn't fix anything because a strong pointer could be downgraded and dropped
[03:15:48] <Eridius> fundamentally, we either need some kind of locking (e.g. a spinlock), or we need to be able to determine from a _single_ atomic load whether this reference is unique
[03:16:23] <bluss> don't you think a spinlock is ok since it's a fringe function
[03:17:38] *** Joins: cdidd (cdidd@moz-m698fs.broadband.corbina.ru)
[03:18:13] <Amaranth> To make a lock work here wouldn't you need to also put it on every use of the strong and weak counts?
[03:19:22] <Eridius> right
[03:19:37] <bluss> the way the Arc is now it is very lightweight and you don't pay anything for Weak pointers if you don't use them (for example in .clone() and drop)
[03:21:44] <Eridius> sfackler: good point about address space
[03:23:20] <sfackler> I'd also be pretty comfortable saying "if you want to have more than 4 billion references to the same Arc, you are Doing It Wrong" :P
[03:24:35] <Eridius> I'm not actually sure num_ptrs+num_weak works though
[03:25:09] <Eridius> specifically, in the Drop of Arc, it needs to know when the strong pointer count hits zero, so it can drop the value immediately, and I'm not sure if it can do that without running into the exact same issues that get_mut has
[03:25:53] <Mutabah> Eridius: The trick is if you do an atomic load and it returns 1, and you have a &mut, you controll the allocation
[03:25:59] <Mutabah> *control
[03:26:18] <Mutabah> ... that could be interesting with weak pointers though...
[03:26:26] <Eridius> but if we're doing num_ptrs/num_weak, then the only way to get num_strong is to do 2 loads
[03:26:32] <Eridius> anyway, dinnertime
[03:26:44] <sfackler> spinning over the 2 loads seems fine too
[03:27:12] <Eridius> if we use a spinlock we have to use it everywhere

[03:29:33] <sfackler> I'm assuming double wide atomic ops aren't sufficiently supported on all the platforms we care about
[03:31:12] <Eridius> as a short-term fix we could actually make get_mut and make_unique simply always fail if a weak pointer has ever been constructed from an Arc
[03:31:21] <Eridius> (that way there's no penalty to code that doesn't use weak pointers)
[03:31:51] <Eridius> (we'd do this by flipping an atomic boolean to true when a Weak pointer has been constructed, and then consulting that boolean after testing the strong count in get_mut/make_unique

[04:20:29] <Gankro> aatch: Pretty much exactly that. If an &'a "techically" outlives 'a while being unreachable (e.g. by leaking) it is irrelevant to borrowck
[04:21:00] <Gankro> bstrie: pnkfelix is captain of that work
[04:21:34] <aatch> Gankro, ah, that's probably because of dataflow then.
[04:22:28] <aatch> Gankro, while the region system is defined in terms of lexical scopes, borrows are handled using dataflow analysis and therefore are based on the control flow of the program.
[04:26:33] <Gankro> aatch: I don't think it was necessarily an insight on implementation details so much as meaningful semantics. Although you might be saying that and I'm having trouble interpretting your impl-speak :)
[04:30:42] <aatch> Gankro, heh. What I'm saying is that a borrow of a variable is analyzed using the flow of the function, that says whether or not two borrows overlap, or whether or not a given borrow lasts long enough.

[05:03:12] <Eridius> Gankro: :)
[05:04:39] <Eridius> aatch: the point about borrowck only caring about reachable values is that borrowck doesn't care if a value outlives its lifetime by being leaked, since it's unreachable, which means borrowck cannot be used to guarantee that a value destructs by the time its lifetime ends
[05:05:05] *** Joins: A205B064 (A205B064@moz-9s9nhk.nap.wideopenwest.com)
[05:06:50] <aatch> Eridius, ah, I think then it's more that a value leaked in that manner isn't considered to be outliving the associated region.
[05:08:29] <Eridius> but it does outlive the region. The bytes tht make up the value persist indefinitely in memory (well, until the process terminates) and the destructor is never called. For any reasonable definition, it's still alive. It's just unreachable
[05:09:04] <aatch> Eridius, well yes, but it's not that the compiler knows it's unreachable.
[05:09:53] <Eridius> well, not really. It's not that the compiler knows it's unreachable, it's that the compiler only cares about reachable values
[05:10:09] <Eridius> borrowck doesn't ensure that values don't outlive their lifetimes, it ensures that any reachable value with a lifetime is valid
[05:10:26] <aatch> Eridius, the point is, if you create a reference cycle in a function, and just let the whole thing drop, at no point, from the compiler's perspective, does the variable escape the appropriate region.
[05:11:03] <Eridius> I suppose that's a reasonable way of putting it
[05:11:54] <Eridius> in any case, the eventual point here is that using a RAII object as a proxy that represents other locally-borrowed values, when the RAII object itself isn't actually used to reach those other values (as is the case with thread::scoped), means relying on borrowck to do something that it doesn't do, namely, to ensure that the value doesn't outlive its lifetime
[05:13:08] <aatch> Eridius, yeah. I guess I've spent too much time hacking around in the compiler for that be surprising to me.
[05:13:48] <Eridius> when you actually think about it, it makes sense. But most people didn't really think about it and just worked off of their simpler mental model that says that borrowck ensures values don't outlive their lifetimes
[05:14:46] <aatch> Eridius, the other part is that many people's model of lifetimes aren't probably biased by knowing *exactly* what the compiler thinks a lifetime is.
[05:14:57] <Eridius> true
[05:16:51] <aatch> This is also why I'm having a hard time caring about "leakocaplypse", since the moment you try to pass something up the stack, the compiler will yell at you.

[07:13:38] <Eridius> what benefit would there be to moving str into the library?
[07:13:50] <Eridius> I'm pretty sure the memory representation has to be guaranteed by the language
[07:14:06] <reem> generally just having less things baked into the compiler is a good thing
[07:14:10] <Eridius> so there's no real difference between the library defining str, and the compiler defining str but letting libstd add an inherent impl onto it (which is what we have today)
[07:14:31] <reem> yes, from the outside-of-std perspective it doesn’t matter, it’s just implementation cleanliness
[07:14:39] <Eridius> reem: having fewer things baked into the compiler is not intrinsically a good thing, it's a good thing because of all the associated reasons that go along with it. I don't think there's any relevant reasons for str
[07:15:02] <reem> it lessens the complexity of the compiler and demonstrates language flexibility
[07:15:24] <Eridius> the compiler has to rely on the memory representation of str already, I don't think it would lessen complexity in any meaningful fashion
[07:15:26] <reem> for this specific case it doesn’t really matter, I admit
[07:15:32] <Eridius> and I don't know what you mean by "demonstrates language flexibility"
[07:15:42] <reem> Eridius: but that can be accomplished by just sticking #[repr(C)] on the definition
[07:15:58] <reem> actually it doesn’t really need to guarantee the repr tbh
[07:16:17] <reem> &[T] doesn’t even need a guaranteed repr, since you have conversion functions
[07:16:20] <Eridius> reem: string literals need to be hard-coded into the output in the exact representation that str uses
[07:16:37] <Eridius> s/output/resulting binary/
[07:16:49] <reem> Eridius: Sure, from the perspective of the compiler it needs to know, but from the perspective of the end user… it actually doesn’t matter.
[07:17:08] <Eridius> also &[T] does need a guaranteed repr because we make assumptions all over the place as to what the repr of &[T] is
[07:17:25] <Eridius> from the persective of the end user it's irrelevant if the type is provided by the compiler or the library
[07:17:40] <reem> Eridius: std internals can be aware of the current repr, but it doesn’t need to be guaranteed as part of the language
[07:18:23] <reem> since we have as_ptr(_mut), len, and from_raw_buf(_mut)
[07:18:33] <reem> not sure if those muts are in the right place
[07:18:42] <Eridius> those don't matter
[07:18:49] <reem> raw::Slice is unstable for a reason
[07:19:02] <Eridius> &[T] is required to have a contiguous sequence of T instances, without any header or footer fields

[07:19:58] <Eridius> well, I guess a better way of saying it is the memory layout of &[T] must precisely match what the compiler expects
[07:20:06] <reem> oh, of course
[07:20:13] <Eridius> the one time we changed it, when switching to DST, we had to change the compiler and library in lockstep
[07:20:14] <reem> but the compiler specifies it, since [T] *is* a builtin
[07:20:18] <Eridius> yeah
[07:20:35] <reem> I view the compiler + std as a single unit, std is allowed to depend on compiler internals because it is always updated in lockstep
[07:20:55] <reem> so even if std is depending on the current layout, it’s not actually guaranteed to “the wild”

[07:21:30] <reem> and even though std does it
[07:21:39] <Eridius> basically, a lang item is only useful as a lang item if it's actually possible to write a different stdlib implementation that has a different implementation of the lang item
[07:21:47] <reem> not sure if I agree
[07:22:15] <Eridius> if the lang item is required by the language itself to have a particular implementation then there's no benefit to moving it to the library
[07:22:26] <aatch> Well, that's not strictly true.
[07:22:27] <reem> some lang items are there just to inform the compiler that this is the trait we mean when we are talking about e.g. index, so the compiler doesn’t have to change it, but the compiler still depends on the details of that trait
[07:22:39] <Eridius> well, I mean if we'er talking about things like functions, if the runtime wants to use the same function the compiler does, then having it exist in the stdlib makes sense
[07:22:45] <reem> if you put lang on random things you will get random problems
[07:22:46] <Eridius> but we're talking here about str and [T]
[07:23:04] <Manishearth> reem: that sounds like fun :p
[07:23:08] <Eridius> reem: the compiler depends on certain semantics as expressed by the lang item. It doesn't depend on any semantics that are not expressed by the lang item
[07:23:23] <bstrie> Eridius: having the implementation in a library makes it easier to debug and implement. it's not about providing a different implementation
[07:23:30] <Eridius> for example, for loops don't depend on the precise implementation of iterators, they only depend on the shape of the API
[07:23:33] <reem> like I can do #[lang=“index”] trait X { } I’m liable to get random ICEs
[07:23:40] <aatch> The idea of language items is that they allow you to use the full power of Rust to define the items in question.
[07:23:57] <Manishearth> you can remove unnecessary bits and whatnot
[07:24:12] <Manishearth> eg panics in indexing
[07:24:15] <Manishearth> or whatever
[07:24:28] <Manishearth> generally if you're redifining a lang item you're probably trying to go for a more baremetal Rust
[07:24:29] <aatch> since the alternative requires a lot of effort to manually generate all the parts each subsystem in the compiler needs for a given item.
[07:24:41] <Eridius> ok I think you're misconstruing what I'm saying. I'm not suggesting that every lang item that has only one obvious implementation should be moved into the compiler. Obviously there are lots of lang items that are more natural to write in the library instead of the compiler. I'm still talking here in the context of the str and [T] types
[07:25:03] <Manishearth> #[lang_item = "panic_fmt"] fn panic_fmt() -> ! { /* do nothing*/}
[07:25:27] <Eridius> anyway it's late and it's time to go to bed
[07:25:31] <bstrie> Eridius: if machinery can be moved out of the compiler for a net decrease in complexity, I'm all for it
[07:25:42] <Eridius> bstrie: if there's a net decrease in complexity, then sure
[07:25:56] <aatch> I'm not convinced there is a net decrease in complexity though.
[07:25:58] <bstrie> incidentally it also makes alternate compilers easier to write, but I don't think we really care about optimizing that right now...
[07:26:03] <Eridius> part of my argument here is that moving str into the library won't decrease the overall complexity

[07:42:43] <Manishearth> ChrisMorgan: With lang items you could even switch to non-utf8 strings
[07:42:45] <Manishearth> or....
[07:42:52] <Manishearth> wtf8 strings! cc SimonSapin 
[07:43:13] <Manishearth> I wonder how much we can mess with the compiler in Servo before we are declared to be using Servo-flavored Rust
[07:43:29] <aatch> Except you couldn't.
[07:43:47] <aatch> Since the compiler needs to know the representation of the string.
[07:43:48] <Manishearth> aatch: ?
[07:43:50] <ChrisMorgan> The compiler would still be needing the UTF-8 invariant.
[07:43:57] <Manishearth> for what?
[07:43:57] <p1start> https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/19612 is relevant
[07:44:17] <aatch> Manishearth, to actually turn string literals into strings.
[07:44:26] <Manishearth> aatch: oh right
[07:44:29] <ChrisMorgan> Manishearth: the lang item would just tell the compiler that "foo" needs to be str([…])
[07:46:16] <aatch> To do that, we could do what haskell does and generate a call to a conversion function that turns a rustc_str into some other type
[07:46:46] <aatch> we'd still end up with a primitive string type though.
[07:46:55] <Manishearth> we could add a lang item for that ... right?
[07:47:01] <Manishearth> hm
[07:47:03] <Manishearth> maybe not
[07:47:04] <p1start> aatch: &[u8] could sort of be used, right?

[08:53:19] <Manishearth> we can write a safe forget using channels :)
[08:53:29] <Manishearth> the core issue here
[08:53:34] <aatch> There is some overlap in definitions I guess.
[08:53:37] <Manishearth> is that when you call bar(foo)
[08:53:45] <Manishearth> (by move, obviously)
[08:54:03] <Manishearth> you *know* that the destructor of foo was called before bar() ends
[08:54:06] <Manishearth> or when bar() ends
[08:54:43] <Manishearth> so `let foo = ...; bar(foo); /* you know foo is gone */`
[08:54:51] <aatch> Manishearth, "before bar() returns", is what you want
[08:54:56] <Manishearth> aatch: yeah
[08:55:06] <Manishearth> *as long as* foo is !Send, you have this guarantee
[08:55:16] <Manishearth> and you can design RAII guards with this in mind

[08:55:45] <reem> channels use Arc internally
[08:55:49] <Manishearth> hm, what about a combination of Send and Static?
[08:55:57] <reem> So they can just bound by Leak appropriately
[08:56:04] <Manishearth> reem: not my point
[08:56:24] <Manishearth> reem: I'm saying that feeding to a channel in current Rust is the same as feeding to safe_forget() as far as RAII guards go
[08:56:42] <reem> I disagree
[08:56:43] <Manishearth> except that because RAII guards are never Send, the former is not possible in current Rust
[08:56:56] <Manishearth> I wonder if a combination of Send and !'static would work
[08:56:57] <Manishearth> hm
[08:57:02] <Manishearth> reem: what's the difference?
[08:57:14] <reem> How are they similar?
[08:57:51] <Manishearth> let's say you have fn foo<T>(t: T) and fn bar<T:Send>(t: T)
[08:58:05] <reem> Ok
[08:58:13] <Manishearth> let x = ...; let y = ... ; foo(x); bar(y); 
[08:58:32] <Manishearth> after all this, you *know* that the destructor was called in the first situation
[08:58:41] <Manishearth> sorry
[08:58:46] <Manishearth> assume x is !Send
[08:58:53] <Manishearth> and y is Send
[08:58:56] <reem> Ok
[08:59:12] <reem> How can you leak from
[08:59:18] <reem> bar?
[08:59:41] <Manishearth> after all this, you *know* the destructor was called in the first situation, regardless of the internals of foo() (ignoring the current safe_forget that exists due to Rc cycles)
[08:59:44] <reem> You would have to bound with T: Send + 'static to be able to send to another thread
[08:59:51] <Manishearth> but you cannot be sure if the same goes for bar
[08:59:54] <Manishearth> reem: yes, sorry
[09:00:09] <reem> Leaking T: 'static is not concerning
[09:00:15] <Manishearth> reem: you can't really leak from bar. well, sort of. you could send it to a thread that loops indefinitely
[09:00:57] <reem> There are many, many ways to "leak" 'static data

[09:00:57] <Manishearth> not my point
[09:00:57] <Manishearth> Basically, I'm shifting how we look at the problem
[09:00:57] <reem> By definition you are allowed to hold on to it for an indefinite period
[09:00:59] <reem> It's crucial to your example though
[09:01:07] <Manishearth> We were looking at the problem as "what if the destructor never runs even though we think it does", right?
[09:01:30] <reem> The problem is much more precise than that
[09:01:55] <reem> It's with not running the destructor of T: 'a within 'a
[09:01:58] <Manishearth> I'm shifting/pinpointing the focus to "if we call foo(guard) by-move, *can we be sure that he destructor was run after foo returns*"
[09:02:15] <Manishearth> with guards that are !Send or have a lifetime parameter, that is true
[09:02:28] <reem> I don't think that is a better way to frame the problem
[09:02:42] <reem> It's not specific enough
[09:02:46] <Manishearth> that lets us think in terms of existing things like Send and 'static IMO
[09:02:54] <Manishearth> which might be a way to avoid Leak
[09:03:05] <reem> Send is irrelevant here, 'static is the thing that lets you leak
[09:03:41] <reem> So yes, bounding Rc by 'static alleviates the problem, but is untenable since that destroys and important and valid use case

[09:08:19] <Manishearth> reem: perhaps there is a way to handle this without a trait?
[09:08:35] <aatch> I do think the hand-wringing over this is little much though, I'd be surprised if this ever came up in real code, since you'd not be able to return the Rc in the first place.
[09:08:56] <reem> Leak is basically just the sunset of 'static types which aren't safe to leak
[09:09:05] <reem> non-'static*
[09:09:26] <aatch> So you'd literally be leaking the guards on purpose.
[09:10:03] <reem> You can be Leak + 'static but since the guarantee of leak is that you run the destructor before the end of that lifetime, it means nothing.
[09:10:32] <Manishearth> reem: okay, so perhaps we can use 'static to somehow make the backcompat easier?
[09:10:44] <Manishearth> (sorry, bit busy now, mostly just thinking out loud)
[09:10:49] <Manishearth> for Leak
[09:11:10] <Manishearth> I like the Leak proposal more, but I have a sneaky feeling that there's a better way to do it
[09:11:16] <Manishearth> wrt backcompat

[09:12:35] <Manishearth> reem: hm, how about disallowing Rc cycles with non-'static contents?
[09:12:51] <bstrie> I'm interested in the notion of categorizing the pattern used by thread::scoped as something wholly separate from a scope guard. it seems like it does something fundamentally different

[09:18:12] <bstrie> we just need to have, like, 10 different Rc types. Rc1, Rc2, etc. then make it so you can only store an RcX in another RcY when X < Y

[13:56:54] <steveklabnik> :)
[13:56:58] <steveklabnik> awesome posts lately
[13:57:30] <huon> thanks!
[13:57:50] <steveklabnik> i wanted something like your travis one in the docs, just hadn't written it up yet
[13:57:59] <steveklabnik> and hadn't totally figured out how to do one or two bits of it
[13:58:18] <huon> both of those were written in a few hours, on the spur of the moment... I should really get back to the ones I've had lying around for ages. :/
[13:58:32] <steveklabnik> i know that feel
[13:59:53] <scott> I really liked the small libraries post, huon
[14:00:05] <huon> thanks

[14:00:34] <huon> yeah, this is the first time I've really experienced it
[14:00:43] <scott> so they immediately resist adding deps for little things like byteorder and the like
[14:00:49] <huon> (not that I was ever really deep in the C/C++ world)

[14:02:49] <huon> ChrisMorgan: that's so last year :P
[14:02:55] <huon> (as in, I've already done it)
[14:03:13] <ChrisMorgan> Oh, true. Missed it.
[14:03:26] * ChrisMorgan receives tweets like https://twitter.com/JoshuaPoehls/status/584069585428545536
[14:03:30] <huon> yeah, they seem to have a delayed load sometimes
[14:03:35] <ChrisMorgan> “This FizzBuzz deep dive in #rustlang will make your head hurt. That said, I do hope to dive into Rust soon.” 😀
[14:03:47] <huon> oh, I should consider images...
[14:04:18] <ChrisMorgan> I’ve decided to draw something for almost all blog posts. My #[cfg_attr] “quick tip” didn’t get one, but other things should.
[14:04:37] <ChrisMorgan> I’m really wondering what to draw for my almost-completed “Rust ownership, the hard way”.

[14:05:35] <ChrisMorgan> My next post “Functions and closures and their types” has a comparatively clear one: a stick figure trying to stuff slightly differing square blocks marked “fn()” and “||” into a round hole.

[16:46:32] <larsberg> Sorry to nag, but we believe that ICE is blocking the Servo update and don't really have a workaround either (short of "remove all non-ascii characters from all files")
[16:46:40] <pnkfelix> larsberg: I am still looking at it.

[16:51:38] <Manishearth> larsberg: why do we have nonascii characters in Servo?
[16:52:04] <larsberg> Manishearth: at the very least there is the chapter/section unicode character that some people like to use when referencing specs
[16:52:11] <Manishearth> blargh
[16:52:50] <Manishearth> for a moment there I thought we'd let steveklabnik into our codebase and all of our variables were emoji now

[16:53:12] <larsberg> there's also some math characters; some encoding tests (obviously)
[16:53:23] <Manishearth> right
[16:53:29] <larsberg> But I'm a little confused because even removing the ones I found, I still get the ICE
[16:53:38] <larsberg> found via:        find . -name '*.rs' | xargs ggrep --color='auto' -P -n "[\x80-\xFF]"

[16:53:48] <steveklabnik> Manishearth: ;) <3
[16:53:49] <larsberg> (where ggrep is gnu grep, because apple's version of grep is older than me)
[16:54:07] <steveklabnik> or should i say 😉❤️️ 
[16:54:11] <Manishearth> larsberg: are we sure it's due to unicode?
[16:54:11] <steveklabnik> haha
[16:54:16] <Manishearth> hah
[16:54:45] <Manishearth> larsberg: remember that we do have a sizeable amount of macros and expansion, and codemap has an issue with those
[16:55:06] <Manishearth> (as in, it sometimes messes up)
[16:55:09] <larsberg> Manishearth: assertion made in the issue is that we can't even hit that code path if we don't have any multibyte chars. I haven't looked deeper than just trying to remove things from outside the normal ASCII range.

[16:55:44] <Eridius> is ggrep unicode-aware or does it only operate on bytes? i.e. is your pattern actually sufficient?
[16:58:30] <larsberg> Eridius: great question; I'll have to test (or treat as binary) :-)

[19:41:27] <apoelstra> iirc if one of the threads had panicked, the join would panic
[19:42:11] <bluss> bstrie: if it allowed to catch a panic, it could leave some of its borrowed variables from the parent stack in an indeterminate state
[19:42:29] <bluss> bstrie: generic exception safety problems
[19:43:21] <bstrie> but doesn't a panic in the child thread already propogate to the parent?
[19:43:34] <bstrie> bluss: are you saying that this somehow prevents people from attempting to catch a panic manually?
[19:43:59] <bluss> thread::scoped allowed catching and ignoring a panic in the child, and that was unsound
[19:44:11] <bluss> so panic propagation was enforced in the destructor

[22:01:00] <Ericson2314> did `static mut` ever get removed?

[22:02:19] <Ericson2314> :(
[22:05:50] <GBGamer> no...
[22:06:02] <GBGamer> static mut is really useful for a very few things
[22:06:13] <GBGamer> And as long as you use a mutex, it's safe
[22:06:22] <GBGamer> StaticMutex
[22:06:46] <brson> Manishearth: do you have a link to the bangalore meetup group?
[22:07:00] <Ericson2314> i thought there was consensus that it was extraneous
[22:07:05] <Ericson2314> what is it useful for?
[22:08:14] <GBGamer> Heaps
[22:08:26] <huon> it's theoretically extraneous with struct RacyCell<T> { x: UnsafeCell<T> } unsafe impl<T> Sync for RacyCell<T> {}
[22:08:28] <GBGamer> implementing mutex yourself
[22:08:38] <GBGamer> s/mutex/malloc/
[22:08:50] <huon> GBGamer: extraneous beause it can be implemented other ways, not extraneous because the functionality isn't useful :)

[22:10:13] <steveklabnik> https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1096 <-
[22:10:21] <GBGamer> I mean, static UnsafeCell<T> is pretty much equal to static mut T
[22:10:45] <GBGamer> steveklabnik: please allow this to pass
[22:11:19] <Ericson2314> huon: relatedly, why do we have the Sync bound again?
[22:11:29] <GBGamer> 'cept one is a language feature, one is a libcore feature
[22:12:36] <huon> Ericson2314: to ensure threadsafety. I'm not ]sure I understand the question
[22:12:43] <huon> GBGamer: UnsafeCell is a language feature
[22:12:58] <huon> (the interface to that language feature is via core, of course)
[22:13:28] <GBGamer> Well then there is literally no difference, except for some extra typing
[22:13:57] *** Joins: Skyler (Skyler@moz-nu4i4b.sd.cox.net)
[22:14:05] <GBGamer> still don't really see the point
[22:14:10] <Ericson2314> My understanding is that absent something like unsafe that is already unsafe
[22:14:27] <Ericson2314> the type system would never let you mutate a static
[22:14:35] <Ericson2314> so there is no need for sync
[22:14:46] <huon> Atomic and Mutex types allow for mutation through a &
[22:15:01] <huon> similarly RefCell and Cell
[22:15:06] *** Joins: chc4 (chc4@moz-pdo0at.ma.comcast.net)
[22:15:07] <GBGamer> Ericson2314: what about *mut T
[22:15:15] <GBGamer> That's definitely not Sync
[22:15:17] <Manishearth> brson: I didn't know one existed. You'll have to ask Deb for all that, he's handling it mostly. I'm just going to be there and give a talk or two :)
[22:15:25] <GBGamer> Yet you can define a static *mut T
[22:15:35] <GBGamer> (well, you can't, but only because it's !Sync)
[22:15:43] <Ericson2314> I asked this a long time ago, and I think somebody mentioned some technicallity reguarding Cells
[22:15:50] <huon> however, the latter don't try to be threadsafe, so it is invalid to access a RefCell/Cell in multiple threads
[22:15:57] <Manishearth> (I'm not local to bangalore and I have exams now so I'm not doing any organizational stuff)
[22:16:02] <GBGamer> Similarly, you can define a const *mut T
[22:16:03] <huon> it's not really technicalities, it's the fundamental design of the types :)
[22:16:20] <huon> GBGamer: hm, I'm not sure I understand your point
[22:16:28] <GBGamer> reason we need Sync
[22:16:33] <Ericson2314> those synchronization primitives enforce there own sync restriction on the data they contain right?>
[22:16:45] <huon> Ericson2314: yes, and that's why it's safe to put them in a static
[22:16:56] <huon> they indicate they are safe by implementing Sync
[22:17:11] <huon> (RefCell/Cell indicate they are not safe by not implementing Sync)

[22:21:38] <GBGamer> (also, I think this would be #rust stuff?)
[22:21:51] <tamird> i'm updating librustc_bitflags to use associated constants
[22:21:59] <GBGamer> oh nvm, then

[22:22:13] <GBGamer> hrm, could you gist the error codes?
[22:22:16] <tamird> sure
[22:22:49] <seanmonstar> tamird: likely because associated constants are super new, and rustdoc hasn't been taught about them?
[22:23:08] <tamird> doesn't rustdoc use the same mechanics as rustc?
[22:23:27] <simukis> only up to AST

[22:25:32] <tamird> does that help, at all?
[22:25:42] <tamird> it looks like compilation fails, not doc generation per se
[22:25:45] <simukis> so that’s doctests… does rustdoc perchance invoke some other rustc which does not support associated constants? 
[22:26:21] <tamird> let me see...
[22:26:38] <seanmonstar> might depend on the stage?
[22:26:57] <seanmonstar> or is there a snapshot already of associated constants?
[22:27:10] <simukis> seanmonstar: he appears to be invoking a simple rustdoc, which suggests he’s using nightly, I think?
