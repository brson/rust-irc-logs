[00:11:51] <bcoopers> Hey quick question
[00:12:03] <bcoopers> when I try to run rustc from compiling the compiler from github
[00:12:06] <bcoopers> I get this error:

[00:12:29] <bcoopers> I ran make

[00:13:45] <aturon> acrichto: i think the point is, now that rustup gets beta by default, need to pass a flag for nightly
[00:13:54] <aturon> (and we probably want to recommend beta over nightly)
[00:14:09] <nmatsakis> acrichto: what aturon said
[00:14:13] <acrichto> aturon: sure, but rustup hasnt' actuallly been updated!
[00:14:19] <acrichto> we have to manually update it on S3
[00:14:19] <nmatsakis> let me rephrase,
[00:14:28] <aturon> just need to do it before the announcement :)
[00:14:29] <acrichto> I can definitely update when it's needed :)

[00:42:36] <acrichto> nmatsakis: hm yeah I don't think I'd expect a panic there
[00:42:52] <acrichto> nmatsakis: I'd probably just handle the Ok(0) case specially and then let through all other Ok(_) cases otherwise
[00:43:29] <nmatsakis> not sure what you mean by "Let through"
[00:43:39] <acrichto> e.g. remove the Ok(1) special case
[00:43:45] <acrichto> and use Ok(_) instead
[00:43:51] <acrichto> after Ok(0) is ruled out

[05:15:15] <bstrie> aturon: what time tomorrow is the release vaguely happening? I want to be awake for it...
[05:15:25] <bstrie> safe to presume noonish or later?
[05:15:29] <aturon> bstrie: hmm, i'm not actually sure. brson?
[05:15:41] <bstrie> as long as you don't do it first thing in the morning
[05:15:47] <aturon> that's unlikely :)
[05:15:54] <bstrie> great so I can sleep in
[05:16:00] <aturon> last time i think it was around ~11am
[05:17:40] <kmc> bstrie: aren't you living in a cave or something
[05:18:05] <brson> aturon bstrie: i think it's up to acrichto this time
[05:18:27] <reem> Can someone change the AsRef impl for Cow? It's preventing hyper from building. I would do it myself, but I'm on a plane so downloading the latest snapshot would take... a while.
[05:18:31] <brson> acrichto: make sure bstrie is awake before releasing tomorrow
[05:19:39] <reem> afaict all that needs to be done is change T: Clone to T: ToOwned + ?Sized
[05:19:45] <brson> acrichto: is there any part of the release that's blocked on me tomorrow?
[05:19:54] <brson> i can't think of anything that only i have access to
[05:19:56] <aturon> reem: i'll look into it
[05:19:57] <bstrie> kmc: not a cave, my tree hammock :)
[05:20:10] <aturon> reem: have a link to the code that needs it handy?
[05:20:24] <aturon> brson: i'm pretty sure we're all systems go
[05:20:28] <cmr> Is the release cut?
[05:20:38] <reem> aturon: Cow<'static, str> does't impl AsRef<str> basically just because of an implicit Sized bound
[05:20:57] <reem> that causes some breakage in the Headers in hyper
[05:21:17] <brson> cmr: yeah, if you 'multirust update beta-2015-04-03' you can get it right now
[05:22:07] <acrichto> brson: I think we're basically just pulling the trigger at this point
[05:22:11] <acrichto> brson: all artifacts are ready to go
[05:22:13] <acrichto> tested on linux/mac
[05:22:18] <acrichto> gotta test windows tonight
[05:22:19] <aturon> reem: oh yeah, that's an odd choice of impl. will fix (but won't land for beta)
[05:22:23] <acrichto> but other than that I think we're good1
[05:22:46] <reem> aturon: urgh, that's unfortunate, let me see if I can hack around it

[05:24:19] <cmr> So how does 1.0.0 work? Does the beta get promoted to 1.0.0, or do we cut master for it?

[05:26:37] <aturon> cmr: the current thinking is that the beta branch will continue to be updated from master for a couple weeks, as we focus hard on polish. about half way into the cycle, that will stop, and we will cherry pick emergency commits only 
[05:26:50] <cmr> Ok, that sounds good.
[05:27:12] <WindowsBunny> ideally homu will support being able to approve PRs for beta
[05:27:50] <aturon> note that the above is a 1.0 thing only, in general once a beta is cut from master it gets cherry picks only
[05:27:59] <cmr> right
[05:28:02] <cmr> gotta start the train somewhere
[05:28:08] <aturon> WindowsBunny: yes, that would be ideal but it'll probably be a while before the infrastructure is ready
[05:28:10] <aturon> cmr: exactly
[05:28:24] <cmr> (that's why I'm asking; I've never witnessed a train leaving station before...)
[05:28:39] <WindowsBunny> aturon: Just pay barosl to take a week off whatever he's doing normally and just work on homu

[05:30:36] <huon> aturon: does ToOwned imply Clone?

[15:09:51] <steveklabnik> cool
[15:09:55] <pnkfelix> nmatsakis: The lifetime/loop label syntax, was to be able to support (in the future), I think, potentially attaching labels to arbitrary blocks
[15:09:59] <steveklabnik> i was triaging this morning and wasn't even sure what to tag it
[15:10:11] <pnkfelix> Its not a beta blocker, IMO

[15:10:38] <nmatsakis> pnkfelix: that was a motivation
[15:10:47] <pnkfelix> nmatsakis: so, my question is: Do you think that is still a potential goal ?
[15:10:52] <nmatsakis> pnkfelix: yes, why?
[15:11:01] <nmatsakis> because of that issue re: scoping?
[15:11:09] *** Joins: binkarus (ashkan@moz-014tff.ca.comcast.net)
[15:11:10] <pnkfelix> nmatsakis: no
[15:11:27] <pnkfelix> nmatsakis: its for gh21633
[15:11:28] <[o__o]> Back-compat risk: same label can be attached to distinct blocks in the same scope: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/21633
[15:11:38] <pnkfelix> nmatsakis: I have a patch for the above, but it does not work for for-loops
[15:12:05] <pnkfelix> nmatsakis: because we expand `'a: for ...` into `{ stuff including 'a ... }`
[15:12:30] <pnkfelix> nmatsakis: and I was thinking that if we hacked in (feature-gated) ability to attach lifetime-labels to blocks
[15:13:02] <pnkfelix> nmatsakis: then `'a: for ...` could expand to `'a: { ... stuff including a nested 'a: ... }`
[15:13:36] <kimundi> hm, that sounds like a weird solution
[15:13:39] <pnkfelix> nmatsakis: Just so that the label would persist on the outside
[15:13:55] <nmatsakis> pnkfelix: right, that's the one I meant
[15:14:14] <pnkfelix> kimundi: yeah I know, but its the cleanest one I could think of.  Alternatives include: Make the duplicate-label analysis smart enough to inspect the interiors of blocks that came from expanding for-loops ...
[15:14:47] <nmatsakis> pnkfelix: so another option is not to fix this and just report errors later if you use an "ambiguous lifetime reference"
[15:14:49] <kimundi> pnkfelix: How about a hidden attribute? #[loop_lifetime('a)] { ... }
[15:14:50] <nmatsakis> :)
[15:14:56] <nmatsakis> pnkfelix: however --
[15:15:05] <pnkfelix> nmatsakis: well that is related to another question
[15:15:16] <nmatsakis> pnkfelix: it's not clear to me that lifetime label names should be scoped with `{}`
[15:15:18] <pnkfelix> nmatsakis: namely: Is ariel1b perhaps right about the proper scoping  for loop labels ?
[15:15:19] <nmatsakis> i.e.,
[15:15:20] <nmatsakis> I could see
[15:15:34] <nmatsakis> { 'a: { ... } } 'a: { ... }
[15:15:36] <nmatsakis> being illegal
[15:15:50] <pnkfelix> nmatsakis: hmm, I suppose that's another option here
[15:15:53] <nmatsakis> which basically means, making it "smtarter' as you said
[15:16:01] <nmatsakis> I probably would draw line at "repeating scopes"
[15:16:05] <nmatsakis> (loop bodies)
[15:16:06] <pnkfelix> nmatsakis: yeah, but that would actually be a simpler analysis
[15:16:19] <pnkfelix> nmatsakis: i mean, it sounds like you are saying that the scope of labels is the entire fn-body ?
[15:16:23] <nmatsakis> since there is no meaningful way to refer to a scope inside a loop form outside
[15:16:26] <nmatsakis> *form outside
[15:16:31] <nmatsakis> yes that is basically what I'm saying
[15:16:38] <nmatsakis> or innermost enclosing repeating scope
[15:16:44] <nmatsakis> but I'd be fine with either one for now
[15:16:47] <nmatsakis> fn body is obviously backwards compat
[15:16:48] <kimundi> I guess the backwards compatible thing would be to prevent the same lifetime name from being used as a loop label at all inside the same block
[15:17:04] <kimundi> basically prevent all variations, and punt on exact semantic later
[15:17:57] <pnkfelix> kimundi: is there any real difference between "inside the same block" and "entire fn-body", considering that a fn-body is a block ?
[15:18:13] <pnkfelix> nmatsakis: Okay, maybe I will try entire fn-body first
[15:18:15] <kimundi> pnkfelix: no, I meant the same thing :)

[15:18:55] <kimundi> pnkfelix: but constexor don't allow loops so, that doesn't mean much
[15:19:00] <pnkfelix> kimundi: (since there's no conditional-flow)
[15:19:01] <kimundi> yeah
[15:19:21] <pnkfelix> nmatsakis: if there's unexpected fallout during bootstrapping, then I'll try innermost enclosing repeating scope instead.

[15:21:47] <kimundi> nmatsakis: Unrelated from this concrete issue, I feel like lifetime labels should behave either as a item that introduces a type, or a statement that introduces a type. that is, I see them as consistent with the current shadowing semantic, which for items prevents identically named  items in the same scope, but allows block-nested shadowing in all cases
[15:21:48] <pnkfelix> nmatsakis: BTW, shouldn't the r+ on gh23606 wait until beta is actually cut?  (Or has it now?)

[18:14:19] <seanmonstar> im thinking i just need to alter Connector to return a Box<Stream> itself
[18:14:41] <nmatsakis> seanmonstar: so...in your original example, the code did compile,
[18:14:45] <nmatsakis> seanmonstar: so I'm confused now :)
[18:14:57] <nmatsakis> seanmonstar: you just want me to fill in the fn so it compiles?
[18:15:04] <aturon> acrichto: i suspect the commenter was looking at a stale version (cc steveklabnik)
[18:15:10] <seanmonstar> nmatsakis: i'll write some more
[18:15:48] <aturon> semarie: i think we're probably going to pull directly from master for the next couple weeks of updates, before switching to cherry picking. (assuming that the next couple weeks will be very focused on polish)
[18:15:52] <simukis> SYN whoever wrote release notes
[18:16:07] <nmatsakis> seanmonstar: e.g. http://is.gd/2ZzkXQ ?
[18:16:27] <simukis> I’ve been mentioned twice 😉 I don’t care enough to fix it myself, but feel free to remove one entry if you feel like it
[18:16:48] <aturon> brson: i don't have a strong opinion. looks like the doc thing was a false alarm, though, so maybe no need to rush.
[18:17:29] <seanmonstar> nmatsakis: http://is.gd/D1y1RS
[18:18:01] <brson> simukis: that was totally intentional to honour your hard hard work
[18:18:14] <nmatsakis> seanmonstar: you need some kind of adapter; you have a Connector that returns some random type S, but you need it to return an object (which means it'll ahve to build a vtable and stuff) -- let me show you...
[18:18:34] <seanmonstar> nmatsakis: i have a trait bound on the associated type: Stream...
[18:18:55] <seanmonstar> nmatsakis: in the end, i need a some Connector that can return Streams, but i dont care which they are
[18:19:27] <seanmonstar> i've been playing with making some sort of adapter, and cant get one working without knowing the exact Stream type somewhere
[18:20:45] <seanmonstar> easiest (for me) is to change Connector to return Box<Stream>. but if its possible, i'd rather box it myself instead of making all implementations Box (and then whats the point of an associated type)
[18:21:44] <simukis> brson: thanks! 😃d
[18:23:15] <wycats> steveklabnik: I'm on draft 3
[18:23:27] <wycats> will finally file this weekend
[18:23:36] <steveklabnik> nice :)

[18:26:39] <nmatsakis> seanmonstar: ok so there are some annoying lifetime issues -- this compiles http://is.gd/RL0HkC but i'm not sure why the c:'static is needed actually, I think it relates to some rules I wanted to revisit
[18:27:36] <nmatsakis> seanmonstar: sorry, slightly simplified http://is.gd/q6qhkL
[18:27:53] <nmatsakis> seanmonstar: the S: 'static in the trait is needed because if you want to convert to Box<Stream> it can't have borrowed pointers in the object

[18:29:22] <nmatsakis> seanmonstar: the C:'static is needed for same reason; it's being converted into an object in the return

[18:29:37] <brson> ugh spurious

[18:30:23] <seanmonstar> brson: hyper is in there twice? 0.3.9 and 0.3.8
[18:30:34] <brson> seanmonstar: just because i have results for both
[18:30:56] <seanmonstar> ah, ok. i thought 0.3.8 didn't compile on beta
[18:32:01] <brson> seanmonstar: it doesn't...
[18:32:13] <brson> oh, hyper is listed as a fail
[18:32:13] <seanmonstar> oh, non-root failure
[18:32:32] <seanmonstar> non root means dependency?
[18:32:42] <brson> yeah something upstream also fails

[18:32:59] <brson> the link shows the build output

[19:33:22] <Eridius> aturon: I think the only workaround I can do is make my API start returning Rc<io::Error> instead. The use-case here is an API that writes structured data, and if any write fails, I need all subsequent writes to fail (because any subsequent writes would produce a bad structure)
[19:33:32] *** Joins: Rym (y@moz-o8t.887.55.31.IP)
[19:33:32] <Eridius> so what I was doing was holding onto the error and cloning it for the return value of each API

[20:01:35] <bluss> Eridius: do you need to repeat the same error? Just thinking, maybe it's irrelevant, but if the user doesn't handle the error the first time it is returned, does it matter to repeat it; you could return a placeholder indicating there was a previous error
[20:01:57] <Eridius> acrichto, aturon: I just commented on #23919 (the PR that removed io::Error's Clone impl) with an alternative suggestion: io::Error could just use Rc to hold the trait object, thus recovering the ability to Clone
[20:02:15] <Eridius> bluss: hrm, I suppose that is an alternative suggestion. Maybe I should just implement that for now, as it means not changing my API
[20:02:27] *** Joins: meteredsection- (meteredsect@moz-3l4.eb4.227.173.IP)
[20:03:02] <Eridius> although it's not great, because right now you could just ignore the intermediate errors and then handle the error when calling .close(), but if I make it return a different error it means you lose all the info as to what went wrong when using the .close() error
[20:03:20] *** Joins: dcb (textual@moz-ifd.223.170.166.IP)
[20:04:02] <Eridius> this would be perhaps a bit nicer if there was some concept of an io::ConcreteError which doesn't have the trait object, and io::Error just wraps either that or a custom trait object error, which would let my API hold onto the ConcreteError and re-wrap that in an io::Error each time. But I don't think that's a particularly good API to use in general

[22:55:03] <aturon> acrichto: are you open to a "conservative" impl of Eq for io::Error? (cc mitsuhiko)
[22:55:58] <Eridius> aturon: are you suggesting that io::Error would consider two custom errors to never be equal?
[22:56:14] <acrichto> aturon: yes
[22:56:16] <aturon> Eridius: yeah. not ideal, of course
[22:56:34] <acrichto> aturon: although well
[22:56:37] <Eridius> who actually uses Eq on io::Error?
[22:56:39] <acrichto> that seems not very useful
[22:56:44] <Eridius> comparing ErrorKind seems useful, but Eq, not so much
[22:56:44] <acrichto> unless you're using #[derive(Eq)]
[22:56:55] <aturon> Eridius: mitsuhiko was asking about it for unit tests. but yes, good point
[22:57:02] <acrichto> aturon: what about equating on only ErrorKind?
[22:57:09] <aturon> +1
[22:57:16] <acrichto> not sure if all instances of Other shoudl be equal
[22:57:22] <Eridius> acrichto: I'd consider it an error for two io::Error values to compare as equal when they contain different custom errors
[22:57:23] <mitsuhiko> acrichto: that's basically what i implemented currently
[22:57:24] <acrichto> they rpobably should be for tests at least
[22:57:27] <mitsuhiko> (for my own errors)
[22:57:46] <aturon> maybe the simplest thing is to recommend people extract the kind for comparison
[22:57:56] <Eridius> I'm very much in favor of saying "just use kind"
[22:58:00] <aturon> rather than advertise the type as PartialEq/Eq with caveats
[22:58:23] <aturon> Eridius: mitsuhiko: nice to have both of you back around, btw!
[22:58:45] <mitsuhiko> Eridius: the main issue with that is comparing Results in unittests
[22:58:52] <Eridius> assert_eq!(foo().map_err(io::Error::kind), io::ErrorKind::NotFound)
[22:59:09] <Eridius> aturon: :) I still don't have much time but I'm trying to slowly start paying attention again
[22:59:20] <mitsuhiko> Eridius: that becomes tedious when working with cause() on an outer error
[22:59:29] <mitsuhiko> i have zero problem with IoError *directly*
[22:59:37] <mitsuhiko> but it becomes a pain if you have an error that contains an IoError
[23:00:14] <Eridius> if you're using cause() you're using a &Error trait object anyway, so how are you expecting to compare that with a concrete io::Error?

[23:01:35] <mitsuhiko> Eridius: i am not doing that
[23:01:46] <mitsuhiko> i just happen to carry an IoError
[23:02:02] <mitsuhiko> which means I can no longer use deriving(PartialEq, Eq)
[23:02:13] *** Quits: blaenk (blaenkdenum@moz-em283u.res.rr.com) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[23:02:38] <Eridius> mitsuhiko: there's an old issue about being able to customize the deriving process. That would be the ideal solution here, to be able to mark that field as something to skip in the Eq/PartialEq test
[23:02:54] <Eridius> (or to somehow provide a custom equality test for that field while still deriving the rest of the impl)
[23:03:54] <Eridius> acrichto, aturon: Any thoughts on making io::Error use Arc<Error+Send+Sync> instead of Box<Error+Send>? That would recover the Clone implj
[23:05:04] <frewsxcv> mitsuhiko: you're talking about io::Error and not IoError, right?
[23:05:34] <acrichto> Eridius: perhaps, but I feel like the Sync requirement is leaking too many impl details
