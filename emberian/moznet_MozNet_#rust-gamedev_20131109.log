[22:44:19] <bjz> yuriks: o/
[22:45:43] <yuriks> bjz: hey
[22:47:52] <yuriks> currently trying to figure out why internalFormat in glTexImage2D is GLint, not GLenum
[22:48:31] <yuriks> doesn't seem to be any good reason for it
[22:49:11] <yuriks> ah, deprecated crap
[22:49:45] <bjz> yuriks: if you have an issue with it, it's probably with the spec
[22:49:54] <bjz> :)
[22:49:56] <yuriks> yeah it is
[22:50:11] <bjz> silly C with its implicit conversions
[22:50:25] <yuriks> it used to be it accepted 1-4 as aliases for GL_LUMINANCE, GL_LUMINANCE_ALPHA, GL_RGB and GL_RGBA
[22:50:55] <bjz> and silly opengl for relying on them
[22:52:26] <bjz> yuriks: I'm also interested in working on a rendering engine
[22:52:52] <bjz> I'm currently playing with: https://github.com/bjz/gfx-rs/
[22:53:00] <bjz> not much done on it yet though
[22:59:01] <yuriks> feels familiar :)
[22:59:09] <yuriks> I've been through a lot of that, but using C++
[22:59:32] <yuriks> in the end I never god something I was happy with
[23:02:02] <yuriks> regarding the handle-based API, loss of the pointed to object is usually regarded to be acceptable in that context
[23:02:09] <yuriks> so you just don't draw the object, or w/e
[23:13:25] <bjz> ok
[23:13:39] <bjz> yuriks: would you fail, or just ignore it?
[23:13:45] <yuriks> just ignore
[23:13:51] <bjz> or emit a debug message?
[23:13:57] <yuriks> possibly replace it with a dummy resource of some sort
[23:14:12] <yuriks> like Source's pink-checkerboard or ERROR mesh
[23:14:40] <yuriks> debug messages, maybe, not sure
[23:15:24] <bjz> yuriks: I'm working on a DataManager1..20. Then you would embed it in a wrapper to access stuff nicer
[23:15:45] <bjz> generated using macros
[23:15:56] <yuriks> well, it's probably a good idea, then you wouldn't have people actually relying on null handles
[23:16:08] <yuriks> bjz: what would that do?
[23:16:21] <cmr> oh the pink-checkerboard, I know you so well
[23:16:57] <bjz> so it would allow you to have struct DataManagerN { field0: ~[T], field1: ~[T], ..., fieldn: ~[T] }
[23:17:03] <yuriks> this is the object pool I use: https://github.com/yuriks/libyuriks/blob/master/memory/ObjectPool.hpp
[23:17:19] <bjz> oh ok
[23:17:21] <bjz> cheers
[23:17:29] <yuriks> ah, to SoA-fy it, I see
[23:17:38] <bjz> if you have any suggestions, let me know
[23:17:47] <yuriks> yup
[23:18:09] <yuriks> I'm not that familiar with Rust yet, so I don't really know what's possible to do in it, regarding abstractions and architecture
[23:18:31] <bjz> we don't have very advanced metaprogramming
[23:19:12] <bjz> ie. CTFE or contants in type parameter lists, or dependent types
[23:19:28] <bjz> or variadic type args
[23:19:50] <bjz> so you have to generate stuff using macros, usually
[23:19:59] <yuriks> hmm
[23:20:06] <bjz> unfortunately
[23:20:11] <yuriks> my vector and matrix classes would likely suffer
[23:20:20] <bjz> I have cgmath-rs btw
[23:20:30] <yuriks> gonna take a look at it
[23:20:32] <bjz> still needs work
[23:20:41] <bjz> look in the notice ^
[23:20:49] <bjz> lots of resources there
[23:22:34] <bjz> yuriks: kvark and h3r3tic have been using cgmath, as have I - it seems to work ok
[23:22:41] <bjz> :)
[23:23:08] <bjz> still not entirely happy with the api - much that could be improved
[23:23:38] <yuriks> wee, I definitly can't read rust macros ;D
[23:24:02] <bjz> it gets easier :)
[23:24:14] <bjz> much safer than the C preprocessor
[23:24:21] <cmr> and more powerful
[23:24:22] <bjz> it works on ASTs
[23:24:23] <cmr> and prettier
[23:24:36] <cmr> well
[23:24:52] <cmr> more powerful in different ways. can't do pure-text replacement (somewhat) unfortunately.
[23:24:54] <bjz> it can't replace templates though, because it works before the typechecker
[23:25:15] <cmr> bjz: are templates supposed to be syntactic abstraction?
[23:25:47] <bjz> cmr: templates a duck typed
[23:25:49] <yuriks> not a big fan of the 'methods' style you're using for vector
[23:25:59] <bjz> yuriks: yeah, me niether
[23:26:00] <yuriks> imo, dot(v1, v2) > v1.dot(v2)
[23:26:15] <bjz> yuriks: I'm planning to add wrapper fns
[23:26:19] <yuriks> normalized(v1), etc.
[23:26:27] <bjz> haven't got around to it yet
[23:26:30] <bjz> :P
[23:27:07] <bjz> cmr: templates are ducktyped, which is part of the reason you get such horrible compile time errors
[23:27:22] <bjz> cmr: but it also makes them super powerful for code gen
[23:27:52] <yuriks> as akward as it may be to express, hehe
[23:28:42] <yuriks> but yeah, lack of decent metaprogramming is one of my major gripes. I've struggled to design a passable RTTI and reflection framework for my things
[23:29:11] <yuriks> couple that with allocation strategies that aren't just "new everything and add to a global manager" and things get complicated to think about...
[23:29:48] <yuriks> this is some code that I am at the same time pretty proud and ashamed of: https://github.com/yuriks/Bloody3D/tree/master/src/serialization
[23:29:51] <yuriks> :P
[23:30:06] <bjz> cmr: so basically, say I had: struct A; impl A { fn foo(&self) {} } struct B; impl B { fn foo(&self) {} } template<T> fn bar(thing: T) { T::foo(&self) } bar(A)
[23:31:35] <bjz> cmr: then if I had a type C which didn't impl a method foo in scope, I would get a compile time error: struct C; bar(C) // big error
[23:32:41] <bjz> cmr: but the nice thing is that your things can be more flexible - with traits/typeclasses your apis are very brittle
[23:32:58] <bjz> yuriks: does that explain things?
[23:33:10] <bjz> yuriks: I might not have it correct
[23:33:25] <yuriks> I think so. Not sure how to read that pseudo-Rust though :)
[23:33:37] <bjz> yuriks: yeah, sorry :P
[23:34:17] <yuriks> the lack of strong typing in templates means all interfaces are convention based
[23:34:22] <bjz> yuriks: it would make more sense if you had overloading
[23:34:47] <bjz> yeah, things should get tonss better with concepts/template constraints in C++14
[23:35:39] <yuriks> I think it got dropped again
[23:35:44] <bjz> really?
[23:35:44] <yuriks> they're gonna release it as a TR
[23:35:49] <bjz> ugh
[23:36:03] <yuriks> std::optional got dropped too -_-
[23:36:10] <bjz> yuriks: when did you hear that?'
[23:36:43] <yuriks> probably in one of Herb Sutter's talks
[23:37:30] <bjz> yuriks: Bjarne was talking about it in GoingNative this year
[23:37:46] <bjz> dunno if that was before/after you heard that
[23:37:54] <yuriks> oh, dynarray went, too
[23:38:01] <yuriks> which is a shame, I wanted that
[23:38:03] <bjz> heh
[23:38:19] <bjz> so are you testing the waters with Rust?
[23:39:05] <yuriks> yup
[23:39:15] <yuriks> my idea is to write a simple roguelike or such
[23:39:18] <bjz> how did you hear about it?
[23:39:27] <bjz> what interests you about it?
[23:39:43] <yuriks> and since I dislike ncurses that means implementing a simpled libtcod xD
[23:39:58] <bjz> heh, neat!
[23:40:11] <bjz> yay for NIH
[23:40:23] <yuriks> Heard about it... don't really remember. I first tried it when 0.7 was released and was promptly turned away by the iterators mess
[23:40:32] <bjz> hah
[23:40:40] <bjz> yeah it was an ugly transition
[23:40:59] <bjz> shame we couldn't get the new syntax for 0.7
[23:41:11] <bjz> but it's there now, thanfully
[23:41:16] <bjz> *thankfully
[23:41:39] <yuriks> and it interests me because it's a language with value semantics and emphasis on paying attention to ownership and allocation, instead of throwing caution to the GC
[23:41:48] <bjz> yeah
[23:41:51] <yuriks> you know, for a change :P
[23:42:14] <bjz> it's ridiculous nobody has done it before, besides MLkit and Cyclone
[23:42:24] <bjz> all these wannabe C++ killers
[23:43:36] <bjz> also in terms of unboxed, nicely aligned types, and monomorphisation
[23:45:15] <bjz> Rust really is one of the first to take on C++ on its own turf. It still lags behind on the the abstraction front though. I doubt it will ever be as expressive as C++ in that respect, but that may be a good thing. But a bit more of an improvement would be nice.
[23:45:29] <bjz> (or expressive as D)
[23:47:07] <bjz> yuriks: here was the kind of thing I was thinking of for the data manager: https://gist.github.com/bjz/b3905d522006c59a554f
[23:47:54] <cmr> bjz: right, I'm just saying: macros aren't *supposed* to do what templates do. Entirely different problemset.
[23:48:11] <bjz> cmr: yeah, completely agree
[23:48:15] <yuriks> bjz: you repeated dm14 several times on the 'instantiations'. I assume that wasn't intended
[23:48:37] <bjz> yuriks: woops, you're right!
[23:48:56] <bjz> yuriks: one of the reasons I hate copy/paste code
[23:49:14] <bjz> yuriks: that's what good metaprogramming is for
[23:49:43] <bjz> I also missed out exporting dm16-dm20
[23:50:08] <bjz> yuriks: the modules are needed because of an unfixed bug with macros
[23:52:23] <bjz> yuriks: but yeah, don't let my rants about metaprogramming dissude you, the devs are well aware of it, and generally I think the tradeoffs are worth it
[23:53:17] <bjz> yuriks: in terms of living without it for now - the things rust brings to the table outweighs the disadvantages
[23:56:21] <cmr> bjz: I don't get the feeling that the devs are *happy* with the current situation, just that other things are more important for 1.0 and that any extra meta-things will be backwards-compat (ie, CTFE, variadics)
[23:56:37] <bjz> cmr: yeah defs
[23:56:51] <bjz> cmr: more important to get to 1.0
[23:57:04] <cmr> bjz: did you see that multiple lifetimes landed today!?
[23:57:07] <cmr> 'self is no longer special
[23:57:10] <bjz> !!!
[23:57:12] <bjz> YAY
[23:57:24] <cmr> It missed the TWiR PR cutoff by a few hours :(
[23:57:33] <bjz> heh
