[00:01:47] <larsberg> jack: I think I figured out what the right fix is for our shutdown freeze. Right now, if script gets a window.close, it tries to shut down the associated pipeline. but, that's normally done via the constellation when the compositor is shutting down and it's pretty easy to clean up so that window.close goes through the same shutdown sequence as all the normal
[00:01:47] <larsberg> ones
[00:02:29] <larsberg> of course, it leads to a "task 'LayoutTask' failed at 'RefCell<T> already borrowed'" in initialize_layout_data, so it's not *quite* as easy as I'd hoped :-)

[05:25:19] <jdm> pcwalton: so there's a snag with the Encodable thing
[05:25:25] <pcwalton> jdm: what's up?
[05:25:28] <jdm> in particular, derive does not like cycles
[05:25:29] <jdm> at all
[05:26:02] <jdm> Window -> Document -> Page -> Frame -> Window
[05:26:12] <pcwalton> is one of those cycle links a JSManaged?
[05:26:26] <jdm> pcwalton: not at the moment, but they will be
[05:26:46] * pcwalton thinks
[05:27:12] <pcwalton> so I would think that the Encodable implementation for JSManaged would just not continue traversing
[05:27:34] <pcwalton> because once you've hit a JSManaged you don't need to go any further; the JS engine will call the trace hook
[05:28:10] <jdm> pcwalton: I was under the impression that the trace hooks would just call the encoder
[05:28:14] <jdm> perhaps I have that backwards
[05:28:23] <pcwalton> oh, they do
[05:28:35] *** Joins: dbaron (dbaron@moz-A9D01D68.dsl.dynamic.sonic.net)
[05:28:40] <pcwalton> but I think once you hit a JSManaged it calls jscontext->trace() or whatever it is
[05:28:42] <pcwalton> and then stops
[05:28:52] <pcwalton> jscontext->trace(self)
[05:28:55] <pcwalton> to be more specific
[05:29:26] <pcwalton> and I assumed once you did that, the JS engine would say "aha, ok, that is live" and then invoke the trace hook on that object recursively, if it hasn't been traced yet
[05:29:34] <jdm> that's a good point
[05:30:03] <jdm> I guess encodable needs to wait until everything's converted, then :(
[05:30:21] <jdm> except, hmm
[05:30:45] <jdm> if we trace the global, why do we not hit the same problem?
[05:30:46] <pcwalton> well, you could use a special DontTraceThis<T> newtype wrapper

[05:31:20] <pcwalton> you mean why don't we hit it today?
[05:31:22] <jdm> so we do its trace hook
[05:31:24] *** Quits: marcosc (marcosc@moz-B9805BF7.dsl.telepac.pt) (Ping timeout)
[05:31:26] <jdm> no, I mean why won't we hit the same problem
[05:31:48] <jdm> trace the Page, which isn't jsmanaged, trace the frame which isn't jsmanaged
[05:32:13] <pcwalton> are there any cycles that don't go through JSManaged?
[05:32:13] <jdm> oh, the important bit I missed
[05:32:18] <jdm> "hasn't been traced yet"
[05:32:22] <pcwalton> yeah
[05:32:26] <jdm> makes sense
[05:32:35] <pcwalton> I would hope the JS GC just won't trace it if it's marked black already

[14:14:58] <Ms2ger> Do you have a replaceChild for me on this beautiful day? :)
[14:15:07] * abinader wonders if the qualified name parser from style/selectors would suit the requirement to parse name/qname in http://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#dom-domimplementation-createdocumenttype
[14:15:37] <abinader> Ms2ger: almost there :-) gotta find the best solution for parsing name/qualified name
[14:15:48] <Ms2ger> I think there's something
[14:16:00] <Ms2ger> In... dom/bindings/utils?
[14:16:21] <abinader> lemme check
[14:16:53] <jgraham> Yeah, you don't need to go into style for that
[14:18:44] <Ms2ger> Anyway, going to get some work done
[14:19:46] <abinader> alright, thanks folks :)
[14:20:00] <abinader> Ms2ger: I'll be uploading the patch later today :-)

[17:26:59] <jack> not sure how thrilled i am about hardcoding servo path knowledge.
[17:27:06] <zmike> I agree
[17:27:08] <jack> but i'm not sure what else to do either other than wholesale move to cmake.
[17:27:17] <zmike> it's the only solution for the current build system
[17:27:41] <zmike> as I said in the other ticket, I think it's a better choice to fix things in the existing system than to just wait until someone changes to cmake
[17:29:20] <jack> why is the target phony? :)
[17:29:43] <jack> that looks like the only bug.
[17:30:57] <jack> can you fix that and i'll r+ it?

[20:25:41] <jdm> I really appreciate that the allocation header for some ~ types has now been removed in rust
[20:25:48] <jdm> that's just one more impediment to upgrading :)
[20:26:16] <jdm> we're either going to be waiting to upgrade until the complete JSManaged transition is achieved, or none of it
[20:26:17] <Ms2ger> Is that what we had the @int for?
[20:26:27] <jdm> Ms2ger: well, the @int doesn't work anymore
[20:26:38] <jdm> so it's now impossible to have a mixture of JSManaged and non
