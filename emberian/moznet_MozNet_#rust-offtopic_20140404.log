[06:39:46] <Eridius> ChrisMorgan: I'm apparently missing the context of bstrie and monads
[06:39:57] <ChrisMorgan> Eridius: it was the HKT thread on reddit
[06:40:27] <ChrisMorgan> I got downvoted for a while (ended up +ve again) saying I didn't like monads in Rust for marketing reasons. bstrie holds that position also, fiercely.
[06:40:35] * ChrisMorgan is heading off right now
[06:41:08] <Eridius> huh, somehow I marked that thread as read without actually reading it

[06:47:09] <eddyb> ah he left
[06:47:15] <eddyb> I was going to say I blame the article writer for that
[06:47:24] <eddyb> quite poor IMO
[06:47:48] <eddyb> the HKT pseudosyntax he demonstrated wasn't really meaningful
[06:47:50] <cmr> it's not his fault
[06:48:00] <cmr> bstrie just hates monads.
[06:48:06] <cmr> violently.
[06:48:11] <eddyb> want an example? use Functor. people don't just hate on functors
[06:48:16] <cmr> bstrie does.
[06:48:24] <cmr> not even joking here :P
[06:48:41] <eddyb> cmr: well, ChrisMorgan's reaction could have been different, given a better article
[06:48:47] <cmr> perhaps
[06:48:54] <cmr> go write one yourself, you bum :p
[06:50:42] <eddyb> trait<*> Functor {fn map<T, U>(self: Self<T>, f: |T| -> U) -> Self<U>;} impl Functor for Option {fn map<T, U>(self: Option<T>, f: |T| -> U) -> Option<U> {match self {Some(x) => Some(f(x)), None => None}}}
[06:51:05] <eddyb> and you can also implement it for Vec<T> as .move_iter().map(f).collect()
[06:51:26] <eddyb> there, nicely contained example with no monadic hate
[06:51:44] <eddyb> cmr: but, I've got things to do!
[06:51:48] <eddyb> and soon, places to be
[06:52:02] <cmr> I perfer places to do, things to be
[06:52:24] <cmr> the similar phrase involving "people" is somewhat more crude ;0
[06:52:26] <cmr> ;)
[06:52:38] <eddyb> haha
[06:53:04] <eddyb> "things to be" hmm
[06:53:08] <eddyb> cmr: have you played the accurate bitcoin simulator?
[06:53:12] <cmr> no
[06:53:25] <eddyb> http://www.beepboopbitcoin.com/
[06:53:46] <cmr> ohh one of these-style games.
[06:54:25] <eddyb> this one has a twist
[06:54:54] <cmr> that it's railing on bitcoin? :p
[06:58:38] <cmr> uhhh
[06:58:42] <cmr> it seems to be buggy
[06:58:50] <cmr> in that I can buy bitcoin with 0 USD
[06:59:47] <Eridius> sweet, mining repeatedly loses more fiat dollars
[07:00:11] <cmr> Ah
[07:00:13] <cmr> You have lost a net 563.06 fiat dollars.
[07:00:16] <cmr> there it's accounted
[07:02:05] <Eridius> On bitbuddychat there's a discussion about a book by Ayn Rand. It is about the problems of society. It involves super metals, perpetual motion machines, and cloaking devices. It says that all the smart people should stop working, because this would cause society to collapse and millions of people to die. The book says this is okay, because they have it coming. The book is a work of fiction but some people regard it as a major work of philosophy. ...
[07:02:11] <Eridius> ... Ayn Rand seems to be popular with people who are involved in bitcoin.
[07:03:23] <Eridius> aww man, I tried to buy a dozen bitcoins at $1 USD and ended up buying them at, like $21
[07:03:27] <Eridius> what a terrible exchange
[07:03:43] <cmr> yeah it takes like 3-4 days for it to go through
[07:04:37] <Eridius> I assume the ASIC never arrives?
[07:04:44] <Eridius> oph snap!
[07:04:45] <Eridius> just got it
[07:04:47] <cmr> :p
[07:04:53] <Eridius> only took 21 weeks
[07:04:55] <cmr> hahahahah
[07:05:01] <cmr> the investment tab is great
[07:05:11] <Eridius> wat, why'd the ASIC stop
[07:05:29] <Eridius> aww crap BTC just skyrocketed
[07:05:30] <Eridius> and I had none
[07:05:37] <Eridius> too busy looking at the asic
[07:05:52] <Eridius> hrm, I think bitcoin transactions are now delayed a full week
[07:06:20] <Eridius> why did the whole page just go black except for the buttons?
[07:06:40] <Eridius> and now those are gone too
[07:06:46] <Eridius> wait, homeless?! I was only $4k in debt!
[07:06:52] <Eridius> oh my house burned down
[07:07:07] <Eridius> how the hell did the ASIC burn my house down?
[07:08:06] <cmr> very, very carefully.
[07:09:12] <Eridius> The road runs west toward the edge of town and west toward the heart of downtown
[07:09:18] <Eridius> nice geography
[07:09:34] <cmr> lol
[07:15:15] <Eridius> woohoo I won
[07:15:51] <cmr> "You're the world's first digital cryptohuman. You're the blockchain made flesh. You're the incarnation of Satoshi's collective unconscious."

[07:55:30] <eddyb> pretty sure I did "go hut" or something like that for five times
[07:55:33] <cmr> you have to go to the food kitchen, eat the pork, and then walk around.

[07:55:55] <eddyb> oh?
[07:56:01] <eddyb> I thought the hut was essential
[07:56:11] <eddyb> I moved a lot after eating the pork and going into the hut
