[00:00:38] <Ilari> bascule: Also, how to ensure that the sample of certificates in "website reputation" is representative?
[00:02:14] <Ilari> It occurs to me that one could use that against CT if one doesn't have HSTS-CT.
[00:05:33] <Ilari> Or HPKP should also be able to deal with that attack.
[00:07:13] <Ilari> The reason for that "yay" comment is that it is nice to have backup firepower (especially higher-caliber stuff).

[00:35:23] <Ilari> Haha, lawsuit about car cyber-insecurity.
[00:37:11] <Ilari> One might not be able to do anything dangerous (just annoying) by hacking into elevator controls. But hacking into important control buses of cars is quite dangerous.
[00:38:30] <Ilari> E.g. being able to do "Speed III". Which puts not just the people inside hacked car into danger, but also others nearby.
[00:41:35] <Ilari> Even cars with quite dinky engines can reach 100mph (160km/h). Which is quite a bit faster than any speed limit for cars (and speed-unlimited stuff is rare). If engine is decent (like it often is with the kinds of cars without obvious ways to shut the thing down), the top speed is much higher.
[00:44:07] <Ilari> Also reminds me of police patrol being so amazed at some very dinky Lada managing 105km/h upslope that they forgot to notify the second patrol ahead.

[01:47:07] <Ilari> I would expect full standards to be actually "battle-tested" stuff.

[01:49:37] <bascule> I know Nadim pinned himself into a corner with HPKP ;)
[01:50:04] <Ilari> It was probably before they deployed DNSSEC (fat-fingered DNS zonefile).
[01:51:13] <Ilari> Also, on DNS top level, gTLDs have rules to play with. ccTLDs don't.
[01:53:02] <Ilari> E.g. Can't have top-level address records. Can't have top-level wildcards.
[01:53:26] <Ilari> Can't just suddenly pop up out of nowhere.
[01:54:51] <Ilari> Basically, don't screw around with two-letter names under search root.
[02:01:38] <Ilari> If then goal is "secured (C/I) communications channel" One can definitely simplify TLS quite a bit. But if goal is "secured (I) DNS", I don't know how much DNSSEC can actually be simplified.
[02:02:06] <Ilari> ... Sure, DNSSEC has at least some crap on it.
[02:03:41] <Ilari> E.g. Bad crypto algorithms and NSEC vs. NSEC3.
[02:09:42] <Ilari> Whereas TLS has: Bad crypto algorithms, bad crypto constructs, incomprehensible trust models, bad implementation boobytraps, really annoying data models, etc
[02:11:51] <Ilari> Open problems in computation: What is the computational complexity class of verifying an X.509 certificate chain of trust?
[02:14:18] <Ilari> I would be quite surprised if it was anything less than NPC. And REC wouldn't be too surprising.

[02:15:52] <Ilari> Of course, once a software tries to verify trust chains like that, almost invariably result will be: 1) Lockup, 2) Crash or 3) Error.

[22:45:38] <Ilari> At least it isn't complicated saturated arithmetic like in OpenSSL.
[22:47:17] <Dcoder> saturated tends to have smaller kernels, due to more regularity
[22:55:18] <Ilari> Also, carries in saturated tend to mess with high-performance CPUs.
[23:00:22] <Dcoder> sure, and table-based AES is also faster than the contortions used to make it constant-time
[23:00:29] <Dcoder> performance is not really my point
[23:01:33] <Dcoder> i mean, the whole point of this edwards/montgomery business is to simplify implementations

[23:40:15] <Dcoder> there was a crypto challenge a couple of weeks ago on boston key party ctf that involved doing something similar
[23:40:27] <Dcoder> recovering N from a partially leaked private key
[23:40:36] <Dcoder> err recovering the factors, not N
[23:41:19] <Dcoder> there was also a twist-insecure curve to exploit, that was cool too
[23:43:53] <Ilari> Also, recently someone asked me feedback about some "homegrown" encryption stuff (using Chacha20 and HMAC-MD5(!)). That got broken pretty quick...
[23:44:18] <tiffany> what the
[23:48:08] <Dcoder> heh
[23:49:15] <Ilari> Best attack: Recovering one complete plaintext lets one forge arbitrary plaintexts.
[23:53:48] <Ilari> Also, 1) Derive initial nonce using KDF from master key, or 2) Derive initial nonce in way that passive attacker can recover? :-P
