[00:32:11] <larsberg> jack: test_empty_clientrect is failing because the call to getBoundingClientRects comes in and queries the layout_task before we've performed layout. So self.display_list is still None, but the contentboxquery code blindly tries to unwrap it
[00:32:34] <jack> so it's not correctly waiting on layout to finish?
[00:32:55] <aydinkim> pcwalton: ping
[00:33:14] <larsberg> that's what I suspect; i thought we fired off an initial layout and script would wait for it, but the query is coming in before we even start layout. will report when I learn more :-)

[00:39:31] <aydinkim> pcwalton: Can you just suggest us the best way to implement that? I'm now trying to implment with making list flow. Is it right?
[00:39:42] <patrickkim> :)
[00:41:17] <pcwalton> are lists just blocks with generated content?
[00:41:53] <jdm> oops, I'll review 1409 tonight
[00:42:37] <aydinkim> pcwaltion: yes. It is very similar to block. but It needs to know the style and attr information of its parents. 
[00:43:27] <aydinkim> pcwalton: pcwalton: In the webkit, It is inherited from block.
[00:43:59] <pcwalton> aydinkim: ah, my inclination just tells me to make another flag on block
[00:44:03] <pcwalton> we already have one for is_float
[00:44:05] <pcwalton> is_list sounds good to me
[00:47:19] <aydinkim> pcwalton: I have thought about like your suggestion. However, probably the list may have float style also. Can we handle that in all cases of complex cases? 
[00:47:50] *** Joins: jet (jet@moz-79F891EE.hsd1.ca.comcast.net)
[00:48:55] <pcwalton> I think we probably need to introduce a bitfield

[00:49:06] <pcwalton> which handles these complex sets of flags
[00:49:11] <pcwalton> webkit has bitfields all over the place for this
[00:49:15] <pcwalton> we have a bitfield! macro

[00:52:49] <aydinkim> pcwalton: pcwalton: yes, and probably webkit uses RTTI. Webkit has renderBlock, renderList, renderTable separately. you think we don't need to do that like webkit?
[00:53:27] <pcwalton> for tables I think we probably do need a separate flow type, but for lists I don't think so
[00:53:34] <pcwalton> maybe once Rust gets more inheritance support
[00:53:45] <pcwalton> but IMHO WebKit's hierarchies are too deep
[00:53:51] <pcwalton> let's try to keep it simple for now
[00:53:57] <pcwalton> we can always refactor later

[00:57:24] *** Quits: miketaylr (mtaylor@moz-8ACC7131.dyn.grandenetworks.net) (Quit: Leaving...)
[00:57:37] <pcwalton> in general flows are independent for parallelism reasons, but you can import the information to a child flow from the parent during construction
[00:57:56] <pcwalton> when the flow is constructed, have it fetch the information from its parent DOM node and stuff it into the flow
[00:58:14] <pcwalton> that helps parallelism since the layout itself will be independent from the DOM

[01:55:01] <jack> jdm: i have to rebase over teh android stuff to pick that up. so hopefully 1409 will be ready shortly after :)
[01:58:03] <larsberg> jack: the crash on exit in all of the content tests is because the script task is exiting before the constellation has finished sending all of the messages (e.g., ResizedWindow) to the script task
[01:58:21] <jack> is that a different bug than 1409?
[01:58:25] <larsberg> yes
[01:58:40] <larsberg> 1409 is the specific failure on getClientRect
[01:58:57] <larsberg> the tests still "pass" with this error, though
[01:59:14] <larsberg> it happens after all of the content the harness cares about has been checked :-)
[01:59:39] <jack> if you want to take a crack and fixing it quick, that'd be fine. otherwise just file it and we'll do it post-upgrade.
[01:59:47] <jack> did you check the reftest failures at all?
[02:00:08] <larsberg> have not started looking into them, but I can
[02:00:42] <larsberg> at least on the content ones, I'm definitely in favor of landing the upgrade asap and leaving the issues for us to handle in the usual way

[02:28:12] <jack> i can start landing submodule patches later tonight once i make sure i didn't break anything in android-land
[02:30:11] <larsberg> jack: sounds great. content tests will need that change to make sure that script doesn't exit until after the constellation is done sending messages (or it needs to stop sending messages after script has told it that it's shutting down)

[15:17:09] <SimonSapin> oh, that’s the same you said
[15:17:55] <larsberg> You guys just ruined my morning - I was overwhelmed enough just getting up to speed with all the corner cases with *being* standards compliant...
[15:19:01] <larsberg> and it's an interesting difference from yesterday's discussion on #research about how we could "carefully break" rendering web pages when either layout crashed or was taking pathologically long (e.g., by re-starting layout/rendering without certain features enabled)
[15:19:14] <jgraham> Quirks mode is just another standard
[15:19:16] <SimonSapin> being standards compliant != render documents in "standards mode"
[15:19:42] <jgraham> http://quirks.spec.whatwg.org/
[15:19:46] <Ms2ger> Being standards compliant \ni quirks mode :)
[15:20:37] <jgraham> (FWIW http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/mama-key-findings/ says 85% quirks mode, which is way higher than the other source for the same time period)
[15:21:03] <larsberg> jgraham: thanks for the link - that's not as bad as I'd feared
[15:21:18] <Ms2ger> What, 85%?
[15:22:20] <larsberg> the whatwg spec link - I was slow at typing this morning
[15:23:21] <SimonSapin> larsberg: there is some in HTML as well, eg. http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/selectors.html#case-sensitivity
[15:25:40] *** ahal is now known as ahal|brb
[15:26:48] <larsberg> SimonSapin: hrm, I wonder if there's a good way to factor out some of that code for per-mode rendering instead of sprinkling conditionals throughout. if we had ML structures, I'd try to functorize the code over rendering modes. Or is the amount of conditional code not substantial / a problem in modern layout engines?

[15:53:34] <larsberg> I was mainly worried about cases where we say, "oh, we'd like to parallelize this portion of layout but it's not safe if we're in quirk mode and there's an <X> in there" and end up having to have a lot of different code paths and lurking bad perf corner cases
[15:54:01] <jgraham> I think it's not usually things that deep
[15:54:33] <jgraham> Typically it's surface features e.g. the way that the document is interpreted
[15:54:34] <Ms2ger> larsberg, do you know about such cases?
[15:55:39] <larsberg> Ms2ger: I don't know of any and looking through the specs jgraham and SimonSapin linked, the only parts that seem to have some impact might be table layout (but we haven't done that anyway yet and probably will only have a couple of fast paths in it)
[15:56:13] <jgraham> Yeah, I guess table layout could be interesting. It's goign to be fun anyway ;)

[16:04:56] <jack> sigh. my vmware froze.

[19:08:04] <jgraham> abinader: Yeah, whatever you did to critic was wrong :)
[19:08:17] <Ms2ger> And we probably shouldn't have HTMLDocument::GetHead and Document::GetHead both
[19:08:28] <jgraham> I think you managed to make it think that all the changes on mainline were part of your commit
[19:08:41] <abinader> jgraham: yes :S
[19:09:06] <abinader> would it go back to normal if I add critic's git repo as remote and reset it?
[19:09:15] <jgraham> abinader: No
[19:09:33] <jgraham> It has state in a database as well
[19:09:34] <Ms2ger> Woop
[19:09:36] <abinader> damn, I should've read https://critic.hoppipolla.co.uk/tutorial?item=rebase before
[19:09:49] <jgraham> The rebase tutorial there might not be helpful
[19:10:14] <abinader> Ms2ger: about that then, I'll provide a fix very soon
[19:10:26] <jgraham> Unfortunately some of the help materials assume that you are using critic in the normal mode rather than the tracking mode that we use with github
[19:10:41] <Ms2ger> Thanks
[19:10:48] <abinader> hmm
[19:10:59] <abinader> so I guess that review is doomed?
[19:11:16] <jgraham> That can happen if you rebase and it doesn't select the right parent. On the rebase screen you want to see just the commits that you think are part of your PR after you press "Fetch Branch"
[19:11:48] <jgraham> Unless someone wants to go through and mark all the unrelated files, I think it might be
[19:12:06] <jgraham> I don't dare try surgery on the backend
[19:12:17] <abinader> Ms2ger: seems the same case for SetBody/GetBody, shall we stick only with Document impl or HTMLDocument?
[19:12:40] <Ms2ger> Document
[19:12:48] <abinader> ack!
[19:13:46] <abinader> about critic, I guess I'll update the patch with Ms2ger's review on a branch with different name
[19:13:51] <abinader> (and sorry about that)
[19:14:04] * abinader still not feely very comfy with critic
[19:14:09] <abinader> feeling*
[19:14:15] <jgraham> abinader: Not your fault, there are plenty of sharp edges to do with rebases and tracking branches
[19:14:43] <abinader> I saw someone mentioning that amending patches was doable
[19:16:45] <jgraham> It helps if you think in terms of branches rather than patches
[19:17:28] <jgraham> If you come from an mq background the natural thing is to keep qref-ing all the time, which is like git commit --ammend
[19:18:14] <jgraham> But the model for critic is that you just keep pushing new commits to a branch and then fix up the branch to the set of commits you actually want to merge at the end
[19:18:24] <jgraham> *amend
[19:18:55] <abinader> yeah
[19:19:11] <abinader> I see two separate problems
[19:19:26] <abinader> 1) rebasing to an updated master branch;
[19:19:39] <abinader> 2) squashing & amending patches
[19:20:02] <abinader> I'd be really happy if I could do both at the same time
[19:20:58] <jgraham> So the problem is working out which changes were due to the rebase and which were actual changes
[19:22:47] <abinader> yep
[19:23:30] <abinader> we could help critic if we could tell him the new parent's SHA1 
[19:23:32] <jgraham> If you have a patch based on O with commits A-B and you rebase it to a patch based on O' with commits A'-B' critic wants to represent it as A-B-M where M is an "equivalent merge commit", because it already knows about A and B and they already have comments and review progress, so it isn't easy to turn them into A' and B' directly
[19:24:23] <jgraham> If you at the same time add more changes, they become part of the merge commit, which isn't a good place to be (merge commits are unusually ugly to review)
[19:24:48] <abinader> indeed
[19:25:09] <jgraham> e.g. if you just have a single patch A and you both rebase it and amend it to contain more content
[19:25:39] <jgraham> I don't see how you could actually fix this
[19:27:25] <jgraham> (github copes by throwing away all previous comments whenever you do a rebase of any kind, which is maddening)

[19:55:35] <jack> task '<unnamed>' failed at 'RefCell<T> already borrowed', /home/jack/src/servo/src/compiler/rust/src/libstd/cell.rs:167
[19:55:53] <SimonSapin> is RefCell what replaces Cell?
[19:56:02] <jack> RefCell replaces Slot
[19:56:31] <jack> RefCell is a type which does the dynamic borrow checking of @
[19:56:39] <jack> so it's like a non-GC @mut
[19:56:59] <jack> @mut's replacement for example is Rc<RefCell<T>>

[20:00:39] <jack> pcwalton: was borrow_unchecked() fro Slot to work around multi-task borrowing or something?

[20:01:50] <jack> i removed it and replaced it with borrow_layout_data
[20:02:01] <jack> or mutate_layout_data depending on how the data was used.
[20:03:13] <pcwalton> jack: if it's no longer needed, kill it

[20:16:02] <larsberg> I'm not sure if we're not checking return codes or Rust is still returning zero when failure reaches toplevel yet
