[02:15:59] <barosl> It looks very complex

[02:21:40] <barosl> http://bazel.io/docs/FAQ.html

[02:22:26] <Mutabah> May I note that it hit me yesteray that to compile some code at work, you needed scons, cmake, and make
[02:22:41] <Mutabah> Oh, and another part of the same project (but different binary) used boost (and hence bjam)
[02:23:33] <barosl> Does boost use its own dependency manager?
[02:23:35] <barosl> bjam?
[02:24:19] <barosl> http://www.boost.org/build/doc/html/bbv2/faq/names.html
[02:24:19] <Mutabah> It's boost's build system
[02:24:28] <barosl> Wow, it is a very complex system
[02:25:07] <barosl> Why does they do that? Isn't a thing like CMake or something not sufficient for it?
[02:25:40] <barosl> "Can I use Bazel for my LISP/Python/Haskell/Scala/Rust project?"
[02:25:49] <barosl> lol so Rust's in the list
[02:26:14] <barosl> Althought its order is the very last
[02:27:23] <cmr> Oh, I didn't realize Bazel was a google project.
[02:28:15] <barosl> It must be, as it uses protobuf internally!
[02:28:26] <cmr> Well, the about page says as much.
[02:28:42] <cmr> I just skimmed the intro page and moved on, because it wasn't useful to me right now ;)
[02:29:59] <barosl> "Googler authored a day ago. hanwen committed 10 hours ago"
[02:30:17] <c74d> 2015-03-24 19:30 -0700. Now that I am come to the point of beginning my attempt at building a hardened Linux-From-Scratch-ish operating system, with a custom package-manager and pervasive containment and containerization of programs, I find myself unexpectedly, though perhaps predictably, tempted toward some polished, pre-built operating system with little assembly required, perhaps
[02:30:19] <c74d> fancy NixOS, or SELinux-y Fedora, or familiar Gentoo. I shall endeavor, I hope, to stay my course.
[02:31:13] <barosl> Who said that?
[02:32:18] *** Quits: swgillespie (swgillespie@moz-rn1.vmq.232.104.IP) (Quit: My MacBook Pro has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[02:32:48] <c74d> I'd guess GitHub? Though “Your search - "Googler authored a day ago. hanwen committed 10 hours ago" - did not match any documents.”.
[02:33:22] <barosl> Ah, it was extracted from the bazel commit log
[02:33:30] <barosl> I wonder who "Googler" is
[02:33:48] <cmr> I feel like you two just talked completely past each other...
[02:34:47] <barosl> lol
[02:35:41] <c74d> ‘Googler’ = “Google employee”, no?
[02:36:25] <barosl> Yes. But usually one uses its own name to make a commit, so I find it amusing to use "Googler" in place of his or her name
[02:37:59] <c74d> It looks like “Googler” is a generic replacement for the people who lacked GitHub accounts when Google put the project on GitHub.
[02:38:26] <barosl> Ah, I see! ...But they do use git internally, right?
[02:38:48] <barosl> In that case, GitHub should have displayed the name recorded in a git commit, instead of just Googler. Hmm

[02:41:08] <GaryOak_> compiling rustc, I'm worried this old macbook will melt on lap
[02:41:36] <c74d> How old?
[02:41:45] <GaryOak_> 2008
[02:42:40] <barosl> Good luck!
[02:42:57] <c74d> My 2007 MacBook survived many a build of GCC, LLVM+Clang, Boost, FFMPEG, and many other heavy packages.
[02:43:22] <GaryOak_> cool, I'm hopeful then, this thing really needs a new battery
[02:43:31] <c74d> I'd not keep it on a lap during that though.
[02:43:31] <GaryOak_> it's getting the bulge
[02:43:54] <barosl> I've always enjoyed running the command like `emerge -upvUD world` in my old laptop
[02:44:06] <GaryOak_> what does that do?
[02:44:08] <barosl> It generally took 48 hours to complete compiling a whole bunch of packages
[02:44:25] <barosl> GaryOak_, It recompiles all the packages installed in the system
[02:44:32] <GaryOak_> damn
[02:44:40] <barosl> It is normally required when libc is updated, for example
[02:44:42] <c74d> Not with `-p` it doesn't. ;)
[02:44:51] <barosl> Oh, right. Without -p
[02:45:11] <GaryOak_> oh because most things rely on libc?
[02:45:18] <barosl> I even don't remember what those flags mean right now, but because of that scary experience, I still remember what I typed at the time!
[02:46:12] <GaryOak_> haha like that xkcd about defusing a nuke with a proper tar command
[02:47:47] <lahwran> tar is easy
[02:47:51] <lahwran> that was such a bad example
[02:48:25] <GaryOak_> tar -xvfb
[02:48:31] <GaryOak_> that's all I remember
[02:48:38] <c74d> I don't recall ever rebuilding @world in Gentoo, even over libc updates.
[02:49:37] <lahwran> tar -xf will extract a tar file
[02:49:52] <lahwran> tar -xzf will extract a gzipped tar file (except gnu doesn't need this, as it will autodetect)
[02:50:04] <lahwran> replace z with j for bzip2
[02:50:07] <lahwran> that's... all you need
[02:51:41] <c74d> barosl: `-u` is update, `-p` is pretend, `-v` is verbose, `-D` is deep (dependencies of the listed packages in addition to the listed packages), I don't know `-U`.

[11:41:43] <bombless> Otherwise I generally agree with @huonw here; Rust 1.0 sucks. Well, it's ok. But I'm pretty sure everyone is hurting for major pieces of functionality that won't be in 1.0. Using Rust really seriously is still a waiting game. 1.0, to me at least, mostly means "your shit will stop completely breaking". The 1.0 of literally every language ever has similarly sucked.
[11:43:26] <bombless> I think, seriously, we can have 2.0 in the middle of next year. (Okay this sounds like joke)

[12:15:47] <barosl> bombless, I believe we made a lot of mistakes in 1.0. So, personally, I'd like to see 2.0 in the near future. But I'm sure it may disappont so many people who want stability, so I'm very cautious saying this
[12:20:25] <bombless> At least we can plan for a 5-year cycle. And after 1.0 is polished some people can start to work on 2.0 which is planed to ship on 2020.

[13:08:56] <Tobba|Laptop> using a compiler written for windows 95
[13:09:06] <Tobba|Laptop> lots of custom operators that don't work sensibly, no C99
[13:10:28] <fmtq> Python 1 was complete shit
[13:10:32] <fmtq> Python 2 was complete shit
[13:10:42] <fmtq> Python 2.4 was when it started to behave in a way people properly enjoyed.
[13:26:10] <barosl> fmtq, Personally Python 2.4 was huge to me because it was the first version to distribute with the Korean codec
[13:26:17] <barosl> Before that I had to install the codec manually
[13:26:56] <barosl> That's why I remember the specific version number, but later versions... I don't have specific memories on them
[13:28:01] <barosl> 3.3 was worth remembering as it introduced u'literal' to Python 3.3, which eased writing a portable library that works on both Python 2 and 3
[13:28:13] <barosl> So I call 3.3 a "stable release" of the Python 3.x branch

[13:44:50] <barosl> Yes
[13:45:00] <fmtq> barosl: also I agree 3.3 was "I will always use Python 3 now" 
[13:45:02] <fmtq> for me 
[13:45:08] <fmtq> 3.2 was "I am mostly happy"
[13:45:12] <barosl> Haha, yeah
[13:45:13] <fmtq> and 3.4 has been great
[13:45:21] <fmtq> 3 is making leaps and strides now after a VERY ROUGH period
[13:45:28] <fmtq> which nearly killed the language
[13:45:49] <fmtq> also your English is very strong for a SE Asian
[13:46:06] <barosl> It was too rough... Personally I was pretty disappointed at the whole Python community that it took such long time

[13:47:27] <fmtq> barosl: gevent still isn't ported right
[13:47:34] <fmtq> and other things people still rely on 
[13:47:50] <fmtq> I mean let's be honest, porting from Python 2 to 3, even completely manually, is actually not that hard.
[13:47:52] <barosl> Oh, the relevant code is already in the tree. They're just too lazy to release things frequently
[13:47:57] <fmtq> I ported several libraries myself.
[13:48:08] <fmtq> because I was doing a lot of language stuff
[13:48:16] <fmtq> and I fucking hated how str and unicode were backwards to how I think
[13:48:29] <fmtq> I wanted str to be unicode, and Python 3 gave me that
[13:48:29] <fmtq> :D
[13:49:18] <barosl> That's one of the features that Python 3 got right in my opinion, but it also made the smooth transition impossible, and some people like mitsuhiko didn't like the change
[13:49:46] <mitsuhiko> barosl: i think a lot of people miss what my criticism is about
[13:49:47] <barosl> So as a result of this bunch of years in divided ecosystem... Now I'm not confident
[13:49:49] <fmtq> readding the u"" was enough for most of these people
[13:50:02] <mitsuhiko> python3 does two things wrong; the unicode model is fundamentally flawed and it did not bring enough to the table to encourage porting
[13:50:16] <mitsuhiko> i never argued against unicode support
[13:50:38] <barosl> Oh, it seems that I misinterpreted your intention
[13:50:41] <mitsuhiko> rust for instance has strong unicode support but it's text model is much, much more realistic and better
[13:51:00] <barosl> Yeah, that's what I felt too after starting using Rust
[13:51:16] <barosl> Python 3's internal unicode representation is... just too crazy
[13:51:26] <fmtq> isn't it just UCS-2 
[13:51:27] <mitsuhiko> in rust a unicode string and bytes is essentially the same thing
[13:51:28] <fmtq> or -4 
[13:51:31] <mitsuhiko> fmtq: no, it's ... weird
[13:51:35] <mitsuhiko> it's now latin1, ucs2 or ucs4
[13:51:41] <fmtq> haha latin1 
[13:51:44] <fmtq> wot
[13:52:10] <barosl> fmtq, Nope, it dynamically chooses the representation based on the textual data *at runtime*
[13:52:18] <mitsuhiko> it's worse though
[13:52:19] <fmtq> wot 
[13:52:32] <barosl> So if the text only contains ASCII, it uses UTF-8
[13:52:36] <mitsuhiko> it does not just change the representation randomly, it does it in really terrible ways
[13:52:39] <mitsuhiko> barosl: no, it never uses utf-8
[13:52:40] <mitsuhiko> however
[13:52:40] <barosl> If not, it uses some other bloated encoding
[13:52:50] <mitsuhiko> the moment you encode to utf-8, each unicode string caches the utf-8 encoding on it
[13:52:52] <mitsuhiko> which is even worse
[13:52:53] <fmtq> wot
[13:52:54] <fmtq> wot
[13:52:59] <mitsuhiko> u'x' -> 1 byte
[13:53:04] <barosl> Ah, yes. I also heard that
[13:53:08] <mitsuhiko> u'x' + emoticon -> 8 bytes
[13:53:08] <fmtq> is this CPython or "Python" the language
[13:53:11] <barosl> It caches several representation on it haha
[13:53:16] <barosl> CPython, of course
[13:53:25] <mitsuhiko> (u'x' + emotion).encode('utf-8') -> 8 bytes + 5 bytes
[13:53:26] <barosl> There are a lot of duplicate APIs in CPython to handle them
[13:53:36] <mitsuhiko> it's nuts
[13:53:37] <fmtq> okay I thought as much 
[13:53:51] * fmtq has been using PyPy for a while 
[13:53:51] <fmtq> just to see how it behaves.
[13:53:53] <mitsuhiko> whatever you do, do not use python 3 as inspiration for anything
[13:53:53] <fmtq> feels the same.
[13:54:07] <barosl> This thing is mandatory to know because the knowledge of the internal representation is required to interoperate with C
[13:54:18] <fmtq> I generally do not interoperate with C
[13:54:33] <fmtq> I basically refuse to do anything string related in C.
[13:54:35] <barosl> Ah, yes. Mandatory for the C-based plugin authors, I meant
[13:54:39] <fmtq> I put too much value on my time.
[13:54:43] <fmtq> :P
[13:55:00] <fmtq> if I was going to need dynamic language + native speedups for Strings, I'd do node.js + C++ 
[13:55:08] <fmtq> writing node.js plugins is actually really nice
[13:55:09] <barosl> No, Rust
[13:55:14] <fmtq> like, disturbingly so 
[13:55:37] <fmtq> I wrote a fast PRNG in it 
[13:55:57] <fmtq> lol at return { hi: n, lo: n } for 64bit ints
[13:55:59] <fmtq> because JS is sutpid 
[13:56:25] <fmtq> a lack of native support for 64bit integers makes fmtq a very mad person
[13:56:31] <barosl> Node.js itself is also pretty fast... It even sometimes beats Haskell. I'm kinda jealous of so much love thay get from the mainstream compiler authors
[13:56:43] <fmtq> I am enjoying io.js
[13:56:47] <fmtq> because it's giving me more access to ES6.
[13:57:20] <barosl> I pasted this link on this channel previously, did you see this? https://github.com/barosl/ws-bench
[13:57:32] <fmtq> I SEE NOTHING
[13:57:46] <barosl> It's a crippled benchmark that isn't worth considering seriously, but it matches with the general consensus
[13:57:56] <barosl> Python is pretty slow, as expected
[13:58:05] <fmtq> what am I looking at here 
[13:58:24] <fmtq> you mean inefficient
[13:58:37] <barosl> Yup
[13:58:52] <barosl> And it will get slow after reaching the 100% CPU usage... ;)
[13:58:57] <fmtq> heh
[13:59:03] <fmtq> what about with pypy?
[13:59:25] <barosl> I tried to run on that, but there was problems
[13:59:32] <fmtq> always good
[13:59:41] <barosl> First, PyPy doesn't support `yield from`, so it cannot utilize asyncio
[13:59:46] <fmtq> I'm probably just going to jump onto the Scala ship 
[13:59:47] <barosl> The version it supports is 3.2
[13:59:56] <fmtq> and sink
[14:00:19] <barosl> Second, the Twisted implementation is primarily C-based... PyPy doesn't gain any speedup when running Twisted-based apps
[14:01:13] <fmtq> I wasn't talking about Twisted :P
[14:01:16] <fmtq> mostly for that reason 
[14:01:19] <fmtq> HOW ABOUT LUAJIT
[14:01:21] <fmtq> :P
[14:01:31] <barosl> Oh, yes
[14:01:36] <barosl> I should definitely test it
[14:01:49] <barosl> I've heard many good opinions on Lua Jit
[14:01:57] <fmtq> let me know
[14:03:35] <fmtq> I won't use Rust until I can write network shit in an async way 
[14:03:47] <fmtq> threading sockets is not my fun time :|
[14:04:08] <fmtq> socket.on_message(|data| { ... })

[14:04:28] <barosl> Isn't mio the thing? How mature is mio?
[14:04:43] <barosl> (I haven't used it at all)
[14:04:49] <fmtq> no idea 
[14:05:00] <fmtq> but if it's anything like nio in Java, it's going to fucking suck 
[14:05:11] <barosl> :D
[14:05:28] <barosl> It got matured over time, to be honest
[14:05:35] <fmtq> NIO. Sucks.

[14:05:49] <fmtq> yes* 
[14:05:58] <fmtq> but it's still a piece of shit, they just rolled glitter on it 
[14:06:04] <fmtq> like, implementing TLS sockets.
[14:06:22] <fmtq> you can never know for sure that what you've written is actually secure without being in the mind of whoever wrote the fucking API 
[14:06:37] <fmtq> anything non-HTTP requires writing your own verification code 
[14:06:52] <fmtq> and annoyingly a lot of libraries use javax.security not java.security 
[14:07:01] <fmtq> because of their idiot decisions to migrate namespaces in a broken way 
[14:07:19] <fmtq> Java: we made several mistakes which will cause problems for several years :P 
[14:09:18] <barosl> In contrast, Rust tries to keep things unstable as long as possible before it gets mature
[14:09:31] <barosl> It is generally good, but sometimes it blocks you from "getting things done" right away...
[14:09:54] <barosl> So I think those are pros and cons

[14:13:06] <Mutabah> and yes
[14:13:44] <barosl> Wow, that's incredible. I thought that considering the complexity of the borrow checker, that would not be an alternative implementation anytime soon
[14:14:02] <Mutabah> barosl: This hasn't touched borrowck yet
[14:14:06] <barosl> Aha
[14:14:17] <barosl> That makes sense - Still, pretty awesome work
[14:14:18] <Mutabah> It's just a lexer+parser with the start of AST checking
[14:15:06] <barosl> Your compiler will also please those C programmres!
[14:15:10] <barosl> C++*
[14:15:14] <barosl> Or C, whatever
[14:15:25] <Mutabah> barosl: That's kinda why it's C++
[14:15:37] <Mutabah> as much as I miss rust features while writing it...
[14:15:51] <Mutabah> having it be c++ allows the rustc chain of trust to be shortened
[14:16:14] <barosl> So now we can use the compiler to test if the official compiler has some backdoors in it!

[14:17:47] <Mutabah> Plus, it's an interesting project, and helps me nut out some quirks of the rust syntax

[14:18:27] <Mutabah> :D
[14:18:53] <barosl> What quirks did you find? For example?
[14:19:17] <Mutabah> Can't use destructuring patterns in provided trait methods
[14:19:33] <Mutabah> (or anywhere that you could omit the argument name)
[14:19:48] <barosl> Oh, really? Huh
[14:19:55] <Mutabah> Internal quirks of how macros evaluate
[14:20:04] <Mutabah> (how they handle nested $() for example)
[14:20:34] <scott> at work I'm having this weird intermittent build issue related to parallel make that just "goes away" if you try again. solution: while true; do gmake -j20 ... && break; done
[14:20:39] <scott> great stuff
[14:22:11] <Mutabah> barosl: Oh, and there's a quirk of collisions of function and module names
[14:22:20] <scott> Mutabah: that quirk about the lack of patterns where the arg name is optional is pretty interesting
[14:22:29] <barosl> They are not allowed to have the same name, right?
[14:22:47] <Mutabah> barosl: You'd think so... but 'use' allows you to have that collision
[14:22:56] <barosl> Heh
[14:23:17] <scott> Mutabah: it's a shame it's required for provided trait methods, too... that's the one place where it's really a "gotcha"
[14:23:21] <Mutabah> barosl: and introduces fun resolution rules (I special looking up a leaf node in a path)
[14:23:51] <Mutabah> scott: yeah, I haven't actually double-checked what rustc does when you try... but the code says that it's like that
[14:24:01] <barosl> That's a gorgeous discovery!
[14:24:20] <scott> I imagine it has to be like that because the parser doesn't know if it's a provided or required method until it hits the { or ;
[14:24:24] <Mutabah> And it does make sense, since rustc needs to know within a few tokens if it's looking at a variable binding or the type
[14:24:32] <scott> you'd need a signalling keyword earlier on

[14:36:56] <scott> yeah
[14:37:05] <barosl> Because every person likes to use exotic words
[14:37:57] <barosl> And there's an interesting aspect to this - foreign words are also used to say something that is embarrassing to say
[14:38:47] <barosl> There's a culture genre called "boy's love", which describes the love between the two male protagonists
[14:39:46] <barosl> And interestingly, the genre is primarily called "BL"(boy's love) in Japan, but "Yaoi" is more frequently used in the Western communities
[14:40:25] <scott> interesting
[14:40:26] <barosl> So they want to hide the embarrassing nuance by using some exotic words
[14:41:59] <cmr> I wonder if that's the real motivation, or if it was just initially from otaku talking about a genre.
[14:43:28] <barosl> But in that case, the Japanese otaku didn't have to invent a word ("BL") to indicate the same thing ("Yaoi" in their mother tongue)
[14:44:00] <cmr> yeah, good point, I was only thinking from the english side
[14:45:09] <scott> it seems common for Asian language concepts to not get translated or at least not fully translated to English, I guess since most of them are quite different
[14:46:18] <barosl> To be honest, I think that's one of the reason why English's vocabulary has been grown like a hell
[14:46:36] <scott> yeah, I think English is king of borrow words
[14:46:40] <barosl> Instead of trying to translate the original meaning, just importing the words directly...
[14:47:33] <barosl> And again, to be honest, Korean also tends to follow the same trend nowadays, in contrast to what happened hundreds of years ago
[14:48:19] <barosl> At that time we had created new words that have the similar meanings of the imported words, but nowadays it is considered to be a waste of time, so...

[14:52:29] <scott> I should probably try learning Mandarin/Japanese/Korean/something like that.

[15:02:03] <barosl> lol
[15:02:49] <barosl> ES6 will make JS less "function language", as it introduces a new arrow syntax that creates an anonymous function...
[15:03:02] <scott> ES6 looks way more palatable
[15:03:51] <barosl> You mean "bearable", right? :P
[15:04:10] <scott> the new lambda syntax is both concise and treats `this` lexically
[15:04:13] <scott> so much better
[15:04:38] <eddyb> the this thing makes it unsuited for certain things
[15:04:42] <scott> ES6 basically imports 90% of coffeescript into the ECMAScript standard
[15:04:43] <eddyb> but there's also "method" syntax
[15:04:52] <eddyb> { foo(x) { ... } }
[15:04:55] <eddyb> I think

[15:07:25] <cmr> was ES6 finalized or something?

[15:08:29] <scott> lots of really basic JS mistakes are getting sanely replaced
[15:08:43] <barosl> Oh, do they even have const?
[15:08:48] <scott> I actually found it surprising how sane ES6 seems
[15:08:55] <barosl> That's not JavaScript anymore! No dynamism!
[15:09:15] <eddyb> barosl: it's still dynamic
[15:09:24] <eddyb> sadly, `const` in JS is a lie
[15:09:38] <barosl> How so?
[15:09:38] <eddyb> it's the C const, not a true constant
[15:09:39] <scott> yeah, I wouldn't expect any miracles there

[15:09:48] <scott> probably just as much as lie as Ruby constants

[15:10:13] <eddyb> which is not what "constant" means but w/e
[15:10:18] <scott> > Calls in tail-position are guaranteed to not grow the stack unboundedly
[15:10:27] <eddyb> scott: about time :P
[15:10:29] <scott> using JS in a functional style will be quite doable
[15:10:34] <scott> JS is finally a real Scheme?
[15:10:36] <barosl> We can call it "final", I think
[15:10:51] <eddyb> any language with pervasive GC can do TCO
[15:11:04] <eddyb> (by default)
[15:11:13] <scott> the issues Rust has with TCO are interesting
[15:11:28] <scott> I hadn't ever thought about it before, but destructors defeinitely get in the way
[15:11:33] <eddyb> and they are all a matter of opting in
[15:11:36] <scott> you always have to be aware of the invisible code in RAII languages
[15:11:40] <eddyb> scott: destructors are *the only* issue
[15:12:01] <scott> well, not always, but when it comes to control flow
[15:12:15] <eddyb> that's what `become` does, runs the destructors for everything that's not moved into the tail call
[15:12:37] <barosl> A mention on tail calls is interesting, is that part of the ES6 specification? I thought tail call optimization was somewhat implementation detail
[15:12:40] <scott> I think I like the idea of explicit tail calls regardless of destructors, anyway
[15:12:51] <scott> then the compiler can tell you if it's not tail position
[15:13:10] <scott> barosl: sounds like it's becoming a guarantee in the spec

[16:49:23] <GaryOak_> ohhhh
[16:49:25] <eddyb> reallocating a vector while you're sliding a pointer across it
[16:49:30] <panicbit> E.g. modifying it while iterating it, eh?
[16:49:37] <eddyb> yes
[16:49:59] <panicbit> That's where you'd use flat_map :)
[16:50:01] <eddyb> panicbit: keep in mind that in C++, modifying an element is valid (and not UB)
[16:50:30] <eddyb> only messing with the backing storage is problematic (such as pushing which may need to grow the vector)
[16:50:50] <panicbit> Yeah, that's easy to overlook
[16:50:52] <eddyb> while in Rust, even a simple in-place mutation is considered UB (unless you use Cell, for example)

[16:52:13] <GaryOak_> Can heap overflows still happen in Rust?
[16:52:49] <cmr> GaryOak_: not in safe code.
[16:52:56] <GaryOak_> ok
[16:54:13] <panicbit> Btw, what about increasing stack space? Is that possible right now?
[16:54:35] <GaryOak_> I figured with the type system you couldn't do that
[16:54:56] <cmr> panicbit: it's possible to implement it, but we don't right now. we used to.
[16:55:01] <cmr> it's too slow, too much overhead.
[16:55:02] <panicbit> I see
[16:55:16] <cmr> ("segmented stacks")
[16:55:21] <panicbit> Wait. What about compile time?
[16:55:22] <cmr> we can't relocate the stack though
[16:55:39] <cmr> what do you mean about compile time?
[16:55:47] <panicbit> Increasing the stack space at compile time?
[16:56:06] <cmr> that's nonsense, you don't know the stack bounds at compile time.
[16:56:18] <cmr> stack usage isn't fixed.
[16:56:25] <panicbit> Aha
[16:56:50] <panicbit> So I basically can't do nothing to give my deep recursion a little bit more space?
[16:57:12] <eddyb> I think panicbit just wants to set the stack limits
[16:57:14] <cmr> you can set RUST_STACK_SIZE.
[16:57:22] <eddyb> which you totally can if you spawn a new thread
[16:57:27] <panicbit> Yeah, I think that's what I'm asking for =D
[16:57:27] <eddyb> or do what cmr said
[16:58:01] <cmr> sorry, I misunderstood the original question to be growing the stack as it's being used, rather than just getting a bigger stack.
[16:58:16] <panicbit> I was curious because rustc crashed when throwing lots of nested stuff at it :P

[17:11:23] <bvssvni> if you stand on one side of a river in the fog, having lost sense of direction, how can you tell which side you are on?
[17:12:03] <eddyb> well, it coudln't be the direction of the water because that's too easy
[17:12:12] <eddyb> (the flow, I mean)
[17:12:15] <cmr> what does "side of a river" even mean?
[17:12:19] <bvssvni> eddyb: you’re right!
[17:12:28] <eddyb> what kind of a riddle is that?
[17:12:39] <eddyb> they're supposed to require mental effort
[17:12:40] <bvssvni> eddyb: one I just made up :P
[17:12:42] <eddyb> oh

[17:14:32] <bvssvni> eddyb: if you don’t know what’s up, then it gets harder
[17:14:44] <cmr> eddyb: well, I mean, riverside sure.
[17:15:05] <cmr> but how do you differentiate which side you're on besides the flow? there's no other meaningful distinction in the problem description
[17:16:16] <bvssvni> unless there is some other way, you can't
[17:16:21] <cmr> right
[17:16:40] <bvssvni> and if you’ve lost the sense of what’s up or down, then it becomes impossible

[17:20:14] <eddyb> Manishearth: that's quite interesting
[17:20:47] <eddyb> there's a pool of potential candidates but they prefer complacency and maybe occassionally supporting the active one
[17:21:12] <Manishearth> when our main antihero left, his supporters caused a continous stream of uproar
[17:21:32] <Manishearth> initially centered around the circumstances up to his leaving, but then on other things

[17:24:00] <bvssvni> eddyb: I didn’t like naturalism in school
[17:24:49] <bvssvni> eddyb: I guess I’ve missed the point, but it sounded a bit too “just give up”
[17:24:56] <eddyb> apparently seeing horrible crimescenes in TV series affects me less than reading about such a thing...
[17:25:49] <eddyb> bvssvni: are you thinking of the branch of realism in literature, or something else entirely?
[17:26:50] <eddyb> something like Dexter is... too technical to qualify
[17:27:20] <eddyb> naturalism is just grotesque 19th century stuff

[18:18:47] <Tobba> in-place bit manipulation
[18:18:58] <Tobba> which would randomly do weird shit and zero out whatever you were writing to, so they were pretty useless

[18:19:29] <Tobba> of course you can, but the compiler was incredibly shitty
[18:19:35] <Tobba> it wouldn't have a chance at optimizing that

[19:32:29] <c74d> I don't think so, it *usually* reconnects. But it disconnects often enough that not reconnecting after one in a few hundred to a thousand disconnects is a significant problem.

[20:21:07] <tiffany> the main point of signatures is that someone else probably won't be able to make one that looks quite like yours
[20:21:13] <tiffany> and if they try too hard, it shows up in the writing
[20:21:43] <tiffany> you can probably fool the bank accountant, but if it ever comes into question, it can be examined
[20:22:36] <tiffany> what else are you going to use to uniquely identify someone that you can do in 3 seconds with nothing but a reliable technological device such as a pen (or quill and ink, if it comes to it)
[20:22:54] <tiffany> I guess fingerprints? but then you get ink all over your hand
[20:23:08] <Tobba> that'd be a pain in the ass
[20:23:14] <Tobba> it's pretty easy to lose a fingerprint
[20:23:18] <tiffany> in some cases, they do require fingerprints too

[20:27:59] <eddyb> :|
[20:28:56] <GaryOak_> it's there some quantum theory where the future has to be a certain way based on current conditions?
[20:29:02] <GaryOak_> isn't there*
[20:30:37] <insaneinside> probably.. I was just an undergrad, and spent more time programming than doing my physics homework. :)
[20:32:14] <scott> GaryOak_: that's just the basic idea of determinism, ie. every moment in the future is uniquely determined by the present state
[20:32:29] <scott> predates quantum mechanics and whatnot
[20:33:53] <scott> I'm not sure what quantum physics has to say about it, though
[20:34:28] <scott> afaik some things appear to be totally random, but maybe that's just from our current knowledge
[20:34:40] <GaryOak_> scott: i think that maybe heisenberg's principle
[20:34:53] <insaneinside> Quantum physics says that at very small scales, you deal with probabilities rather than deterministic values.
[20:35:40] <GaryOak_> so you can't predict the future with 100% certainty
[20:35:51] <GaryOak_> just by knowing the state of everything
[20:36:01] <scott> I guess that becomes a meta-question about determinism
[20:36:05] <insaneinside> ehh, more that you can't really know the state of everything
[20:36:27] <scott> if you can't ever know the state of everything, does the question of determinism even matter at all
[20:36:37] <insaneinside> heh.

[20:38:25] <tiffany> probabalistic determinism
[20:39:31] <tiffany> you don't really need to predict the future with 100% certainty

[20:40:20] <scott> and whether that's significant
[20:40:32] <scott> effects*
[20:40:32] <tiffany> I am pretty much 99% sure they do not in any significant way

[20:41:02] *** Joins: Rym_ (y@moz-vsu.f6d.55.31.IP)
[20:41:27] <tiffany> and there's a new transistor design which is supposed to abuse quantum tunnelling to reduce switching costs
[20:42:48] <tiffany> neurons are way too big for quantum effects to matter too much, I think
[20:42:58] <tiffany> I might be overestimating the size
[20:43:15] <scott> it's interesting how weird of a base all the normal stuff is built out of
[20:43:17] <Tobba> considering all the shenanigans of organic stuff, the nondeterminism resulting from quantum mechanics probably has a neglible effect
[20:43:23] <scott> macro stuff is so sensible
[20:43:28] <scott> but it's made up of all this nonsense
[20:43:37] <tiffany> it's only nonsense because you didn't grow up around it
[20:43:43] <scott> right
[20:44:28] <tiffany> apparently neurons vary from 4 to 100 micrometers in diameter
[20:44:31] <tiffany> which is enormous
[20:44:36] <zwarich> Bell's Theorem implies that you get either locality or determinism (well, actually something weaker than determinism)
[20:44:54] <tiffany> like damn, you could actually see a neuron with the naked eye at the large end of the scale
[20:45:35] <zwarich> and it's unclear if nonlocal determinism is determinism in the sense that we want ;)
[20:45:54] <tiffany> that's just the soma part, which is like the actual cell, and not the axon tail or dendrites
[20:47:14] <insaneinside> but what about the low-level chemical interactions that are the biological underpinnings of cellular life?  Biophysics is a huge topic right now, and I'd be surprised if there's not any current research into whether QM affects biology significantly.
[20:47:33] <tiffany> even if it does, it probably smooths over at any higher levels
[20:47:48] <Tobba> it probably matters a bit
[20:47:51] <tiffany> and then there's definitions
[20:47:55] <eddyb> insaneinside: there's a few things

[21:51:09] <lahwran> so has coral cache ever actually worked?
[21:51:10] <Tobba> good god
[21:51:13] <panicbit> ipv1/0. It evaluates to Inf, right?
[21:51:14] <panicbit> :P
[21:51:18] <c74d> Oh, of course, Google Web Cache. I ought to have remembered that from when I was using it extensively when I'd blocked outgoing HTTP.
[21:51:34] <lahwran> c74d: wait, what? blocked outgoing http?
[21:51:37] <Tobba> wait what
[21:51:40] <Tobba> why would you ever do that
[21:51:51] <lahwran> sometimes people wear chastity devices for fun
[21:52:11] <c74d> Tobba: I'd like IPv4 connectivity, I just haven't bothered to figure out how to get it at present.
[21:52:19] <lahwran> OH.
[21:52:31] <lahwran> I seem to have missed a conceptual connection here
[21:52:38] <lahwran> you're ACTUALLY ON an ipv6-only system?
[21:53:27] <Tobba> personally I really dislike IPv6, but there isn't a standardized alternative...
[21:53:37] <c74d> As for blocking outgoing HTTP, that was for security reasons -- initially, so that I could be sure that a package manager (el-get) was downloading packages only via secured connections.
[21:53:58] <Tobba> which failed hilariously if I recall
[21:54:01] <lahwran> I wonder how hard it'd be to run llbmc on rust
[21:54:23] <panicbit> fun fact: IPv6 addrs actually broke the reference client (java) I got for an assignment.
[21:54:25] <lahwran> probably not very?
[21:55:08] <lahwran> ooh yeah
[21:55:16] <lahwran> it doesn't even care what you get the llvm bitcode from
[21:55:44] <c74d> lahwran: As of recently, yes. I switched, on this Ubuntu system, from NetworkManager, which was obnoxiously flaky (disconnected from Wi-Fi frequently and sometimes forgot to reconnect), to plain wpa_supplicant, which worked fine for me on Gentoo, but now I have no IPv4 connectivity and I haven't bothered figuring out why.
[21:58:12] <panicbit> c74d: Maybe you should take a look at the dhcpd config
[21:58:31] <c74d> (I also blocked FTP, the plain Git transport protocol, and SMTP along with HTTP. I later unblocked HTTP, but not the others.)
[21:58:55] <lahwran> I wonder if one could use llbmc to find bugs in compiled programs
[21:59:04] <panicbit> -d
[21:59:42] <lahwran> requires being able to get llvm ir out of x86 machine code
[21:59:53] <lahwran> not sure if that's closer to disassembly or closer to decompilation
[21:59:58] <Tobba> there was a project that did that
[22:00:17] <Tobba> I think someone did it to PowerPC code to recompile code from consoles to PC or something
