[05:37:26] <bjz> TheHydroImpulse: the elm website is super nice: http://elm-lang.org/
[05:38:14] <bjz> as with the logo too: http://prezi.com/npjjrmt_badc/tangrams-logo/
[05:38:34] <bjz> http://library.elm-lang.org/
[05:39:20] <bjz> ^ think it's a little hard to find the 'browse' section there
[05:39:27] <bjz> but it's still very pretty
[05:40:32] <bjz> the thing I really miss from our current docs is the lack of top level type signatures: http://library.elm-lang.org/catalog/evancz-Elm/0.12/Graphics-Input-Field
[05:41:00] <bjz> we are a typed language, and the type signatures are really important for documentation
[05:41:43] <bjz> I think the original docs were inspired by how php does it, but php is dynamically typed
[05:42:05] <bjz> just some thoughts
[05:51:11] <TheHydroImpulse> bjz oh nice! I’ll take a look at this
[05:51:56] <TheHydroImpulse> thanks
[05:53:58] <bjz> just been looking at my glfw docs
[05:54:12] <bjz> and it's super sad to see all my types hidden :(
[05:56:23] <bjz> if you look at haskell docs for example, they need very little hand written annotations
[05:56:46] <bjz> because its very clear just from the combination of the identifier and the type what they do
[05:56:54] <bjz> but yeah
[05:57:02] <bjz> anyway, have to head out now
[05:57:05] <bjz> cya!
[06:07:14] <TheHydroImpulse> bjz hehe. cya
