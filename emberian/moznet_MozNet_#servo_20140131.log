[00:00:39] <pcwalton> jack: I don't know that DOM nodes contain a child count?
[00:00:45] <pcwalton> we're already iterating over all the children of each DOM node
[00:00:49] <pcwalton> I'd rather not do it twice
[00:01:04] <pcwalton> I thought that DOM nodes just contain a first-child and last-child pointer and don't maintain a count of children
[00:01:05] <jack> i don't understand. you only add up the number o fchildren when you iterate over children()
[00:01:13] <jack> so you're already doing an O(n) iteration there.
[00:01:17] <pcwalton> right

[00:01:39] <pcwalton> it's easier to just do one
[00:02:13] <jack> Doesn't children return an iterator?
[00:02:23] <pcwalton> yeah, but iterators don't have a length field
[00:02:26] <jack> And if so, then len() is just that same for loop you wrote.
[00:02:49] <pcwalton> oh, hmm
[00:02:59] <pcwalton> for some reason I thought I had more in that loop, sorry
[00:03:10] <jack> I r+ed it already since it's not a big deal

[01:02:10] <pcwalton> I just did an experiment commenting out the leaf set entirely in order to be fair to sequential
[01:02:23] <pcwalton> because I was worried that the leaf set maintenance was swamping our parallel gains
[01:02:27] <pcwalton> turns out that is not the case
[01:02:57] <pcwalton> in fact we get a 2.66x speedup on 4 cores from parallel style recalc
[01:03:04] <pcwalton> compared to the optimized sequential version
[01:03:31] <pcwalton> which is similar to reflow gains, in fact
[01:03:35] <pcwalton> so: yay parallelism!
[01:04:07] <cmr> do you expect to see that factor increase with further tuning, or is that about what you expected?
[01:04:40] <pcwalton> unsure. it might be worth asking Leo at this point
[01:05:02] <pcwalton> I know that we shouldn't expect 4x to be attainable

[08:49:31] <jdm> nice
[08:50:13] <eddyb> I wonder if there's a large PNG out there compressed using a fixed huffman tree
[08:50:35] <eddyb> s/a fixed/the fixed/
[08:51:32] <eddyb> because I don't want to be slower than zlib for those, before I start implementing dynamic huffman trees - which will be a PITA
[08:52:31] <Yurume> eddyb, does zlib use a special code path for the fixed huffman tere anyway?
[08:52:33] <Yurume> tree*
[08:52:50] <eddyb> Yurume: I'm not actually sure on that, there's a lot of code in it
[08:53:36] <eddyb> I've seen an implementation which was lazy and it was generating the fixed tree by plugging in the range/bits generator values, like for a dynamic tree
[08:54:32] <Yurume> I think there are several implementations that do so, and is no worse than having a separate code path for the fixed huffman tree IMHO.
[08:55:05] <eddyb> depends how you implement it
[08:56:01] <Yurume> since in order to make the dynamic huffman tree fast, I guess you need to have a tight loop that processes at least one byte per iteration, which has to be done for the fixed huffman tree as well.
[08:56:07] <eddyb> one branch per bit or manually reversing bits - that's just bad. I'm planning on generating dynamic jump tables, in which I insert functions parametrized over the value they decode
[08:56:37] <eddyb> Yurume: it's harder than you think
[08:57:35] <Yurume> yes, but as far as I know there exists such implementation and is the state of the art, I might be incorrect in this regard though
[08:57:59] <eddyb> it's a bit stream and you can't just make sure it has at least 8 bits in it, you have to be pretty precise
[08:59:05] <Yurume> state-dependent mapping from a byte to literals to emit and next state, to be exact.
[08:59:25] <eddyb> you don't have bytes, you have bits
[08:59:40] <eddyb> this is something you can speed up a lot in hardware - it's akin to instruction decoding in CPUs (so you can have a pipeline, prediction magic and whatnot)
[09:00:59] <Yurume> eddyb, I'm not saying that bytes have an meaning in bitstream, I'm saying that you can speed up the decoding by (essentially) unrolling the decoding process eight times.
[09:01:34] <eddyb> not even like that
[09:01:52] <eddyb> Yurume: for the fixed huffman table, you have 7-bit codes, 8-bit codes and 9-bit codes
[09:02:29] <Yurume> and 5-bit codes. (don't forget distance codes)
[09:02:42] <eddyb> in the main loop, those are specializations
[09:03:54] <eddyb> what I do right now is ensure I have 7 bits, check for a 7-bit code marker. if it's not 7-bit, ensure I have 8 bits (this branch I could mark as cold), check either of the two 8-bit code markers, if not: ensure I have 9 bits (again, could be cold) and handle the 9-bit code

[09:22:52] <jdm> cmr: maybe some mozilla security folks, but not sure who you mean by "anyone"
[09:23:16] <Ms2ger> Year of the horse, eh
[09:23:24] <Ms2ger> More like year of the horse mask
[09:23:34] <cmr> jdm: any rust evangelists, of course :P
[09:23:49] <dbaupp> cmr: are you?
[09:24:15] <cmr> dbaupp: I have no plans to be, right now.
[09:24:25] * jdm works on his frankenstein Servo slides
[09:24:49] <dbaupp> "it lives!"
[09:26:47] <Ms2ger> "GitHub now has a bug bounty. Best part: "Bugs, such as XSS, that only affect legacy browser/plugin versions" not eligible"

[09:33:43] <eddyb> I suggest we fix that by dropping libpng :P
[09:36:45] <eddyb> Yurume: bleah, the dynamic huffman table supports up to 15 bits. I am not allocating that many pointers in all cases
[09:37:22] <eddyb> s/table/tree
[09:38:08] <dbaupp> allocations?
[09:38:08] <eddyb> which means I have to specialize the dynamic tree loop for max bit lengths 1-15, I guess. that will suck :(
[09:38:38] <dbaupp> I thought zlib etc. got a way with no allocations?
[09:38:43] <dbaupp> *away
[09:38:54] <eddyb> dbaupp: it has internal allocations
[09:39:49] <eddyb> it's even in the docs - one of the state structure's fields points to internal data and there's even allocation functions you can replace with your own
[09:40:28] <eddyb> wait, nevermind, my plan was to have 256 "jump" pointers for a byte value. hmpf
[09:40:48] * Ms2ger wonders how much sleep eddyb has been getting
[09:41:35] <dbaupp> really?
[09:43:01] <dbaupp> eddyb: the only malloc call in http://svn.ghostscript.com/ghostscript/trunk/gs/zlib/contrib/puff/puff.c is for the test at the end (yes, I know that's not the "real" decompressor)
[09:44:10] <dbaupp> and github's search doesn't seem to turn up any `malloc`s in the main code of https://github.com/madler/zlib

[09:47:38] <eddyb> dbaupp: "It is not written for speed but rather simplicity."
[09:47:54] <eddyb> dbaupp: and it's not malloc, it's zalloc or something like that. it's another field of the state structure
[09:48:04] <dbaupp> and,yeah, just tracking that down now
[09:48:11] <eddyb> Ms2ger: 8 hours, sadly. I wish I had my own apartment :/
[09:48:29] <Ms2ger> eddyb, how so?
[09:49:08] <eddyb> I get woken up too early
[09:49:34] <Ms2ger> Ah, I see
[10:01:03] <eddyb> (HCLEN + 4) x 3 bits: code lengths for the code length alphabet given just above, in the order: 16, 17, 18, 0, 8, 7, 9, 6, 10, 5, 11, 4, 12, 3, 13, 2, 14, 1, 15
[10:01:09] <eddyb> yay arbitrary decisions
[10:14:11] <eddyb> Ms2ger: I hope nobody will try to read my code on a 80-wide terminal, I break that soft limit way too oftem
[10:14:25] <eddyb> (if we had make tidy in rust-png I'd fail it)
[10:17:15] <Ms2ger> I don't read code on a terminal, but it does make life a lot harder when reviewing side-by-side diffs

[17:15:06] <jack> larsberg: why did bors fail on inline border again?
[17:17:27] <larsberg> jack: two things going on in that PR
[17:17:48] <larsberg> the inline-border one is because the image was generated on linux, which doesn't work on OSX
[17:18:01] *** Quits: doomlord__ (servitor@moz-841308DB.range86-160.btcentralplus.com) (Quit: Leaving)
[17:18:08] <larsberg> (all our image-based verification ref tests seem to fail on linux right now, at least in my testing in a VM)
[17:18:28] <larsberg> the other thing was that I fixed up all the race conditions with reftests where we would render an incomplete PNG due to partial reflows
[17:18:28] <jack> i thoguht we landed a fix for that?
[17:18:45] <eddyb> larsberg: does it output red diffs now?
[17:19:02] <larsberg> jack: I'll look into cross-platform ref testing more next
[17:20:16] <larsberg> eddyb: I ended up doing something slightly different - basically I emit a C0 in any of the RGB vectors where you differ, which causes the resulting image to have both vibrant diffs and you can do some color-math to figure out where it's wrong. Seemed to have good results for a variety of errors (e.g., both borders/margins off and mis-rendered imagey stuff)
[17:21:29] <jack> larsberg: so i'm confused. if your PR fixes this, why did it still fail?
[17:21:45] <larsberg> so the race conditions I'd fixed were related to partial reflows, but there was still a bad case where we could finish loading the page, reflow and render it, but THEN get a resize event. there was a workaround, but it required significant changes to script, etc. to avoid making queries before the resize had landed and had some potential deadlock issues, so
[17:21:45] <larsberg> I shelved it and changed to 800x600 for our default size

[17:26:32] <larsberg> I would love to write a cheesy flow-dumper that basically takes the result of layout and spits out an HTML page that uses absolute positioning for every element and explicit border drawing for baselines (or something similar) to generate reftest baselines automagically.

[17:52:09] <jack> do we know why parallel flow construction is timing on in a content test?
[17:52:48] <larsberg> jack: can you check if there are *diff.png files in /tmp on the builder I can see? I can't repro the reftest failure
[17:53:00] <larsberg> jack: I haven't seen that timeout before
[17:53:32] <larsberg> do you know which one? Is it one of hte ones where script calls back into layout to perform a query (e.g., the getClientBlahBlah ones?)
[17:53:55] <jack> you want the diffs from teh reftest that failed on the previous PR?
[17:54:04] <larsberg> if they're still there
[17:54:08] <larsberg> I can't repro it locally
[17:54:14] <jack> larsberg: the only way to check is to manually tick them off and see which one doesn't print out :)

[21:07:43] <jack> pcwalton: you really think the hang is a mutex?
[21:07:53] <jack> why would it be causing a crash?
[21:08:39] <pcwalton> jack: it doesn't cause a crash, it causes a hang, because we use OS mutexes with green threads
[21:09:21] <pcwalton> I think that's the problem because (1) the problem disappears with RUST_THREADS=1; (2) gdb shows that our threads are blocked in the mutex
[21:09:24] <jgraham> Brussels is loud :(
[21:09:39] <jack> lars said the hang was really just a crash and then a wait on exit that would never come
[21:10:08] <jack> but i'm assuming you looked closer.
[21:10:09] <jack> sigh
[21:10:26] <jack> can we backport the mutex?
[21:12:37] <pcwalton> jack: it hasn't landed yet
[21:12:47] <pcwalton> how close is jdm's stuff to landing?
[21:12:52] <pcwalton> might be better to just land it
[21:13:01] <jack> that's not hte only thing blocking us though
[21:13:10] <jack> i think it's ready for review and landing.
[21:13:18] <pcwalton> jack: I think I might be able to harden flow construction to be enforced thread safe pretty easily in the interim
[21:13:19] <jack> but we haven't done windowing or the compositor
[21:13:49] <pcwalton> that'll fix the pressing problem (code drift making it harder to have parallel flow construction) and then actual flow construction can wait to land cleanly

[21:17:49] <pcwalton> I'm fine with waiting for performance improvements… I love them but I don't want to incur technical debt if the performance experiments were to prove a point (which IMO they have--that flow construction wins when performed in parallel)
[21:17:52] <jack> do you think it's likely to happen? i mean, i'm all for hardening
[21:18:00] <pcwalton> jack: I can take a crack at it today
[21:18:16] <jdm> http://www.joshmatthews.net/fosdemservo/mozilla.html is the talk I plan to give at fosdem
[21:18:17] <pcwalton> oh, if you're concerned about code drift making it hard to do parallel flow construction, yes, I think that is likely to happen
[21:18:19] <pcwalton> it already happened
[21:18:30] <pcwalton> I had to fix some code that wasn't threadsafe

[21:33:49] <jgraham> SimonSapin: Well the bit of Brussels I am in is louder than the bit of London I live in. There are bars and stuff on the same street as our hotel and the room is on the road
[21:34:53] <jgraham> jack: I had an implmentation of that algorithm kicking around somewhere. But this was more than 5 years ago and I don't know what happened to it since then :|
[21:34:54] <jack> abinader: not that i know of. and it's needed for testharness.js :)
[21:35:19] <abinader> jack: yep :-) willing to work at that
[21:35:55] <abinader> I was just checking how http://dom.spec.whatwg.org is rendered on Servo and saw a call for document.querySelector

[21:36:10] <abinader> it is doing pretty fine btw :-) better than google.com

[21:39:49] <abinader> jgraham: right, I've seen WebKit has some sort of script for automating this process
[21:40:03] <jgraham> Right, I am doing that for Gecko

[22:27:26] <pcwalton> jack: so I'm thinking my initial approach can be to just start marking everything racy as "unsafe" and deal with the fallout
[22:27:38] <pcwalton> there will be a lot of "unsafe" but I'd rather be honest about it than dishonest about it
[22:27:46] <pcwalton> and we can then clean up the APIs later
[22:28:58] <pcwalton> actually, looking at this, this will result in almost every flow construction method being marked unsafe
[22:29:02] <pcwalton> I guess I'll clean up that API
