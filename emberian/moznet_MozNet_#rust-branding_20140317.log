[10:40:54] <TheHydroImpulse> bjz cmr Started to make some changes to the docs design to make it more pleasant (https://www.dropbox.com/s/pl5ks6tcliioyjd/Screenshot%202014-03-17%2004.39.45.png), thoughts?
[10:41:25] <TheHydroImpulse> (the search box is in a focused state btw)

[11:30:46] <cmr> TheHydroImpulse: doing away with the sidebar?
[11:31:10] <cmr> I like the way it looks.
[11:33:14] <TheHydroImpulse> cmr you like this look or the current design?
[11:33:27] <cmr> this look
[11:33:32] <TheHydroImpulse> oh awesome
[11:33:40] <cmr> I also don't mind the current design, but those screenshots are very clean.
[11:33:55] <TheHydroImpulse> Just testing out some stuff. I'm a sucker for clean things
[11:34:15] <cmr> After Seldaek's girlfriend designed the original layout, we just sort of piled things on in whatever way that worked ;(
[11:34:38] <TheHydroImpulse> hehe
[11:35:37] <TheHydroImpulse> Would changing the design to say, something like this be a huge debate?
[11:36:13] <cmr> getting rid of the sidebar won't be easy I don't think
[11:36:34] <cmr> simply usability wise; it's useful (apparently) to navigate inter-module like that
[11:36:42] <cmr> personally I rarely if ever use it
[11:37:19] <TheHydroImpulse> the sidebar is still completely there, just on a page that doesn't show the items I guess
[11:37:25] <cmr> ohhhh
[11:37:34] <cmr> can you get a screenshot of inside std::io ?
[11:37:57] <TheHydroImpulse> I sure can
[11:39:31] <TheHydroImpulse> I haven't touched the design on the sidebar yet: https://www.dropbox.com/lightbox/home/Public
[11:39:34] <TheHydroImpulse> oops
[11:39:39] <TheHydroImpulse> https://www.dropbox.com/s/obaipgudltawtvz/screencapture-static-rust-lang-org-doc-master-std-index-html%20%281%29.png?m=
[11:40:53] <cmr> looks beautiful
[11:41:01] <cmr> I don't think there'd be resistence to it
[11:41:30] <TheHydroImpulse> Well awesome. 
[11:42:19] <cmr> there is some more information we need to be showing on some types, and we need to be showing stability attributes everywhere
[11:42:44] <cmr> I have to go for now, but in short the builtin traits (Pod etc) that a type implements should be visible somehow
[11:43:02] <TheHydroImpulse> Sounds good. ttyl
[12:13:28] <cmr> TheHydroImpulse: back
[12:25:00] <ChrisMorgan> cmr: the sidebar could be made a lot more useful than it is at present. It's valuable real estate.
[12:29:48] <TheHydroImpulse> cmr wb
[12:31:22] <TheHydroImpulse> ChrisMorgan what do you think would make it more useful?
[12:31:58] <ChrisMorgan> TheHydroImpulse: for starters, at the crate root it should show the modules in the crate.
[12:32:44] <TheHydroImpulse> ChrisMorgan ahh yes, that would make it more consistent.
[12:32:48] <ChrisMorgan> I think it would *probably* be valuable having it a full-on browsable tree, though not necessarily laid out with indentation and all but rather with sliding panels.
[12:33:34] <TheHydroImpulse> That would definitely make things more direct and simple
[12:35:04] <ChrisMorgan> Like the front page of a website, one must be careful, still, not to try to cram everything into it.
[12:36:36] <TheHydroImpulse> Definitely
[12:49:55] <bjz> why do we need the big logo wasing all that space?
[12:50:11] <bjz> you have to scroll down to get at the sidebar
[12:50:16] <cmr> because it's swaggy
[12:50:26] <bjz> valuable time if you are perusing docs
[12:52:28] <ChrisMorgan> And it's not necessarily a Rust logo: http://www.rust-ci.org/chris-morgan/diffbot-rust-client/doc/diffbot/index.html
[12:52:36] <bjz> this is an interesting way of doing it (not sure its the best though) http://erldocs.com/
[12:55:05] <bjz> (I might be wrong)
[12:55:19] <bjz> ChrisMorganI nice robot!
[12:56:06] * bjz does agree with not cramming things too close together, but also thinks that's not a hard or fast rule
[12:56:24] <ChrisMorgan> bjz: that's one form of Diffbot's logo. I certainly didn't draw it.
[12:56:35] <bjz> ah
[12:56:42] <bjz> are you allowed to use it?
[12:56:57] <ChrisMorgan> Should be; the library was commissioned by them.
[12:57:19] <bjz> some projects prefer to keep the logo to official things
[12:57:31] <bjz> ohhh
[12:57:34] <bjz> I see
[12:58:39] <bjz> ChrisMorgan: they commissioned you?
[12:58:45] <ChrisMorgan> bjz: yep
[12:58:49] <bjz> awesome!
[12:59:47] * ChrisMorgan was toying with the notion of becoming a freelancer at that time and happened to come across what is probably the only Rust project to have been on oDesk.
[13:01:05] <bjz> haha
[13:01:37] * ChrisMorgan demonstrated his credentials by being the rust-http author :P
[13:02:39] <bjz> customer service specialist anyone? https://www.odesk.com/o/jobs/browse/?q=rust
[13:03:58] <cmr> "The pipe began to rust while new."
[13:04:17] <cmr> hahah
[13:04:20] <cmr> Must not have an accent
[13:04:25] <cmr> I guess that excludes every human ever
[13:04:36] * ChrisMorgan doesn't have an accent :P
[13:04:41] <ChrisMorgan> Not when I'm typing, anyway.
[13:04:47] <bjz> haha
[13:04:49] <cmr> can confirm
[13:04:50] <TheHydroImpulse> lol
[13:12:51] * ChrisMorgan was expecting complaints about Australian spelling
[13:13:05] * cmr doesn't notice
[13:17:35] * ChrisMorgan clearly hasn't been passing himself off as a fair dinkum bonza Aussie sufficiently well, saying things like g'day (and g'night as it is now past midnight)
[13:54:19] <bjz> man american spelling is so weird
[13:54:29] <bjz> :P
[13:54:56] <bjz> too many Zs
