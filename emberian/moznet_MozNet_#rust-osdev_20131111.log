[09:32:06] <Seldaek> dbaupp: thanks for the PR on coreutils but not sure what you did :p
[09:32:20] <Seldaek> probably needs a rebase 
[09:32:42] <Seldaek> and it won't fix the build unfortunately since there's still code using old io :/
[09:32:51] <Seldaek> but that's a bit more stuff to fix
[09:34:00] <dbaupp> Seldaek: yeah, I must've been working off the wrong branch or something... I dunno :S
[09:34:20] <dbaupp> anyway, new IO does weird things with EOF on files vs tty's, so I'm trying to fix that :P

[09:58:52] <Seldaek> dbaupp: added some comments, mostly questions because I'm out of the loop lately
[09:59:09] <Seldaek> but otherwise looks good thanks!
[10:05:41] <dbaupp> Seldaek: fixed that match thing (and added an extra commit)
[10:07:08] <Seldaek> cheers
[10:08:22] <Seldaek> dbaupp: the "writeln!(&mut stderr() as &mut Writer," but doesn't feel like an improvement in the language though
[10:08:34] <dbaupp> Seldaek: yeah, I know, it's fairly ugly. :(
[10:09:05] <dbaupp> (having writeln! at all is an improvement, though.)
[10:09:34] <cmr> Once we have implicit trait object coercion it should be fine.
[10:10:21] <dbaupp> yeah
[10:10:28] <Seldaek> yay for a brighter future then
[10:11:17] <cmr> I also think we should have auto-borrow so that if you have `let x = foo(); bar(x);` and bar takes a &, it will auto-borrow, but maybe that's just me.
[10:11:39] <cmr> (which would make that `writeln!(stderr())`)
[10:13:15] <Seldaek> yeah that'd be nice
[10:16:01] <Seldaek> dbaupp: "Build #19 was fixed." hurray

[13:07:56] <eddyb> strcat: have you figured already how you would allow a default heap to be defined without cfg(libc)? my solution only works when you include rust-core's module tree, instead of linking against a crate (which doesn't work yet for that usecase, no static linking)
[13:08:10] <strcat> no, don't know how it would work
[13:09:06] <strcat> I could separate out the config flag for malloc/free from libc
[13:09:27] <strcat> and they could be supplied just as functions in the group of stuff you're linking
[13:09:31] <eddyb> would you consider the "pull in items from a support module" trick, or do you want it to only work as a crate?
[13:11:17] <strcat> I want it to work as a crate, once rust has static linking and LTO
[13:11:36] <eddyb> strcat: I can't define malloc/free in Rust, which keeps the dependency on a C file alive, and I need LTO to get some optimization
[13:11:55] <strcat> why can't you define them in rust?
[13:11:58] <eddyb> but I somehow doubt it will work as well :(
[13:12:12] <eddyb> strcat: because they get renamed, as the import is also a definition
[13:12:47] <eddyb> you can't import and export a function with the same name. that might work better if rust-core is a crate, but still...
[13:12:53] <strcat> eddyb: afaik it works fine if it was a crate
[13:13:02] <strcat> it just doesn't work in the broken single-crate system
[13:13:18] <strcat> privacy also isn't going to work afaik
[13:13:18] *** Quits: brson (brson@6A848D32.C1B840DD.76F66111.IP) (Ping timeout)
[13:13:22] <strcat> it can't stay this way
[13:14:48] <eddyb> strcat: it's sad because SlamAllocator can implement a fancy Allocator trait, but it still has to go through C :/
[13:15:34] <strcat> I'm too frustrated with rust atm to continue work on it anyway, there are too many language limitations
[13:15:51] <strcat> if it could be a crate, because there was static linking and LTO, I would be unable to export macros from it
[13:15:59] <strcat> the stdlib does this by having the macros hard-coded into the parser
[13:16:14] <strcat> can't actually make use of allocators right now anyway because generic dtors don't work
[13:16:53] <strcat> generic functions with foreign ABIs don't work which threw a wrench in my attempt at making a fork-join style thread pool abstraction
[13:16:56] * strcat shrugs
[13:17:21] <strcat> and ofc not being able to write sane smart pointers and vectors in a library
[13:17:59] <strcat> things being hard-wired into the language is the biggest problem with rust imo, it leads to libraries being second-class citizens
[13:19:59] <eddyb> #[lang="~[T]"] struct Vec<T> ....
[13:20:44] <strcat> and now it has no allocator support
[13:20:56] <strcat> and it's stuck with whatever representation ~[T] uses
[13:21:23] <eddyb> why?
[13:21:44] <strcat> because ~[T] literals are hard-coded into the compiler, as are dtors, and indexing, and auto-slicing
[13:21:49] <strcat> unless it all becomes a lang item
[13:22:02] <eddyb> although, having librustc look for a specific lang item before compiling code using that feature... kinda problematic
[13:22:03] <strcat> in which case I would ask why not just add generic literals and drop ~[T]
[13:29:17] <eddyb> well, types are processed before functions, so rustc could just alias ~[T] to Vec<T> - the rest should work, if it does for Vec<T>
