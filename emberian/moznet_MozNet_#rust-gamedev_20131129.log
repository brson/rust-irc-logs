[04:33:24] <bjz> well, AEST seeing as I'm on holiday up in Brisbane for the next couple of weeks
[04:33:39] <csherratt> I am working on a game engine that I hope to put in a commercial project if the stars alight right.
[04:34:09] <bjz> nice!
[04:34:20] <bjz> what kind of architecture are you going with?
[04:35:38] * bjz is beginning to head in this direction, although he has been distracted trying to get his head around Rust's concurrency model for the time being
[04:36:20] <bjz> csherratt: h3r3tic, jeaye and sebcrozet are also doing game engine stuff
[04:36:54] <bjz> h3r3tic can't post his work because of his annoying work contract, but he is a cool guy to talk to
[04:43:31] <csherratt> The hope is to build something fairly pipelined. The physics / game logic / rendering / sound ect will run concurrently to each other. 
[04:44:26] <csherratt> the physic calculations for frame N will be rendering at the same time as frame N-1. and the user input will be sampled for N+1 at the same moment.
[04:45:17] <csherratt> there is quite a bit you should be able to do in a pipelined fashion inside of the rendering context to.
[04:45:47] <csherratt> I'm at the very early stage so I don't have much more then hand wavy ideas.
[04:47:37] <csherratt> glx-rs might have some overlap with what I want to do with the rendering pipeline design. So I did want to find out more about where you were going with that.
[04:48:40] <cmr> bjz: you're working on glx bindings?
[04:49:12] <csherratt> gfx* oops
[04:49:46] <bjz> that sounds super awesome, and similar to what I was planning
[04:50:05] <bjz> I've done some work locally with gfx-rs that I haven't pushed yet
[04:50:54] <bjz> but yeah, definitely interested to hear your opinions. I'm rather new at this I must say
[04:51:45] <bjz> what are your thoughts on what I've previously posted re. gfx-rs?

[05:23:21] <bjz> like, I dunno how practical some of my goals are
[05:23:40] <bjz> maybe it might be easier to head more towards a framework than a library

[05:34:43] <csherratt> yes.
[05:42:27] <csherratt> So here is what I was thinking for how to build out the rendering pipeline. This has some overlap with gfx-rs, but I'm not sure if it is exactly what you had in mind. A frame is prepared by sending an update list from the `game logic core` to the rendering pipeline. The update list just updates location information of the objects, this could be anything from rotation, position, to even extreme parts like the skeleton. Basically 
[05:42:28] <csherratt> anything that you are pushing into your vertex shader via a uniform.
[05:43:11] *** Quits: nielsle (nielsle@moz-C46DA772.boa.fiberby.dk) (Ping timeout)
[05:43:27] <bjz> that sounds nice
[05:43:29] <csherratt> when you draw a frame, the frame data is built out of a tree like structure. a frame buffer has a scene object, a scene is a collection of drawable object ect.
[05:43:52] <bjz> by 'send' do you mean via a pipe?
[05:45:08] <csherratt> I'm actually not sure how I am going to do ITC (inter task communication) right now. I don't know if you have benchmarked comm::pipe but it is pretty scary. 
[05:45:18] *** Joins: nielsle (nielsle@moz-C46DA772.boa.fiberby.dk)
[05:45:48] <csherratt> Since each message comm::pipe sends is allocated, you end up getting bottlenecked on malloc/free.
[05:45:58] <csherratt> not sure if that has changed since I last looked at it.
[05:46:04] <bjz> yeah, you might need to talk to brson about that
[05:46:21] <bjz> he probably knows the most about the runtime (he wrote it)
[05:46:57] <bjz> larsberg is another good fellow to talk about performant concurrency
[05:47:30] <cmr> csherratt: acrichto is working on chans/ports
[05:48:01] <bjz> that's his area of expertise, but he's still relatively new to Rust (he's an employee working on servo, but he's done work on CML and Manticore)
[05:48:01] <csherratt> yeah, I don't want to make to much noise as far the language development is going. To many people keep trying to bike shed ideas.
[05:48:14] <bjz> oh, this stuff is more performance related
[05:48:30] <bjz> thankfully
[05:48:58] <bjz> it's worth talking about
[05:50:42] <bjz> csherratt: plus this is more library related

[05:53:57] <bjz> before 1.0

[05:54:08] <bjz> yep
[05:54:09] <cmr> I don't know if it /will/ be, but it's certainly within reach now.
[05:54:16] <cmr> (or, after the next few changes)

[06:06:48] <Yurume> I prefer ASCII diagrams for that very reason ;)
[06:07:45] <csherratt> send receive reply message passing, it's an alternative to traditional synchronous message passing. It adds an extra state, where synchronous message passing has send blocked / receive blocked states it adds a 3rd state called reply blocked. So when you send a message to a server, you block waiting on the response.
[06:08:06] <cmr> so like rendezvous?

[06:16:18] <csherratt> So the reason SRR is neat is that since the sending task is blocked for the time that the receiving task is working on it's request, they can safely share data.
[06:17:02] <csherratt> so in the context of rust, you could potentially share stack allocated data with another task without copying it.
[06:18:00] <cmr> hm, that is interesting
[06:18:09] <cmr> I don't think we can express it safely, though
[06:21:11] <csherratt> the same thing can be emulated with tossing an owned pointer back and forth, which is not a bad compromise.
[06:22:09] * bjz wants a diagram
[06:30:08] <csherratt> it's like this http://www.qnx.com/developers/docs/qnx_4.25_docs/qnx4/sysarch/images/messpass.gif
