[00:00:04] <bascule> DHE should diediedie
[00:00:09] <bascule> as for (FF)DHE?
[00:00:15] <bascule> 1) fuck RHEL5
[00:00:22] <Tiffany> maybe it would be better to specify the things in TLS which do not need to diediedie
[00:00:28] <bascule> 2) If we have a "backup", it should not be FFDHE
[00:00:39] <bascule> Tiffany: haha, seems hard
[00:00:51] <bascule> Tiffany: at that point, fuck it all and switch to Noise ;)
[00:01:00] <Ilari> I would say fuck anything that doesn't do at least TLS 1.2. And everything major that does TLS 1.2 does ECDHE.
[00:01:11] <bascule> FFDHE does not make sense to me
[00:01:13] <bascule> and what's sad
[00:01:28] <bascule> when I complained about it on the TLS mailing list, my complaints got lost and tangled up in "Java"
[00:01:51] <bascule> but the people who were complaining to me seem to be ignoring that RHEL5 wants to make *additive legacy bullshit changes*
[00:01:58] <bascule> I want to *remove obsolete shit*
[00:02:14] <bascule> if you are in the former and not the latter camp, you are the enemy of good
[00:02:34] <Ilari> Compatiblity and security are not compatible.
[00:03:08] <Ilari> Especially if the old is crappy.
[00:56:46] <Ilari> The problem with old stuff in TLS is that it is invariably garbage -> Needs removing for security.
[01:00:16] <Ilari> I think it is much more likely that ffdhe just falls apart completely than that any nontrivial fraction of prime elliptic curves is discovered to actually be weak.
[01:03:11] <Ilari> Hasn't problem analogous to ffdhe in binary fields fallen apart completely?
[01:07:49] <bascule> Ilari: do you think FFDHE is a good/bad idea?
[01:08:05] <bascule> I mean
[01:08:09] <bascule> I guess you basically said bad
[01:08:15] <bascule> heh
[01:08:31] <bascule> I am in favor of less complexity and legacy bullshit
[01:08:41] <bascule> which is what attracts me to Noise

[01:17:43] <bascule> Ilari: nah, ECC is too new and we need to let it simmer for another decade before it can be trusted, and until then we should stick to RSA o_O
[01:18:13] <kmc> i remember running RHEL5 on a PDP-8 and we had to shovel coal in the front when we restarted apache
[01:19:34] <Tobba> bascule: also eh, are you sure about plaintext certificates vs simple binary encodings
[01:19:50] <Tobba> it sounds like a potential cause for needless complexity and ambiguity :P
[01:23:37] <Ilari> I think it is higly unlikely that "NIST" curves are backdoored in any way (crappy sure, due to many mistaken assumptions / not knowing better).
[01:23:45] <Ilari> *highly

[01:29:18] <bascule> Tobba: uhh what now?
[01:29:40] * bascule agrees the NIST curves are (probably unlikely) not backdoored
[01:29:59] <Tobba> bascule: human readable certs vs a binary encoding you can't possibly fuck up
[01:30:00] <bascule> the NSA used all their 90s era ECC knowledge to insert a backdoor djb hasn't found in 16 years!
[01:30:19] <bascule> Tobba: I'm not sure what you're responding to specifically, but I could go either way on that
[01:30:24] <bascule> and there is a sort of middle ground
[01:30:28] <bascule> like pkt-likes
[01:30:51] <bascule> and if I have expressed otherwise in the past, I disavow all previous opinions
[01:31:24] <bascule> this is the funny thing about langsec
[01:31:31] <bascule> they're all "context-free or regular"
[01:31:33] <Tobba> http://cleancrypt.org/tls/ mentions human readabiliy a lot
[01:31:51] <bascule> but I think my personal preference is "recursive regular" (a context-sensitive grammar, afaict)
[01:31:57] <bascule> Tobba: I should probably rewrite it

[01:32:22] <bascule> it's like a year and a half old at this point I think

[03:04:40] <eternaleye> bascule: Part of the problem IMO is that langsec defines its stuff by grammars, not parsers.
[03:05:17] <eternaleye> bascule: Personally, I think that the cutoff should be "Has unambiguous deterministic O(n) parsing algorithm"
[03:07:23] <Lurkin2> Hey c74d did you get your coreos setup going?
[03:07:48] <o11c> is there any *useful* grammar that isn't LR(1) ?
[03:08:39] <o11c> (note that SLR(k), LALR(k), and LR(k) all cover the same set of *languages*, but the grammars may need to be contorted)
[03:16:51] <eternaleye> o11c: C?
[03:17:35] <eternaleye> o11c: Dunno if it is or not, though
[03:19:53] <eternaleye> o11c: Oh, you said LR(1), not LL(1)
[03:21:17] <eternaleye> o11c: Anyway, LR parsers only handle deterministic context-free
[03:21:33] <eternaleye> o11c: Length-value formats are context-sensitive
[03:22:34] <eternaleye> o11c: So anything that supports extents, or subelements that are length-bounded rather than sentinel-delimited? Nope.
[03:22:48] <eternaleye> o11c: For text formats, that's not a big deal.
[03:22:55] <eternaleye> o11c: But for binary encodings?
[03:24:30] <eternaleye> o11c: Enjoy either finding a sentinel not in your data (not binary-safe) or escaping it in the stream (SUCKS BALLS TO WRITE ENCODERS)

[03:56:30] <eternaleye> Separate lexing is an artefact of the implementation
[03:57:18] <eternaleye> The lexer/parser split is misleading; both are part of the "parser"
[04:15:12] <o11c> the point is that you can use whatever technique you want to hand-write the parser efficiently
[04:15:27] <o11c> lexing is a much smaller problem than parsing
[04:18:50] <eternaleye> o11c: What I mean is that if you use the lexer for that, the whole is not "context free" and is not "parseable with LR(1)"
[04:20:13] <o11c> lexing and parsing are separate steps for a reason
[04:20:37] <eternaleye> o11c: The token stream is; but the actual format is not.
[04:20:39] <eternaleye> o11c: Also, it presumes that the only place such things occur is at the lexer level - that only tokens are length-delimited
[04:20:42] <eternaleye> o11c: With that, RIFF is unparseable, as are any number of other formats.
[04:23:27] <eternaleye> o11c: Including CBOR
[04:25:24] <eternaleye> o11c: To parse CBOR like that, you'd need to lex length-delimited, parse, and then lex the *interiors*, and repeat.
[04:25:39] <eternaleye> o11c: IOW, it really does become part of the parser.
[04:27:38] <eternaleye> o11c: Separating them like that is useful in simple cases, but treating them as ideologically separate rather than a matter of convenience is just incorrect.

[18:15:35] <Ilari> bascule: AFAIK, it doesn't.
[18:22:43] <Ilari> I actually don't know another curve that would be valid for EdDSA than Curve25519.

[18:25:35] <Tiffany> that is impressively bad
[18:26:36] <Ilari> Oops, I think M-383 would be valid. But you would need hash function that is pretty much unobtanium.
[18:27:04] <Ilari> Oh, and M-511.
[18:28:19] <bascule> Tiffany: we actually used FogBugz back in 2006 on Linux. It had horrible escaping bugs

[18:30:53] <Ilari> Oh, and nobody uses M-383 or M-511.

[19:37:11] <Ilari> eternaleye: CBOR ocassionally also has the fun of packing CBOR maps inside octet strings (which can be fragmented).
[19:44:45] <Ilari> Also, AFAIK in CBOR (unless you have nested CBOR encodings), the only place where lexing is context-dependent is octet/text string fragments (and those can't nest).
