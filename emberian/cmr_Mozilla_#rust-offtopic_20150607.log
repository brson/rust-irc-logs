[00:27:51] <raph> i saw recently that baidu is using go for their main frontend
[00:28:25] <raph> they had a poster on this at the o'reilly velocity conference
[00:28:44] <raph> their #1 complaint is the garbage collector, and they did interesting hacks to get around it
[00:29:35] <raph> they take threads offline, collect, and then bring them back online, so gc doesn't affect latency
[00:29:54] <eddyb> lol
[00:30:06] <eddyb> it's like Erlang mixed with bad C
[00:31:09] <raph> well, the new go gc should be very interesting for that kind of work
[00:31:23] <raph> but of course it leaves me wondering if rust might not have been a better choice
[00:31:42] <Tobba> I'm not sure if our web frameworks are there yet, but probably
[00:31:48] <raph> not yet

[00:37:32] <eddyb> raph: does it enable generics?
[00:37:46] <raph> eddyb: no, strictly orthogonal
[00:38:01] <eddyb> :P
[00:38:11] <raph> my understanding is that generics are not really on the golang roadmap, because a simple, compelling design hasn't surfaced
[00:38:15] <eddyb> Tobba: want to try it? https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/6303
[00:38:19] <raph> but you probably already knew that
[00:38:37] <eddyb> the C++ template design isn't compelling because it's too ducktapey for Go?
[00:39:10] <raph> and they have a point, generics make the type system complex, which makes compile slow, and there are plenty of languages that offer that :)
[00:39:51] <Tobba> eddyb: sure, one sec
[00:40:15] <Tobba> ... and that somehow detached my HEAD, magic
[00:40:17] <eddyb> raph: generics make the type system
[00:40:31] <eddyb> Tobba: it should be fine :P
[00:40:51] <raph> eddyb: the syllogism still stands then
[00:40:59] <raph> type systems make the compile slow
[00:41:19] <eddyb> I don't see why they would, TBH
[00:41:34] <eddyb> you know what makes the compile slow? monomorphization
[00:42:21] <eddyb> and the C++ template model comes with post-monomorphization type checking
[00:42:28] <eddyb> which is a good reason for not using it in Go
[00:42:50] <eddyb> but if you don't do that, it's not duck typed anymore and you need bounds in generics
[00:42:58] <eddyb> hahahaha Go is so screwed
[00:43:25] <eddyb> they have to choose between simple and slow
[00:43:45] <eddyb> wait, no
[00:44:15] <eddyb> (simple and slow) or (complex and fast)
[00:44:27] <eddyb> between slow and complex, that's what I meant

[00:45:32] <eddyb> hey, Plan 9 was cool
[00:45:43] <Astrum|Lap> I just don't understand Go
[00:45:53] <Astrum|Lap> if google wasn't behind it would it even be a thing?
[00:46:29] <Tobba> eddyb: why did I click a buzzfeed link and why was the last one actually funny
[00:47:58] <eddyb> I did not expect that
[00:49:16] <niconii> the funny thing about #4 is you could interpret "posing with the old versions of themselves" both ways
[00:49:23] <Tobba> eddyb: I can't get the userscript to work
[00:49:29] <eddyb> how?
[00:49:32] <Tobba> specifying --userscripts causes each thread to panic left and right
[00:49:42] <eddyb> -_-
[00:49:43] <Tobba> no matter what arguments I give it
[00:49:47] <eddyb> oh don't
[00:49:52] <eddyb> it takes a directory
[00:50:10] <niconii> was "how?" directed at me or Tobba
[00:50:12] <eddyb> I just put my script in resources/user-agent-js/
[00:50:14] <eddyb> niconii: Tobba
[00:50:18] <niconii> gotcha
[00:50:35] <eddyb> Tobba: resources/user-agent-js/ is the default if you pass no directory
[00:50:40] <Tobba> eddyb: I did
[00:50:43] <Tobba> I had to pass it an absolute path to that
[00:50:46] <Tobba> otherwise it would shit itself
[00:51:12] <Tobba> well, the animations are buggy as hell but do work
[00:51:18] <eddyb> :D
[00:51:27] <eddyb> I expect it to be smoother on a release build
[00:51:30] <eddyb> let's start that
[00:51:40] <Tobba> the circle sometimes goes outside of the button
[00:52:13] <eddyb> that might be a clipping issue
[00:52:30] <eddyb> I have no idea why the colors don't show up
[00:52:45] <eddyb> and the arrangement of the buttons is wrong because Servo doesn't have flex
[00:53:06] <Tobba> eddyb: nah uh, it's a rendering issue
[00:53:12] <Tobba> the circle is correctly clipped but offset
[00:53:43] <Tobba> actually, there is a clipping issue where the circle renders everywhere but inside of the button
[00:54:00] <Tobba> (click the drop shadow of COLORFUL)
[00:54:25] <Tobba> or anywhere on the BUTTON one and you get an offset but correctly clipped thing

[00:58:38] <niconii> for instance that is *not* super metroid
[00:58:56] <niconii> that's the samus from metroid 1's box art
[00:59:36] <Astrum|Lap> eh, I suppose we can't expect great things from buzzfeed
[00:59:42] <niconii> (for some reason a bunch of nintendo's nes games have like... pixel art, except slightly more detailed than what's actually on the nes for some reason)
[00:59:58] <niconii> also, both gladoses are from portal 2
[01:00:23] <niconii> glados wasn't as detailed in portal 1

[01:13:47] <eddyb> c74d: hahahaha
[01:13:53] <eddyb> c74d: maybe this was their ploy all along
[01:14:00] <raph> no doubt
[01:14:29] <cmr> c74d: thankfully they removed "don't be evil" from their ethos a few years ago.
[01:14:50] <raph> russ cox and rob pike sitting around in 2009 saying, "1. write go; 2. baidu will adopt it in 6 years. 3. ??? 4. profit!"
[01:14:56] <eddyb> Go has enough pitfalls to cause issues sooner or later
[01:14:59] <bombless> Hmm will water-cooling be as noisy as fan if I use it on i7 CPU?
[01:15:42] <Astrum|Lap> bombless: depends how you set it up
[01:16:25] <cmr> bombless: overclocked? I run a xeon with stock fans at 100% and it's pretty quiet.
[01:16:44] <cmr> (the only loud thing in that system is the GPU and the 6 hard drives)
[01:16:52] <bombless> at first I want to build a PC without fan, then I realize the pump will also be very noisy
[01:17:33] <bombless> so all I need is basically a quiet fan :D
[01:17:37] <Astrum|Lap> well if you want to go crazy about things you can always use a particularly powerful pump and put it in another room with a radiator
[01:17:42] <Astrum|Lap> and just pipe it into the tower
[01:17:42] <cmr> heh
[01:17:48] <raph> there's not much percentage imho in hating on go; it's very good at what it does
[01:18:11] <cmr> raph: I agree, it reaches an excellent local maximum in its space.

[01:19:23] <cmr> Astrum|Lap: Here's my 100TB Lagrangian I used to model the space:
[01:19:43] <raph> with convolutional neural networks it's not an insane question
[01:20:23] <raph> they can write c linux kernel code already: http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/
[01:20:36] <raph> s/convolutional/recurrent/
[01:20:54] <c74d> NixOS users: how should I install Rust/start a Rust project in NixOS?
[01:21:25] <cmr> Tobba eddyb: ^
[01:22:39] * raph waits for people's minds to be blown if they haven't seen that already
[01:22:52] <Astrum|Lap> raph: saw it a bit ago
[01:22:54] <Astrum|Lap> pretty cool
[01:23:12] <raph> so we just need to train an RNN over the space of language designs
[01:23:16] <Astrum|Lap> though saying it can write c linux kernel code is a bit of a stretch
[01:23:27] <Tobba> c74d: nix-env -i rust
[01:23:29] <Tobba> ?
[01:23:40] <raph> Astrum|Lap: definitely
[01:23:43] <Tobba> actually, that should probably be nix-env -i rustc cargo
[01:24:01] <raph> after a few iterations with poorly tuned parameters it might come up with nim
[01:24:30] <c74d> Tobba: hm, I was under the impression that installing things with `nix-env -i` is bad practice?
[01:24:32] <raph> oops, gotta remember rule 4
[01:24:36] <Astrum|Lap> shots fired
[01:24:47] <cmr> Astrum|Lap: I suspect you'd get similar results if you feed a few files of that to a random complete-non-programmer and asked them to write something that resembled it!
[01:25:30] <Tobba> c74d: not really, no
[01:25:46] <Tobba> though you can use nix-shell for it, it's more complicated
[01:25:49] <c74d> hm. maybe that was only for Haskell.
[01:25:59] <Astrum|Lap> cmr: I doubt it, lol
[01:26:25] <eddyb> c74d: what cargo does is project-local so there isn't much friction
[01:26:29] <cmr> Astrum|Lap: you're right, it'd probably be worse, but,
[01:26:55] <c74d> …I guess it's somewhat irrelevant seeing as this is a live-medium environment where software I install with Nix is presumably going to not persist over reboots.
[01:26:55] <eddyb> c74d: if something you're working on has native dependencies, you'll need nix-shell for sanity
[01:27:03] <Astrum|Lap> the human will seek out patterns and find plenty that aren't there
[01:27:13] <Astrum|Lap> whatever they output would be funny though
[01:27:23] <eddyb> c74d: nix-env installs in an user-specific profile. unless you're playing on a liveCD?
[01:27:39] <raph> while in science fiction mode, i bet you could train a neural network to take rust code that almost passes the type/borrow checker and suggests fixes to it
[01:27:43] <c74d> er… the boot medium is readonly, where's the store…
[01:27:59] <eddyb> RAM
[01:27:59] <c74d> eddyb: playing on a live-SD-card, but yes.
[01:28:12] <cmr> raph: rustc already does a pretty good job suggeting fixes :P
[01:28:14] <c74d> So it will work, but not persist, okay.
[01:28:22] <raph> cmr: indeed
[01:28:34] <cmr> (for small numbers of errors that don't interact heavily with each other)
[01:28:36] <raph> so it's basically a trivial problem for an rnn
[01:28:53] <cmr> not sure, it'd need to actually learn the type system.
[01:28:59] <raph> how hard is that?
[01:29:08] <raph> i'm only half kidding here
[01:29:23] <raph> i think it could learn an extremely baby form of the type system where you have strings and vectors and not much else
[01:29:31] <c74d> eddyb: my project (a package manager) will indeed depend on C libraries (libcurl, GPGME, maybe others).
[01:29:32] <raph> primitive nums, that kind of thing
[01:30:04] <c74d> …although both of those could be replaced by invoking the `curl` and `gpg` programs.
[01:30:14] <cmr> yeah, it'd probably be easy to do a type system corresponding at most to propositional logic.
[01:30:47] <cmr> but rust's type system is higher-order, which is... challenging.
[01:30:48] <c74d> …eh, using `gpg` like that is supposedly nasty, enough that there's GPGME to wrap it.
[01:30:49] <raph> one reason to be hopeful is that "does the program compile now" could be used to automate the training set
[01:30:53] <cmr> yeah.
[01:31:05] <cmr> I'd love to see an experiment in that, it'd be super interesting.
[01:31:17] <raph> if i were a kid in grad school...
[01:31:17] * cmr -> sleep
[01:33:02] <zwarich> cmr: yo
[01:33:29] <zwarich> there has been a bunch of work recently on using SMT / weighted SMT to find the causes of type errors
[01:34:18] <raph> sat mod theory?
[01:34:47] <zwarich> raph: yeah
[01:34:54] <raph> sounds interesting
[01:35:22] <zwarich> SAT solvers are insanely good relative to the apparent difficulty of NP-complete problems
[01:39:37] <c74d> eddyb: so, to use nix-shell for this, I need to write a Nix package definition for my project?
[01:40:01] <eddyb> c74d: just an env. it's pretty simple
[01:40:25] <c74d> Where should I look to see what an env is?
[01:40:28] <eddyb> https://gist.github.com/eddyb/0deeebe91cfab395b330
[01:40:36] <eddyb> this is what I use for servo
[01:40:54] <eddyb> this is a default.nix file in my servo checkout
[01:41:25] <eddyb> c74d: it's not a "package definition", just the dependencies
[01:41:34] <eddyb> and I use it like so: nix-shell --command './mach build -d'
[01:41:46] <eddyb> where ./mach build -d is what you'd usually run outside of NixOS
[01:42:53] <c74d> Okay, thanks.

[03:05:55] <Astrum|Lap> a lot of programs offer -h
[03:05:58] <XMPPwocky> I'm appreciating responsive design way more now that i'm using a tiling wm
[03:06:02] <Astrum|Lap> so you kind of get used to it
[03:06:10] <Astrum|Lap> then you run across an odd one that doesn't and you scratch your head
[03:06:38] <Astrum|Lap> can I start a petition to rename that to something other than responsive design?
[03:07:05] <niconii> some have -h and --help, some only have --help, some only have -h, some have -help...
[03:07:22] <niconii> and then there's the ones that don't have anything......
[03:07:38] <Astrum|Lap> seriously, 'responsive' was the worst possible word they could have used
[03:07:55] <Astrum|Lap> they may as well have called it 'articulating fulcrum design'

[03:08:22] <niconii> oh, and then there's windows programs, which expect /?
[03:08:36] <niconii> ...except for the ones that don't because they're cross-platform
[03:08:57] <XMPPwocky> my windows install somehow got a bunch of coreutils in its path from mingw
[03:09:00] <XMPPwocky> which is fun
[03:09:12] <XMPPwocky> 90% of the time it's helpful, 10% of the time it breaks things

[04:34:53] <bombless> http://slash-r-slash-rust.github.io/archived/2u1dme.html#co4uurq I'm trying to translate this, does he mean "intense pressure of stabilizing and shipping a finished product on some plausible timetable"?
[04:36:03] <bombless> that "stabilizing and shipping a finished product on some plausible timetable" part looks odd to me
[04:38:57] <Quxxy> bombless: Reads fine to me; I'm not sure what aspect you're having trouble with

[04:41:22] <Quxxy> Is it the "some plausible timetable" part?  I think he's saying "completing the project (getting it to a point where the language is stable and it is usable for regular users) such that completing it doesn't take an unreasonable amount of time"
[04:41:50] <Quxxy> i.e. not expanding scope or slipping so much that it simply never gets done, no matter how "doable" it appears at any given moment
[04:42:25] <Quxxy> i.e. it might *look* like you can eat a meal in front of you, but you'll find it hard if people keep adding more and more food to the plate
[04:42:38] <Quxxy> Clearer?
[04:42:59] <bombless> Quxxy: so "plausible timetable" is part of "contradictory demands"?
[04:43:26] <Quxxy> Ah
[04:43:54] <Quxxy> I believe so; I think the correct grouping is:
[04:44:28] <Quxxy> Every day involved another round of intense pressure to meet the contradictory demands of ( absorbing advanced features from C++/Lisp/Haskell/Scala/Cyclone ;; pursuing a "fastest in the world" performance target ;; paying off technical debt for all the mistakes we'd made thus far ;; maintaining internal consistency and correctness ;; stabilizing and shipping a finished product on some...
[04:44:29] <Quxxy> ...plausible timetable ).
[04:44:41] <bombless> Quxxy: Thanks! That makes sense.
[04:44:46] <Quxxy> Cool
[04:45:09] <bombless> guess my biggest problem is that I'm treating absorbing as adj.
[04:45:40] <Quxxy> Well, I suppose it *could* be in another context
[04:45:41] <Quxxy> Here it's a verb
[04:47:08] <raph> my parse matches Quxxy
[04:48:34] <bombless> that parsing route is usable at least, reminds me of an RFC that suggest macro expanding should retry a different path when it fail otherwise $tt is useless

[04:49:20] <Quxxy> bombless: $tt is *not* useless

[04:50:35] <Quxxy> c74d: ontopic in offtopic is still offtopic :D
[04:50:39] <Quxxy> It's just offtopic offtopic
[05:01:49] <bombless> hmm when I /msg playbot on #rust-zh it response on #rust-internals
[05:02:04] <bombless> I wonder if this is a bug of HexChat ..
[05:04:41] <niconii> bombless: when you */msg* playbot? that should just be private chat
[05:05:08] <c74d> bombless: try using /query rather than /msg
[05:05:28] <bombless> yes /query works fine
[05:06:09] <c74d> I believe some clients display responses to /msg as channel messages, whereas AFAIK responses to /query are consistently displayed separately.
[05:08:18] <c74d> …and seeing as playbot is not in #rust-zh, it would be predictable for such a client to not display playbot's responses to your /msg messages in #rust-zh, on the assumption that it (HexChat) should display the responses in a channel that playbot is it.

[12:28:04] <Quxxy> It's like... the *regular* way of pinning a program to the start menu wasn't good enough for a browser
[12:28:17] <Quxxy> It *has* to have a redundant way of getting into Start...

[12:35:15] <eddyb> so I follow it around a bit
[12:35:26] <eddyb> the stack trace is wrong, I think
[12:35:28] <eddyb> or something
[12:35:36] <eddyb> it jumps around a bit *after* the SetEvent call returns

[12:40:14] <eddyb> it's supposed to resume, but +5 is the invalid offset

[12:42:45] <WindowsBunny> Morning eddyb
[12:44:54] <Tobba> eddyb: does wine have the 2 byte patching hole?
[12:44:58] <Tobba> you'd think they would
[12:51:13] <eddyb> it doesn't
[12:51:24] <eddyb> mov edi, edi; push ebp; mov ebp, esp
[12:51:32] <eddyb> so this is the 5 byte thing
[12:51:41] <eddyb> mov edi, edi is two bytes
[12:51:58] <eddyb> now... I can edit the wine ELF
[12:52:03] <eddyb> this is going to be fun :D
[12:52:09] <Tobba> the mov edi, edi is the 2-byte patching hole
[12:52:43] <eddyb> I just need to assume that the hook is going to save ebp for me
[12:52:49] <eddyb> and work off of that
[12:53:19] <eddyb> it does align esp, among other things
[12:53:27] <eddyb> I could just hope it doesn't use SSE in an interesting way :P

[12:58:48] * WindowsBunny nibbles on Tobba
[12:59:26] <eddyb> okay, wtf
[12:59:40] <Tobba> I'm busy trying to figure out why my context switching code is jumping to 0xFFFFEFF0
[12:59:43] <eddyb> Tobba: the wine code *before* saving ebp, well, it does something weird
[12:59:51] <Tobba> WindowsBunny: shouldn't bindgen on wsock.h work pretty well?
[12:59:59] <eddyb> it aligns the stack to a 16-byte boundary
[13:00:05] <Tobba> that's pretty standard
[13:00:08] <eddyb> and then pushes the return pointer
[13:00:16] <eddyb> the original esp is not saved anywhere
[13:00:19] <WindowsBunny> Tobba: I'm doing this from the microsoft headers, not mingw
[13:00:26] <eddyb> wouldn't shit break after returning?
[13:00:28] <WindowsBunny> Tobba: and last time I tried bindgen puked on microsoft headers
[13:00:48] <Tobba> eddyb: huh, that's weird
[13:00:57] <eddyb> either that or I'm reading it wrong
[13:01:01] <WindowsBunny> Tobba: also its winsock2.h and ws2tcpip.h
[13:01:04] <eddyb> it goes like
[13:01:11] <Tobba> WindowsBunny: close enough
[13:01:32] <eddyb> lea ecx, [esp + 4]; and esp, ~15; push [ecx - 4]
[13:01:36] <WindowsBunny> Tobba: If you manage to get bindgen working on official microsoft headers though, please tell me how you did it
[13:02:15] <Tobba> eddyb: looks fine to me, it's saved in ecx
[13:02:19] <eddyb> oh right
[13:02:21] <eddyb> well, fuck
[13:02:41] <Tobba> although it's doing it in a certainly wacky manner
[13:02:52] <eddyb> let's assume it doesn't matter whether it's aligned or not
[13:03:16] <eddyb> the hook is going to handle push ebp; mov ebp, esp for me
[13:03:23] <eddyb> or assume it's there, at least
[13:03:38] <Tobba> I thought it only handled push ebp; ?
[13:03:50] <eddyb> it jumps after 5 bytes
[13:04:03] <eddyb> so mov ebp, esp can't run
[13:04:10] <eddyb> unless I'm reading the offsets wrong
[13:05:02] <Tobba> I'd just modify Wine so that the functions start with "mov edi, edi; push ebp"
[13:05:09] <eddyb> haha no
[13:05:17] <eddyb> so esp = esp0 - 4 after the hook
[13:05:33] <eddyb> ecx has to be esp0 + 4
[13:06:02] <eddyb> the return pointer is not an issue, thankfully :D
[13:06:29] <eddyb> so: mov edi, edi; push ebp; mov ebp, esp; lea ecx, [esp + 8]
[13:06:32] <eddyb> I think that's all
[13:06:38] <eddyb> and nop padding, ofc

[13:32:07] <ytain> WindowsBunny you are not supposed to use the api functions that have underscores in the front, they are usually undocumented and will not be supported in the future kernel versions
[13:32:53] <WindowsBunny> https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms741578%28v=vs.85%29.aspx
[13:33:00] <WindowsBunny> It's documented
[13:35:13] <ytain> Well it's only supported on win8.1 or higher which means it is experimental even though it is in documentation
[13:36:22] <WindowsBunny> Its actually supported since Vista
[13:36:34] <WindowsBunny> It's only that with 8.1 they added support for windows store apps to use it
[13:36:35] <ytain> in the past when I was developing win32 apps, I made the mistake of relying on underscored win api functions, they were deprecated in newer revisions of the api set, and sometimes they appear 
[13:37:07] <WindowsBunny> ytain: Well I'm just binding whatever functions are here

[13:46:33] <eddyb> big mistake
[13:46:50] <eddyb> Range not being Copy bugs me oh-so-much
[13:47:01] <WindowsBunny> eddyb: They need a middle Pod type
[13:47:06] <eddyb> no they don't
[13:47:20] <eddyb> tell me what use would !Copy + Pod have
[13:47:31] <eddyb> what type could possibly meaningfully be that
[13:48:34] <fkaa> heh, i haven't even used lifetimes yet
[13:49:04] <WindowsBunny> eddyb: um
[13:49:27] <WindowsBunny> eddyb: Nothing actually, because you can still move any type
[13:49:55] <WindowsBunny> !Copy just prevents you from using the original Q_Q
[13:50:19] <WindowsBunny> eddyb: So not implementing Copy for a type that could have an impl is a dick move
[13:51:48] <eddyb> WindowsBunny: I wouldn't mind an unsafe impl of Copy if a field could be Copy but isn't
[13:51:53] <eddyb> *const T would be a nice fit
[13:51:58] <eddyb> and *mut T
[13:52:23] <WindowsBunny> eddyb: I thought those types are Copy already though?
[13:53:30] <cmr> eddyb: you need to distinguish between "not Copy because lacking impl" and "not Copy because it has a destructor" for that, but you can do it manually with ptr::read etc.
[13:56:02] <eddyb> cmr: yeah, but, we can make that distinction
[13:56:19] <eddyb> (and trivially so)
[13:58:40] <eddyb> WindowsBunny: yeah, which is why we can't fix it now
[13:58:47] <eddyb> WindowsBunny: but we can still add Copy to all the iterators
[13:59:00] <eddyb> seriously, the `for` loop is kinda broken
[13:59:14] <eddyb> and we have to throw lints at it because we can't change semantics
[13:59:19] <WindowsBunny> eddyb: I care more about not having Clone on things like fixed size arrays :|
[13:59:58] <eddyb> make an Array trait and use to impl everything for fixed-size arrays
[14:00:11] <eddyb> as long as Array is not stable, it can be replaced later with generics over integers
[14:00:16] <eddyb> why haven't we done that? I don't know
[14:01:20] <bombless> because then it's harder to add interger generics patameters?
[14:02:20] <bombless> I remember one reason for rejecting a `fn foo()->impl Iterator<u8>` feature is that it make those type parameters thing silly
[14:02:23] * bombless runs
[14:02:35] <eddyb> wat
[14:03:10] <eddyb> no, adding integer generics is not harder
[14:03:15] * WindowsBunny nibbles on bombless
[14:03:27] <eddyb> if you have something to do impls forall N.[T; N]
[14:03:30] <eddyb> and it's not stable
[14:03:41] <eddyb> bombless: and what type parameter thing?
[14:03:52] <eddyb> anonymized return types are orthogonal to type params
[14:05:14] <bombless> like `fn foo<T: Display>(v: T) {}` can simply be `fn foo(v: impl Display)`
[14:06:45] <eddyb> that's not the same feature
[14:06:55] <eddyb> it's a different feature which is syntax sugar abusing the same syntax
[14:07:01] <eddyb> I do not condone abuse :P
[14:07:08] <eddyb> Tobba: bookmark https://mkremins.github.io/blog/unix-not-acceptable-unix/
[14:07:21] <eddyb> now let's burn the tree under us
[14:07:30] <eddyb> unix and winapi are thoroughly broken
[14:07:43] <Tobba> I've always really disliked the UNIX/POSIX designed
[14:07:44] <eddyb> in their design and implementation
[14:07:48] <Tobba> design*
[14:07:56] <bombless> hmm I think someone in Amazon also wrote similar thing for lisp
[14:08:09] <Tobba> "UNIX philosophy" has really come to just mean "everything is a file"
[14:08:34] <bombless> hmm not kiss?
[14:09:11] <Quxxy> "Everything is a file" => "Everything has to be able to parse arbitrary text"
[14:09:33] <Quxxy> I used to wish it was "everything is an object", and then PowerShell happened, and now I'm not so sure
[14:09:36] <bombless> I happened to read Advanced UNIX Programming today. not the classical apue, but easier for me to read
[14:09:55] <Tobba> bombless: could say the philosophy is KISS, but it doesn't really work out
[14:10:05] <Tiffany> no no tobba, it also means |
[14:10:17] <WindowsBunny> >ls is called ls for the very same reason that  its flags are cryptic single-character runes rather than meaningful  words or, god forbid, entire phrases:
[14:10:19] <Tobba> you get a bunch of simple utilities that can't actually interact with eachother
[14:10:41] <WindowsBunny> I'm so glad winapi at least has sensible naming for its types and functions
[14:10:43] <bombless> hmm one thing in Rust I like is that I don't have to think that "everything is an object" bulls**t
[14:11:14] <Tobba> I'm building my current osdev project around "everything is an object"
[14:11:22] <eddyb> the problem with Rust is that things are either types or values
[14:11:26] <eddyb> or traits
[14:11:32] <eddyb> what is a value?!
[14:11:32] <Tobba> I'm not so sure about it anymore, but it's better than "everything is a file"
[14:11:43] <Tobba> i.e hey want to encode everything really inefficiently?
[14:11:56] <Tobba> or rather, have to uselessly serialize everything
[14:12:10] <bombless> that's not that bad, look at the design of Git
[14:12:14] <WindowsBunny> >we still expect “serious developers” to drop down into a demonstrably inhumane environment to get anything meaningful done.
[14:12:17] <WindowsBunny> this exactly

[14:13:36] <Tobba> nathan7: heh, one of my favorite things is coming up with jokes about syntactically correct Lisp programs
[14:13:47] <Tobba> which happens to be about 1/10 of all 128 byte blocks urandom will give you

[14:14:20] <WindowsBunny> nathan7: DIR on windows only has 15 single character flags
[14:15:25] <Quxxy> Tobba: Now there's an interesting idea, as a measure of a language's syntax "coverage" :P
[14:15:48] <bombless> I thought it's a Perl joke
[14:16:25] <cmr> with perl you get semantically correct programs, not just syntactically!
[14:16:55] <Tobba> bombless: shit, I meant pearl

[14:49:24] <Tiffany> okay
[14:49:27] <Tiffany> I just did wc -l
[14:49:30] <Tiffany> 20k lines of code
[14:49:39] <Tobba> that's more reasonble but still kinda crazy
[14:49:52] <Tiffany> no, I think that's probably about right
[14:50:06] <Tobba> I must've spent too much time writing rust
[14:50:10] <Tiffany> they have a hand-written parser in C, separate bytecode compiler and interpreter, the complete runtime including the garbage collector
[14:50:24] <Tiffany> as well as the implementation of the standard library
[14:51:00] <Tiffany> it looks like there's 5400 lines of code to implement the standard library (all the source files ending with *lib.c)
[14:51:22] <WindowsBunny> Can someone give me a one-liner that gets the total lines of code in all *.rs files in a given directory + subdirectories?

[14:53:14] <fkaa> Tiffany: very neat pdf, thanks :)
[14:53:35] <fkaa> i've never really worked on a bytecode level of abstraction before
[14:53:49] <fkaa> this looks more readable than some other stuff i've seen though
[14:53:54] <eddyb2> Tobba: so wine returns via: lea esp, dword [ecx - 4]; ret 0xc
[14:53:55] <WindowsBunny> Tiffany: I have.... 40767 lines of rust code in winapi (including comments/whitespace)
[14:54:06] <Tobba> eddyb: seems about right
[14:54:37] <eddyb2> what I wrote should work :|
[14:54:54] <Tobba> lol
[14:54:57] <eddyb2> so what I'm guessing is that a different hook causes this fuck up
[14:55:01] <Tobba> I think my OS totals in at 14k lines or so atm
[14:55:16] <Tobba> and I've been poking at that slowly for over a year
[14:55:21] <Tobba> I should get off my ass and fix the kernel already
[14:55:50] <eddyb2> Arc<RwLock<Device>> :>
[14:56:05] <eddyb2> well, personally I'd disable interrupts and use RefCell inside
[14:56:13] <Tobba> eddyb: disabling interrupts is a very poor idea
[14:56:13] <eddyb2> or even Cell where possible
[14:56:17] <eddyb2> why?
[14:56:20] <Tobba> atm I'm removing nearly all interrupt disabling
[14:56:25] <Tobba> it's a very good way to deadlock yourself to hell
[14:56:46] <eddyb2> it seems faster than dealing with mutexes
[14:57:01] <eddyb2> I guess you could go the way of something like RCU
[14:57:03] <Tobba> I can't reliably perform a context switch in situations where interrupts are disabled
[14:57:08] <Tiffany> uh
[14:57:13] <Tobba> which means if the lock is held by an interrupted routine it deadlocks
[14:57:15] <Tiffany> you can't use mutexes inside interrupt handlers eddyb
[14:57:29] <eddyb2> Tiffany: only with try_lock
[14:57:45] <Tiffany> what good does that do you?
[14:57:56] <eddyb2> you don't deadlock :P
[14:58:00] <Tiffany> also, interrupt handlers can get interrupted
[14:58:03] <Tobba> and if you don't get the lock, then ??????
[14:58:04] <Tiffany> no I mean, what good is using try_lock if it fails
[14:58:12] <Tiffany> do you just bail? do you queue up the item to process later?
[14:58:20] <eddyb2> the latter seems like a possibility
[14:58:20] <Tobba> Tiffany: I can't *reliably* context switch
[14:58:32] <Tobba> having interrutps disabled allows access to a lot of mutable state
[14:58:35] <Tiffany> the only way to handle interrupts seems to only ever work with atomic lockless operations
[14:58:42] <Tiffany> which may simply be appending to a lockless queue
[14:58:59] <eddyb2> hmpf
[14:59:00] <Tobba> what I'm rewriting my code to do is to create a new task and append it to the work queue
[14:59:10] <Tobba> if it has a high enough priority it'll be run upon leaving the interrupt
[14:59:12] *** Joins: Simplebrain (Simplebrain@moz-6h4u6b.skybroadband.com)

[15:00:22] <eddyb2> not sure how good it is...
[15:01:00] <Tobba> Tiffany: sadly, I can't come up with a good way to implement a lock-free FIFO
[15:01:07] <Tobba> (that doesn't suck, anyways)
[15:01:26] <eddyb2> disable interrupts, push, enable interrupts :P
[15:01:34] <Tobba> actually, I could have a per-core queue and use the fact that only one interrupt handler can be pushing to the queue at a time
[15:01:38] <Tobba> eddyb: you don't get the problem, do you? :P
[15:01:47] <Tobba> disabling interrupts = death
[15:01:55] <eddyb2> you re-enable them
[15:01:59] <eddyb2> quickly after
[15:02:02] <Tobba> before or after you deadlock
[15:02:08] <eddyb2> *push*
[15:02:15] <eddyb2> how can you deadlock from a push
[15:02:22] <Tobba> locking
[15:02:29] <eddyb2> it's interrupt-locked
[15:02:41] <eddyb2> and you just disabled interrupts
[15:02:48] <Tobba> that's actually not safe
[15:02:57] <Tobba> since you may have interrupted something writing to it
[15:03:08] <eddyb2> no, that something would have disabled interrupts
[15:03:18] <eddyb2> while writing
[15:03:23] <Tobba> and if they're on another CPU
[15:03:31] <eddyb2> but you've disable-oh
[15:03:45] <Tobba> in this case I do get away with doing that though
[15:03:50] <eddyb2> well, if that can happen, then the whole interrupt-locking stuff is useless except for embedded systems
[15:03:53] <Tobba> since the queue should only ever be pushed to inside of an interrupt handler
[15:04:02] <nathan7> eddyb2: correct
[15:04:02] <Tobba> but in 99% of circumstances that can happen
[15:04:03] <eddyb2> like single-core ARM with interrupts
[15:04:08] <nathan7> or, like, AVRs
[15:04:17] <nathan7> and you don't really have NMIs there
[15:04:18] <eddyb2> meh
[15:04:31] <nathan7> but even then disabling interrupts is often not a good idea
[15:04:35] <eddyb2> x86 is a bitch
[15:04:48] <eddyb2> nathan7: you'd only disable them long enough to make an atomic operation

[15:05:20] <nathan7> eddyb2: yes
[15:06:04] <nathan7> eddyb2: your word-sized writes are virtually guaranteed to be atomic

[15:15:25] <fkaa> Tiffany: do you think a lua implementation in rust would have any benefit at all over the C one?

[15:17:58] <Tiffany> it is not

[15:18:37] <Tiffany> plus, there's myriad things you can do in bytecode that you can't in source
[15:18:41] <Tiffany> and they can't be sandboxed

[17:38:25] <Tobba> fmtq: it includes journalists now?
[17:38:26] <Tobba> that was fast
[17:38:42] <fmtq> Tobba: technically it doesn, tbut report on a "special intelligence operation" and you go to jail for 10 years
[17:38:44] <fmtq> as a journalist 
[17:38:45] <fmtq> or a leaker
[17:38:54] <fmtq> you can't know if it's an SIO in advance.
[17:39:07] <fmtq> and the director of ASIO can declare anything an SIO 
[17:39:18] <fmtq> accidentally kill a bunch of people in a botched operation? SIO
[17:40:18] <eddyb> would you have to get asylum to fix statelessness, or something?

[21:10:17] <WindowsBunny> I really hope it was originally a switch
[21:10:19] <niconii> all of those items are hard-coded?
[21:10:21] <fmtq> yeah almost definitely 
[21:10:23] <WindowsBunny> and the decompiler just turned it into an if

[21:30:39] <fmtq> software patents OR copyright but not both
[21:31:42] <eddyb> SaaS is fine and dandy... selling "products"... suuure
[21:31:53] <eddyb> but you're paying for data, not logic
[21:32:45] <eddyb> inb4 someone points the irony of code being data
[21:34:08] <cmr> you don't patent code or data though, you patent the abstract idea of a thing that just happens to be able to be encoded as data.
[21:35:08] <eddyb> I was thinking that selling games was fine because of the data they come with
[21:35:17] <eddyb> like, that's what you're paying for
[21:35:56] <eddyb> or, hmm
[21:36:12] <eddyb> cmr: not sure why I got confused there
[21:36:31] <cmr> there's a difference between patent, copyright, and selling something.
[21:36:32] <eddyb> you can pay for an implementation, but you shouldn't be able to restrict whether someone can write their own
[21:37:35] <eddyb> copyright is trickier, because you can trivially duplicate software, unlike hardware
[21:38:25] <cmr> no trickier than a record or book.
[21:38:50] <eddyb> yeah, but a book does take more work :P
[21:39:04] <eddyb> you can't share it with the whole world in minutes
[21:39:28] <eddyb> it would be easier if DRM worked
[21:39:50] <cmr> why should the technical feasibility or ease of something affect its legality?
[21:39:52] <eddyb> but it doesn't and that makes copyright a moral issue
[21:41:15] <cmr> it's a moral issue even if DRM did work, you just wouldn't have as many opportunities to subvert it.
[21:41:15] <eddyb> cmr: because stealing removes the original
[21:45:13] <eddyb> I am oversimplifying it all because it's ever harder to reason about when you consider all the details and

[23:29:10] <Astrum|Lap> not so much the language, it sucks, but how it ties into OSX
[23:29:35] <XMPPwocky> at least it's not COM!

[23:29:55] <eddyb> it's AOT
[23:30:05] <Astrum|Lap> XMPPwocky: I still don't know much about COM... 
[23:30:08] <eddyb> has been for ages
[23:30:08] <Tobba> eddyb: .NET is normally run with a JIT afaik
[23:30:13] <eddyb> huh
[23:30:16] <Tobba> but there is an AOT compiler
[23:30:17] <cmr> COM is just an ABI for laying out function pointers in structs.
[23:30:26] <eddyb> I thought .NET is usually AOT'd
[23:30:27] <cmr> (Plus some associated stuff on top)
[23:30:31] <cmr> eddyb: no not usually.
[23:30:40] <Tobba> eddyb: the DLL files .NET produces secretly have sections with .NET IL in them
[23:30:44] <eddyb> or that it's the default. or at least possible
[23:30:51] <Tiffany> tobba: I think it's a bit different actually
[23:30:55] <eddyb> Tobba: not that far ahead
[23:30:55] <Tobba> and the entry point is a call to the runtime
[23:30:55] <Tiffany> at least with the microsoft impl
[23:31:02] <Astrum|Lap> cmr: right, but I've tried looking for the actual technical details before and I get lost in a sea of windows terms that I don't get, heh
[23:31:11] <Tiffany> they have a JIT, but windows AOTs binaries automatically as well
[23:31:17] <Tiffany> at install time, but also at other times
[23:31:18] <Astrum|Lap> anyway, Swift compiles down
[23:31:25] <Tiffany> pretty sure
[23:31:30] <Tobba> Tiffany: SXS?
[23:31:46] <Astrum|Lap> it's like if ObjC and C++ had a baby

[23:31:57] <cmr> :P
[23:32:11] <Astrum|Lap> oh yeah, I forgot about ObjC++...
[23:32:44] <Tiffany> I don't think so tobba
[23:32:57] <Tiffany> I'm thinking of that .NET optimization process that occasionally eats your CPU

[23:34:54] <eddyb> or PE?
[23:35:07] <cmr> COM is more than a vtable format, that's just its corest part.
[23:35:23] <eddyb> Mach-O and ELF would make for punny titles though
[23:35:58] <Astrum|Lap> actually... has anyone made any headway on that yet?
[23:36:17] <Astrum|Lap> interop with objc is still going to be important for rust for the forseeable future
[23:36:18] <cmr> Rust ObjC?
[23:36:27] <cmr> https://github.com/SSheldon/rust-objc
[23:36:48] <cmr> servo's using that.
[23:37:05] <cmr> it's pretty yucky and raw.
[23:37:23] <Tiffany> I thought someone here was working on it
[23:37:34] <Astrum|Lap> yeah, I was envisioning suport in rustc
[23:37:34] <eddyb> Astrum|Lap was
[23:37:37] <eddyb> WAS
[23:37:38] <Astrum|Lap> basically what clang does
[23:37:38] <Tiffany> oh
[23:37:41] <Astrum|Lap> yeah, was
[23:37:50] <Astrum|Lap> but then I got a job writing javascript and I lost all hope in humanity
[23:37:57] <cmr> rip astrum
[23:38:00] <fkaa> oh that's just creepy
[23:38:37] <Astrum|Lap> actually... I'm curious if the D compiler branch with objc support has been merged yet
[23:41:47] <zwarich> it's not that hard to generate code that interfaces with the Obj-C runtime
[23:42:58] <Astrum|Lap> yeah, mostly straight forward

[23:52:20] <Astrum|Lap> guess it... wasn't merged?
[23:52:22] <Astrum|Lap> hmm...
