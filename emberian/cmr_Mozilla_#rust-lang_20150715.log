[14:49:50] <aturon> pnkfelix: hey, happen to be around? it's looking like the interaction between specialization and dropck is less manageable than we had hoped
[14:50:08] <pnkfelix> aturon: nmatsakis and i are discussed
[14:50:35] <pnkfelix> are *discussing 
[14:50:35] <pnkfelix> now
[14:51:20] <aturon> pnkfelix: ah ok! sadly i'm not in the office yet or i'd ask to join...
[14:52:33] <pnkfelix> aturon: we're probably going to wrap this meeting up soon anyway, but we may have another follow-on tomorrow at around the same time
[14:53:43] <aturon> pnkfelix: ok, thanks, i'll try to coordinate with nmatsakis as well
[14:53:47] <pnkfelix> aturon: we are bouncing around some ideas on ways to address it.  I'm going to look into a way to restrict dropck so that it stops relying on parametricity (namely, that makes it assume that all destructors read from all references they can see, unless the user asserts otherwise via an unsafe attribute)
[14:54:08] <aturon> pnkfelix: ok great -- that's exactly what i was going to suggest!
[14:54:13] <pnkfelix> aturon: (I'm not incredibly thrilled about going down this path, but it is probably the safest route for the short term.)
[14:54:24] <aturon> worth assessing the impact, at least
[14:54:33] <nmatsakis> I view it as similar to #[fundamental]
[14:54:44] <nmatsakis> we didn't have that precedent, or didn't apply it,
[14:54:53] <nmatsakis> but it seems like the model we SHOULD have done for rules we knew were new
[14:54:59] <nmatsakis> which is to make a hack to accept the cases we know we want to accept
[14:55:04] <nmatsakis> but reserve judgemnet ont he best mechanism for acceping them
[14:55:15] <aturon> yes. we got a bit greedy :)
[14:56:19] <nmatsakis> given the flaws we've found with parametricity
[14:56:21] <aturon> my main worry about this route is that, IIUC, you would need to use this unsafe attribute for many basic data structures (e.g. Vec) to allow them to be used in cycle-forming ways
[14:56:24] <nmatsakis> this can legitimately be called a bughfix
[14:56:32] <nmatsakis> yes, you would
[14:56:39] <nmatsakis> but the interpretation is not so complex
[14:56:50] <nmatsakis> it comes down to: you can only move or drop your type parameters (Transitively)
[14:56:55] <aturon> meaning that we introduce fairly widespread `unsafe` for a somewhat niche (?) use case
[14:57:09] <aturon> yeah
[14:57:15] <nmatsakis> (yes, but vec is already unsafe)
[14:57:21] <aturon> heh, fair enough
[14:57:36] <nmatsakis> anyway i'm not thrilled either but seems prudent, particularly if we can hold it unstable
[14:57:52] <nmatsakis> anyway bbs :) trying to finish discussion
[14:58:00] <aturon> yes, though going forward with specialization would of course cut off some avenues for replacing the attribute
[14:58:02] <aturon> yep ttyl
[15:25:45] <nmatsakis> aturon: yes, of course. I think specialization kind of kills the parametricity avenue (interestingly, that brings back the old concern over stable ABIs? I have to refresh my memory somewhat there)
[19:37:58] <nmatsakis> aturon thoughts on https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1177#issuecomment-121718188 ?
