[00:52:52] <Peach> Ok, language design - for function return type signatures,
[00:53:00] <Peach> how about  : instead of  ->     ?
[00:53:13] <Peach> function acos(float) : float
[00:53:24] <Peach> vs   function acos(float) -> float
[00:54:57] <niconii> -> is clearer
[00:55:33] <snow> Using : makes functions feel more like types, at least to me
[00:55:41] <snow> Err, variables not types
[00:58:35] <niconii> Peach: by the way, as a sidenote, i notice you use `int` and `float` a lot, and i would definitely *not* bring C-style number types back
[00:58:43] <niconii> (...though we've gone over this too)
[00:59:29] <Peach> int32 float32 float64 ?
[00:59:45] <niconii> i32 f32 f64
[01:00:02] <Peach> that's not clear though
[01:00:07] <Elaine> what's a float?
[01:00:14] <niconii> you have to learn them only once, but you use numbers *ALL* the time
[01:00:15] <Peach> I thought f meant fixed
[01:00:19] <Peach> Hmmm
[01:00:36] <niconii> that too, if you aren't a programmer, `float` doesn't make sense *anyway*
[01:00:52] <niconii> a float is one of those things in a parade
[01:01:02] <Elaine> or a delicious desert.
[01:01:35] <niconii> or something you can lie on in a pool
[01:02:05] <Peach> dec?
[01:02:07] <Peach> for decimal
[01:02:15] <Peach> decimal32 :P
[01:02:21] <Elaine> but they're all binary.
[01:02:23] <Elaine> not decimal.
[01:02:42] <Peach> how about number
[01:02:47] <Peach> num
[01:02:49] <niconii> also, already used in some languages as a fixed point type, since you need those for financial purposes
[01:03:00] <Elaine> or bcd, surely.
[01:03:16] <Elaine> number is too vague, it could mean anything, unless you want a unified numeric type.
[01:03:27] <Elaine> real doesn't work since that's a lie and is kinda weird outside of math.
[01:03:27] <Peach> yeah it's too vague
[01:03:55] <Peach> for int and float, it's cases where the programmer doesn't care about the size
[01:04:02] <Peach> Rust's style is low level centric
[01:04:16] <Elaine> the programmer should *always* care about the size, if they don't then you shouldn't use a fixed-size type at all.
[01:04:46] <Elaine> at which point Number is probably accurate and necessary.
[01:05:00] <Peach> What about high level logic centered things like people who are game logic programmers and don't touch low level stuff?
[01:05:10] <niconii> they still have to worry about overflows
[01:05:19] <niconii> which means they need to know how big their numbers are
[01:05:26] <Elaine> do them a favor and give them a bignum.
[01:05:34] <niconii> they also need to worry about precision

[03:09:26] <Astraea> I especially love when people GPL things like open source web apps you can host yourself
[03:10:43] <ChrisMorgan> Peach: the GPL exists because of people with strong ideological opinions about restricting freedom under the guise of granting freedom.
[03:11:21] <Peach> "under the guise of" sound nefarious XD
[03:12:12] <Astraea> tbh the GPL isn't bad, it just shouldn't be the default anyone goes to when they want to open source their code
[03:13:46] <Peach> GPL is pretty bad, cause there's a less incentive to get strong backing with something you can't use in most commercial projects

[03:44:51] <Peach> should I re-order the comparisons in order of most commonly true expressions first?
[03:44:58] <Peach> will this speed up performance?
[03:45:24] <aatch> Peach, do you have short-circuiting?
[03:45:29] <scott> I do that sometimes.
[03:45:47] <Astraea> it'll speed up performance, but it'll likely only make a difference in micro-benchmarks
[03:46:40] <Peach> Yes I have short circuting, this is me talking about C++'s if semantics
[03:47:01] <Peach> My language is gonna have short circuiting too because who wouldn't :P
[03:47:13] <aatch> Peach, ah, well it depends on how expensive the expressions are.
[03:47:26] <Peach> aatch: simple == comparisons
[03:47:41] <Peach> but the check will be called millions of times
[03:48:08] <Yurume> in that case the compiler would try to reorder them to get a better instruction ordering
[03:48:16] <aatch> Peach, then it's not likely to make that much of a difference.
[03:48:28] <Peach> billions of times?
[03:48:34] <Yurume> it cannot if, e.g. the code were `if f() || g() || h()` with a side effect
[03:49:17] <aatch> Peach, between compiler optimisation (because no side-effects) and branch-prediction (which if it's a hot-loop will warm up fast) I'd be surprised if it made much of a difference.
[03:49:51] <Peach> hmmmmmm
[03:50:08] <Peach> branch prediction is something I wish I could measure
[03:50:29] <aatch> Peach, you can. Well, you can measure branch misses (where prediction fails).
[03:50:29] <Peach> Is it possible to make a program that tells me "CPU how do you branch predict?"
[03:50:33] <Peach> Oh?
[03:51:14] <aatch> Peach, yeah, modern processors expose counters for all sorts of stuff. On linux the `perf` tool gives you access.
[03:52:54] <Astraea> yeah, I think profilers like vtune give you a crazy amount of information

[04:36:46] <aatch> Nowadays, I think compiling-to-C is fine as a temporary solution, but given that it's relatively easy to work with LLVM now, there's not much reason to not go in that direction.

[05:24:12] <eddyb> scott: I think so
[05:24:27] <eddyb> ChrisMorgan: it doesn't because the reduced-in-scope impl Trait is an existential
[05:24:29] <ChrisMorgan> scott: except that you can’t actually specify T manually.
[05:25:00] <scott> And then fn foo(f: Foo) is a generic function even though it isn't apparent that it is?
[05:25:01] <eddyb> as opposed to the introduction of polymorphism
[05:25:11] <eddyb> scott: *shudder*
[05:25:18] <ChrisMorgan> scott: I guess so.
[05:25:56] <eddyb> anyways, there's only two serious semantics for impl Trait
[05:26:12] <eddyb> one is anonymized return types, which is the feature I want
[05:26:16] <Peach> OOOH!
[05:26:20] <eddyb> the second is anonymous associated items
[05:26:22] <Peach> SUPER IMPORTANT QUESTION
[05:26:32] <ChrisMorgan> OK, so I guess I can see how impl Trait might be undesirable for fields; for function arguments is still sound, though, surely?
[05:26:35] <Peach> How does Rust handle newline/semicolons?
[05:26:40] <scott> eddyb: How would the latter work?
[05:26:48] <Mutabah> Peach: Statements are separated by semicolons
[05:26:48] <eddyb> trait Foo { fn foo() -> impl Trait; } is *not* an anonymized return type
[05:26:50] <aatch> ChrisMorgan, sound, yes.
[05:26:53] <Peach> Javascript gets a lot of criticism for not handling semicolons
[05:26:57] <Peach> right
[05:27:07] <Peach> so I was wondering how Rust improves this
[05:27:14] <aatch> Peach, we don't handle newlines. The tokenizer just skips over them.
[05:27:20] <scott> eddyb: Oh, right, each impl gets to choose its return value. Neat.
[05:27:26] <eddyb> it gets desugared to trait Foo { type FooReturn: Trait; fn foo() -> Self::FooReturn; }
[05:27:43] <eddyb> the impl doesn't have to use -> impl Trait
[05:27:55] <eddyb> it does something entirely different
[05:27:56] <scott> ChrisMorgan: Yeah, seems fine for function arguments as a simple shorthand.
[05:28:05] <eddyb> and it's almost unnecessary
[05:28:15] <eddyb> except it makes -> impl Trait on the impl side easier
[05:28:23] <huon> Peach: whitespace is meaningless in Rust except as a token separator
[05:28:30] <eddyb> scott: also see https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/105#issuecomment-125088911
[05:28:55] <eddyb> ChrisMorgan: maybe for the Fn* traits
[05:28:56] *** Joins: Quxxy (chatzilla@moz-efh10q.internode.on.net)
[05:29:22] <eddyb> ChrisMorgan: it still is introduction of polymorphism and requires doing something in a desugaring step we don't yet have
[05:30:01] <eddyb> ChrisMorgan: but hey, by the time any RFC is approved, that compiler infrastructure might be there already :P
[05:30:44] <eddyb> but the basic -> impl Trait could've been in 1.0, it's a really small part of the workload for the entirety of the original RFC
[05:31:18] <eddyb> and only depends on the associated type implementation, AFAICT
[05:32:53] <Peach> How do you...... PRINT AN INT in Rust?
[05:32:59] <Peach> It's not  println!(x)
[05:33:05] <Peach> which is :'(
[05:33:24] <aji> requiring the first arg of println! to be a string is a good thing imo
[05:33:25] <Peach> println!("{}", x); is error
[05:33:25] <eddyb> Peach: have you even looked at any docs?
[05:33:31] <eddyb> Peach: what's the error?
[05:33:39] <eddyb> *read* the error
[05:33:56] <ChrisMorgan> !#rust-offtopic-offtopic
[05:33:57] <rustbot> This is the channel for the Rust community back-channel. For *actual* Rust questions, ask in #rust or the appropriate topical channel.
[05:33:59] <eddyb> there shouldn't be any error if it's really an integer but YMMV
[05:35:18] <Yurume> ChrisMorgan: Banach-Tarski theorem of topics? :)
[05:35:26] <Yurume> paradox*
[05:36:36] <Peach> Ouch
[05:36:45] <Peach> Rust totally needs a semicolon
[05:36:51] <Peach> for return statements
[05:37:07] <eddyb> why are you using "return"?
[05:37:37] <Peach> http://is.gd/87PvXP 
[05:37:59] <eddyb> lemme see here...
[05:38:05] <Peach> natural use of return without semicolon causes errors
[05:38:12] <ChrisMorgan> Of course.
[05:38:24] <eddyb> Peach: well, yeah
[05:38:27] <scott> Statements are separated by semicolons. You need a semicolon.
[05:38:52] <Peach> I need a semicolon at the end of the return?
[05:39:19] <eddyb> you can only skip ; after the } of a if/else/while/loop/for/match expression which happens to be a statement
[05:39:32] <eddyb> Peach: again, the whitespace doesn't matter
[05:39:39] <ChrisMorgan> !#rust-offtopic-offtopic @ Peach
[05:39:39] <rustbot> Peach: This is the channel for the Rust community back-channel. For *actual* Rust questions, ask in #rust or the appropriate topical channel.
[05:39:44] <eddyb> you wrote return 2+7 a(x+y);
[05:40:00] <Peach> eddyb: why wouldn't I use return? If I want multiple exit points in a function and I want the function flat with minimal {}, then why wouldn't I use return?
[05:40:29] <eddyb> Peach: well, "return" is for early returns
[05:40:43] <Peach> ChrisMorgan: My questions are totally off topic, I ask about fundamental language design decisions in Rust
[05:40:47] <eddyb> like, conditional early returns
[05:41:09] <ChrisMorgan> Peach: they’re not off-topic.
[05:41:10] <eddyb> we should've just made it an error-by-default lint against `return expr;` at the end of a function
[05:41:29] <Peach> You should really see some of my previous questions ChrisMorgan 
[05:41:38] <eddyb> there is no bloody point to intentionally writing "return" other than to be obnoxious
[05:41:42] <ChrisMorgan> Peach: especially when you’re just trying to understand all of these things. That’s all on-topic.
[05:42:06] <Peach> No ChrisMorgan , I'm asking about why Rust is designed the way it is, not how to use it
[05:42:07] <ChrisMorgan> And definitely off-topic for #rust-offtopic. For that matter, this discussion on impl Trait is borderline #rust-offtopic-offtopic.
[05:42:30] <Yurume> Peach: that's a legitimate subject on #rust.
[05:42:47] <ChrisMorgan> Peach: … which is on topic, especially when your understanding is incomplete.
[05:42:51] <eddyb> or, if it gets into the nitty gritty
[05:42:56] <eddyb> there is #rust-internals
[05:42:58] <Astraea> eddyb: maybe I'm incredibly dogmatic and I love being explicit with my return! =P
[05:43:01] <eddyb> and there's more
[05:43:18] <eddyb> Astraea: it makes code ugly and harder to read
[05:43:36] <Yurume> Astraea: #[allow(whatever_the_lint_would_be_called)]
[05:43:59] <Peach> What parts of Rust syntax are the most controversial from a language design perspective?
[05:44:16] <Astraea> eddyb: all code is ugly and hard to read
[05:44:25] <aatch> Peach, most controversial? Probably `::<>`, because people are petty.
[05:44:38] <eddyb> I mean, once you get a grasp on value flow, the extra "return" tell you "this is not a regular production of a value, must look closer"
[05:44:49] <Astraea> there was some minor talk about changing <> to []
[05:45:04] <Astraea> because angle brackets hurt to read
[05:45:05] <eddyb> Astraea: and use () for indexing?
[05:45:06] * ChrisMorgan wishes generics had changed to []
[05:45:10] <ChrisMorgan> eddyb: yep
[05:45:15] <eddyb> Astraea: that's the stupidest reason ever
[05:45:23] * Yurume recalls when the syntax for lifetime was very in flux
[05:45:35] <scott> eddyb: I actually agree with it, since <> are not tall enough in most fonts compared to [](){}.
[05:45:38] <ChrisMorgan> eddyb: it’s surprising just how much harder angle brackets make types to read. It really is.
[05:45:41] <eddyb> compared to, say, "because angle brackets are not balanced separators otherwise"
[05:45:53] <ChrisMorgan> Both are good reasons.
[05:46:00] <ChrisMorgan> Sound reasons, in fact.
[05:46:04] <Yurume> ChrisMorgan: <| |>
[05:46:30] <eddyb> one of them is subjective and does not apply to, e.g. some C++ developers :P
[05:47:10] <Astraea> I think my editor would solve all these silly debates
[05:47:24] <Astraea> you know... if I wasn't so lazy and built it
[05:47:26] <eddyb> is your editor anything like my IDE and decompiler?
[05:47:30] <eddyb> yupp, sounds about right
[05:47:31] <Yurume> Astraea: what's that?
[05:47:38] <Yurume> (still reading backlog)
[05:47:39] <ChrisMorgan> Really, consistency with C++/Java is the *only* reason to use angle brackets; if it weren’t for that, I think people would laugh at the very notion of using angle brackets for the purpose.
[05:48:20] <Yurume> just ditch ASCII-only delimeters, yay Perl 6
[05:48:21] <Astraea> eddyb: I dunno what a decompiler has to do with it, but what was your plan for an IDE?
[05:48:32] <Astraea> Yurume: what's what?
[05:48:59] <eddyb> Astraea: it involved being able to convert between languages via "magic"
[05:49:02] <Yurume> Astraea: Perl 6 lexer allows lots of Unicode delimiters
[05:49:32] <Astraea> eddyb: no, but mostly because I'm not a mage, so I dunno how to do magic
[05:49:35] <Yurume> e.g. http://design.perl6.org/S02.html#Bracketing_Characters
[05:50:13] <ChrisMorgan> playbot: X«Y»
[05:50:13] -playbot- <anon>:9:10: 9:11 error: unknown start of token: \u{ab}
[05:50:14] -playbot- <anon>:9         X«Y»
[05:50:14] -playbot- output truncated; full output at: http://bit.ly/1JJz8YE
[05:50:18] <Astraea> Yurume: but you have to type that out...
[05:50:23] <ChrisMorgan> … whereas we just have all sorts of unicode that doesn’t even tokenize.
[05:50:43] <Yurume> Astraea: digraphs are your friend
[05:50:58] <eddyb> an intermediary semantics-oriented represenation that would be produced by language parsers and analyzers, and decomposed into new code with lots of patterns
[05:51:22] <Astraea> Yurume: seems silly honestly
[05:51:27] <Peach> Hey use    `  ` for generics :P
[05:51:32] <Peach> Vec`int`
[05:51:34] <Peach> so silly
[05:51:38] <eddyb> Peach: that's not even delimited...

[05:52:10] <Peach> Vec`@i32@`
[05:52:11] <eddyb> I think my first attempt at the idea involved either refactoring style in a C++ codebase and/or converting C linux drivers into C++ Pedigree ones
[05:52:20] <eddyb> and then it was Python vs JS
[05:52:23] <Astraea> the web figured out you needed to separate presentation from content
[05:52:25] <Peach> "C++ pedigree" :O
[05:52:30] <Yurume> still Perl 6 case is useful from time to time to show what *can* be done with the language design
[05:52:31] <Astraea> programming languages haven't
[05:52:42] <eddyb> Peach: no, C++ pedigree drivers
[05:52:48] *** Joins: pcwalton (pcwalton@moz-6kjabm.ca.comcast.net)
[05:52:50] <Quxxy> Obviously, the correct solution is to use parens, with a leading infix `!` to disambiguate the grammar
[05:52:50] <Yurume> I would *never* make a language like that, but well...
[05:52:52] <eddyb> as in, drivers for the Pedigree hobby OS, written in C++
[05:52:54] <ChrisMorgan> Astraea: it only thought it did, actually.
[05:53:01] * eddyb whacks Quxxy
[05:53:10] <Quxxy> why i aughta...
[05:53:17] <Peach> Can you make a single programming language that effectively replaces C and Python at the same time?
[05:53:20] <Astraea> ChrisMorgan: the web?
[05:53:28] <scott> Astraea: The web hasn't figured out anything in a satisfactory manner.
[05:53:31] <Peach> *C++ and Python
[05:53:32] <ChrisMorgan> Astraea: then it realised that it was more a matter of that sounding like a good idea, but in practice, pragmatism steps in and people are lazy and so on.
[05:53:54] <Astraea> I didn't say their solution is stellar, merely that it's an identified problem
[05:54:01] <Astraea> PLs have the same issue
[05:54:41] <aatch> Astraea, the difference is that the "content" of a program is incredibly abstract.
[05:54:44] <ChrisMorgan> (Pet peeve which is only slightly related: HTTP/2 gets a fancy binary header compression scheme and HTML is still transmitted as text and JSON still wastes every single byte you saved in the headers.)
[05:55:17] <Quxxy> ChrisMorgan: But binary formats are evil because you can't View Source them!
[05:55:32] <Quxxy> And anyway, DEFLATE makes every text format exactly as compact as any possible binary format
[05:55:34] <scott> Aren't most HTML and JSON documents gzipped these days? Not that I think we should be using gzipped HTML and JSON...
[05:55:36] <Astraea> aatch: I don't see the issue
[05:55:53] <Astraea> we already do the opposite of a parser and go from an abstract notion to a sequence of tokens
[05:55:53] <aatch> Astraea, well you still have to make the content somehow.
[05:56:20] <Astraea> and it's a specific representation
[05:56:47] <Astraea> and now we've gone the route of auto-formatting
[05:56:55] <Astraea> it's silly tbh
[05:56:57] *** Quits: pcwalton (pcwalton@moz-6kjabm.ca.comcast.net) (Client exited)
[05:57:09] <aatch> Astraea, ok, I think the problem here is that the programming language *is* the presentation.
[05:57:35] <ChrisMorgan> Quxxy: sure, and that’s a part that people often forget (though in practice it’s not so great), but there’s still enormous waste on most pages. And then we get to the matter of uncompressed and poorly compressed images and videos and so forth.
[05:57:37] <Astraea> no, the sequence of characters the parser digests is the presentation
[05:57:55] <aatch> Astraea, what's the difference?
[05:58:10] <Astraea> in my head I'm not thinking, "I need an f-u-n-c-t-i-o-n-space-blah"
[05:58:15] <Astraea> I'm thinking, "I need a function"
[05:58:23] <Astraea> then I have to encode it in a very specific manner
[05:58:49] <Astraea> does the { go on the same line or the next line?
[05:59:17] <Astraea> should angle brackets be used or square brackets
[05:59:23] <Astraea> space or tab
[05:59:34] <Astraea> all pointless things that shouldn't be an issue
[06:00:09] <aatch> Astraea, well no, but I'm not sure what you consider a source file to be in this content/presentation divide?
[06:00:21] * Quxxy wonders if ChrisMorgan realises he was being facetious
[06:00:32] <ChrisMorgan> Quxxy: of course.
[06:00:33] * Quxxy believes binary with canonical text representation is the way to go
[06:00:58] <ChrisMorgan> Quxxy: facetiousness can still warrant a serious response
[06:01:22] * Quxxy also wishes ST3 allowed for plugins to control how to read/write files so he could just open compressed text files
[06:01:23] <Astraea> aatch: a source file is just the content, it'd probably be something similar to the AST
[06:02:12] <ChrisMorgan> Quxxy: what, you genuinely can’t open a .gz file and have the editor decode it automatically, like Vim does?
[06:02:55] * ChrisMorgan is surprised; he thought ST3 was a Serious Text Editor
[06:03:19] <Quxxy> ChrisMorgan: No, I cannot
[06:03:20] <Yurume> Serious T3.
[06:03:21] <Quxxy> It shows up as hex
[06:03:21] <aji> i found out the other day that vim can edit files over the network
[06:03:25] <Yurume> (T3 stands for Text)

[06:03:39] <ChrisMorgan> Yurume: txt, surely?
[06:03:50] <Yurume> ChrisMorgan: o1 c5!
[06:03:52] <ChrisMorgan> aji: yep, vim is seriously good stuff.

[06:04:25] <ChrisMorgan> Yurume: I’m mildly concerned that I read that line before noticing it wasn’t spelled “of course!”
[06:04:26] <aatch> Astraea, ok, so in this model, the text of a language is just the presentation of the information encoded in the source? That works well in one direction, but not very well for *creating* the content.
[06:05:00] <aatch> Astraea, it'd be an impossible task to account for every last formatting quirk somebody might want to maintain between saving and opening a file.
[06:05:33] <Astraea> aatch: yeah, creating is a problem, I've thought about this for quite a while
[06:05:38] <Astraea> not sure what you mean by formatting quirk
[06:06:30] <aatch> Astraea, I might carefully align some code in a way that makes sense with my specific settings, but isn't syntactically significant. I would want that to still be there after saving and re-opening the file.
[06:07:23] <Astraea> I'm not sure what you mean by align
[06:07:58] <aatch> Astraea, like, I might indent some code an extra mark between two function calls but not actually have any syntax to indicate that.
[06:08:39] <aatch> Astraea, or line up tokens in a sequence of statements.
[06:10:04] <Astraea> indentation and alignment are a property of how the AST is presented
[06:10:56] <aatch> Astraea, yes, but the software doing the presentation needs to have a way of accounting for every little thing I might want to keep as part of the formatting.
[06:12:34] <aatch> Astraea, your web analogy breaks down because theres no difference between the creation and consumption of source code, at a human level. The same people write and read it. On the web, the content is created by different people to the consumers.
[06:13:15] <Astraea> it doesn't break down at all, I just haven't explained things well
[06:14:35] <Astraea> you wouldn't manually format your code
[06:14:49] <Astraea> it's just a style more or less
[06:15:06] * amstrad another day, another round of Rust
[06:15:24] <Astraea> like the separation of HTML and CSS
[06:15:47] <amstrad> so, i decided to attack the whole async io thing again
[06:15:56] <amstrad> not using mio, going it raw
[06:17:02] <aatch> Astraea, but I don't see how, without encoding it into the "html" side, you could account for everything that I might want to do to make my code easier to read.
[06:17:57] <aatch> Astraea, while also making as transparent as possible while actually working.
[06:19:12] <Astraea> aatch: it's hard to effectively communicate how I envision things
[06:19:27] <Astraea> besides, unless I stop being lazy and actually work on it, it doesn't matter, heh
[06:20:56] <aatch> Astraea, I guess I'm just saying that given that I tend not to use formatting tools because they have a habit of screwing up my nicely-formatted code, an IDE and/or language that forces use of a formatting tool sounds like hell.
[06:22:02] <Astraea> aatch: nothing says the presentation logic can't be incredibly advanced, automatically lining stuff up that you'd normally line up
[06:22:18] <Astraea> or whatever
[06:22:27] <eddyb> Astraea: including arbitrary markdown tables?
[06:22:45] <eddyb> (macros can parse markdown tables. and I think we had one in the compiler, at some point)
[06:23:02] <Astraea> and I can have different presentation logic, display things completely differently, and yet we can still diff the two code bases and they'd be the same, huzzah
[06:23:19] <Astraea> eddyb: are you talking about documentation? because I have an entirely different complaint about that
[06:23:28] <eddyb> Astraea: I'm talking about code
[06:23:40] <Astraea> markdown table in code?
[06:23:49] <eddyb> I said macro, pay attention :P
[06:23:54] <eddyb> yes, someone wrote a macro at some point
[06:24:02] <aatch> Astraea, but now I need to code two things: my actual program and the presentation logic of my editor.
[06:24:03] <Astraea> ick
[06:24:04] <eddyb> that took a markdown table of whatever list it was building
[06:24:13] <eddyb> ChrisMorgan: was it you?
[06:24:54] <Astraea> aatch: presumably they can be components you download and use in the editor, it'd suck if you couldn't share that
[06:25:22] <eddyb> Astraea: I wish you more luck than I had
[06:25:24] <eddyb> :P
[06:25:38] <Astraea> and I'd skip macros for now, eddyb 
[06:25:40] <eddyb> Astraea: actually, I may have made more progress than you...
[06:25:44] <Astraea> because that doesn't quite work
[06:26:03] <eddyb> including an ES6 C11 parser based on the yacc/lex grammar on some site
[06:26:08] <Astraea> eddyb: if you wrote any code then you made it further
[06:26:23] <eddyb> a half-assed code editor in simple HTML/JS
[06:26:35] <Astraea> well... I wouldn't have a lexer/parser
[06:26:37] <eddyb> with syntax highlighted auto-generated from kate's XML definitions
[06:26:41] <Astraea> that implies text! =P
[06:26:51] <eddyb> Astraea: yeah, no, that bit was actually for the decompiler
[06:26:55] <eddyb> but it's pretty self-contained
[06:26:58] <Astraea> ah

[06:27:13] <eddyb> and unlike some amateurish attempts, it actually understands C types
[06:27:27] <eddyb> which are an unorderered set of qualifiers
[06:27:39] <eddyb> int long unsigned long is a type
[06:28:06] <eddyb> T static x; is a global definition. I think, at least
[06:28:17] <eddyb> might only work when T is something like the above nonsense

[10:14:17] <Quxxy> WindowsBunny: I saw that one; didn't know that existed
[10:14:27] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: Can that be replicated in Rust?
[10:14:35] <WindowsBunny> Like, could we have a safe interface for that
[10:14:37] <Quxxy> Well, Kimundi wrote a crate that does something similar
[10:14:54] <Quxxy> It basically keeps an `(Owned, *const _)` pair
[10:15:05] <Quxxy> So you can have owned interior pointers
[10:15:25] <Quxxy> But I'm now wondering if it could be done by making an Rc derivative that's got enough information to resolve interior pointers back to their base address
[10:16:00] <Quxxy> That, or we get generic value parameters and just encode the offset into the type
[10:17:14] <kimundi> Heh, I find this extremely funny. I knew there was a std::shared_ptr article on HN, but I hadn't actually read it beforehand, and now I don't need to anymore. :D
[10:17:24] <Quxxy> :3
[10:17:48] * WindowsBunny stabs kimundi with https://www.justsoftwaresolutions.co.uk/cplusplus/shared-ptr-secret-constructor.html
[10:18:03] <WindowsBunny> I don't read HN, I got it on my C++ rss feed
[10:18:03] <kimundi> ouch my template
[10:18:18] <Quxxy> Right in the type substitution!
[10:19:41] <Quxxy> Oh good grief
[10:19:53] <Quxxy> "The diversity factors used in design of iDiversicons emoji are:
[10:20:03] <Quxxy> * Skin tone * Gender * Skin tone combinations
[10:20:19] <Quxxy> (Ok, consistent with Unicode as it stands, and I suppose that horse has bolted)
[10:20:22] <Quxxy> * Clothing
[10:20:24] <Quxxy> * Hair style
[10:20:26] <Quxxy> * Complexion
[10:20:29] <Quxxy> * Color of clothing
[10:20:31] <Quxxy> "
[10:21:20] <ChrisMorgan> Yep, our society is preposterous.
[10:21:45] <ChrisMorgan> And the makers of such emoji things and the Unicode Consortium and everyone else are just as ridiculous.
[10:21:48] <Quxxy> But what about diversity in accessory brands?  I mean, I don't want *my* emoji to be using Estee Lauder products!
[10:22:23] <Quxxy> And it's just plain *unacceptable* for someone's emoji to be wearing the colours of the wrong sports team
[10:23:04] <Quxxy> UTC should have just nope'd out of the proceedings and recommended that all codepoints that depict people be replaced with the "PILE OF POO"
[10:23:52] <ChrisMorgan> Oh for the simple days of inline images.
[10:24:17] <Quxxy> Wait, a better idea: have a pair of codepoints that start/stop an embedded SVG image
[10:24:27] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: Hey 💩
[10:24:35] <Quxxy> 💩 💩
[10:24:55] <Quxxy> That way, everyone can have their pet emoji without cluttering Unicode
[10:25:50] <niconii> i'm all for the skin tone/gender stuff personally
[10:26:12] <niconii> but as for the rest, i'm assuming the endgame is creating a dress-up game entirely in emoji...
[10:26:13] <ChrisMorgan> niconii: I’m all for keeping it utterly unrealistic like with ☺
[10:26:19] <Quxxy> I think it has no place in *Unicode*, but it's more or less a moot point now
[10:26:44] <WindowsBunny> Unicode should only be used for actual written languages
[10:26:52] <Quxxy> I mean, skin tone could have been handled at a higher layer
[10:27:02] <WindowsBunny> like, you know, those written languages out there that don't have proper unicode support yet
[10:27:04] <Quxxy> We already have font and colour styling; why not skin tone?
[10:28:30] <ChrisMorgan> Fun fact about SVG: you can easily put different versions of a thing in the one file, styling it through CSS using the hash; e.g. http://temp.chrismorgan.info/ferris.svg has six variants; no hash, #yay, #sad, #left, #right and #up.
[10:28:35] <Quxxy> But no... Apple had to make them all conspicuously white and then blame UTC for the issue and now we have skin tone and gender combining modifiers in a standard for written language
[10:29:03] <WindowsBunny> ChrisMorgan: that is adorable
[10:29:15] <WindowsBunny> Quxxy: We're blaming time for the issue?
[10:29:18] <Quxxy> ChrisMorgan: Thankyou for the happy :)
[10:29:23] <Quxxy> UTC = Unicode Technical Committee
[10:29:29] <fkaa> holy moley
[10:29:41] <fkaa> i only recently learned that .svg's could be animated too
[10:29:48] <WindowsBunny> .svg is awesome
[10:29:54] <WindowsBunny> you can even embed javascript :|
[10:29:55] <ChrisMorgan> fkaa: bear in mind that SMIL is poorly supported
[10:29:56] <Quxxy> Overdesigned, but awesome :D
[10:29:59] <bluss> ChrisMorgan: wow
[10:30:13] <ChrisMorgan> (Specifically, IE still doesn’t support SMIL.)
[10:30:45] <WindowsBunny> ChrisMorgan: #happy doesn't work in my IE :(
[10:31:01] <Quxxy> WindowsBunny: Well, it *is* IE
[10:31:05] <ChrisMorgan> WindowsBunny: there is no #happy, it’s #yay
[10:31:06] <Quxxy> There can be no #happy in IE
[10:31:12] <Quxxy> Only #suffering
[10:31:19] <WindowsBunny> ChrisMorgan: still broke :D
[10:31:30] <WindowsBunny> what
[10:31:36] <WindowsBunny> I put in #sad, it is smiling
[10:31:38] <ChrisMorgan> I will admit I haven’t tried this in IE, only in Firefox and Chrome. IE should definitely work, though.
[10:31:43] <WindowsBunny> what the fuck

[10:32:43] <WindowsBunny> ChrisMorgan: http://i.imgur.com/mL39W0P.png
[10:32:52] <ChrisMorgan> Firefox handles it all correctly. Chrome normally handles it correctly, but if you try using e.g. ferris.svg#yay as a background-image and have an instance of ferris.svg later in the document when you scroll down and back up it will have gone to the other version, and changing the hash on :hover is broken, and other minor issues which don’t surprise me (WebKit/Blink is a toy, always
[10:32:54] <ChrisMorgan> has been).
[10:32:57] <WindowsBunny> I'm not sure what is going it on
[10:33:24] <ChrisMorgan> WindowsBunny: it’s simply not updating the :target styling. A bug, though unsurprising.
[10:33:47] <Quxxy> Trapping Ferris in IE... you *monster*
[10:33:54] <ChrisMorgan> I imagine it does it in HTML, but not SVG.

[10:37:10] <WindowsBunny> fkaa: what
[10:37:17] <fkaa> silly css rules
[10:39:30] <Quxxy> WindowsBunny: No wonder there are still real languages that can't be properly encoded, if the UTC gets this many silly submissions
[10:39:51] <Quxxy> There's one where some guy started a company and invented a new language which requires a "mini-hyphen"
[10:40:30] <Quxxy> So he just writes this letter just saying "I want this" and comes across as though the UTC is some government department that just has to add everything that's requested
[10:40:39] <ChrisMorgan> And there’s still one letter (used, though not especially common) in Bengali that I believe *still* isn’t supported.

[10:53:13] <ChrisMorgan> Quxxy: yeah, I get the feeling Americans have a different meaning for the word “hamburger” to what we do. Here “hamburger” would, I think, normally include cheese and other such things.

[15:17:52] <Tobba> Tiffany: I'm somewhat sad the itanium failed
[15:18:02] <Tobba> it was a pretty awesome architecture
[15:18:16] <WindowsBunny> but Itanium had terrible x86 compatibility
[15:18:17] <Tiffany> pretty complicated
[15:18:24] <Tobba> WindowsBunny: we don't talk about that
[15:18:37] <WindowsBunny> Hence why AMD64 won :P
[15:18:39] <Tobba> I think the itanium 2 took the x86 compat out?
[15:18:47] <Tobba> I'm not quite sure why they put that in since it ran like absolute arse
[15:20:17] <Tobba> iirc the main reason it tanked was that the compilers just weren't there
[15:20:27] <Tiffany> that's what I heard
[15:20:41] <Tiffany> I also heard it was difficult to write a compiler for
[15:20:43] <Tobba> ignoring the problems of the first itanium
[15:20:53] <Tobba> yeah, it was incredibly difficult
[15:21:05] <Tobba> the compiler would have to predict stuff like if something was in L1, what kinda data it would see, etc
[15:21:39] <Tobba> it wasn't just difficult, the compiler didn't even have all the necessary information to generate perfect code
[15:21:48] <Tobba> (neither does any compiler of today, but it matters less on x96)
[15:21:50] <Tobba> x86*
[15:25:52] <WindowsBunny> buf: Box<UnsafeCell<[u8; 0x8000]>>,
[15:25:55] <WindowsBunny> This is totally safe, right?
[15:26:09] <eddyb> WindowsBunny: why not Cell around every element?
[15:26:20] <WindowsBunny> eddyb: Because I need to hand a *mut to the entire buffer
[15:26:21] <eddyb> wait, Cell is not Copy
[15:26:22] <eddyb> ffs
[15:26:25] <Tobba> actually, I guess profiler-guided optimizers would have most of the information
[15:26:30] <eddyb> WindowsBunny: ah, then it doesn't matter
[15:26:47] <eddyb> (Cell<u8> and u8 are really the same type, at least behind some indirection)
[15:26:50] <WindowsBunny> eddyb: Also I need the guarantee that the pointer will remain valid even if the box moves around
[15:27:00] <eddyb> what?
[15:27:08] <eddyb> you mean the Box value, right?
[15:27:25] <WindowsBunny> eddyb: If the Box itself moves around, the contents themselves will have the same address
[15:27:33] <eddyb> yeah
[15:27:45] <eddyb> not sure why the UnsafeCell though
[15:27:50] <WindowsBunny> Because I have an async function going that took a *mut to the contents
[15:28:21] <WindowsBunny> so while it is writing to it, the struct itself is stored in a HashMap, that may be modified and stuff, and I want to avoid UB as much as possible
[15:28:22] <eddyb> ahhh I see it now
[15:28:30] <eddyb> yeah this is sane

[15:37:35] <dfockler> I want to do that with timezones and leap seconds
[15:37:52] <Tobba> we can start with murdering DST
[15:38:01] <Tiffany> it's not their fault their language isn't dead simple to render on computers
[15:38:54] <dfockler> I think it's hard for software makers to get everything right without the help of a native speaker/writer
[15:39:06] <WindowsBunny> Tiffany: But now that Microsoft has it in Windows 10, now anyone who still doesn't have a proper universal shaping engine is hopelessly behind :D
[15:39:29] <Tiffany> yeah but harfbuzz 1.0 has it
[15:39:31] <Tiffany> just use harfbuzz
[15:39:36] <Elaine> everyone uses harfbuzz.
[15:39:42] <Tiffany> yeah
[15:39:45] <WindowsBunny> Why would you use HarfBuzz when you can just use DirectWrite from top to bottom
[15:39:47] <Tobba> Tiffany: it's not just hard to render on computers, it's batshit insane
[15:39:56] <Elaine> because some of us write software for more than windows
[15:39:56] <Tiffany> ssssh tobba
[15:40:31] <Tiffany> I was thinking about making my code use DirectWrite on windows, but it's not worth it
[15:40:36] <dfockler> harfbuzz has an MIT license
[15:40:57] <Tiffany> I don't think I could coerce it to do what I need it to
[15:41:50] <WindowsBunny> wait, did HarfBuz 1.0 just come out?
[15:42:03] <Tiffany> http://anzwix.com/a/HarfBuzz/100
[15:42:14] <WindowsBunny> I'm looking at their release page, and I see HarfBuz 1.0.0 on July 26 2015
[15:42:32] <dfockler> probably for windows tan
[15:42:54] <WindowsBunny> So HarfBuzz implemented the Universal Shaping Engine that Microsoft developed
[15:42:55] <WindowsBunny> cool
[15:43:24] <WindowsBunny> I just have a few complaints
[15:43:25] <WindowsBunny> like
[15:43:33] <WindowsBunny> WHY ISN'T THERE A DAMN 64-BIT BINARY RELEASE FOR WINDOWS
[15:44:06] <Elaine> build it yourself you communist.
[15:44:10] <niconii> the language samples in that blog post look pretty cool, i've never seen most of these languages before
[15:44:32] <Tiffany> does the win32.zip only contain 32bit binaries?
[15:44:37] <niconii> it's interesting to see how diverse human writing is
[15:44:43] <Tiffany> same niconii
[15:45:27] <Tobba> it's interesting in the same way as APL
[15:45:44] <Tiffany> please stop being so xenophobic tobba
[15:46:33] <Tiffany> this is the guy who maintains harfbuzz, btw http://behdad.org/
[15:46:46] <Tobba> I've had enough foreign languages for a lifetime :P
[15:48:30] <Tobba> Tiffany: I'm not sure if it actually counts as xenophobia to hate a language
[15:48:45] <niconii> i think buginese is pretty interesting in how just about every line is diagonal; vertical/horizontal lines are so much more common for some reason
[15:49:06] <Tobba> I only dislike ones that require asinine shaping anyways

[18:22:18] <Tobba> true, but in this case you probably have a very craptastic microcontroller
[18:22:30] <Tiffany> what kind of sensor is that?
[18:22:38] <Astraea> first things will be written 3 bytes at a time (two 12 bit samples)
[18:22:49] <Astraea> the 2kb will be used as a circular buffer

[18:24:09] <Astraea> well my #1 solution is a damn database where this becomes a non-issue
[18:24:33] <Astraea> but apparently that's not a good solution, so my next solution is to give me more flash memory on the device, but that increases the BOM
[18:25:40] <Astraea> even better, iOS devices will have to pull in the data all the time or the data will be literally lost forever
[18:26:13] <Tobba> most M3s I've worked with have more SRAM than that for crying out loud, and more builtin flash
[18:26:27] <Astraea> well
[18:26:36] <Astraea> the firmware has to be stored somewhere =P
[18:26:39] <Tobba> actually, how much do the samples differ? it might be possible to store 6-bit deltas or something?
[18:27:01] <Tobba> Astraea: well yeah that flash doesn't have too many write cycles either, but still
[18:27:58] <Astraea> right now ~40% of the 12 bit range, but to increase sensor accuracy (which will be lost forever when the iOS device doesn't pull in the data) the circuit is being modified to use the full range
[18:28:14] <Astraea> err... ~40% of the 12 bit range is being used

[18:44:01] <Astraea> wish I was better at physics to comment on the emdrive
[18:44:16] <Elaine> so do most physicists I think
[18:44:16] <Tiffany> I spent a really long time trying to figure out the math to see if their claims about how much propulsion they got from how much wattage they used are even physically possible
[18:44:42] <Tiffany> I think the result was that if this thing exists, it operates at something like 100000% energy efficiency
[18:44:52] <Tobba> the suspicious thing about the emdrive is the "hey we made a thing but we don't actually know how it works"
[18:45:14] <Elaine> what's suspicious about that?
[18:45:18] <Astraea> Tobba: well a lot of stuff has been discovered that way
[18:45:29] <Tiffany> the thing that was suspicious to me was that they said they could use a 1kW engine to produce 40kN
[18:46:11] <Tobba> Elaine: iirc there isn't much info on how they discovered it, so it sounds like they just slapped parts together randomly

[20:56:25] <zofrex> can you explain it? I mean, I get it, but my friend doesn't.
[20:57:37] <XMPPwocky> basically, you know how you build a linked list at runtime with enum Cons<T> { Nil, (T, Box<Cons<T>> } 
[20:57:54] <XMPPwocky> you can also build one with just types. instead of using an enum, you can use a /trait/ (not a trait object)
[20:58:18] <Astraea> stahp
[20:58:31] <XMPPwocky> so the length of the linked list is fixed. but you then don't need the Box, so it's laid out like an array

[23:07:32] <c74d> "<Peach> Ok, language design - for function return type signatures, how about  : instead of  ->     ?" -- I use `:` in my programming language concept, because I found `->` awfully annoying to type in Haskell and also I was already having `:` be one of the few "special" characters in my syntax... but I do have qualms about `->` being clearer (at least, for people who read it as an
[23:07:33] <c74d> arrow).
[23:07:59] <Peach> Oh cool c74d 
[23:08:31] <huon> Rust decided on -> instead of : because it felt more right
[23:08:46] <huon> (there was a mailing list thread about it at some point)
[23:09:08] <Astraea> : wouldn't make sense tbh
[23:09:36] <Havvy> Elainemo:  Clang is OSS. Go file an issue on it at the very least.
[23:09:40] <Peach> and what about even simpler - no symbol mark at all? :   function acos(float) float { code}   
[23:09:47] <Elainemo> It makes more sense when : isn't the type-assignment operator
[23:09:50] <Elainemo> Peach: tht's what Go does
[23:10:01] <Elainemo> Havvy: if only I cared...
[23:10:03] <Havvy> Especially since one of Clang's earlier selling points over gcc was the better error messages.
[23:10:03] <Astraea> I'd say that makes it hard to read
[23:10:13] <Elainemo> I think the message is fine already.
[23:10:35] <niconii> my vote's ->
[23:12:03] <Astraea> I vote for the hook right arrow glyph
[23:12:08] <Astraea> because it looks cool
[23:13:34] <Havvy> If we want to emphasize return types (and I think we do), then `->` works for me.
[23:14:30] <niconii> -> is a lot more intuitive than the alternatives imo
[23:15:19] <Elainemo> it matches both the math notation for function types and lots of functional languages.
[23:15:48] <Elainemo> Havvy: I don't file bugs for such trivia anyway, I file patches :P
[23:17:14] <Astraea> it vaguely matches mathematical function notation
[23:17:16] <Havvy> I generally file issues/bugs for these things, and somebody else sees it as low hanging fruit and implements it/says they'll implement it before I find time to try myself.
[23:17:24] <Peach> Would allowing C style   function int name() {} by bad for a new language? :X
[23:17:28] <Astraea> that's not the strongest reason to keep it

[23:17:48] <Tiffany> it's annoying to parse, peach
[23:17:55] <Havvy> Peach:  Yes. It's human inreadable.
[23:18:03] <niconii> Peach: is there a particular reason you're averse to using ->?
[23:18:26] <c74d> Peach: I'd say it would be bad for clarity, so especially for your language.
[23:19:22] <niconii> if your goal is making an intuitive language, i would definitely go with -> over the alternatives
[23:19:46] <Peach> I guess the only reason for the aversion is all the C++ code I'd have to rewrite with it :P
[23:20:36] <Peach> I guess for the sake of clarity though
[23:20:38] <Astraea> I say you go full math
[23:20:44] <Peach> I have to go with return type after
[23:20:45] <Astraea> f: N -> Z
[23:20:59] <Peach> Math notation would be a no, at least no for everything
[23:21:03] <Havvy> Peach:  Why rewrite all that C++ code when you can write a tool to rewrite it for you?
[23:21:22] <Peach> Parsing C++ is hard, maybe I can do it through clang 
[23:21:24] <Astraea> math notation is the one true notation though! =P
[23:21:25] <Peach> How did Rust do it?
[23:21:28] <c74d> fn acos: float -> float
[23:21:32] <Astraea> you can definitely do it with clang

[23:22:56] <Peach> Waddya mean why call them functions? The function concept is too ubiquitous in programming languages to change it
[23:23:06] <Astraea> so the type acos(float) is greater than the type float?
[23:23:38] <c74d> Peach: C "functions" are also called "routines", "subroutines", "procedures", and "subprograms" in other programming languages
[23:23:50] <Peach> function acos(float)→float
[23:24:28] <niconii> good luck typing that ;)

[23:24:58] <Astraea> about to go home, but I really did spend 4 hours working on a car in the parking lot
[23:25:01] <Peach> But yeah  -> is nice, it'll be the "Function return" symbol
[23:25:10] <Peach> nice for tokenization
[23:25:24] <Peach> Also how about something completely controversial:     function acos(float) returns float
[23:25:25] <Peach> :P
[23:25:51] <c74d> Peach: if you're already spelling out "function", I think it fits.
[23:26:43] <niconii> it'd work... having to write that all out for every function would make me cry, but it'd work......
[23:26:55] <mbrubeck> Or even "function acos from float to float"?
[23:27:14] <Tiffany> COBOL-style syntax is clearly the best
[23:27:37] <niconii> "function acos takes float named f and float named g and returns float"?
[23:27:57] <c74d> Personally, I expect a good chunk of programmers to know "fn = function" due to that being a popular abbreviation on keyboards.

[23:54:10] <zwarich> huon: '->' is right in function types, but for a function declaration ':' is probably more symmetric
[23:54:15] <niconii> scott: probably there, yeah
[23:54:30] <zwarich> did type ascription get accepted?
[23:55:06] <zwarich> indeed it did
[23:55:08] <niconii> zwarich: i'd rather have function types and function declarations match in using ->, imo
[23:55:55] <zwarich> niconii: the thinking is that you are defining a value f(a, b), so you should declare its type with f(a, b): T, similar to the ascription syntax
[23:56:42] <niconii> yeah, i understand what you're getting at
[23:56:57] <scott> That's basically how C syntax is supposed to work. I'm not sure it's a great idea.
[23:57:14] <zwarich> but Rust's syntax is pretty asymmetric anyways
[23:57:24] <niconii> anyway, it's certainly a valid option, but i still prefer ->
[23:57:27] <zwarich> scott: C syntax relies on a pun between declaration and use
