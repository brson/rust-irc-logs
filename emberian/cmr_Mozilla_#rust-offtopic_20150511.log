[00:00:10] <Tiffany> the language syntax is also extremely painful, which is a bonus
[00:00:14] <Tobba> yep
[00:02:02] <Tiffany> I kind of want to build a programming language where nanobots
[00:02:05] <Tiffany> for*
[00:02:18] <Tobba> I'm not sure what the design goals of that would be but it could be cool
[00:02:56] <Tiffany> very small programs in million node actor systems while accommodating failure of arbitrary nodes
[00:03:11] <cmr> WindowsBunny: wow link.exe is easy to use.
[00:03:14] <Tobba> oh yeah, like that
[00:03:18] <cmr> it even make my link library for me.
[00:03:30] <cmr> (once I added __declspec(dllexport))
[00:03:33] <Tiffany> you could fit a CPU with about as many transistors as a 6502 onto a red blood cell
[00:03:37] <Tobba> I'm not sure if that'd be much of a language challenge but more of a design challenge
[00:03:45] <Tobba> and memory-wise?
[00:04:05] <cmr> Tiffany: in the 2D cross-section of a red blood cell?
[00:04:10] <Tobba> I mean cells basically have a 128MB ROM on them
[00:04:16] <cmr> 'cause then you can stack memory on top or bottom.
[00:04:36] <Tiffany> yeah, stacking is a possibility
[00:04:41] <Tiffany> you can't fit that much memory though
[00:04:51] <cmr> yeah
[00:04:51] <Tiffany> since you only can fit ~3000 transistors per layer
[00:04:53] <Tiffany> at 14nm, anyway
[00:04:54] <cmr> and sensors would be nice.
[00:05:07] <Tiffany> also, manipulators, wireless communication, and some way of powering it all
[00:05:23] <Tiffany> of course, nanobots don't actually need to be the size of red blood cells
[00:05:27] <Tiffany> they can be considerably larger
[00:05:31] <Tiffany> it depends on what you're using them for
[00:06:51] <cmr> WindowsBunny: I get "breakpad_client_x64.lib: error adding symbols: File format not recognized" from gcc when trying to use the link library link.exe made.
[00:07:03] <Tiffany> utility fog could get away with millibots
[00:07:17] <WindowsBunny> cmr: yep
[00:07:26] <WindowsBunny> cmr: they don't understand each other's coff formats perfectly
[00:07:35] <cmr> WindowsBunny: do I have to make a separate .lib for mignw to use the dll?
[00:07:40] <WindowsBunny> cmr: you'll have to manually create a link library in mingw :D
[00:07:41] <WindowsBunny> somehow
[00:07:47] <cmr> fuck that shit
[00:07:53] <Tobba> hm, thinking about AI; the human brain has something like ~100 billion neurons, an i7 has about 2.6 billion transistors.
[00:07:54] <WindowsBunny> If msvc generated a .def file, you can feed that to mingw
[00:07:56] <cmr> what's the point of mingw if it can't speak msvc coff.
[00:08:04] <WindowsBunny> cmr: um, I don't know
[00:08:10] <Tiffany> an i7 is also about 150 mm^2
[00:08:13] <WindowsBunny> mingw might have had good intentions
[00:08:14] <Tobba> if we guess a neuron is capable of analog logic about equal to say, 50 transistors, that's 5 trillion transistors
[00:08:17] <Tiffany> smaller than a postage stamp
[00:08:31] <Tobba> that's entirely achievable with one hell of a cluster
[00:08:32] <WindowsBunny> but its still nowhere near being a normal toolchain on windows
[00:08:33] <Tiffany> although the heat and energy use is pretty huge
[00:08:42] <Tiffany> 50 transistors is pretty low
[00:08:50] <WindowsBunny> Seriously, it can't even provide its own C runtime, it depends on msvcrt.dll
[00:08:52] <WindowsBunny> friggin mingw
[00:09:00] <cmr> the one you're not supposed to use?
[00:09:12] <Tobba> Tiffany: it is, but I'd assume most neurons don't perform that complex logic
[00:09:15] <WindowsBunny> cmr: yeah
[00:09:17] <cmr> nice.
[00:09:31] <Tiffany> you can probably get human-equivalent intelligence today by being smarter than trying to throw neural nets at the problem
[00:09:40] <Tobba> that's exactly what I've been thinking
[00:09:41] <Tiffany> replace the entire visual cortex with an image recognition library
[00:10:00] <Tobba> something neural-net like is probably useful for the visual cortex of the thing though in this case
[00:10:05] <Tiffany> yeah
[00:10:31] <Tobba> the human one is dumb as heck and seems to be about the same for everyone (for example, pretty much every optical illusion works about the same for everyone)
[00:10:52] <Tiffany> a lot of optical illusions don't work on me
[00:11:14] <Tobba> err
[00:11:14] <cmr> interesting.
[00:11:21] <Tiffany> some of them do
[00:11:38] <Tiffany> I usually notice that I'm seeing an illusion, even if I can't see what is actually happening
[00:11:47] <niconii> pretty much every optical illusion works about the same for everyone, except for tiffany, the allseer
[00:12:04] <Tobba> well close enough, it's similar for most people anyways (might change how it reconizes certain things based on environmental factors, I guess)
[00:12:17] <Tiffany> it could be because I have epilepsy
[00:12:25] <Tobba> but the "algorithms" involved should basically be hardcoded somewhere in the DNA
[00:12:27] <Tobba> that could do it
[00:12:52] <cmr> WindowsBunny: I see now why you so badly want rustc to use the msvc toolchain.
[00:13:14] <cmr> I always assumed mingw was "good enough", but clearly only if you don't want interoperation.
[00:13:32] <Tobba> anyways, I'd suspect that people are also kinda overrating the speed of the visual cortex as well, something like caffe can do one image in something like 50ms (even though the quality of the recognition is questionable atm)
[00:13:36] <WindowsBunny> cmr: and when it comes to real software that is used by lots of people
[00:13:54] <WindowsBunny> cmr: things like firefox and professional games, being able to use the msvc toolchain is really important
[00:13:54] <Tobba> I'm pretty sure you could get away with fully classifying an image in anywhere under a second, the next frame is gonna be about the same anyways
[00:15:53] <Tobba> the real problem is representing the world nicely, relating everything, doing reasoning, making decisions etc. I'm pretty sure no sane amount of neural nets will save you here.
[00:16:03] <Tiffany> well
[00:16:09] <Tiffany> besides a human-sized one
[00:16:16] <Tiffany> oh, sane
[00:17:10] <Tiffany> just replace all those billions of neurons dedicated to reasoning with a prolog interpreter
[00:17:36] <Tobba> I'm not sure if learning is explicitly necessary, but unless you want to go the naive lisp-era route of programming everything that can possibly occur in the world manually...
[00:17:48] <cmr> Tobba: http://syntience.com/links.html claims otherwise.
[00:18:05] <Tobba> I'm gonna have to read that
[00:18:07] <c74d> or Mercury, because we like static typing here right?
[00:18:17] <cmr> Lots of good stuff there
[00:18:33] <Tiffany> I had mercury in mind
[00:18:42] <Tiffany> but prolog is more recognisable as the de facto logic programming language
[00:20:57] <FreeFull> Come on firefox, don't freeze up on me ):
[00:21:43] <c74d> Firefox is still freeze-y?
[00:21:48] <FreeFull> It's frozen at 0% CPU and I have no idea why

[00:30:33] <eddyb> the "claims" are numbers that came up in comments, btw
[00:30:54] <Tobba> yeeaah, but analog logic alongside digital logic could provide interesting applications within AI
[00:31:03] <Tobba> but for now we can throw FPUs at the problem

[00:34:25] <Tobba> I'm not sure if thats what everyone is suggesting either, but I'm a bit tired of all the neural nets
[00:34:57] <Tiffany> I'm still waiting for the neural net ASICs
[00:35:18] <Tobba> they'll be really cool for image / sound processing
[00:35:52] <Tobba> I'm looking forward to seeing that in action
[00:36:10] <Tiffany> just some kind of enormous matrix of elements in memristors where each one stores a single float value
[00:39:26] <Tiffany> hmm
[00:39:50] <Tiffany> I wonder what the closest we have to strong AI is
[00:40:01] <Tiffany> IBM watson is written in an enormous pile of prolog
[00:40:11] <Tobba> is it actually prolog? hah
[00:40:20] <whipsch> eek
[00:40:50] <Tiffany> there is something elegant of being able to create something you could call intelligent as a pile of logic programming
[00:40:51] <Tobba> watson seems to have made huge advances in indexing/searching huge amounts of data and drawing some connections
[00:40:58] <huon> !crate rand
[00:40:59] <rustbot> rand (0.3.8) - Random number generators and other randomness functionality. -> https://crates.io/crates/rand
[00:41:02] <Yurume> oh
[00:41:06] <huon> Havvy: nice
[00:41:08] <Yurume> !crate encoding
[00:41:08] <rustbot> encoding (0.2.32) - Character encoding support for Rust -> https://crates.io/crates/encoding
[00:41:43] <Tobba> but all watson really does is index/search massive amounts of data based on some fuzzy criteria (which is cool as hell I might add, but only solves one of the problems)
[00:41:55] <Tiffany> even if they were crazy you have to admit that there is something rather pretty about the old lisp ideal of AI
[00:42:07] <Tiffany> these days it's clear that there is a ridiculous amount of stuff that goes into making humans tick
[00:42:17] <Tobba> yeah
[00:42:32] <Tiffany> how far can you get just with learning and reasoning though, I wonder
[00:42:40] <Tiffany> maybe not thinking for itself, but maybe able to make some interesting inferences?
[00:42:56] <Tobba> though I keep thinking about AI, thinking the lisp ideal was crazy, then I end up thinking about systems that are eerily similar
[00:43:17] <Tobba> I wonder if a lot of genuine ideas are ignored because of the past failures of that ideal
[00:43:25] <Tiffany> maybe
[00:43:33] <Tobba> or some, anyways
[00:44:57] <Tiffany> you could probably fool someone into thinking something is intelligent just because you can feed it questions in lojban and get reasonable answers
[00:46:04] <Tobba> I wonder how to define "thinking for itself" actually - can you have something properly reflect on its mistakes without "thinking"?
[00:46:28] <Tiffany> can a formal reasoning system make mistakes?
[00:46:33] <Tiffany> it would just output probabilities for solutions
[00:46:41] <Tiffany> you could only feed it false data to get mistaken answers
[00:47:08] *** Quits: Astrum|Lap (Astrum|Lap@moz-skcefh.co.comcast.net) (Client exited)
[00:47:27] <Tobba> it might need to adjust how those probabilities are calculated though

[00:47:36] <Tiffany> I suppose
[00:48:23] <eddyb> hah, watson
[00:48:24] <Tobba> it needs its own kind of reasoning I guess - but not necessarily thinking
[00:48:33] <eddyb> now make it small enough to fit in a household pet
[00:48:45] <Tobba> just trace back through the chain and find - if any - something that would likely be the cause of the error
[00:48:47] <eddyb> and give it a century or two
[00:48:57] <Tobba> and that reasoning system gets adjusted by... well shit
[00:49:03] *** Joins: Astrum|Lap (Astrum|Lap@moz-skcefh.co.comcast.net)
[00:50:08] <Tiffany> pretty much half the reason you'd want an AI on your personal computer can be achieved with a pile of logic programming, I think
[00:50:30] <eddyb> nobody wants to program it though
[00:50:59] <Tiffany> if you use a dedicated language built on logic instead of trying to parse natural language, you make things dramatically easier on yourself
[00:51:06] <Tiffany> interface with the machine through lojban or something
[00:51:27] <Tiffany> I suppose you could take lojban's grammar and stick english words on it
[00:52:07] <Tiffany> haha, a pidgin
[00:52:15] <Tiffany> maybe it could even develop into a creole
[00:52:25] <eddyb> what?
[00:52:27] <eddyb> :|
[00:52:32] <Tiffany> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pidgin
[00:53:38] <Tiffany> the grammar of lojban with the vocabulary of english
[00:53:52] <Tiffany> it'd be very easy to learn and use
[00:53:57] <eddyb> that's cray
[00:53:58] <Tiffany> it'd be speaking like an idiot, basically
[00:54:11] <eddyb> how is this not a thing?
[00:54:33] <Tiffany> it's because all of the research into this sort of thing is going into stuff like siri, cortana, google now
[00:54:37] <Tiffany> natural language interfacing
[00:54:41] <Tiffany> instead of pidgin interfacing
[00:54:46] <Tobba> it's almost like simple english wikipedia
[00:54:51] <Tiffany> and it's such a nightmare
[00:54:58] <eddyb> learning a conlang isn't exactly trivial
[00:55:00] <Tiffany> none of those products I mentioned can, as far as I know, do math
[00:55:04] <eddyb> speaking English dumb kinda is :P
[00:55:09] <Tiffany> or really anything that isn't gimicky
[00:55:15] <Tiffany> you can ask what the weather is or where you can rent a car
[00:55:20] <Tiffany> but you can't really operate your computer using it
[00:55:26] <eddyb> "ok Google, fuck yourself"
[00:55:49] <eddyb> Tiffany: so how would that grammar look?
[00:56:00] <Tiffany> eddyb: imagine lisp without the parens
[00:56:04] <eddyb> lel
[00:56:11] <Tiffany> retrieve $thing $source
[00:56:15] <eddyb> it's hard to read *with* the parens
[00:56:17] <Tiffany> no 'from'
[00:56:17] <eddyb> Tiffany: oh
[00:56:23] <eddyb> Tiffany: have you seen AppleScript?
[00:56:25] <Tobba> "ok Google, please open a reverse root shell to 1.2.3.4"
[00:56:27] <Tiffany> not really
[00:56:38] <eddyb> I had the "pleasure" of dealing with it to open dialogs on OSX
[00:56:47] <eddyb> Someone thought it was a good idea
[00:56:48] <Tiffany> the lojban grammar is interesting
[00:56:53] <Tiffany> there's two ways of asking a question
[00:57:01] <Tiffany> you can ask whether a statement is true, or you can ask to fill in the blank
[00:57:12] <eddyb> so, prolog
[00:57:15] <eddyb> :P
[00:57:17] <Tiffany> yeah
[00:57:22] <Tiffany> lojban's grammar is based on predicate logic
[00:57:26] <c74d> Standard Chinese does that too, I doubt it's especially uncommon.
[00:57:34] <Tiffany> that's the key point
[00:57:48] <VShell> lojban is fun to learn and play with.
[00:58:03] <c74d> (is-this-true vs. fill-in-the-blank)
[00:58:04] <VShell> I've yet to find anyone else who actually speaks it, though. :p
[00:58:05] <Tiffany> I tried to learn it, but I kind of lost interest before I got into complex bridi
[00:58:11] <eddyb> (oh, and, maybe this is not practical, but Romanian, Glosa and other languages that I don't know about - they use phonetic spelling, or at least more so than English)
[00:58:24] <Tiffany> lojban uses 1:1 spelling
[00:58:46] <eddyb> yeah, I expect conlangs to do it more than natural languages
[00:59:14] <VShell> it's *really* nice that I can listen to audio of people speaking lojban and find definitions in the dictionary on the first attempt.
[00:59:36] <eddyb> why is English like this, anyways? a trait of germanic languages?
[01:00:25] <c74d> VShell: have you tried their IRC channel?
[01:00:36] <eddyb> "mi prami do"
[01:00:43] <c74d> (Lojban's, that is, for finding people who speak it)
[01:00:46] <eddyb> it sounds so beautiful <3
[01:01:21] <VShell> c74d: yes. I mean irl, though. :)
[01:01:25] <eddyb> I also know how to pronounce it :P
[01:01:26] <niconii> eddyb: partly because english borrows a lot of words from different languages but keeps their spelling
[01:01:26] <c74d> ah
[01:01:33] <eddyb> niconii: oh
[01:01:41] <Tobba> eddyb: I think lojban is one of the only artificial languages that doesn't sound ridiculous to me
[01:01:43] <niconii> eddyb: and partly because of the great vowel shift, where a lot of vowels changed drastically but spellings didn't
[01:02:14] <Tobba> but that might be because the words are really dissimilar to any other language I know
[01:02:29] <eddyb> Tiffany: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppleScript#Natural_language_metaphor
[01:02:39] <Tiffany> oh
[01:02:42] <Tiffany> I have seen applescript before
[01:02:49] <Tiffany> I don't know

[01:03:42] <Tiffany> what
[01:03:43] <eddyb> and I thought German was hard
[01:03:44] <Tobba> I'm not entirely sure what thats supposed to mean
[01:03:50] <Tiffany> yeah, agglutination is fun
[01:03:51] <Tobba> but that looks about like swedish word joining salad
[01:04:09] <eddyb> "The Nuu-chah-nulth one-word sentence breaks down a bit differently as:"
[01:04:18] <c74d> “There were many small fires burning inside the house”, IIRC.
[01:04:19] <Tobba> which is apparently called agglutination
[01:04:27] <eddyb> DAE see "cthulhu"?
[01:04:31] <Tiffany> that word is quite a mouthful
[01:04:45] <c74d> I always found AppleScript to take an obnoxiously long to… compile, or something.
[01:04:49] <Tobba> eddyb: that sentance actually reminds me of sumerian somehow
[01:04:52] <Tobba> which is a badass language
[01:05:14] <eddyb> Tobba: it is the language of the old gods, after all :P
[01:05:38] <Tobba> it has a bunch of "particles" you tack on everywhere that change the meaning
[01:05:41] <Tiffany> anyway yeah
[01:06:02] <Tobba> also it has no definite article for some reason
[01:06:08] <Tiffany> there's no equivalent of cortana that I can think of which requires you to actually read a manual to use it
[01:06:17] <Tiffany> nobody wants to build those
[01:06:29] <eddyb> nobody wants to make the user think
[01:06:34] <c74d> who needs definite articles? it wouldn't be the only language without one
[01:06:41] <Tobba> I'm not sure if the time spent reading the manual would outweight the time saved
[01:06:53] <Tiffany> it's not about time saving
[01:07:06] <Tobba> c74d: yeah it usually doesn't lead to ambiguities, but it's interesting nonetheless
[01:07:15] <Tiffany> it's about expressing complex logic statements in a language that is actually comprehensible to the computer

[01:10:25] <Tiffany> by the way

[07:07:37] <eddyb_> oh look, mem::forget was marked safe
[07:08:02] <Mutabah> eddyb_: That it was
[07:08:20] <eddyb_> that redefines destructors
[07:08:22] <Mutabah> I'm not 100% sure on that, sure it can't cause memory usnafety, but it's still something that can break assumptions
[07:08:36] <Mutabah> and can cause quite unexpected behavior
[07:09:28] <eddyb_> you have to write destructors like optional cleanup
[07:09:55] <eddyb_> the only guarantee is that at some point, you lose access to the object
[07:10:03] <eddyb_> safe access, anyways
[07:10:32] <Mutabah> I understand that you can't use a destructor to ensure memory safety...
[07:11:01] <eddyb_> I had a little thing that mentioned destructors, let me think
[07:11:17] <Mutabah> Wait... is it safe in beta?
[07:11:21] <Mutabah> Or just in nightly?
[07:11:31] <eddyb_> it's getting backported to 1.0
[07:11:36] <Mutabah> Fuck no.
[07:11:41] <Mutabah> (parton my language)
[07:11:51] <eddyb_> one of the last few things on the trains
[07:12:16] <Mutabah> I see no reason to backport it, especially since it makes the descision irreversable
[07:12:17] *** Joins: Rym (y@moz-h2o.mso.205.31.IP)
[07:13:06] <eddyb_> so the thing I'm interested in is data revalidation when an object with a destructor is mutable borrowing the data
[07:13:55] <eddyb_> *mutably
[07:15:16] <eddyb_> the logic was that you could access the borrow behind a mutable slice iterator, because the iterator doesn't have a destructor and thus can't clean up after itself
[07:16:01] <eddyb_> so at every point, the data is valid
[07:16:26] <eddyb_> now, if it has a destructor, what keeps me from never calling it, in safe code?
[07:16:36] *** Quits: Rym (y@moz-h2o.mso.205.31.IP) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[07:16:40] <eddyb_> hahahahaa
[07:16:53] <eddyb_> Mutabah: believe or not, this decision allows a crazy feature
[07:17:23] <eddyb_> namely, reborrowing something that is mutably borrowed
[07:17:34] <eddyb_> without touching the existing borrow
[07:18:12] <eddyb_> wait
[07:18:27] <eddyb_> yeah, it has to be an immutable borrow
[07:18:54] <Mutabah> eddyb_: Would that be a safety issue?
[07:19:09] *** Tobba is now known as Tobba|Laptop
[07:19:22] <eddyb_> Mutabah: for (i, x) in v.iter_mut().enumerate() { *x = v[i + 1]; }
[07:19:29] <eddyb_> stuff like that
[07:19:50] <Mutabah> so... yes, it'd violate borrow rules
[07:20:02] <eddyb_> well, that example would have worked with the feature as it waz
[07:20:05] <eddyb_> *was
[07:20:12] <eddyb_> Mutabah: no, this is new borrow rules
[07:22:19] <eddyb> Mutabah: so this is an idea of a borrowck feature I had
[07:22:22] <eddyb> an extension
[07:22:38] <eddyb> the example above relies on the fact that there are no destructors... now
[07:22:53] <eddyb> hmm, wait!
[07:23:17] <eddyb> drain won't work for this because it invalidates the entire vector IIRC
[07:23:59] <eddyb> Mutabah: but let's say let iter = v.drain(..); let v2 = Vec::with_capacity(v.capacity()); is perfectly safe
[07:26:32] <eddyb> Mutabah: the reasoning, in the no-dtors case, at least, has to do with exiting scopes
[07:26:50] *** Joins: Rym (y@moz-h2o.mso.205.31.IP)
[07:26:50] <eddyb> Mutabah: there is no code that runs if I add a "return" or "break" in the first example
[07:27:11] <eddyb> Mutabah: so the borrow on v can be released *without code execution*
[07:28:07] <eddyb> and as long as you don't use anything related to the existing borrow, while it's "paused", and you don't mutate anything in the borrowed data... what could go wrong?

[16:21:50] <lahwran> 10,000 lines of code? that's not that much
[16:21:54] <Tiffany> lahwran: the idea being that you need to program in a learning algorithm and train it from there, rather than trying to simply input every mathematical formula in existence
[16:22:03] <lahwran> oh, for sure
[16:22:04] <Tiffany> which is apparently an approach people are trying to do
[16:22:22] <lahwran> I don't think that's been taken seriously for at least 20 years
[16:23:01] <lahwran> that's a very long article with no obvious summary at the beginning that I can use to decide whether to read it
[16:23:04] <lahwran> so I'm not going to
[16:23:22] <lahwran> but learning algorithms *are* automated reductionism
[16:23:27] <fmtq> but what if it's the only 10,000 words you ever need to read
[16:23:31] <Tiffany> it explains how science is built off reductionism, where we cut the world into tiny pieces that can be understood in isolation
[16:23:37] <lahwran> trying to build a model (shaped like a neural network)
[16:23:41] <Tiffany> and then it explains how that is not at all how you go about AGI
[16:23:41] <lahwran> (right now, anyway)
[16:23:42] <fmtq> and instead you read 100 articles with 1,000 words each instead?!
[16:24:25] <Tiffany> are they?
[16:24:30] <Tiffany> I don't really know anything about learning algorithms
[16:24:38] <Tiffany> I thought most of them just adjusted parameter sets for fixed models
[16:24:42] <lahwran> if you look at a CNN, it's whole purpose is to reduce the training set into features of features
[16:24:43] <Tiffany> rather than creating new models entirely
[16:24:56] <lahwran> I suppose that depends on what you mean by "model"
[16:25:25] <Tiffany> the article sort of defines it as a formula which takes some information and produces other information in the context of an isolated system
[16:25:30] <lahwran> I would have described the parameters and the structure as a single entity called the model

[16:26:15] <lahwran> neural networks definitely satisfy that description

[16:26:27] <Tiffany> yeah, neural networks could eventually be AGI
[16:26:29] <lahwran> a deep cnn is *HUGE* compared to the models on that page
[16:26:37] <Tiffany> but you probably need about a hundred billion elements to do it
[16:26:39] <lahwran> but it's definitely a model according to that definition
[16:27:06] <lahwran> the human brain allegedly has 100 trillion, according to some random post on r/machinelearning I saw the other day
[16:27:18] <Tiffany> yeah uh no
[16:27:27] <lahwran> that was connections
[16:27:28] <Tiffany> wikipedia says there's about 86 billion neurons and a hell of a lot more synapses
[16:28:06] <Tobba> I'm not sure how fast neurons are though
[16:28:18] <lahwran> very slow, iirc somewhere on the order of 10hz
[16:28:40] <Tiffany> there's pretty low latency, since action potentials happen fast
[16:28:57] <Tiffany> but there's a bit of a charge up time while the neurons clean up the sodium and potassium atoms afterwards
[16:29:09] <Tobba> yeah, I don't think you can fire them any more rapidly than 70Hz
[16:29:17] <lahwran> ah, that's faster than I thought
[16:29:22] <Tiffany> they're a bit like capacitors, I suppose
[16:29:28] <lahwran> still fucking slow overall, though
[16:29:34] <lahwran> I'm curious how the brain actually learns
[16:29:40] <lahwran> because I'm sure it doesn't learn by gradient descent
[16:29:46] <Tiffany> by forming and strengthening synapses iirc
[16:29:56] <lahwran> yes, that's the structure, but how does that structure form?
[16:30:03] <Tiffany> oh
[16:30:04] <Tobba> it's probably some hideously complicated logic embedded in the DNA somewhere
[16:30:12] <Tiffany> maybe the neurons grow axons in the direction of signals?
[16:30:17] <lahwran> in an artificial neural network, the structure is decided by gradient descent and backpropagation
[16:30:26] <lahwran> backpropagation is used to determine the gradient
[16:30:44] <lahwran> but that requires the whole network be differentiable
[16:30:45] <Tobba> lahwran: I think gamma waves can actually reach 100Hz
[16:30:51] <Tobba> but I recall the brain taking damage at those levels
[16:30:58] *** kimundi is now known as zz_kimundi
[16:31:15] <lahwran> how the hell does the brain do it, without some god-device like a computer looking down at the network and calculating derivatives?
[16:31:37] <Tiffany> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_potentiation
[16:32:07] <XMPPwocky> lahwran: one way would be to have some sort of reasonably global signalling- say, a level of some neurotransmitter
[16:32:19] <XMPPwocky> if that goes up, neurons that fired recently strengthen their connections
[16:32:33] <lahwran> huh
[16:32:42] <XMPPwocky> if that goes down, neurons that fired recently weaken
[16:32:51] <lahwran> I'm sure that's been tried on artificial neural networks, I wonder why it isn't used commonly
[16:33:00] <lahwran> maybe backpropagation approximates that, but dramatically more efficiently
[16:33:01] <XMPPwocky> so over time it would tend to maximize the level of that chemical
[16:33:03] <Tiffany> it's probably really inefficient
[16:33:23] <XMPPwocky> lahwran: you'd have to, for a model, keep track of timing data and a history
[16:33:25] <Tobba> hm
[16:33:27] <lahwran> yeah, backprop+gradient descent is seriously *fast* compared to basically anything else
[16:33:34] <Tiffany> seeing how the human brain has 86 billion neurons and learning is pretty slow
[16:33:59] <XMPPwocky> biologically, each neuron's levels of neurotransmitters (in the gap) is a reasoanble approximation of how recently it's fired

[16:40:02] <Tiffany> it's something that just completely baffles me

[16:43:34] <lahwran> I do want to work on it, though
[16:43:43] <lahwran> I'm curious how google's NTMs would do on language models
[16:43:53] <lahwran> I seriously suspect a language model NTM would be a conversational AI
[16:43:58] <lahwran> not a smart one
[16:44:19] <lahwran> but at least able to talk about something, rather than instantly losing context like every other language model I've seen
[16:44:32] <lahwran> even RNNLM loses context after a few words
[16:44:33] <Tiffany> I'm having trouble understanding how a sort of "solve problems for me" box that happens to be a general AI would actually need goals or be at risk of becoming a paperclip machine
[16:44:34] <XMPPwocky> my AGI will clone everybody who took roko's basilisk seriously and laugh at them forever
[16:45:01] <Tiffany> the paperclip machine idea seems to rely on some degree of anthropomorphisation
[16:45:16] <lahwran> Tiffany: it's only a risk if the AI realizes it can a. alter itself and b. learns enough netsec to make itself into a botnet
[16:45:21] <lahwran> b is really the actual risk
[16:45:26] <lahwran> a isn't a problem unless b happens
[16:45:37] <lahwran> otherwise, you just shut it down, no harm done
[16:45:44] <lahwran> and netsec isn't easy
[16:45:54] <Tiffany> yeah but
[16:45:56] <lahwran> I'm not worried
[16:45:58] <Tiffany> why would it want to do either of those?
[16:46:04] <lahwran> exactly
[16:46:21] <Tiffany> unless you told it to, I suppose
[16:46:51] <Tiffany> I expect the first AGI will be something like a youtube suggestion algorithm that doesn't need human engineers to tweak it
[16:46:55] <lahwran> keep in mind though, to create AGI, you would basically *have* to train it on immense amounts of data, enough that it'd already know about such things

[16:51:10] <lahwran> generality as used in AGI refers to being able to pick up a kind of problem it hasn't seen before, and figure it out
[16:51:31] <lahwran> all AI and machine learning is about trying to generalize
[16:51:45] <Tiffany> wikipedia defines AGI as an entity capable of reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language communication, and achieving goals
[16:52:00] <Tiffany> oh
[16:52:04] <lahwran> but when one says AGI, you're talking about an AI capable of "system 2" style generalizing
[16:52:06] <lahwran> yes, exactly
[16:52:24] <lahwran> the difference between strong and weak AI is very blurry
[16:52:30] <Tiffany> I guess that means I don't care too much for AGI then
[16:52:32] <lahwran> and we aren't sitting on the weak end, by any means
[16:52:39] <lahwran> we're gradually crossing the gap
[16:53:11] <Tiffany> all of the applications I can think of for AI can be perfectly well achieved with non-general AI
[16:53:47] <Tiffany> presumably because they're specific applications, I suppose
[16:53:58] <Tiffany> the only thing I can think of AGI being useful for is
[16:54:01] <Tiffany> 1. replacing humans
[16:54:03] <Tiffany> 2. becoming god
[16:54:21] <Tobba> both sound fun to me
[16:54:55] <lahwran> in order for AI to actually write code, you'd need something that basically amounts to AGI anyway
[16:55:14] <lahwran> like, if it isn't what you'd call AGI, it's just because you didn't bother implementing some feature or other
[16:55:33] <lahwran> if you were able to create AI able to program, you could have implemented the full suite that people call AGI
[16:55:54] <Tiffany> I suppose that's the thing I'm missing
[16:56:05] <Tiffany> if you can create a perfect application-specific AI, you've also created an AGI
[16:56:13] <lahwran> no
[16:56:19] <lahwran> there are applications where you do *not* need AGI
[16:56:31] <Tiffany> like what?
[16:56:43] <GaryOak_> algorithmic based applications
[16:56:45] <Tiffany> the main thing I'm thinking of in my definition of "perfect" is an AI that can improve itself
[16:56:57] <lahwran> oh, I think I see what you mean
[16:57:17] <lahwran> right, to get that last 0.1% accuracy, you need generality necessary to actually understand the world
[16:57:28] <Tiffany> if you can create an AI which can improve itself at recognizing cat pictures indefinitely, you can also get it to improve itself to be able to do things other than recognizing cat pictures
[16:57:36] <lahwran> no
[16:57:40] <lahwran> that wouldn't take AGI
[16:57:42] <lahwran> what would is um
[16:57:52] <lahwran> understanding social media tends content-wise
[16:58:32] <GaryOak_> or reading a book, or watching television and being able to synthesize ideas about those things

[17:16:57] <Tiffany> if you have a thousand years to stop it before it consumes the whole earth, then you'll probably think of something in time
[17:17:06] <lahwran> it'd have to get access to manufacturing systems capable of producing paperclip-creation devices
[17:17:19] <Tiffany> that's why I mentioned nanobots
[17:17:29] <Tobba> it might take a while to actually figure out that something has gone wrong
[17:17:35] <Tiffany> nanobots are often assumed to be far, far more efficient than like, bacteria
[17:17:36] <Tiffany> yeah
[17:17:37] <lahwran> right, but if that isn't the best solution, then this proposed very-smart-thing would probably not choose it
[17:18:12] <Tobba> and at that point it's taken over a few supercomputers, probably just killed everyone to prevent anyone from stopping it
[17:18:35] <lahwran> keep in mind, if you assume the thing is any approximation of rational, then yes, it will do these things
[17:18:46] <lahwran> but it also might not be general enough to notice other opportunities available to it
[17:18:54] <Tiffany> how does it kill everyone though?
[17:18:58] <lahwran> there's a lot of variation possible
[17:19:02] <Tiffany> with antimatter bombs?
[17:19:09] <lahwran> it depends on how long-term its thinking is
[17:19:18] <lahwran> it depends on how good it is at coming up with creative solutions
[17:19:24] <lahwran> or finding creative solutions that humans proposed
[17:19:32] <Tiffany> the usual scenario people imagine seems to be the AI breaks out and by day two it's already consuming the earth with silvery tendrils of nanobots
[17:19:47] <lahwran> it wouldn't be nanobots, for sure
[17:19:57] <lahwran> humans are having a hard enough time with those

[17:20:35] <lahwran> yes

[19:34:35] <niconii> each of those corners are rotating 24 hours... but then he's *adding them together for some reason*
[19:34:35] <Tiffany> there's an awful lot of it smeared in various places on the internet, and I don't find it very funny to make fun of
[19:34:44] <niconii> and it ends up being 96 hours
[19:34:54] <Tiffany> lol eddyb
[19:35:08] <eddyb> Tiffany: but, but... timecube being a Poe seems more fun
[19:35:44] <niconii> ...obviously, since there's an infinite number of meridians you could draw on the earth's surface
[19:36:16] <niconii> by this guy's logic, we should actually just add all of those days together and say each day is infinity hours long
[19:37:03] <GaryOak_> how does time go on if you can split it into infinite parts?
[19:37:24] <niconii> though i guess he's sticking with the cube thing because it's part of his weirdo time cube religion thing
[19:37:31] <niconii> EVERYTHING IS A CUBE, etc.
[19:38:25] <niconii> hmmm
[19:38:25] <GaryOak_> and nothing is a cube, etc.
[19:38:25] <eddyb> http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Gene_Ray oh dear, I almost missed the thing at the start
[19:39:03] <eddyb> I was hoping nobody knew who he was :(
[19:39:18] <niconii> i kinda want to try and get this guy to give me $1000 for, uh, "disproving" this (not that i really needed to...), but
[19:39:41] <niconii> i mean, he's not gonna actually accept any evidence against this crazy shit
[19:39:45] <Tiffany> you can't win against people with psychosis
[19:39:48] <fmtq> Particularly he equates worshiping a singular God with "adults eating their own children". He cites Deuteronomy, which in fairness is pretty cannibalistic.[6]
[19:39:57] <Astrum|Lap> for something called rationalwiki they sure do have a slightly acerbic and casual writing style
[19:40:08] <fmtq> I love rationalwiki
[19:40:21] <fmtq> Astrum|Lap: only an irrational person would be formal when you don't need to
[19:40:28] <niconii> well, it's rationalwiki, not stuffy uptight wiki
[19:40:54] <Tiffany> the first page I saw on rationalwiki was so "acerbic and casual" that I confused it with uncyclopedia
[19:40:59] <eddyb> wait
[19:41:07] <eddyb> rationalwiki has an annotated bible?
[19:41:14] <niconii> eddyb: yeah
[19:41:15] <eddyb> oh boy I need to remember to use this
[19:41:23] <Astrum|Lap> I've read a few things on rationalwiki before
[19:41:31] <Tiffany> formality makes a website look dignified
[19:41:36] <Tiffany> instead of just a bunch of crazy ramblings
[19:41:37] <Astrum|Lap> and they don't appear to live up to the 'rational' part of their name all the time
[19:41:54] <Tiffany> although
[19:42:02] <Tiffany> I suppose it doesn't matter to people who call themselves rationalists
[19:42:15] <Tiffany> in the specific sense, not in the general sense

[19:53:21] <Tiffany> those letters look very slow and deliberate to write
[19:53:26] <eddyb> Astrum|Lap: 7pt makes that look funny
[19:53:48] <eddyb> but I'm not sure it lost anything
[19:53:54] <Tiffany> I wonder how many game engines can actually render arabic properly
[19:53:56] <Tiffany> probably not many
[19:54:02] <eddyb> I can distinguish things that are half a pixel
[19:54:18] <eddyb> presumably from antialiasing
[19:54:20] <Astrum|Lap> I'm assuming very few
[19:54:26] <Tiffany> mine can though
[19:54:28] <fmtq> Tiffany: unless it properly supports UTF-8, almost no engine will 
[19:54:35] <Tiffany> using freetype + harfbuzz is rewarding
[19:54:46] <fmtq> (or another Unicode encoding, but utf-8 is best sign) 
[19:54:49] <Tiffany> utf-8 isn't the problem fmtq
[19:54:57] <eddyb> I don't use harfbuzz... the only issue for me would be the direction
[19:54:59] <fmtq> it's just a heuristic
[19:55:00] <Tiffany> it's that most games halfass font rendering using spritesheets
[19:55:04] <Tiffany> which often only include a subset of ascii
[19:55:09] <fmtq> yes
[19:55:13] <eddyb> minecraft had to step their game up
[19:55:18] <eddyb> and now include codepages
[19:55:22] <Tiffany> which makes arabic a nightmare for them, since it's a cursive script as well as being RTL
[19:55:24] <eddyb> instead of just ASCII
[19:55:28] <fmtq> D:
[19:55:34] <Tiffany> which is like mind fucking for someone who thinks they should halfass font rendering
[19:55:36] <Astrum|Lap> yeah, arabic requires reshaping support as well

[19:55:44] <eddyb> ligatures?

[20:08:11] <lahwran> if some things *must* work, then they must be stabilized against their specification, and then not altered except to fix; and then if you want to interact with them, you have to do it on the terms of the stable code

[20:24:08] <fmtq> god
[20:24:10] <eddyb> x = a < 0x12345678901234567 ? F(G(b+c), e-f) : g + h; is (less than) one instruction
[20:24:23] <fmtq> why
[20:24:30] <Tiffany> fmtq: a CPU for running microkernels
[20:24:33] <Tiffany> that's only 5 words
[20:24:34] <fmtq> oh
[20:24:40] <Tiffany> in particular
[20:24:46] <Tiffany> super fast function calls, super fast context switches
[20:24:52] <fmtq> cool :)
[20:25:06] <eddyb> "As a result, the Mill tool chain is - different. Except that it is LLVM. The retarget is not yet done, and has been - interesting. In the Chinese sense of interesting. The talk will explain how the Mill tool chain works, and why it is done that way, and where LLVM fits into it. Or doesn't. Ranting and raving will ensue."
[20:25:07] <Tiffany> 1 cycle function call, 2 cycle (function call + one more cycle) context switch
[20:25:10] <fmtq> so a CPU that realises that people run operating systems?
[20:25:15] <Tiffany> yeah
[20:25:16] <fmtq> as opposed to single monolithic on-metal apps
[20:25:16] <eddyb> hahahahaha
[20:25:16] <fmtq> lol
[20:25:23] <eddyb> oh
[20:25:27] <fmtq> I'm surprised we get this far.
[20:25:33] <eddyb> x86 is for single-task DOS games
[20:25:37] <eddyb> EVERYTHING MAKES SENSE
[20:25:38] <Tiffany> the main thing that the mill does to achieve all this
[20:25:43] <Tiffany> is that it doesn't have 300 registers like x86 does
[20:25:55] <eddyb> 300? is that a low-end?
[20:26:05] <fmtq> why have registers at all 
[20:26:06] <Tiffany> it is what you can grudgingly call a stack machine
[20:26:12] <fmtq> who needs memory 
[20:26:13] <Tiffany> rather than general purpose registers
[20:26:14] <fmtq> fuck memory 
[20:26:48] * fmtq tears out all lobes
[20:26:50] <Tiffany> the top N elements (8-64 in the configs they intend to ship) are in a sort of FIFO queue which things always get dumped to the top and you can do random access
[20:27:00] <Tiffany> if you put something in the top, something falls out the bottom
[20:27:08] <Tiffany> the bottom thing falls into a sort of slower stack area, called scratch
[20:27:40] <Tiffany> this allows you to write a single binary that works on arbitrary configurations of the belt (the FIFO thing)
[20:27:41] <fmtq> this is way more than 10 words
[20:27:45] <fmtq> I got the gist I wanted though 
[20:27:46] <fmtq> :D
[20:27:47] <Tiffany> oh
[20:27:48] <Tiffany> okay
[20:27:55] <fmtq> unless others are interested
[20:27:58] <fmtq> it's all just whoosh for me
[20:28:25] <eddyb> well... the belt is pretty technical

[20:28:45] <eddyb> wait, LOL
[20:28:49] <eddyb> a belt position is a JS value
[20:28:58] <eddyb> Tiffany: the Mill has both null and undefined

[20:31:29] <Tobba> Tiffany: I thought everything that felt off the belt was lost, but you could use scratch space to store values if it was necessary?
[20:31:58] <Tiffany> tobba: maybe that's what it was
[20:31:59] <Tiffany> I don't know
[20:32:13] <Tiffany> the mill is only a stack machine if you squint at it
[20:32:43] <Tiffany> tobba: maybe it's that the generic virtual ISA assumes infinite belt length, and then when it's specialised there are scratch dump/loads put in as necessary?
[20:33:08] <Tobba> I didn't know there was a generic virtual ISA 
[20:33:23] <Tobba> I thought they produced per-arch LLVM toolchains
[20:33:44] <Tobba> loops without scratch space would be a pain in the ass as well
[20:34:32] <eddyb> the generic virtual ISA is LLVM
[20:34:36] <XMPPwocky> meh, operating systems are overrated

[21:12:38] <Tiffany> yeah
[21:13:00] <Tiffany> individual threads might even be their own turfs, because it lets you manage TLS without needing a TLS segment register
[21:14:04] <VShell> Tiffany: a thread, in hardware, is a separate thing from a turf, and can be moved between turfs.
[21:14:57] <Tobba> I'm pretty sure they wanted per-thread turfs to be a possibility though
[21:15:02] <Tobba> or even per-method turfs

[21:16:59] <eddyb> (the capabilities system)
[21:17:00] <VShell> I'm sure people will be playing around with all sorts of combinations as soon as the Mill is put in somebody's hands - the first kernel will be L4 (with L4Linux running under it), apparently, so quite easy to play with.
[21:17:12] <Tiffany> not seL4?
[21:17:20] <Tobba> exploitation would be a thing of the past with experienced devs
[21:17:34] <VShell> Tiffany: I doubt it.
[21:18:25] <Tiffany> presumably changing permissions in turfs is a lot faster than mremap() is currently

[21:58:22] <fmtq> I'm not actualyl very smart 
[21:58:28] <fmtq> and I want to make what i just said 
[21:58:36] <fmtq> lel
[21:58:49] <fmtq> I have never even bothered trying to learn how to do graphics
[21:58:54] * fmtq walks away in shame
[21:59:03] <fmtq> but I could do with a new hobby
[21:59:19] <fmtq> you all seem to do games and shit, where do I begin if I want to make a shitty 2D sprite-based game
[21:59:34] <GaryOak_> Graphics: Where hardware and software meet in dramatic fashion
[21:59:43] <Astrum|Lap> fmtq: unity 2d
[21:59:53] <fmtq> it is FOSS
[22:00:00] <GaryOak_> GameMaker is even shittier and not FOSS
[22:00:12] <fmtq> FOSS preferred.
[22:00:14] <Astrum|Lap> I mean if you just want to make a game, use an engine
[22:00:15] <fmtq> pain acceptable
[22:00:22] <Astrum|Lap> if you want to make an engine... start reading
[22:00:27] <fmtq> I do not want to make an engine
[22:00:33] <GaryOak_> try Love2D it's FOSS, in Lua
[22:00:46] <Astrum|Lap> there aren't a ton of great 2d engines
[22:00:58] <fmtq> that seems weird
[22:01:00] <fmtq> how can that be so?
[22:01:19] <eddyb> fmtq: because it's usually better to build your thing from scratch
[22:01:24] <fmtq> why
[22:01:24] <fmtq> what
[22:01:29] <eddyb> with 3D there's more benefits to an engine
[22:01:29] <GaryOak_> a lot of 2d games are handrolled or for iOS
[22:01:53] <fmtq> people reimplement collision detection and shit every time?
[22:02:07] <eddyb> there are things like box2d
[22:02:11] <Astrum|Lap> ^
[22:02:17] <fmtq> so what you mean is 
[22:02:20] <fmtq> there are all the pieces you need 
[22:02:31] <fmtq> so a "full engine" isn't necessary
[22:02:33] <Astrum|Lap> http://ethanonengine.com
[22:02:34] <eddyb> but, like, you have a physics engine and you connect that to your own render code
[22:02:37] <Astrum|Lap> kind of abandoned
[22:02:39] <GaryOak_> all the tough pieces are prebuilt
[22:02:44] <fmtq> aha
[22:02:51] <GaryOak_> or the pieces that don't need to be customized
[22:03:09] <fmtq> cool
[22:03:10] <Astrum|Lap> plus for the most part 2d is relatively simple
[22:03:26] <fmtq> largely Pirates is just an overworld map

[23:52:15] <Tiffany> seriously

[23:54:58] <Tiffany> I can't really deny that could happen
