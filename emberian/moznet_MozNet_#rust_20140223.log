[06:24:21] <derek_c> I have this problem where I have a struct that contains a list.  Now I'm doing something like `for k in s.lst.iter() { ... }`, so now s is borrowed as immutable.  Now inside the for loop, I'm trying to call a function on s that takes `mut &self`.  However, the function doesn't modify the list at all (it modifies other fields), so this is safe in practice.  However the compiler won't allowed me to do it.  How would you get around this?
[06:25:05] <derek_c> right now I'm just cloning the whole list and use the clone instead, but wondering if there is a better way
[06:25:43] <derek_c> I should perhaps clarify that `s` is the struct and `s.lst` is the list

[06:27:26] <bvssvni> the function must return a new borrowed mut pointer

[06:28:06] <huon> std::mem::replace(&mut s.lst, list)

[06:31:04] <derek_c> in terms of memory though, what's the difference? both copy the content, right?
[06:31:06] <huon> e.g. cloning a ~[] requires a new allocation and cloning every element, replace just needs to copy the pointer
[06:31:20] <derek_c> huon: ok
[06:31:28] <derek_c> so it's just copying the pointer

[09:51:41] <yati> Hi. Say I have a struct A {name: ~str, number: ~str}, what is the recommended type for the inner strs? &str or ~str? If I use, ~str, my callers have to .clone() the string while constructing if they want to use it later, right?
[09:52:13] <kimundi> afaik consistency, less space wasted, and nice 4-char indentation
[09:53:53] <kimundi> yati: The answer depends on whether you want the struct to own the data independently from other parts of the code, or just want it to contain references to existing strings

[10:06:39] <yati> Yeah. the ownership - and also lifetimes I guess. But I can't express how liberating this is compared to C++ where I had to track everything myself - here the compiler is helpful :)
[10:06:49] <yati> strcat, please elaborate :)
[10:06:59] <strcat> ~[T] isn't ~T

[10:07:43] <strcat> Ms2ger: yes

[10:08:21] <kimundi> right, sorry. I wanted to simplify first before explaining that to yati :P

[10:08:38] <yati> Is that the difference?
[10:08:38] <strcat> yati: yes

[14:28:03] <doomlord_> conversions in rust are usually methods named ".to_whatever" rather than C++ style constructors
[14:28:07] <bollu> what am I doing wrong?
[14:28:07] <doomlord_> use ~str
[14:28:15] <bollu> why? I don't want it to be on the heap
[14:28:24] <doomlord_> ~str is more like C++ std::string
[14:28:31] <doomlord_> if its on the stack its got to be fixed size
[14:28:35] <doomlord_> you want a variable size string
[14:28:41] <bollu> hmm okay. makes sense
[14:29:11] <bollu> then when can you use str()
[14:29:17] <bollu> rather than ~str() ?
[14:29:34] <doomlord_> there's no "str()"
[14:29:40] <bollu> and doomlord_, how'd you know I  generally use C++?
[14:29:53] <bollu> so there are types in rust which can only be allocated on the heap? bummer
[14:29:54] <doomlord_> i'm guessing from what you're trying to do :)
[14:29:57] <bollu> xD
[14:30:22] <bollu> so, that means that any non-POD data type will have to be ~ ?
[14:30:25] *** jorendorff_away is now known as jorendorff
[14:30:30] <doomlord_> rust has ~ built into the language which does the job of C++11 unique_ptr , and ~str does the job of std::string
[14:30:43] <doomlord_> ~[T] is like vector<T>
[14:30:45] <bollu> that seems like wrong semantics
[14:30:51] <bollu> so str = char?
[14:30:59] <bollu> ~[str] = vector<char> ?
[14:31:05] <doomlord_> other POD data can go on the stack just fine, because its fixed size
[14:31:22] <bollu> I thought ~T -> std::shared_ptr<T> in C++

[14:31:57] <doomlord_> Rc<T> i think , i haven't used it
[14:32:11] <bollu> so how do I transfer ownership? the borrow semantics thing?

[14:32:21] *** Joins: leslie (Adium@802083C6.67DB9176.67D29DD9.IP)
[14:32:27] <doomlord_> transfer ownership is passing the thing around, when you pass it as an arguemnt
[14:32:35] <bollu> as in ~str?
[14:32:38] <doomlord_> borrow semantics is where the original instance keeps ownership
[14:32:38] <bollu> then what's &str ?
[14:32:48] <doomlord_> yeah &str would be borrowed from a ~str 'original#
[14:32:59] <bollu> so how would I transfer ownership?
[14:33:03] <bollu> or is that impossible?
[14:33:07] <doomlord_> you can in some situations
[14:33:17] <doomlord_> but if you just make somethinig on the stack, the stack frame 'owns' it
[14:33:24] <doomlord_> if you make it as an argument, then you can transfer it
[14:33:28] <bollu> can I take ~str as a parameter?
[14:33:37] <benh> let x: ~str = ~"foo" /* now x owns the string */; let y = x /* now y owns the str */;
[14:33:39] <bollu> and what does taking ~str as a parameter mean?
[14:34:01] <doomlord_> taking ~str as a parameter, it will try to "move" , (take ownership) i think
[14:34:03] <benh> fn f(s: ~str) { ... } ; let x: ~str = ~"foo"; f(x) // now f owns the string
[14:34:11] <bollu> so implicit type inferencing tends to transfer ownership?
[14:34:18] <doomlord_> it can yes
[14:34:19] <bollu> why wasn't borrowing taken as the default?
[14:34:24] <benh> type inference has nothing to do with it
[14:34:25] <doomlord_> you must say you borrow with &
[14:34:37] <doomlord_> if you want to borrow , you clearly say so with &
[14:34:50] <benh> borrowing ~strs is a bit trickier, syntactically...
[14:34:52] <bollu> no, when you say let y = x, why does it consider it as let y : ~str = x and not let y : &str = x ?
[14:35:16] <bollu> was it an arbitrary decision?

[15:15:34] <bollu> ../src/main.rs:22:28: 22:29 note: `t` moved here because it has type `WorldState::Tagger`, which is non-copyable (perhaps you meant to use clone()?)

[15:18:02] <kimundi> getName() as you've written will consume self (the Tagger struct) and move the name out of it
[15:18:16] <Ms2ger> Taking `self` rather than `&self` eats the self value
[15:18:33] <Ms2ger> So it's dead after the first iteration

[15:26:07] <sp3d> bollu: the hash is used to distinguish between different libs which might call themselves "rsfml" (see <https://github.com/mozilla/rust/wiki/Doc-crate-hashes>), and rustc only looks for rust libs which follow its filename convention
[15:26:41] <SiegeLord> You do get a weird warning when you link two crates with the same name, strangely
[15:26:57] <bollu> thanks. so I can't tidy up the names can I?
[15:27:12] <bsteinb> the docs say that vec's method slice_from(start) fails if start is out of bounds.
[15:27:31] <bsteinb> alas, v.slice_from(v.len()) works and returns an empty slice.

[17:10:25] <mk12> I get the impression that it's better to pass small structs by value rather than by immutable reference (why can't the compiler choose for me?), but when I'm implementing Add, Sub, Mul, and friends I am forced to use &.

[17:18:40] <mk12> Ms2ger: So it is really about moving vs. borrowing, and not about copying vs passing a pointer?
[17:19:02] <Ms2ger> Yes
[17:19:56] <kimundi> mk12: They imply different ownership semantics - as Ms2ger said, if Foo is a moving type, passing by value will transfer ownership, while passing by immutable reference will not. While semantically this also implies shallow copy vs pointer, if you compile with optimization's either one can get optimized either way.
[17:19:59] <sp3d> in theory
[17:20:36] <sp3d> in practice even at --opt-level=3 & vs. by-value does influence whether a copy is made

[18:13:48] <cmr> you're allocating a string for to_str, then tossing it away and doing another allocation for the concatentation.
[18:13:57] <bollu> oh, makes sense.
[18:13:58] <bollu> thanks
[18:14:03] <cmr> whereas format! will allocate one string, write the base into it, then format the int into it.

[19:28:03] <bjz> eddyb: ohh
[19:28:12] <bjz> eddyb: but still
[19:28:19] <kimundi> rgomes: making the field private
[19:28:27] <cmr> rgomes: or add any private field.
[19:28:34] <cmr> `priv nocons: ()` for example
[19:28:42] <cmr> () is zero-sized so there is no affect on representation.
[19:28:42] <cremes> i wanted to play around with the 'vec' benchmarks in src/libstd/vec.rs but I can't get it to compile. Is this because I am running rust 0.9 and it's no longer compatible with github master?  https://gist.github.com/chuckremes/9176029
[19:28:46] <bjz> eddyb: it seems ugly. 6.. would be a nice thing to have
[19:28:52] <cmr> cremes: correct.

[19:29:23] <cremes> wow, this thing moves fast. I'll compile my own rustc then.
[19:29:43] <rgomes> I've made the struct and all fields priv but it's still not working as I expect. I will send a gist about this....
[19:29:46] <jmmk> yeah 6.._ was what came to mind naturally
[19:30:03] <cmr> rgomes: keep in mind that privacy doesn't apply to the current module or child modules.
[19:30:14] <cmr> rgomes: current + child modules can still see your privates.
[19:30:15] <Eridius> rgomes: what code is trying to initialize it? If it's in the same crate, it may still have visibility into your private fields (depending on the location of the code compared to the struct definition)

[20:36:25] <rgomes> this is an example of agreggation, which resembles data inheritance. By the way, collections::btree depends on TotalEq.

That's why I suggested yesterday that you guys had a look at FastUtil. eddyb: ok, ok,... java again...

[23:02:33] <rgomes> I think I will satisfy myself with what is provided and that's it.
