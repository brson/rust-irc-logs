[00:15:29] <Ilari> Also, you happen to know protocols (disregarding "export" ones) that only include part of nonce in each packet and have the rest derived in a way that passive attacker can recover?
[00:17:42] <bascule> not offhand
[00:17:55] <bascule> the TACACS+ "keystream" is made by a sort of MD5 hash stream construction
[00:18:37] <bascule> so if you know of or can guess any of the plaintext "blocks" that are encrypted with that keystream, you can xor that block with the "ciphertext" and recover the rest of the keystream

[00:25:28] <bascule> the hell is AES-X?
[00:25:35] <bascule> is that like 1048-bit XAES?
[00:25:56] <Ilari> AES-X is to AES what DES-X is to (single) DES. :-)
[00:26:27] <bascule> I didn't realize DES-X was a thing either
[00:26:42] <Dcoder> whitened DES, Rivest invention from the 80s
[00:27:19] <Dcoder> it's basically DES plus an Even-Mansour layer (before Even-Mansour was a thing)
[00:27:32] <bascule> umm, fun!
[00:28:03] <Ilari> Another cipher one has to be pretty crazy to use: 3AES.
[00:28:17] <Dcoder> ugh

[07:03:28] <Ilari> Seemingly CurveCP transmits equivalent to full nonces in the clear. Noise doesn't.
[07:06:39] <Ilari> Also, in AES-GCM, there is no symmetry between nonces and keys (whereas there is in Chacha20-Poly1305).
[07:16:48] <Ilari> Also, reminds me of AES and "tau statistic" remarks in some leaked slide... To me that could mean one of three things: a) The cryptographers there are utterly retarded. b) The "tau statistic" has nothing to do with publically-known "tau statistic". c) It is similar, but much more advanced.
[07:20:57] <Ilari> Also, are there any papers attempting to attack PRFs based on HMAC-MD5 (just to pick some bad hash function)?
[07:50:06] <Ilari> Also, AES-GCM in SSH hasly hidden nonces (incrementing per packet).

[22:03:36] <Ilari> Well, PHB doesn't seem to be as consistent: First proposes using Edwards and then says that unless there is 2x difference (there isn't), one should use the simplest-to-get-right form (which is folded Montgomery X for ECDH). 
[22:03:55] <bascule> lolololol indeed Ilari 
[22:04:08] <bascule> it seems the way to arrive at a good opinion is to do the opposite of what PHB says
[22:04:08] <Ilari> I think good luck even getting 10% difference.
[22:04:39] <bascule> that poll was so funny too

[22:05:49] <Ilari> Also, Brown pointing out that one can mount invalid-point attacks against compressed points.
[22:06:20] <Ilari> And what saves Curve25519 from those is the fact that it uses montgomery-x.
[22:06:26] <bascule> yup
[22:06:27] <bascule> lol
[22:06:40] <bascule> it's like PHB and Dan Brown unintentionally argue against themselves

[22:27:40] <Ilari> Allegedly TLS 1.0 got effectively decertificed for PCI.
[22:28:30] <Ilari> *decertified
[22:32:45] <bascule> haha, I heard that was coming...
[22:32:52] <bascule> do you have a link?

[22:34:11] <Ilari> I guess somebody should poke TLS Chacha20 authors now that CFRG got its stuff out.
[22:38:28] <bascule> heh
[22:39:24] <adu> hi all
[22:39:53] <adu> ok, so I've been reading about ChaCha20, and I think I'm in love
[22:41:43] <bascule> ChaCha is nice
[22:42:43] <Ilari> The CFRG Chacha20 calculates tags a bit differently than unofficial TLS Chacha20.
[22:43:45] <adu> also, I built an inverse sha1
[22:46:50] <Ilari> Hah, I computed CVSS for hypothetical attack against one daemon I discontinued using a while ago, assuming no anti-THS countermessures and some hypothetical TLS changes... 9.7. Wow.
[22:47:12] <Ilari> The scale tops out at 10.0.
[22:47:15] <adu> it requirees the last block of the message work schedule...
[22:48:49] <Ilari> (In reality, it does have anti-THS countermeasures).
[22:51:31] <Ilari> And yes, I was quite annoyed when I implemented those.
[22:52:44] <tiffany> am I reading this right? RC4 is the only cipher you can use to qualify for PCI compliance?
[22:53:10] <Ilari> Might have changed / changing soon.
[22:53:31] <tiffany> and when it changes, there will be no ciphers that qualify, leaving TLS 1.0 out in the cold?
[22:53:43] <Ilari> Yes.
[22:53:59] <Ilari> TLS 1.1 fixes the CBC problem.
[22:54:06] <tiffany> the CBC problem?
[22:54:19] <tiffany> I'm guessing TLS 1.0 has a very restricted set of cipher suites?

[23:01:44] <Ilari> tiffany: Also, funnily enough, GnuTLS has some nonstandard ciphersuites that are usable for TLS 1.0 that don't have any known actual issues.
[23:02:00] <bascule> or rather, the Vaudenay attacks in general
[23:02:37] <cmr> My understanding of most compliance issues was that you are free to use "better practices". Is PCI different here?

[23:11:38] <eternaleye> Almost certainly
[23:11:48] <eternaleye> Paypal's been RC4 for a while IIRC
[23:12:01] <eternaleye> I think XKCD is still RC4, too
[23:12:15] <eternaleye> Since last time I tried to disable it in Firefox, that was one of the broken sites
[23:16:04] <Ilari> eternaleye: According to SSL labs, it is not (grade C due to POODLE).
[23:17:29] <Ilari> WTF: "Yes, TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV supported" (about xkcd.com). Wonder if it is one of those FALLBACK SCSV-intolerant sites.
[23:18:26] <Ilari> If not, it means it has some very recent TLS stack, and such things should support much better crypto than what they have.
[23:22:35] <eternaleye> Ilari: Running apt-get upgrade is a lot easier than editing config
[23:23:26] <eternaleye> Ilari: And since I suspect it last had its config edited when there was basically nothing safe, and ciphersuite lists are awful and should DIAF...
[23:24:16] <Ilari> I think cipher config should be limited to profiling (if one needs that for some reason) or emergency disablement.
[23:24:55] <Ilari> And the insecure crap is permadisabled (e.g. like it is in GnuTLS).
[23:25:30] <Ilari> You can try configuring GnuTLS to enable single-DES. It accepts and silently ignores the request.
[23:25:34] <eternaleye> Insecure crap should be deimplemented.
[23:26:07] <eternaleye> And enabling something nonexistent should log-but-succeed
[23:27:06] <Ilari> (The reason why the request is ignored can be seen by requesting GnuTLS cipher list... There is single-DES, but no known TLS ciphersuite uses it.)
[23:30:26] <Ilari> There are actually some default-disabled ciphers in GnuTLS that can actually be enabled (Salsa12 and Salsa20).
[23:30:37] <eternaleye> Sure
[23:30:51] <eternaleye> Those aren't insecure (and thus up for disablement)
[23:31:11] <eternaleye> There are cases for default-disabled; insecure just isn't one of them IMO
[23:32:51] <eternaleye> insecure -> deimplement, not yet standardized -> default-disable, requires additional config (SRP, etc) -> default-disable, new enough it's seen as needing more testing -> default-disable
[23:47:05] <Ilari> Chrome offers nonstandard Chacha ciphers by default... At high or very high priority.
[23:47:58] <Ilari> I think depending on hardware only second to AES-GCM or second to none.
[23:48:26] <Dcoder> aes is prioritized where aes-ni exists i think
[23:49:26] <Ilari> Yeah, I think if AES-NI exists, then it is AES-GCM followed by Chacha (followed by everything else), and if aes-ni doesn't exist, then it is the other way around at the top.
