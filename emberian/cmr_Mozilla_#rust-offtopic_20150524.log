[00:00:54] <niconii> eddyb: if you want a reasonable amount of type safety, yeah
[00:01:46] <niconii> eddyb: i could probably make result more generic by making ok and err void* or something but
[00:03:12] <niconii> eddyb: that's pretty much throwing type safety out the window for the most part
[00:04:22] <Diggsey> yay, I apparantly have an error that noone has ever encountered before :/
[00:04:35] <niconii> eddyb: i could probably add more enums to specify what types it holds to try and mitigate that, but then it gets pretty complex
[00:10:53] <eddyb> niconii: I was talking about having to pass in two variable names to TRY
[00:11:53] <niconii> eddyb: ahh, right
[00:12:25] <niconii> eddyb: actually, i could make try expand to a ternary operator, which would allow `int x = TRY(&result);`
[00:12:35] <eddyb> niconii: return is a statement
[00:12:46] <niconii> eddyb: but as written, if statements are not expressions, so they don't return anything, unlike rust
[00:13:29] <niconii> eddyb: hmm, right, then no, it has to be done that way

[00:20:42] <niconii> rather, windows 8 didn't sell very well, so microsoft needs all the cash they can get
[00:20:45] <eddyb> look before you leap
[00:20:57] <bstrie> niconii: windows 10 is being offered for free, I thought
[00:21:19] <Tobba> bstrie: didn't help that it took 8 years until MS released something to upgrade to
[00:21:19] <niconii> ...wait, is it?
[00:21:48] <niconii> guess it is, for the first year
[00:21:55] <niconii> then i dunno what's up with that
[00:22:19] <bstrie> "Windows 10 Home and Pro will be available for free to Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 users that have appropriate licenses"
[00:22:29] <niconii> like... at all
[00:22:34] <niconii> what does microsoft gain from that
[00:23:29] <niconii> because somehow i have my doubts that they're doing it out of the goodness of their hearts...
[00:23:35] <bstrie> niconii: likely they're hoping to leverage unification between the desktop and mobile space to make a dent in android

[00:24:09] <bstrie> windows 10 is allegedly the last windows version
[00:24:16] <bstrie> evergreen from now on
[00:24:34] <eddyb> they need that control otherwise windows will start crumbling
[00:24:42] <eddyb> Steam for Linux was the prophet
[00:24:43] <niconii> ahh, i see
[00:24:54] <Tobba> eddyb: well considering steam for linux still doesn't fucking work...
[00:25:05] <Tobba> (which is mostly valves fault, because well, valve)
[00:25:11] <eddyb> Tobba: prophets aren't exactly known to be reliable
[00:25:16] <eddyb> valve isn't either :P
[00:25:28] <bstrie> Tobba: valve's only reason for having steam for linux at all is as a hedge against microsoft banning third-party platforms as per apple
[00:25:42] <bstrie> note how steamOS fizzled when winRT did
[00:25:55] <niconii> steam for linux is really bad, ubuntu is probably the only distro it works halfway reliably on
[00:26:13] <niconii> at least i *assume* so, that's what it's built for
[00:26:18] <Tobba> niconii: note how it seems to include two(2) stripped down copies of ubuntu
[00:26:20] <niconii> so if it doesn't even work on that...
[00:26:40] <niconii> Tobba: yeah
[00:26:43] <eddyb> Tobba: pretty sure that's just NixOS making it work
[00:26:44] <Tobba> my .steam folder is 1GB and contains SCSI drivers
[00:26:59] <niconii> Tobba: steam was actually broken on this computer for a few months
[00:27:03] <eddyb> could be wrong though
[00:27:10] <Tobba> eddyb: NixOS doesn't do anything with .steam, I think
[00:27:19] <Tobba> it seems very non-nix-like to do it like that
[00:27:39] <niconii> eventually i had to fix it by going in and deleting steam's copies of libc and libc++ just to get it to run
[00:27:55] <Tobba> they bundled fucking libc?
[00:27:57] <Tobba> seriously?
[00:27:58] <eddyb> well, when I tried it, the stream chroot commands let me create a dir and use it
[00:28:36] <bstrie> anyway, the point is, unless you make games you can't make a world-leading business by selling software anymore. you need to sell services or you need to sell hardware, and to do both those it really really really helps to have your own platform that you can control
[00:28:56] <niconii> Tobba: ah, no, i think i'm remembering wrong
[00:29:16] <niconii> Tobba: libstdc++ and something related to gcc
[00:30:07] <niconii> libgcc_s
[00:30:47] <eddyb> you know what?

[00:33:22] <eddyb> Tobba: definitely a Nix thing
[00:33:26] <niconii> Tobba: nah, same here on arch
[00:33:53] <eddyb> Tobba: it needs a mutable chroot, but all the data is in /nix/store
[00:34:19] <eddyb> Tobba: that said... Valve might be offering the chroot solution themselves
[00:34:33] <eddyb> which would explain the 6 wierd commands I had to use to control it
[00:35:00] <eddyb> (it's like enable, mount, enter. exit, unmount, disable. but different names)
[00:35:31] <eddyb> (and don't ask me why there's more than a single command for all of this)
[00:35:36] <niconii> steam on linux sorta exists independently of package managers, though
[00:35:58] <niconii> it downloads and updates itself on its own
[00:36:33] <c74d> “use these 6 weird commands to control …” … sorry, I couldn't help but see that <_<

[01:06:26] <eddyb> pffft, it's less typed than C allows
[01:14:58] <bstrie> the steam hardware survey is actually kind of depressing
[01:17:08] <bstrie> mode ram: 8gb
[01:17:27] <bstrie> mode cpu speed: 2.3 to 2.69 ghz
[01:17:33] <bstrie> mode cpu count: 2
[01:18:06] <bstrie> mode display resolution: 1920 x 1080
[01:18:32] <bstrie> I feel like these numbers can't have changed for the past four years
[01:18:35] <Tiffany> half as much memory and you have my system bstrie
[01:18:41] <Tiffany> also yes
[01:18:51] <Tiffany> moore's law is basically dead at this point
[01:19:45] <Tiffany> clock speeds capped out 15 years ago, higher res monitors have gotten a bit cheaper, and they're higher colour quality than they used to be, but 2 megapixels is not exactly revolutionary
[01:20:14] <Tobba> bstrie: at least things are moving in the display area again, but 2 cores in 2015?
[01:20:15] <Tiffany> I'd say that for the past few years at least we've been steady at 8 GB for a typical system
[01:20:22] <Tiffany> tobba: laptops
[01:20:32] <Tiffany> i3 and low end i5s
[01:20:47] <Tiffany> desktop i5s are almost all quad core, laptop i5s are mostly but not entirely dual
[01:20:54] <bstrie> Tobba: 4 cpus has *almost* overtaken it, give it a year maybe
[01:21:03] <Tobba> I've noticed hardware hasn't moved that much, but has gotten cheaper
[01:21:08] <Tiffany> I think i3 is exclusively dual
[01:21:08] <Tobba> RAM is fucking cheap now for example
[01:21:16] <Tiffany> oh, I suppose
[01:21:35] <Tiffany> in case anyone's about to call me out on moore's law being about transistors I actually gathered a bunch of data on this
[01:22:06] <Tiffany> current CPUs are about 1.4 billion transistors, doubling every 24 months since the pentium would be 7 billion, doubling every 18 months would be 42 billion
[01:22:16] <Tiffany> I checked GPUs too and it's just all over the board
[01:22:36] <Tiffany> there was a period of about 5 years low-end nvidia gpus never got more transistors, they only shrunk in die size
[01:23:02] <Tobba> RAM is something like $6/GB now
[01:23:38] <Tobba> SSDs have also been following moores law pretty well I think
[01:23:44] <Tiffany> oh
[01:23:45] <Tiffany> probably
[01:24:09] <Tiffany> I guess overall, intel has more or less managed to keep moore's law going in terms of feature size
[01:24:13] <Tiffany> like, transistor density, not count
[01:24:25] <Tobba> I guess CPUs are hitting the ceiling though, I'm hoping we'll see something new soon
[01:24:30] <bstrie> 24% of all steam users have >1tb of total hard drive space
[01:24:33] <Tiffany> they got delayed a bit with the recent die shrink though, and it's unlikely they will get past 6 nm
[01:24:36] <Tiffany> at least with silicon
[01:24:41] <Tiffany> well
[01:24:45] <Tiffany> silicon isn't the problem
[01:24:48] <Tiffany> MOSFETs are
[01:25:43] <FreeFull> Possibilities: changing the substrates, or the architecture
[01:26:09] <Tobba> with the mill coming I'd say both
[01:26:13] <Tiffany> indium III oxide and graphene are both possibilities
[01:26:22] <Tiffany> both will be more expensive to deal with than silicon
[01:26:23] <FreeFull> I think the Mill will still be using silicon
[01:26:26] <Tiffany> yeah, it will
[01:26:40] <Tobba> yeah, but it could offer a good speedup
[01:26:45] <FreeFull> Another possibility would be doped diamond, but that's tough to produce
[01:26:57] <Tobba> so you'd have innovation going in both areas
[01:27:12] <Tobba> is germanium still on the table?
[01:27:18] <FreeFull> A diamond CPU would be able to run a lot hotter than silicon though
[01:27:20] <Tiffany> silicon makes up a sizable portion of the earth's crust, whereas indium III oxide is a rare-earth metal and graphene is more or less impossible to make in sheets more than a couple micrometers across
[01:27:26] <FreeFull> So you could up the voltage and frequency
[01:27:53] <FreeFull> Although you still have to worry about signal propagation time anyway
[01:28:04] <Tiffany> I guess you could see diamond CPUs in IBM mainframes
[01:28:18] <Tiffany> where cost, heat, and energy use are not objects of concern
[01:28:23] <Tiffany> only shear single-threaded performance
[01:28:28] <c74d> bstrie: why mode, and not median?
[01:28:31] <Tobba> if we find better ways of producing artifical diamonds it could be feasible
[01:28:36] <FreeFull> There have been improvements in making graphene
[01:28:42] <Tobba> I don't think it's possible to get them pure or big enough right now
[01:29:01] <FreeFull> I have no idea how hard it is to dope a diamond
[01:29:10] <FreeFull> Silicon presumably isn't too difficult to dope
[01:29:13] <Tiffany> in mobile computing it would be preferable to lower voltage though, not raise it
[01:29:17] <Tiffany> and frequency is pretty nasty too
[01:30:06] <FreeFull> Mobile is where multicore is really winning out

[02:01:06] <Tobba> so it's more like 1/2 a reference

[03:29:29] <Diggsey> ofc :P
[03:29:40] <Diggsey> unfortunately there's no Rust AMP yet so I can't :p
[03:30:12] <Mutabah> Diggsey: AMP?
[03:30:32] <Diggsey> C++ Accelerated Massive Parallelism
[03:30:41] <Diggsey> it can run C++ lambdas on the GPU
[03:31:49] <Diggsey> it's pretty amazing, except that the QoI sucks
[03:33:42] <Mutabah> Wow
[03:34:43] <c74d> Is there a wiki page for “library concepts someone should implement in Rust”?
[03:34:53] <c74d> …oh, there's no wiki, right.
[03:35:12] <Astrum|Lap> Diggsey: yeah, rust is still pretty immature, lots of stuff that needs to be written still
[03:35:16] <Astrum|Lap> so... get to coding =P
[03:35:29] <Diggsey> I have to use recursive variadic template definitions to unroll loops at compile-time, because some loops seem to confuse it, among other hacks
[03:36:11] <Astrum|Lap> well technically it's not recursive... heh
[03:36:57] <Diggsey> it's def. recursive :P

[03:51:04] <Astrum|Lap> not going to look too closely, but usually when people discuss handling variadic templates they're wrong about it being recursive since you're not calling the same function but generating a lot of very similar ones

[04:02:42] <Diggsey> recursiveness isn't limited to runtime - a template that instantiates itself is still a form of recursion

[17:51:46] <c74d> Tobba: if you're ever in a position to (and I hear NixOS has good support for it), I highly recommend ZFS over ext — it doesn't mind unclean shutdowns, according to one of the main developers of the Linux port (who says he never bothers with clean shutdowns anymore because of that).

[18:14:31] <Tiffany> how many?

[18:14:49] <Tiffany> firefox saves them in a huge-ass json file
[18:14:52] <eddyb> over a hundred times
[18:15:07] <Tiffany> so sometimes you can crash the browser in the period between removing the old version and moving the new version into place
[18:15:09] <eddyb> my old laptop used to hang
[18:15:12] <Tiffany> which is probably a couple milliseconds
[18:15:24] <eddyb> so I had to force shutdown it

[18:48:54] <eddyb> I was hoping I could get away without unsafe :(
[18:49:14] <eddyb> (and I can, if I make everything slices. but perfectionism)

[18:51:37] <eddyb> and the wikipedia page is boring
[18:52:12] <Tobba> generics with values should really be a higher priority
[18:52:59] <Tiffany> salsa20 is a symmetric stream cipher developed by Daniel J Bernstein, eddyb
[18:53:07] <eddyb> I gathered
[18:53:15] <Tiffany> it has a variant called chacha20 which you should use instead, because it has better key diffusion
[18:53:24] <eddyb> well, NaCl has Salsa20
[18:53:29] <Tiffany> I think it has both
[18:53:38] <eddyb> okay, maybe NaCl
[18:53:45] <eddyb> tweetnacl only has Salsa20
[18:54:07] <Tiffany> http://doc.libsodium.org/advanced/chacha20.html
[18:54:21] <Tiffany> I really love chacha20
[18:54:22] <eddyb> libsodium is newer and more featureful than NaCl
[18:54:31] <Tiffany> it is, as far as I know, the fastest stream cipher in existence
[18:54:48] <eddyb> and I'm guessing there's EC stuff in here. though I'm impressed by the lack of dynamic allocation
[18:54:49] <Tiffany> software chacha20 on haswell is more than twice as fast as hardware(!) AES
[18:55:10] <Tiffany> 1.43 cycles per byte vs 3.5 cycles per byte
[18:55:36] <Tiffany> it's going to get even more ridiculous on skylake, with AVX-512F
[18:55:41] <eddyb> lol
[18:55:52] <eddyb> such a waste implementing AES in hardware
[18:56:12] <Tiffany> it's around 25 cycles per byte in software
[18:56:34] <Tiffany> google uses chacha20 on chrome for android in TLS  connections
[18:56:57] <Tiffany> for some reason they still prefer AES when it's available in hardware though

[22:24:54] <eddyb> so, uhm...
[22:25:06] <eddyb> can you use NaCl for TLS somehow?
[22:25:18] <cmr> not really.
[22:25:23] <eddyb> I may have asked this in the past
[22:25:37] <eddyb> cmr: all the cert management is missing... and the protocol, of course. anything else?

[22:26:12] <eddyb> is there even a minimal TLS library?
[22:26:24] <Zoxc> Tiffany: I wrote a program which injected into Path of Exile to steal the decryption key and that works just as another packet provoider which Message Analyzer can capture packets from
[22:26:33] <eddyb> or are they all trying to support a million features?

[22:31:00] <Tobba> I have an ECC library
[22:31:04] <Tobba> it's pretty cool but slow as shit
[22:31:23] <cmr> eddyb: I urge you to join #rust-crypto
[22:31:33] <eddyb> now I feel silly for trying to port tweet-nacl
[22:31:51] <eddyb> and very little of this experience can be put into an automated tool

[22:55:29] <Tiffany> you'd need another library for PKI though...
[22:55:35] <Tiffany> and you'd of course need to implement TLS itself

[23:36:02] <bluss> rc has basically made itself unsound https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/rc-is-unsafe-mostly-on-32-bit-targets-due-to-overflow/2120
[23:36:14] <bluss> just funny and annoying
[23:43:53] <Tiffany> argh
[23:44:00] <Tiffany> how do you dereference a struct(foo)?
[23:44:27] <cmr> In Rust? Without the Deref trait?
[23:44:31] <Tiffany> src/chacha20.rs:34:14: 34:20 error: single-field tuple-structs can no longer be dereferenced [E0068]
[23:44:45] <Tiffany> this doesn't tell me what I should be doing instead?
[23:44:51] <cmr> I'd recommend just doing foo.0
[23:44:56] <Tiffany> okay
[23:45:13] <Tiffany> I didn't know you could index tuples now
[23:49:38] <Astrum|Lap> you're using rust again, Tiffany?
[23:49:42] <Tiffany> yeah
[23:50:00] <Tiffany> I was doing the matasano challenge in it
[23:50:06] <Tiffany> I don't know if I want to continue now that I've finished challenge 6
[23:50:21] <Tiffany> I feel like the majority of my time on it has been spend trying to figure out how to detect god damn english text
[23:50:29] <Astrum|Lap> I'm trying to find the motivation to get back into rust
[23:50:33] <Tiffany> and I still haven't gotten it to the point where the correct solution even shows at the top
[23:50:34] <Astrum|Lap> so far it hasn't been forthcoming
[23:51:00] <Tiffany> right now I'm trying to figure out how I would write uint32_t &operator[](int x, int y) in rust
[23:51:08] <Tiffany> or, well, maybe not operator[]
[23:51:12] <Tiffany> but returning an lvalue
[23:51:15] <Tiffany> for sure
[23:51:23] <Tiffany> can you return lvalues in rust?
[23:51:26] <Tiffany> &mut doesn't really count
[23:52:11] <Tiffany> I guess I can use a macro
[23:52:21] <niconii> afaik, no

[23:52:33] <niconii> and if you could, it wouldn't be terribly idiomatic, i don't think

[23:58:12] <niconii> well, macros, yes
