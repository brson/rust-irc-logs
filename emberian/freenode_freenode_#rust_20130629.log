[20:30:44] <callen> all I've found is an exe so far.
[20:31:09] <Jeaye> For Windows? No.
[20:31:19] <Jeaye> Rust is moving far too quickly right now.
[20:31:27] <callen> no, for Mac.
[20:31:36] <callen> I was saying I found an exe. That's not desirable.
[20:31:45] <Jeaye> And there's not much binary compatibility between objects currently.
[20:31:52] <callen> Jeaye: my irritation is that last time I compiled rust it ate up like 1.5gb
[20:32:05] <Jeaye> There are no pre-compiled binaries for much right now.
[20:32:24] <Jeaye> The only one I know of is for Arch Linux, using thestinger's repo.
[20:32:52] <Jeaye> callen: Yeah, it can be a pain to build. I generally just update once a week and I do it when I'm not at the computer.
[20:34:12] <callen> Jeaye: have the docs been updated recently? I ran into a lot of trouble with that last time.
[20:34:56] <Jeaye> The docs used to follow master when we had an incoming branch. Now that we only have master, the docs are pretty up to date.
[20:36:26] <Jeaye> Also, I'll note (as the /topic did) that there's an official channel on irc.mozilla.org if you're interested.
[20:39:21] <callen> Jeaye: nah, I didn't have a great experience there. I like you better.
[20:40:12] <Jeaye> :)
[20:40:56] <bjz> why didn't you like us? :(
[20:41:14] <bjz> it depends on the time of day
[20:45:14] <callen> bjz: the reaction I got was mostly, "yeah lol docs aren't right, why don't you fix them". Which you know, totally make sense given I didn't know the language and the only way to learn it with like 5 incorrect intersecting versions of the docs would've meant having to learn Rust starting from the source code and then write all new docs for it. Not mere fix-up work.
[20:45:30] <callen> I don't know how to write or hack on compilers, it wasn't in the cards.
[20:47:10] <callen> bjz: it was a pretty big turn-off though.
[20:47:15] <bjz> What docs are you having difficulty with? The tutorial is reasonably good (although the wording lags behind, the code is up to date)
[20:47:25] <callen> we're harkening back to the last time I fiddled with Rust
[20:47:30] <callen> I'm compiling anew right now.
[20:47:36] <callen> I'll let you know if I run into problems.
[20:47:59] <bjz> The lib docs are probably the main issue at the moment
[20:48:15] <bjz> they're difficult to navigate too
[20:48:31] <bjz> there is work happening in that direction too
[20:50:51] <bjz> callen: sorry to hear you had a bad experience :(

[23:40:37] <bstrie> callen: we don't fuck around with shootout benchmarks, apparently
[23:41:17] <bstrie> if your computer isn't swapped to hell, it's not INTENSE ENOUGH
[23:44:06] <callen> bstrie: yeah but that was seriously disconcerting and actually required some serious cleanup
[23:44:11] <callen> bstrie: deeply unnerving.
[23:44:58] <bstrie> callen: were you running the benchmarks we provided?
[23:45:04] <bstrie> which one messed up your system?
[23:45:38] <bstrie> this is making me recall the rust 0.1 release, where we erased the $PATH variable of everyone on windows
[23:46:27] <callen> bstrie: benchmarks you provided.
[23:46:34] <bstrie> which one?
[23:46:39] <callen> bstrie: it dumped 15gb of swap onto my SSD and ran me out of free space
[23:46:42] <callen> bstrie: binary trees
[23:46:45] <callen> it was horrendous.
[23:46:54] <bstrie> I'll file a bug
[23:47:05] <callen> bstrie: danke schon, but should I be worried?
[23:47:17] <callen> bstrie: I'm coming back to Rust after getting burnt last time. This is not a good initial sign.
[23:47:39] <bstrie> callen: pre-pre-pre-alpha, expect to get burnt. though actually damaging your system is certainly unreasonable
[23:47:53] <callen> bstrie: sigh. :(
[23:47:59] <bstrie> I've never heard of anyone having this problem, but then again I'm not sure who actually runs the shootout benchmarks
[23:48:21] <bstrie> but yeah, this is why I run rust on my hdd :P
[23:48:27] <callen> bstrie: okay, I want a statically compiled proglang that isn't Go, Haskell, C/C++, or OCaml with a reasonable concurrency story.
[23:48:31] <callen> bstrie: ideas?
[23:48:36] <bstrie> callen: D?
[23:48:42] <callen> bstrie: /me cringes
[23:48:44] <bstrie> haha
[23:48:48] <bstrie> cyclone?
[23:48:50] <bstrie> nimrod?
[23:49:02] <bjz> :P
[23:49:07] <bstrie> I'm just throwing out names here, I've never used any of them
[23:49:07] <callen> bstrie: cyclone is too crunchy. is nimrod stable'ish?
[23:49:12] <callen> oh.
[23:49:13] <bjz> Haskell?
[23:49:21] <bjz> Idris?
[23:49:23] <callen> bjz: I ruled out Haskell.
[23:49:31] <callen> bjz: Haskell turned everything I wanted to do into a fucking puzzle.
[23:49:37] <bjz> ATS?
[23:49:42] <bstrie> callen: ADA!
[23:49:44] <callen> ick, come on.
[23:49:45] <bstrie> actually
[23:49:47] <bstrie> might have bad concurrency
[23:49:50] <bstrie> not sure
[23:49:53] <bjz> :P
[23:49:58] <bjz> Rust!
[23:50:01] <callen> I do not like negotiating with the Sphinx of Giza for my life when trying to write a program. So no Haskell.
[23:50:02] <bstrie> bjz: no, rust sucks
[23:50:07] <bjz> indeed
[23:50:14] <bjz> I hate rust with a passion
[23:50:19] <bjz> bloody rust
[23:50:21] <bjz> x)
[23:50:25] <bstrie> rust and I have a tumultuous relationship
[23:50:37] <bjz> callen: Forth, Factor?
[23:50:39] <bjz> :P
[23:50:50] <bstrie> chicken scheme!
[23:50:57] <bstrie> it's scheme that compiles to C!
[23:50:57] <bjz> well, Factor aint statically compiled
[23:50:59] <callen> bstrie: chicken scheme is presently in the running.
[23:51:09] <callen> bjz: I really need to be able to ship a binary and dust off my hands.
[23:51:21] <callen> bjz: the origin for this is that I have a favorite language for scripting, and one for persistent backend services
[23:51:36] <callen> I need kinda of a middle-territory where I have a somewhat more serious lang than my scripting lang, but I need a lightweight deployment story.
[23:51:44] <callen> for stuff that constitutes "large scripts" or "very small services"
[23:51:47] <bstrie> callen: in any case, if you need to *ship* anything, then stay far away from rust until we get to 1.0
[23:51:47] <bjz> well maybe chicken scheme is what you want (no idea your domain though)
[23:51:56] <bjz> yup
[23:52:04] <bjz> Rust aint shippable yet
[23:52:10] <callen> bjz: dev-ops'y unix friendly services in binary form.
[23:52:21] <callen> Sadly Go kinda fits that story, but Go is like Turbo Pascal all over again.
[23:52:28] <callen> I thought I'd escaped Turbo Pascal. Alas.
[23:52:42] <callen> OCaml creator/maintainer refuses to acknowledge concurrency is a thing.
[23:52:48] <bjz> :)
[23:52:58] <bstrie> maybe there's another ML that works?
[23:52:59] <callen> Haskell is the fucking puzzlemaster language
[23:53:00] <bstrie> is ML compiled?
[23:53:04] <callen> yes it is
[23:53:12] <bjz> callen: what do you mean?
[23:53:17] <callen> but the concurrent ML I'm aware of is super-obscure.
[23:53:17] <dom96> callen: You should definitely try Nimrod. It is a little more than stable-ish ;)
[23:53:27] <callen> bjz: amps up the difficulty of any given problem I'm working on by 10x
[23:53:27] <bjz> callen: C++11?
[23:53:31] <callen> bjz: any problem of any size.
[23:53:36] <dcolish> how about Clay?
[23:53:39] <callen> bjz: you serious? @ C++11?
[23:53:47] <callen> dcolish: for large'ish scripts and small network services?
[23:53:58] <bjz> callen: probs not
[23:54:17] <callen> dom96: I'm really liking nimrod's GC
[23:54:21] <callen> dom96: I *hate* tracing GC>
[23:54:23] <callen> *hate hate hate*
[23:54:25] <dcolish> Clay is designed for systems programming, its statically compiled, has the same memory layout as C for structs
[23:54:30] <dcolish> no gc
[23:54:33] <callen> dcolish: I don't need anything that low-level.
[23:54:38] <callen> Nimrod is our winner atm.
[23:54:46] <callen> soft real-time GC ftw.
[23:54:51] <dcolish> it does offer a bunch of abstractions without some of the complexity of nimrod
[23:54:53] <dom96> yep :D
[23:54:57] <dcolish> i never got nimrod really
[23:55:06] <bjz> callen: http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?QuestForThePerfectLanguage
[23:55:22] <bjz> callen: http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?HolyGrail
[23:55:25] <callen> dcolish: I need to be able to write things that just work without having to be hyper-fucking paranoid about memory semantics, stack, etc.
[23:55:29] <callen> bjz: it's not a holy grail!
[23:55:33] <callen> bjz: it already exists in Go.
[23:55:37] <callen> bjz: and sort of in Haskell
[23:55:47] <callen> bjz: it's just that they're deeply problematic languages for me personally.
[23:56:01] <bjz> callen: well you rejected all our suggestions :)
[23:56:05] <dom96> dcolish: What complexities are you referring to?
[23:56:12] <callen> bjz: no, I installed nimrod.
[23:56:21] <callen> to be fair to Ada which was mentioned earlier, Ada has aged a lot better than C and Java have.
[23:56:32] <bstrie> callen: sounds like you need to write your own perfect language. now if only you had a language to write it in...
[23:56:53] <callen> bstrie: I already said nimrod sounds like it fits the bill.
[23:58:42] <dom96> callen: What kinds of things do you want to develop?
[23:59:10] <dcolish> dom96: i never found the syntax to be inviting and when i looked at it the libraries did not have APIs that were easy to use. also forward decl was never a lang feature i liked
[23:59:33] <dcolish> its very possible the libraries have had a lot of work done, i havent checked in on the project in 2 years
