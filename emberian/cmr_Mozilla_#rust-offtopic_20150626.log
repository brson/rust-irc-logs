[05:08:06] <WindowsBunny> eddyb: I'm implementing a BITFIELD macro :D
[05:08:20] <GBGamer117> WindowsBunny: yay!
[05:08:21] <WindowsBunny> It even preserves silly semantics like int foo:1; where foo can only be -1 or 0
[05:08:31] <GBGamer117> that is silly
[05:08:33] <GBGamer117> yay!
[05:08:47] <WindowsBunny> Well, that's the semantics msvc uses anyway
[05:08:55] <WindowsBunny> and that's the only platform that matters!
[05:09:05] <GBGamer117> yay! platform-dependency!
[05:09:08] <WindowsBunny> It's so nice working on winapi because I can assume that Microsoft's ABI is the only ABI
[05:09:25] <WindowsBunny> and mingw for the most part respects Microsoft's ABI for C
[05:10:22] <GBGamer117> how would you check that a one-bit bitfield is either 0 or -1
[05:10:26] <GBGamer117> instead of 0 or 1?
[05:12:55] <eddyb> WindowsBunny: those semantics are not silly
[05:13:04] <eddyb> that's what i1 is
[05:13:09] <eddyb> (signed one-bit integer)
[05:13:18] <eddyb> WindowsBunny: I had that type in my "decompiler" framework
[05:13:32] <eddyb> and if you sign-extend an i1 in LLVM you will get -1 from true
[05:14:10] <GBGamer117> the same thing happens in gcc, if you were wondering
[05:14:25] <eddyb> it is the only meaningful semantic I can think of :P
[05:15:01] <eddyb> it kinda sucks in C though, because you have a type and the type matters but it kinda doesn't at the same time
[05:15:01] <GBGamer117> eddyb: well, it could be a one's complement
[05:15:47] <eddyb> you'd probably want bitfields to only have a signed/unsigned qualifier and that's it
[05:15:55] <GBGamer117> then you could have either 0, or -0
[05:16:00] <GBGamer117> that would be interesting
[05:16:04] <niconii> GBGamer117: well, *theoretically* yes; practically speaking though, two's complement is pretty much universal
[05:16:05] <eddyb> (aside from the bits)
[05:16:14] <GBGamer117> niconii: not on classical machines
[05:16:21] <GBGamer117> yes, current machines
[05:16:25] <eddyb> "classical"?
[05:16:26] <niconii> well yes
[05:16:36] <niconii> i meant in today's world, though
[05:16:37] <eddyb> I've heard about BCD, what the heck used 1's complement?
[05:16:50] <GBGamer117> eddyb: just ~ the bits
[05:16:56] <GBGamer117> then you have the negative value
[05:17:04] <eddyb> I know what it is
[05:17:08] <eddyb> I don't know what used it
[05:17:21] <GBGamer117> I'm seeing if I can find one
[05:17:26] <Mutabah> eddyb: Well, iirc the IPv4 checksum is based on it
[05:17:38] <eddyb> Mutabah: sounds like a bit of a stretch
[05:17:54] <WindowsBunny> "ones' complement is used by the PDP-1, CDC 160A and UNIVAC 1100, all of which date back to the 60s as well."

[05:46:32] <zwarich> eddyb: I am playing around with some bad PL ideas you might like
[05:46:48] <zwarich> statically checked doubly linked lists and binary search trees
[05:46:49] <eddyb> what are you insinuating :P?
[05:46:55] <zwarich> aww yeah
[05:47:02] <eddyb> oh, that stuff
[05:50:20] <zwarich> I guess I also have some ideas to improve a Cyclone / Rust style Region system
[05:51:44] <aatch> zwarich, go on...
[05:52:51] <zwarich> aatch: most of them I had back when I worked on Rust
[05:53:35] <zwarich> aatch: Cyclone and Rust have very similar region systems, but use them differently wrt mutability
[05:54:26] <zwarich> Rust prohibits mutation of pointers, even entirely within a single region, because you could change the tag of an enum type and thus invalidate a borrowed pointer
[05:55:07] <zwarich> from what I understand, Cyclone prohibited borrowing the interior of a tagged union, so you still got intra-region mutation
[05:55:39] <zwarich> this would be really helpful for manipulation of general directed graphs
[05:56:09] <zwarich> since you can basically prove that there is no good solution for memory management of general graphs besides garbage collection / tossing it out in the garbage all at once
[05:56:12] <eddyb> I wish I understood what you meant :P
[05:56:22] <aatch> zwarich, when you say "mutation of pointers", I assume you mean "mutation through pointers"?
[05:57:29] <zwarich> aatch: I guess what I was thinking of is if you have a Node type that has a parent field that is a Node pointer, you should be able to modify that field as long as everything is still in the same region
[05:57:45] <zwarich> even though there may be aliasing involved
[05:57:47] <eddyb> you can do that already
[05:57:52] <eddyb> with Cell
[05:58:19] <aatch> zwarich, yeah, that makes sense. It's just that "mutation of pointers" sounds more like making a pointer, well, point somewhere else.
[05:58:51] <eddyb> zwarich: it sounds like you're talking about an arena-backed graph
[05:58:51] <zwarich> I also forget what happened in Rust 1.0 with arenas
[05:59:10] <eddyb> which is the go-to implementation strategy
[05:59:16] <eddyb> zwarich: they are live and well
[05:59:56] <zwarich> ah it's still unstable, and it has that wacky destructor behavior
[06:00:05] <zwarich> if you're doing this, you should probably just not have destructors
[06:00:06] <eddyb> what, Arena?
[06:00:38] <eddyb> zwarich: I kinda want to just make everything in rustc::middle::ty Copy
[06:00:49] <eddyb> allocate slices instead of vectors
[06:00:58] <eddyb> zwarich: just have one big PodArena or something like that
[06:01:14] <zwarich> eddyb: a lot of JITs will even allocate growable vectors from arenas :P
[06:01:34] <zwarich> I'm not sure that would be so hot for Rust's memory use at compile time
[06:01:41] <eddyb> I have spent enough nights reading v8 commit logs
[06:01:57] <zwarich> V8 has some nice code in it in places
[06:02:06] <eddyb> so I do know that the fresh allocation space is just an arena
[06:02:12] <zwarich> could probably use more C++11
[06:02:13] <eddyb> I forget what they call it
[06:02:20] <zwarich> eddyb: Zone?
[06:02:29] <eddyb> well, yeah, but the space itself
[06:02:35] <eddyb> GC terminology
[06:02:46] <zwarich> but yeah, that's a common implementation pattern in JITs, since your memory use is so transient
[06:03:20] <eddyb> not just JIT's own stuff, but all GC allocations
[06:03:36] <zwarich> nursery?
[06:03:44] <eddyb> that's it, thanks :D
[06:04:05] <zwarich> it's somewhat grim to name something a nursery when you expect most of the things in it to die
[06:04:27] <aatch> Worst. Nursery. Ever
[06:04:51] <zwarich> another good / terrible idea is to allow pointer types that borrow some of the fields of a struct but not others
[06:04:59] <zwarich> so disjoint methods could borrow different sets
[06:05:19] <eddyb> there's a different approach to solving some of the problems that would solve
[06:05:31] <eddyb> but first off, I'm not sure what you mean about Rust's memory use
[06:05:53] <eddyb> the allocations I was speaking of are persistent, via the type interner and the backing arena
[06:06:17] <eddyb> they're just on the heap, which means evicting the arena has to run "free" a gazillion times
[06:06:20] <zwarich> eddyb: I mean if you had vectors that grew whose allocations you just put into arena, you would have a bad time if you didn't recycle the old unused vector backing memory after things grew
[06:07:03] <eddyb> it also means you can't get away with a heterogeneous arena that doesn't care about the data you allocated (because it's Copy or w/e)
[06:07:07] <eddyb> zwarich: hell no
[06:07:19] <eddyb> I mean allocating the whole slice up-front in an arena
[06:07:19] <XMPPwocky> exciting new garbage collection strategy: just swap things out when you're out of memory, if they page-fault soon bring them back in, otherwise remove them from the swapfile too
[06:07:32] <XMPPwocky> for many access patterns it'll work great!
[06:07:36] <eddyb> XMPPwocky: already done
[06:07:37] <zwarich> just compress memory
[06:07:38] <eddyb> (see: Java)
[06:07:42] <zwarich> OS X solves this
[06:08:03] <eddyb> wait, Java doesn't remove things from the swapfile
[06:08:08] <eddyb> XMPPwocky: that's nuts
[06:08:17] <eddyb> "lossy memory management"
[06:08:24] <eddyb> XMPPwocky: Erlang would love it though
[06:09:10] <eddyb> zwarich: so... I wrote something somewhere. not sure though
[06:09:16] <XMPPwocky> better yet: in each DRAM row, store a single 1 bit... then disable refresh in your DDR controller.
[06:09:42] <zwarich> XMPPwocky: having to debug issues caused by DRAM refresh being temporarily disabled really sucks
[06:09:45] <XMPPwocky> over time, gate leakage will clear the bit, with no costly page faults
[06:10:03] <XMPPwocky> of course, you'd have to run on bare metal, but...
[06:10:21] <XMPPwocky> "This page works best at -40C"
[06:11:20] <Tobba> zwarich: are there any situations where that happen outside of SMM/startup shenanigans?
[06:11:38] <Tobba> happens*
[06:11:53] <zwarich> Tobba: sleep / wake
[06:11:54] <XMPPwocky> zwarich: pssh, what's a bit flip between frignds
[06:12:50] <eddyb> zwarich: the gist of it is that if you have a mutable borrow you could re-borrow the original value, as long as returning from the function would clear the former borrow
[06:12:51] <Tobba> zwarich: ah right, fun
[06:12:56] <XMPPwocky> but yeah, i actually wonder how much RAM you could manually refresh with modern CPU and DRAM
[06:13:02] <Tobba> I recall there being some systems that do DRAM refresh in SMM, which is uh, yikes
[06:13:23] <XMPPwocky> it should be just a number- memory bandwidth * time before you start losing data
[06:13:24] <Tobba> not necessarily does the whole process, but triggers and controls it
[06:13:31] <Tobba> which means if you disable it, fun times ensue
[06:13:34] <eddyb> zwarich: reborrow as immutable, that is. and the immutable borrow would have to "pretend" to be a sub-loan of the mutable one so that the mutable borrow cannot be used at the same time
[06:13:54] *** Quits: Havvy (Havvy@moz-epv20b.wa.comcast.net) (Connection closed)
[06:13:57] <eddyb> zwarich: the really cool thing about mem::forget being safe is that it means values are always valid
[06:14:07] <zwarich> lol
[06:14:16] <zwarich> I view the safety of mem::forget as a very sad thing
[06:14:20] <eddyb> so immutable borrows are safe if you prevent aliasing
[06:14:21] <zwarich> I love linear types tho :/
[06:14:32] <eddyb> mem::forget would not be callable with a linear type
[06:14:39] <eddyb> we don't have linear types. chill :P
[06:15:02] <zwarich> eddyb: I just mean that the circumstances that prompted mem::forget to be made safe were basically that destructors don't work right
[06:15:18] <zwarich> and that's kinda sad
[06:15:23] <eddyb> oh, you mean leaking linear types via Rc cycles
[06:15:27] <XMPPwocky> using destructors where linear types are needed is always sort of crap
[06:15:42] <zwarich> destructors are frustrating because they work so well most of the time
[06:15:43] <eddyb> presumably Rc would not allow anything linear in it and that's solved
[06:15:46] <zwarich> but are actually fundamentally flawed
[06:15:48] <XMPPwocky> like, mutex locking via scopes just seems like deadlock waiting to happen
[06:16:13] <XMPPwocky> i'm realizing that 
[06:16:14] <eddyb> zwarich: I was scared by mem::forget being safe but I embraced it once I figured it made my borrowck enhancement universal
[06:16:22] *** Quits: rustbot (havvy@moz-epv20b.wa.comcast.net) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[06:16:23] <zwarich> Ada was conspiring against Rust all along for 30 years
[06:16:32] <eddyb> zwarich: if you remember the rule we had that allowed reading from a mutably borrowed primitive
[06:16:32] <zwarich> it introduced destructors into the world to screw us all
[06:16:51] <eddyb> zwarich: we removed that because it didn't work with scoped threads
[06:16:54] <zwarich> actually, maybe one of the PARC systems languages had destructors first?
[06:17:00] <eddyb> turns out the rule was safe
[06:17:12] <eddyb> just not properly defined
[06:17:43] <eddyb> returning from the closure passed to thread::scoped (or the proposed new API which is leak-safe)
[06:17:56] <eddyb> does not clear a mutable borrow
[06:18:23] <eddyb> and that's the important bit
[06:18:26] <XMPPwocky> one day i'll figure out how borrowck works
[06:18:41] <eddyb> with thread::scoped you don't own your data while sub-threads might be running
[06:19:14] <eddyb> which means you can't re-borrow it under my rule
[06:19:25] <eddyb> well, the rule is invalid with thread::scoped, but it works with the proposed API
[06:19:35] <eddyb> anyways
[06:19:41] <eddyb> XMPPwocky: it's not that hard, really
[06:19:47] <eddyb> regionck is a bitch though
[06:20:09] <eddyb> I am looking right now at what I can only believe to be a mishap resulting from mixing HRTB and closures
[06:20:14] <zwarich> eddyb: I saw an issue mentioned on Reddit having to do with borrowing of nested closures?
[06:20:18] <XMPPwocky> i want to see a book entitled "Rust: The Ugly Parts"
[06:20:29] <eddyb> zwarich: heck if I know
[06:20:32] <zwarich> but they claimed it was not in GitHub
[06:20:37] <zwarich> confusing it is
[06:21:00] <eddyb> XMPPwocky: so you've seen errors like "note: first, the lifetime cannot outlive the lifetime 'b as defined on the block at 661:33..." right?
[06:21:02] <zwarich> the most confusing part of the region / borrow checker is how closures work
[06:21:04] <XMPPwocky> like, the nitty-gritty technical details
[06:21:14] <XMPPwocky> eddyb: yes
[06:21:15] <zwarich> it doesn't make any sense at all
[06:21:20] <zwarich> maybe aatch knows :P
[06:21:22] <eddyb> XMPPwocky: what do you think produces those errors?
[06:21:32] <XMPPwocky> poltergeists?
[06:21:39] <zwarich> closures are (were?) just treated like loops
[06:21:44] <eddyb> XMPPwocky: what check phase in the compiler, I mean
[06:21:50] <zwarich> but I have no idea why that's sound
[06:21:55] <eddyb> zwarich: huh
[06:22:02] <aatch> zwarich, depends on what part of the compiler you're looking at.
[06:22:05] <eddyb> zwarich: FnOnce lets you move out
[06:22:05] <XMPPwocky> eddyb: i'm not sure
[06:22:12] <eddyb> XMPPwocky: would you say "borrow checker"?
[06:22:36] <eddyb> well, I gave you the note. it starts with: error: cannot infer an appropriate lifetime for lifetime parameter `'ast` due to conflicting requirements
[06:22:43] <XMPPwocky> i'm not falling into your trap
[06:22:47] <XMPPwocky> :P
[06:22:47] <eddyb> okay
[06:22:50] <eddyb> it's regionck
[06:22:56] <eddyb> worst errors ever
[06:23:04] <eddyb> (nmatsakis admits to that)
[06:23:11] <zwarich> regionck errors are great
[06:23:25] <eddyb> XMPPwocky: but borrowck gets blamed for them
[06:23:28] <Tobba> I like nonsensical typeck errors
[06:23:32] <zwarich> "unexpected region A: expected region A instead"
[06:23:35] <Tobba> especially when "expected" and "got" are swapped
[06:23:40] <eddyb> borrowck actually is very nice
[06:23:46] <eddyb> zwarich: fak u
[06:24:00] <eddyb> you go rewrite the compiler and fight that all day
[06:24:14] <XMPPwocky> my personal favorite typeck error is still "expected Foo; got Foo"
[06:24:14] <eddyb> thankfully I only hit these two so far
[06:24:19] <eddyb> but they've got me blocked
[06:24:21] <XMPPwocky> when you have multiple versions of a crate
[06:24:46] <XMPPwocky> for some reason i keep wanting to type "grape" instead of "crate"
[06:25:00] <eddyb> no crate name in the absolute paths in the error message?
[06:25:07] <XMPPwocky> eddyb: not when it's used
[06:25:13] <Tobba> don't forget "could not infer an appropriate type for _" when you have like 10 types it needs to infer
[06:25:14] <eddyb> :(
[06:25:20] <XMPPwocky> or something like that
[06:25:22] <Tobba> and you have to think really hard which one it's mucking up on
[06:25:25] <zwarich> that's such an annoying problem that plagues type checkers the world around
[06:25:29] <zwarich> ambiguous names
[06:25:30] <XMPPwocky> or, even better, expected glium::Foo; found glium::Foo
[06:25:36] <Tobba> hard about*
[06:25:44] <XMPPwocky> because both crate versions are called glium

[06:27:03] <Tobba> XMPPwocky: oh, that reminds me of a really fun bug
[06:27:08] <Tobba> my project has this line: let init = (); // this is necessary for some reason
[06:27:11] <XMPPwocky> the correct solution is
[06:27:13] <Tobba> it does absolutely nothing

[06:27:17] <Tobba> it's never used
[06:27:30] <XMPPwocky> eddyb: so the issue is ln is an intrinsic method on f32 and f64
[06:27:31] <Tobba> but if you remove it, any call to functions named init break
[06:27:49] <eddyb> XMPPwocky: uh oh
[06:27:54] <eddyb> XMPPwocky: that's a bug :D
[06:28:05] <XMPPwocky> eddyb: but the type of 42.0 is that, uh, uninferred thing where it could be f32 OR f64
[06:28:07] <Moonlightning> Cleaner solution: don't name any functions init()?
[06:28:18] <eddyb> XMPPwocky: but we have fallback IIRC

[06:49:53] <niconii> Manishearth: yeah, steam for linux comes with a *lot* of crazy stuff
[06:50:07] <XMPPwocky> niconii: running it on NixOS involves a chroot 
[06:50:10] <XMPPwocky> loads of fun
[06:50:21] <Manishearth> every time I do locate libfoo.so I get a million steam results and like one result somewhere in lib
[06:50:22] <niconii> XMPPwocky: sheesh
[06:50:54] <eddyb> Tobba: explanation on the issue
[06:51:06] <eddyb> that lint is kinda cool, but...
[06:51:23] <eddyb> it should signal its desire to be side-effect-free
[06:51:44] <Manishearth> Anyone else wants to review my systems programming blog post (https://gist.github.com/Manishearth/16c2dac09bdaafc3d6d1)? The friend who I usually go to for these reviews is missing :p
[06:52:44] <Tobba> eddyb: interesting

[06:53:16] <eddyb> hahahahahahaahah WHAT
[06:53:47] <Tobba> eddyb: this is even funnier considering the prior conversation
[06:53:48] <eddyb> somehow it's inverting the lifetime parameters and that fucks up the Copy impl
[06:53:57] <eddyb> grr
[06:53:58] <XMPPwocky> hwat
[06:54:18] <eddyb> XMPPwocky: Self is a "trait type parameter"
[06:54:31] <eddyb> guess I found a bug in error printing
[06:54:41] <eddyb> XMPPwocky: wait, there's a way to force errors to be verbose
[06:55:06] <eddyb> I worked hard to make sure that stuff kept working
[06:55:13] <eddyb> src/librustc_driver/pretty.rs:155:54: 155:57 note: ...so that trait type parameters matches those specified on the impl (expected `core::marker::Copy<rustc::middle::ty::TyCx<ReFree(DestructionScopeData { node_id: 9397 }, BrNamed(DefId { krate: 0, node: 6876 }, 'a)),'_#62r>>`, found `core::marker::Copy<rustc::middle::ty::TyCx<'_#82r,'_#83r>>`)
[06:55:22] *** Joins: larhat1 (Adium@moz-vlo5br.cable.virginm.net)
[06:55:26] <eddyb> the type parameter is Self
[06:55:49] <eddyb> it can't Copy something because the lifetimes aren't aligned correctly
[06:55:57] <eddyb> the thought of that makes me sick
[06:56:35] <eddyb> hahaha
[06:56:44] <Tobba> eddyb: in your honor I'm going to whip up some spaghetti
[06:56:44] <eddyb> that error was with |tcx, _| panic!()

[06:56:56] <eddyb> if I replace tcx with _, the error goes away
[06:57:18] <eddyb> just binding the argument with the "broken" type makes it go nuts
[06:57:31] <eddyb> and it's only "broken" because of higher-kinded inference
[06:57:38] <eddyb> provably impossible something something
[06:59:13] <eddyb> src/librustc_driver/pretty.rs:149:39: 149:79 note: ...so that types are compatible (expected `core::option::Option<rustc::ast_map::Map<'_#55r>>`, found `core::option::Option<rustc::ast_map::Map<ReFree(DestructionScopeData { node_id: 9324 }, BrNamed(DefId { krate: 0, node: 9289 }, 'tcx))>>`)

[06:59:25] <eddyb> so that's telling me there's a free region named 'tcx
[06:59:37] <eddyb> I'm assuming "free" means "the closure is generic over it"
[06:59:53] <eddyb> which is wrong because that lifetime is actually in scope
[07:02:50] <eddyb> it honestly looks like a compiler bug

[07:10:01] <GBGamer117> Heroes: Reborn
[07:10:39] <eddyb> GBGamer117: don't make me lose all hope q_q
[07:10:50] <aatch> I really liked Heroes, then, well, you know...
[07:10:55] <Mutabah> O.O
[07:11:00] <GBGamer117> :(
[07:11:45] <aatch> It was so good, then they just veered off into crazy town. Completely forgot what made the show good.

[07:15:54] <aatch> I get the impression that the writers of Heroes decided to break every single trope and convention just because they could.
[07:17:15] <Tobba> there's nothing wrong with that if you know what you're doing
[07:17:28] <Tobba> then again it seems they fucked up pretty badly, I haven't watched ity
[07:17:30] <Tobba> it*
[07:19:34] <eddyb> I have a high tolerance for screwups, having watched all of Transformers and Twilight and not really seeing what people hate

[07:20:18] <eddyb> hey now

[07:20:42] <eddyb> I didn't say I liked Twilight
[07:20:47] <eddyb> I was just curious what happens
[07:21:05] <Mutabah> Host was far better
[07:21:25] <eddyb> wasn't Host that SG ripoff?
[07:21:29] <aatch> Tobba, yeah, they were just indiscriminate about it. Rather than setting up a big twist that nobody expected, they decided to just do it to everything.
[07:21:37] <eddyb> aatch: lol
[07:21:54] <eddyb> I love Game of Thrones even after all it did
[07:22:03] <GBGamer117> eddyb: ughhhh
[07:22:09] <GBGamer117> the latest season was so painful
[07:22:14] <eddyb> that could explain why I don't remember anything too bad about Heroes
[07:22:24] <eddyb> GBGamer117: maybe I'm a psychopath
[07:22:33] <GBGamer117> that would explain it
[07:22:41] <Tobba> I think I watched the first... 3-4 seasons of game of thrones?
[07:22:51] <Tobba> it started to get a bit convoluted after the entire cast had died 5 times over
[07:23:03] <aatch> I'm not a fan, but I'm not a fan of the books either, they're just not my thing.
[07:23:25] <eddyb> the dragons do it for me
[07:23:45] <eddyb> that and the coming winter. and maybe the many-faced god
[07:23:50] <Tobba> eddyb: is that still kinda its own separate part
[07:23:58] <Tobba> the dragons, that is
[07:24:17] <Mutabah> eddyb: Dunno, nver actually seen SG... but the Host was more about the position of one of the aliens held "prisoner" by the oppressed humans
[07:24:18] <aatch> I can't really handle a cast with so many characters, I lose track and end up not caring about any of them either way.
[07:24:31] <eddyb> I guess I love GoT for everything that is not merely dark ages
[07:24:54] <eddyb> Mutabah: oh, have you seen Falling Skies?
[07:25:00] <GBGamer117> I love GoT because it's like a TV show version of CKII
[07:25:04] <Mutabah> eddyb: Don't think so
[07:25:14] <GBGamer117> Incest, Murder, and taking over the world!
[07:25:19] <GBGamer117> what else could you want
[07:25:22] <GBGamer117> ?
[07:25:43] <Tobba> it's *really* hard to keep track of GoT though, especially if you don't watch it for some time
[07:25:44] <eddyb> Mutabah: first alien invasion survival horror-ish I actually enjoyed
[07:25:52] <Mutabah> GBGamer117: Characters with a life expectancy of >2 episodes after you start to like them
[07:25:58] <Tobba> the sub-par audio quality mangling peoples names makes everything worse
[07:26:06] <Mutabah> "Oh hey, Stannis is being a good father"
[07:26:06] <eddyb> Tobba: I stopped trying to figure out names
[07:26:10] <GBGamer117> Mutabah: that's just part of the fun!
[07:26:18] <GBGamer117> also, child killing!
[07:26:22] <Tobba> eddyb: same, but since they're going by family names it gets fucking convoluted
[07:26:23] <GBGamer117> yay!
[07:26:26] * GBGamer117 cries
[07:26:45] <aatch> Tobba, yeah, but I tried reading the books where I could flick back to earlier parts and *still* had trouble keeping track.
[07:26:49] <eddyb> oh so since we're talking about GoT
[07:27:05] <eddyb> I couldn't find anything online, but!
[07:27:13] <eddyb> dragon glass and valyrian steel have the same effect
[07:27:21] <eddyb> aren't they both forged in dragon breath?
[07:27:28] <aatch> Tobba, the "using family names" thing isn't really a problem for me though, since it's pretty common in England.
[07:27:33] <eddyb> basically Merlin
[07:27:37] <GBGamer117> eddyb: yeah, I think so
[07:27:38] <Mutabah> eddyb: Or someother infused with fire, yes
[07:27:42] <Tobba> aatch: yeah, but you have to keep track of which family everyone belongs to
[07:27:50] <Tobba> which they only say in a garbled fashion 3 times, and then you have to kinda infer it
[07:27:56] <eddyb> so here's a huge spoiler
[07:28:00] <eddyb> (totally made up)
[07:28:04] <GBGamer117> Tobba: but there are only like 4 important names
[07:28:06] <Tobba> it gets progressively worse as you lose track of things
[07:28:16] <eddyb> dragons vs white walkers
[07:28:21] <GBGamer117> Stark, Lannister, Targaryen, and the southern people
[07:28:25] <eddyb> dragons win unless shot to death
[07:28:43] <GBGamer117> dragons just win
[07:28:49] <eddyb> GBGamer117: hahahahahahahahaahahaha
[07:28:51] <eddyb> hahahahahahaha
[07:28:56] <eddyb> GBGamer117: that is going to hurt
[07:29:08] <GBGamer117> what is going to hurt?
[07:29:10] <aatch> GBGamer117, >.>
[07:29:11] <Tobba> GBGamer117: then theres that guy who got his dick cut off and uh
[07:29:20] <eddyb> dragons are awesome but we got a preview of the damage that can be done to them
[07:29:37] <GBGamer117> Tobba: you haven't even seen season 5 yet
[07:29:42] <eddyb> oops
[07:29:43] <Tobba> I think I stopped at 3 or 4
[07:29:47] <aatch> They did use to hunt dragons, didn't they?
[07:29:51] <eddyb> am I spoiling Tobba?
[07:29:57] <Tobba> I don't think so
[07:29:58] <eddyb> I think I'm spoiling Tobba
[07:30:02] <GBGamer117> Tobba: horrifying shit happens at e6
[07:30:04] <GBGamer117> and e7
[07:30:06] <GBGamer117> and e8
[07:30:07] <eddyb> aatch: yeah, but there's no details on that
[07:30:09] <Tobba> like... everyone dying?
[07:30:09] <GBGamer117> and ...
[07:30:14] <GBGamer117> even worse
[07:30:23] <Tobba> like... everyone getting tortured (again)?
[07:30:31] <GBGamer117> you just gotta watch it
[07:30:38] <GBGamer117> at least up to e6
[07:30:43] <GBGamer117> then you can throw up and stop watching
[07:32:19] <GBGamer117> onto happier topics...
[07:32:30] <GBGamer117> anybody watch the Mr. Robot pilot?
[07:32:46] <aatch> GBGamer117, Mr. Robot?
[07:33:22] <GBGamer117> aatch: yeah, it's a show about infosec
[07:33:37] <Tobba> that sounds like it has a lot of potential to go wrong
[07:33:38] <GBGamer117> dramatized, of course
[07:33:48] <GBGamer117> but the pilot was actually pretty good
[07:34:00] <GBGamer117> and everybody smoked, just like in real life infosec :P
[07:34:14] <Tobba> was everyone a high functioning alcoholic?
[07:34:19] <GBGamer117> yep
[07:34:25] <Tobba> sounds like they got it just right

[07:39:05] <eddyb> why the fuck is this on facebook
[07:39:07] <Tobba> I'd say seasons 2-3 were the best, since that's where it really picked up
[07:40:29] <aatch> Tobba, yeah, I'm a fan of serialized shows like that. With an over-arching plot thread, but a one-or-two episode story to be told in relative isolation.
[07:40:55] <fkaa> some of the things in the show were just ridiculous stuff as well
[07:41:04] <fkaa> come on, estonian mafia in new york?
[07:43:35] <Tobba> heh, I guess you can't handwave that like you can with the other stuff

[08:35:53] <GBGamer117> I wish BSD became the popular UNIX
[08:36:00] <GBGamer117> I hate the GNU GPL
[08:36:26] <GBGamer117> also, why is Drepper such an ass?
[08:37:20] <GBGamer117> hey, question
[08:37:43] <GBGamer117> can I static link a GPL library if I'm writing a BSD thing?
[08:37:52] <GBGamer117> or do I have to use GPL
[08:38:01] <Tobba> pretty sure you need to dynamically link, because GPL
[08:38:24] <Tobba> I'm not exactly sure though, I just avoid GPL'd libraries
[08:38:32] <GBGamer117> yeah, so do i
[08:40:45] <GBGamer117> huh, okay, I think you can
[08:41:11] <niconii> Tobba: holy shit, that guy
[08:41:18] <GBGamer117> "Any software which uses a [(L)GPL] library has to be under the GPL or a GPL-compatible license"
[08:41:40] <Tobba> GBGamer117: ah right, isn't there some clause about being able to swap the library out though?
[08:41:53] <GBGamer117> Tobba: only if it's proprietary
[08:41:58] <Tobba> that might've only been if the code is proprietary?
[08:42:00] <wrl> that's LGPL
[08:42:03] <GBGamer117> (which is why the dynamic linking)
[08:42:13] <wrl> with LGPL you have to be able to swap the LGPL'd library out
[08:42:22] <GBGamer117> Because if you release it MIT/2-clause BSD, then the person can just recompile
[08:42:28] <wrl> GPL the whole thing has to be GPL (aiui)
[08:42:50] <GBGamer117> "If a library is released under the GPL (not the LGPL), does that mean that any software which uses it has to be under the GPL or a GPL-compatible license?"
[08:42:55] <GBGamer117> - Yes
[08:43:04] <GBGamer117> (Gnu faq)
[08:43:13] <GBGamer117> So I think GPL-compatible licenses are okay
[08:43:57] <GBGamer117> like MIT, 2-clause BSD, apache, etc.

[19:07:13] <eddyb_> disney cartoons are better when you can binge watch them on youtube
[19:07:29] <eddyb_> and they're in English and use more than 4 voice actors
[19:07:38] <Astrum|Lap> brandonson: everyone is ridiculous in their own way tbh
[19:08:19] <Astrum|Lap> humans are big bags of bias that are convinced they're right (myself included obv)
[19:08:57] <brandonson> Astrum|Lap: how do you know that's not just your bias speaking? :p
[19:09:08] <eddyb_> brains work on electrical bias
[19:09:13] <eddyb_> or something like that
[19:09:13] <Astrum|Lap> it could be =)
[19:09:26] <Astrum|Lap> then again, psychology says we're all biased

[19:10:28] <Astrum|Lap> I actually don't understand that mentality
[19:10:36] <Astrum|Lap> just look at how we judge politicians
[19:10:41] <Astrum|Lap> we expect them to have strong opinions
[19:10:56] <Astrum|Lap> we hate them when they do something counter to their opinion
[19:11:12] <Astrum|Lap> it's just weird
[19:11:16] <dfockler> or do their strong opinions arise from having to vote yes/no on huge issues?

[19:15:34] <Astrum|Lap> that's why opinions are silly
[19:15:46] <dfockler> but you have to make decisions at some point
[19:16:02] <Astrum|Lap> of course

[19:22:45] <Astrum|Lap> check your implementation, and read that
[19:22:46] <brandonson> of course, that's something like 4 orders of magnitude less than the actual complete distance

[21:23:38] <c74d> I have a website I'd like to get up and working on a memory-constrained VPS in a few days. For now, this website would only be serving static content, though it's intended to later have some kind of wiki-like system for editing pages. What software would this channel recommend I use for this?
[21:31:44] <dfockler> c74d: you could use something small like bottle.py
[21:32:38] <dfockler> and then use a sqlite adapter for your database
[21:33:39] <Tiffany> why do you need something wiki-like, c74d?
[21:34:00] <Tiffany> do you want other people to be able to edit it from a web interface?
[21:34:23] <Tiffany> if you just want to edit the pages yourself, or from the PCs of other people, you could just setup a git repository with a hook that calls jekyll
[21:39:52] <c74d> I'm running the website for a non-technical person who would need such an interface to edit it.
[21:40:07] <c74d> I think I'll just use lighttpd for now, though.
[21:40:36] <c74d> (given that in the short-term I only need static file serving)
[21:42:07] <XMPPwocky> c74d: protip: cat foo.html | nc -lp 80
[21:42:19] <c74d> yeah yeah
[21:43:07] <c74d> ...I hope lighttpd is light-y enough to run in this 0.25 GiB of RAM. :?
[21:43:46] <XMPPwocky> http://xmppwocky.net:9090/
[21:43:50] <c74d> XMPPwocky: it does need to serve *multiple* static files, though :p
[21:43:53] <XMPPwocky> while true; do cat test.txt | nc -l -p 9090; done  
[21:43:54] <XMPPwocky> perfect
[21:44:02] <XMPPwocky> web servers are overrated
[21:44:18] <c74d> I'd count that as a Web server.
[21:44:37] <XMPPwocky> c74d: you have 65000+ ports to play with, you don't have 65000 files, do you
[21:44:44] <XMPPwocky> you can even link between them!
[21:44:48] <c74d> ...except that it doesn't seem to be serving anything at present.
[21:45:42] <XMPPwocky> c74d: hm, while loops don't like pipes or something
[21:45:46] <XMPPwocky> fixed
[21:45:54] <XMPPwocky> while true; do bash -c "cat test.txt | nc -l -p 9090"; done
[21:47:02] <XMPPwocky> i wonder how the performance of this compares to something like nginx. i guess being able to use only one core is a pretty huge handicap, but not parsing *anything* has gotta save some CPU
[21:47:06] <c74d> I don't have 65k files, no, but I do want pages to be identified by name rather than number. :p
[21:47:27] <XMPPwocky> c74d: see /etc/services
[21:47:31] <XMPPwocky> easy!
[21:48:20] <XMPPwocky> hm, browsers don't seem to like "xmppwocky.net:mysql"
[21:48:22] <XMPPwocky> drat
[21:49:40] <bstrie> I see this comment https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/26173#issuecomment-110686387 and it makes me imagine that nmatsakis is a guard from metal gear solid
[21:50:25] <bstrie> pnkfelix is shuffling around in a cardboard box, trying to land PRs without drawing attention
[21:51:22] <c74d> XMPPwocky: the definition of a port identifier that IETF RFC 3986 (the URI standard) uses is merely a sequence of zero or more ABNF DIGITs.
[21:52:31] <XMPPwocky> is it valid HTTP to send *no* headers at all?
[21:52:37] <XMPPwocky> i seem to recall a few of them being MUSTs
[21:54:49] <Tiffany> xmppwocky: for http 1.1 iirc the only required header is Host:
[21:54:56] <Tiffany> for 1.0 I don't think there's any required headers
[21:55:09] <XMPPwocky> hm yeah i see that in rfc2119
[21:55:28] <XMPPwocky> the Date header is mandatory for response codes that aren't 1xx or 5xx
[21:55:52] <XMPPwocky> but if you don't have a "clock capable of providing a reasonable approximation of the current instance in Coordinated Universal Time"
[21:55:56] <XMPPwocky> you MUST NOT send it
[21:56:12] <Tiffany> lol what
[21:56:21] <XMPPwocky> so *technically*, since I have a clock capable of that, it's not valid HTTP
[21:56:25] <XMPPwocky> but who's going to know 
[21:56:30] <Tiffany> exactly
[21:57:04] <XMPPwocky> https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231 7.1.1.2 there
[21:57:29] <XMPPwocky> maybe, idk, the HTTP police are going to bust down my door
[21:57:57] <Tiffany> I'd prefer not sending the time unless you have a good reason to
[21:58:11] <Tiffany> application developers have a tendency of relying on bad behaviours like assuming clocks are close enough together
[21:59:06] <XMPPwocky> time sucks
[21:59:21] <Tiffany> blame relativity?
[21:59:34] <XMPPwocky> for example: my fitness tracker (withings pulse) assumes that the phone's time is always correct when it syncs
[21:59:39] <XMPPwocky> so it updates its own internal clock
[22:00:00] <XMPPwocky> problem: my phone, when it can't get a GSM signal after reboot, sets the time to 1970
[22:00:05] *** Quits: spider-mario (spidermario@moz-coblcf.fbx.proxad.net) (A TLS packet with unexpected length was received.)
[22:00:35] <XMPPwocky> the fitness tracker then gives me all my activity records for that date... AND throws out all the previous ones that it would have synced, because they're out of the 7 days of data it keeps on the device
[22:00:50] <XMPPwocky> so i have something like 1 million steps taken on dec 31, 1970
[22:00:54] <XMPPwocky> er, 1969
[22:01:13] <Tiffany> that is really terrible

[22:03:18] <c74d> the ground in my yard collapsed under my careless tread, sending my sandal-shod foot into dirt and the droppings of presumably long-dead rabbits.
[22:03:22] <c74d> dang gophers.
[22:04:25] <Tiffany> I have never seen a gopher
[22:04:40] <Tiffany> there are gopher turtles though, but they tend to burrow further underground, and don't make networks of tunnels
[22:04:56] <c74d> at least there wasn't a snake squatting in that tunnel.
[22:05:03] <Tiffany> I never considered that there might be things other than snakes and gopher turtles living in them
[22:05:08] <XMPPwocky> c74d: what are you talking about? tunnel snakes rule
[22:06:09] <c74d> XMPPwocky: I expect they also bite when one's foot smashes into their appropriated home.
