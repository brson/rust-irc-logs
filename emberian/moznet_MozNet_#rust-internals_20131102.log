[00:54:32] <pcwalton> acrichto: pong
[00:54:49] <acrichto> pcwalton: so there's not going to be any equivalent of &once fn() in the new closure system?
[00:54:54] <pcwalton> right
[00:54:55] <pcwalton> there won't be
[00:54:57] <acrichto> why not?
[00:55:04] <pcwalton> it was felt that "once fn" is too much complexity
[00:55:17] <pcwalton> and RAII is useful in most cases that "once fn" is
[00:55:27] <acrichto> hm, it seems like it'd be really convenient
[00:55:49] <pcwalton> "once fn" versus RAII is a similar tradeoff to internal versus external iterators
[00:55:54] <pcwalton> very similar actually
[00:56:14] *** Quits: dbaupp (Thunderbir@moz-B3C9E9E8.lns20.syd6.internode.on.net) (Ping timeout)
[00:56:20] <pcwalton> once fn is more convenient for the API writer but less convenient for the user due to rightward drift and inlining/devirt requirements
[00:56:27] <acrichto> so fn foo(&mut self, f(&mut self)) to raii, how does that work?
[00:56:41] <acrichto> or rather passing &mut self around into the closure
[00:56:55] <acrichto> in theory the raii thing needs a reference to the object, menaing that you can't use it again
[00:57:00] <acrichto> (there's already a mutable loan on it)
[00:57:26] <pcwalton> well, you can put the object into the mutable reference that you return and then call subsequent methods on that reference
[00:57:34] <acrichto> urg
[00:57:38] <acrichto> I suppose so yeah
[00:57:42] <pcwalton> let result = thing.foo(); result.object.bar();
[00:57:55] <acrichto> and that much pain is worth not having &proc() ?
[00:58:04] <pcwalton> I think it's more convenient for the user
[00:58:07] <pcwalton> no rightward drift
[00:58:28] <acrichto> I feel like result.object.bar() is so alien that I'd take the rigtward drift
[00:58:59] <pcwalton> shrug
[00:59:04] <pcwalton> I don't really see how it's alien

[00:59:16] <pcwalton> or any more than having to pass a closure
[00:59:27] <acrichto> I'll try working with it for a bit
[01:00:21] <pcwalton> I'm open to &once fn if we need it but I'd like to try going without it… it just feels a little like internal vs external iterators and it was clear what won there...
[01:00:27] <pcwalton> the tradeoffs are pretty much the same
[01:00:41] <acrichto> true, less complexity is better
[01:00:53] <pcwalton> well, also it's not just about rightward drift
[01:01:12] <pcwalton> if you do RAII you can "return"/"break"/"continue"
[01:01:14] <pcwalton> the caller can
[01:01:21] <acrichto> true
[01:01:22] <pcwalton> which if you're inside a closure you can't
[01:01:26] <acrichto> and analysis are a lot easier to write
[01:01:32] <pcwalton> right
[01:01:34] <acrichto> I think I can find a few holes on the once fn analysis
[01:02:27] <acrichto> pcwalton: if we really start pushing raii generic destructors shouldn't require unsafe_destructor
[01:02:35] <pcwalton> yes I agree
[01:02:38] <pcwalton> that's a bug
[01:02:39] <acrichto> what's the reason for that?
[01:02:50] <pcwalton> uh… I thought it was unsound at the time I implemented it.
[01:02:55] <pcwalton> and niko pointed out it wasn't
[01:02:59] <acrichto> hahah
[01:03:05] <pcwalton> I think it's when destructors required Send or something, I forget
[01:03:55] <strcat> acrichto: generic dtors also need to work ;p
[01:04:00] <strcat> you can't use bounds atm
[01:04:48] <pcwalton> for some reason I thought that bounds required virtual destructors
[01:04:48] <pcwalton> but I guess not
[01:04:56] <pcwalton> maybe there are interactions with ~Trait and friends
[01:06:06] <strcat> pcwalton: hm, I don't think you should need anything special for trait objects
[01:06:16] <pcwalton> I guess not
[01:06:19] <strcat> the dtor is always monomorphized and called as a function pointer shoved in the trait
[01:08:02] <strcat> oh right make install is broken now
[01:08:04] <strcat> need to fix that
[01:14:11] <acrichto> why did we forbid self as a variable name?
[01:15:04] <strcat> so, 1c4a348b072a1b6191ac349aefffcc1c5fe84de7 is broken
[01:15:29] <brson> acrichto: it's a keyword and we're pretty strict about not letting them be used as identifiers
[01:17:20] <strcat> brson: do you know why that man dir stuff was changed?
[01:17:30] <acrichto> brson: ok so I've been thinking about the libuv api, and if we want to keep it nice it looks like the general problem of "invoke some code with an environment, but not on my stack" needs to be solved

[01:17:58] <strcat> http://ix.io/8Qv this is what happens now, it tries to install to / instead of the package directory
[01:18:16] <strcat> I don't really understand what the change does other than breaking this ;\
[01:18:40] <acrichto> brson: I think I've come up with a solution for this which uses stack pointers, and to boot I think that it's even sound. The problem, though is that to actually use it everything needs to be in cells
[01:18:43] <Luqman> strcat: what do you set as --prefix ?
[01:18:56] <acrichto> brson: hm nvmd, I'll just keep thinking about this
[01:19:03] <strcat> Luqman: /usr, prefix isn't DESTDIR
[01:19:21] <strcat> DESTDIR is supposed to set the root install directory
[01:20:01] <pcmattman> if DESTDIR doesn't work, package maintainer's lives suddenly become significantly more painful
[01:20:06] <brson> strcat: to support the --mandir flag that is supported by typical gnu configure scripts

[01:27:01] <acrichto> I don't think cells are sound as-is https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/10231 :(
[01:27:08] <strcat> it seems the other ones use PREFIX_XXX and those do $(DESTDIR)/$(PREFIX) at the start
[01:27:12] <strcat> which is right
[01:27:27] <brson> strcat: do you know what gnu configure scripts do if you override --mandir but also use DESTDIR?
[01:28:23] <strcat> brson: well, I know that the usual way to build stuff is './configure --prefix=/usr && make && make install DESTDIR="$pkgdir"', so I think mandir would probably work that way too
[01:28:40] <brson> what is the difference between prefix and DESTDIR?

[01:28:57] <strcat> brson: prefix is whether you want /, /usr or /usr/local for the lib, bin, etc. dirs
[01:29:12] <strcat> DESTDIR is the root you want to install to, packages use a package directory
[01:29:20] <strcat> then the package manager turns it into a package with metadata
[01:30:45] <brson> i don't understand what distinction you are making between "/, /usr, ..." and "where you want to install to"
[01:30:56] <brson> /usr/local is where i want to install
[01:31:59] <strcat> brson: http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en/books/porters-handbook/porting-prefix.html is a good explanation
[01:32:43] <strcat> DESTDIR lets you set a top-level root, at the very end when you install
[01:32:44] <cmr> brson: DESTDIR is the root of everything.
[01:32:49] <cmr> Instead of /
[01:33:09] <brson> I guess it just has to completely override --mandir then
[01:33:20] <strcat> brson: well it should go in front of mandir
[01:33:24] <cmr> ...no? the end result is $DESTDIR/$mandir
[01:33:44] <brson> so --mandir must be a relative path?

[01:34:36] <Luqman> strcat: wrong how so?
[01:34:44] <strcat> Luqman: rust hardcodes some paths based on PREFIX
[01:34:52] <strcat> when you use DESTDIR, it shouldn't incorporate that
[01:35:24] <dbaupp> cmr: do you remember how you had a problem when writing rustdoc_ng of it complaining about not finding std?
[01:35:33] <dbaupp> cmr: ... do you remember how to fix that?
[01:35:36] <strcat> DESTDIR points install at a root to install to
[01:35:43] <strcat> but it should still treat it *as if* it is actually /
[01:35:53] <cmr> dbaupp: move rustdoc_ng next to rustc
[01:35:56] <Luqman> strcat: yea, really it shouldn't be checking for DESTDIR in Makefile.in and only in mk/install.mk

[01:37:14] <strcat> pcmattman: $(FOO) will evaluate to an empty string if it's unset
[01:37:31] <strcat> brson: yeah, the proper way is for only the install target to use DESTDIR
[01:37:35] <strcat> so it was broken before too
[01:37:44] <strcat> (just not in an easy visible way)
[01:37:51] <strcat> it should be doing
[01:38:13] <strcat> install rustc $(DESTDIR)$(PREFIX)/bin/rustc
[01:38:15] <strcat> and so on
[01:39:13] <Luqman> strcat: hmmm though, looking closely the destdir stuff only applies for $(findstring install,$(MAKECMDGOALS))
[01:39:28] <strcat> MAKECMDGOALS? waaat
[01:39:50] * strcat stops understanding build systems when they get beyond a single makefile with a dependency tree
[01:41:16] <brson> using DESTDIR subtly breaks the way we encode rpaths, though probably not in a way that matters
[01:41:50] <strcat> brson: well, DESTDIR is a temporary root, when it's used the dir it installs to will be a real /
[01:42:00] <Luqman> brson: afaik DESTDIR is just to specify a temporary thing for when you want to package it up
[01:42:09] <strcat> (either because it's used as a package, and installed to root, or because you're installing to a chroot)
[01:42:24] <brson> Changing all the install rules to prefix $(DESTDIR) is probably the right way to go though
[01:43:05] <tautologico> how can I pass a -Z option to the compilation of rustc itself, like -Z lint-llvm or -Z trans-stats ?
[01:43:38] <Luqman> hmm, how do --mandir,--libdir and friends work? does whatever i pass to those get prepended with whatever i pass as --prefix?
[01:43:40] <brson> tautologico: RUSTFLAGS="-Z trans-stats" will pass it to all invocations of rustc
[01:43:48] <tautologico> brson: thanks
[01:43:56] <brson> Luqman: in our configure file it just overrides prefix
[01:44:23] <brson> and we're not even using --libdir, and if we did it would break rust badly
[01:51:55] <brson> this looks pretty easy to fix
[01:52:36] <brson> strcat: does 'make uninstall DESTDIR' need to work?
[01:52:41] <strcat> brson: no
[01:53:05] <strcat> at least, I don't care about make uninstall and have never thought about whether it understands DESTDIR ;p
[01:53:16] <strcat> I think 99% of the people using DESTDIR will be using a package manager so they don't need it

[04:52:48] <sfackler> do you know why a private module would be showing up in rustdoc with a blank page? the privacy pass appears to strip empty modules
[04:54:03] <acrichto> I think that the html render pass strips a few more extra things
[04:54:17] <acrichto> so it may get pass the privacy pass
[04:54:30] <acrichto> do you have an example?
[04:55:32] <sfackler> the only thing I've tried is removing the doc_hidden from https://github.com/sfackler/rust-postgres/blob/master/message.rs

[06:16:28] <sfackler> acrichto: It looks like the issue is that trait impls of pub types in a private module are still treated as reachable
[06:16:36] <sfackler> even though the types aren't
[06:18:07] <acrichto> sfackler: hm I would believe it
[06:18:21] <acrichto> sounds like a "if mod.items.len() == 0 { return }" is due somewhere
[06:19:02] <sfackler> that's already there
[06:19:20] <sfackler> but trait impls are never stripped from items
[06:19:39] <acrichto> that should happen at the rendering phase
[06:19:55] <acrichto> it's all stripped before rendering, right?
[06:20:31] <sfackler> yeah, because the trait impls would end up under the struct they're implemented for, but that struct was already stripped
[06:20:45] <sfackler> but a doc page for the module is still generated
[06:21:13] <acrichto> there's a little bit of stripping that happens at render times
